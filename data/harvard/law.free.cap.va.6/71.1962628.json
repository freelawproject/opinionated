The clause in our Act of Assembly, (R. Code of 1819, c. 128, \u00a7 83, p. 509,) which prescribes the sum for which judgment is to be rendered on a bond, meant that, incases of penalties by way of security, the final justice of the case should be attained in the Courts of law, in effectuating which object, those Courts are to be governed by tile same considerations which influence the Courts of Equity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">THIS was an action of debt brought by the appellant, as assignee of <em>Daniel B. White, </em>against the appellee, in the County Court of Spotsylvania. It was brought upon a bond bearing date the 17lli March 1806, in the penalty of 388L 19s. <em>6d. </em>conditioned for the payment of <em>1941. 9s. 9d., </em>on or before the 25th of <em>December </em>1808, \u00ab <em>with inter\u00abestfrom the date if not punctually paid.\u201d </em>The defendant, after <em>oyer </em>of the bond, pleaded \u00abpayment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">On the trial of the cause, the defendant produced a witness to prove that, at the time of executing the bond, it was <em>agreed, </em>that bo should have a <em>credit </em>till 25th Dec. 1808, and that that credit was a constituent part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>contract by which the debt in question was created. The Court excluded this evidence from the Jury, and the defondant excepted. The Jury returned a special verdict, in which, after finding the execution of the bond; the assignment of it to the appellant before the day of payment; several payments, amounting to <em>46l. 13s. 0d. on and before the 9,5th of December </em>1808; and sundry payments thereafter; they submit the question to the Court, whether the appellant is entitled to recover interest upon the sum mentioned in the condition of the bond, from the day of the date thereof, or not. In the former event, they find for the appellant the debt in the declaration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of 36i. 2s. <em>7d.; </em>in the latter, by the payment of 9,110s. Id., with interest, in either case, from the 20th of Oct. 1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-4\">Upon this verdict, the County Court held the affirmative opinion, and gave judgment for the larger sum found <em>by </em>the Jury. They gave judgment for the intei\u2019est from the \u2022date of the bond, calculated upon the <em>whole </em>sum mentioned in the condition, altho\u2019 46l. 13s. 0<em>d. </em>of it had been paid <em>\u25a0on and before </em>the day on which it became due and payable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-5\">On an appeal, the Superior Court of law for the County reversed the judgment, and rendered judgment for the smaller sum; from which judgment an appeal was taken to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AsAF\"><em>Wirt </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmF\">Interest from the date was recoverable as a matter of special contract, perfectly understood by the parties, not as a <em>formal </em>part of the instrument, but one to be executed. Such bonds are in conformity with the constant practice and custom of the country, which, in such cases has been considered as decisive of the law.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Even the set-offs in this Record, are calculated in the same way. Being the contract of the parties, it must be carried into effect, unless it be against some rule of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">A bond of this description is not <em>usurious; 1. </em>because it is evidence of a <em>debt existing at its date, </em>from which time interest, therefore, w\u2019ould have run if nothing further had been said:\u2014-a future day for payment, is indeed given, but upon the express condition of paying interest from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the date, if the principal be not punctually paid; which interest is only at the legal rate:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASKI\">~. Because the back interest is required upon a contingency, by which the obligor might have discharged himself altogether; <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and interest depending on such contingency, even though above the legal rate, must be paid :<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3d\">S. Because, to constitute Usury, there must be proof of borrowing and lending.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsP\">,But if Usury existed in the contract, and rvcn were apparent on the face of the bond, the objection cannot be taken without being p1eaded.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7c\">Neither is the back interest to be considered, as a penalt~j, and therefore not recoverable. It is not a penalty in reason, or in the understanding of the parties. The pemalt~j is generally understood in this Country as intended, only to en!hrce compliance with the condition.The condition is always regarded as containing the contract itself. This bond has a penal part, independently of the condition. `What motive could the parties have to insert another J)enalty~ It was clearly not intended an such, lmt in the light of a liquidated satisfaction in damages. It is easy to imagine countless cases, where the interest from the day appointed, is no satisfaction for th. injury sustained by default of payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuJ\">I have iiot ftnind any case decided in a court of law oii the point relating to back interest; but there are cases analogous in principle.-Ex. gr. a contract was sustained, by which the purchase money for a tract of land was to be paid by instalments; and in the event of failure to pay any one instalment, the whole was demandable immediately.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> Was not that a more highly penal aggreinent than this? In Gowlett v. Hansforth 2. Bl. Rep. 958, the principal and interest were both made payable at an earlier pe~riod, in consequence of the failure to pay the instalments punctually.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZz\">The case of Shode v. Parker, 2 Vern. 316, is the first and last I have been able to find, in which a distinction is taken between a ~oi~tract f4m redue~ng the interest up~. ~n compliance. witI~ th~ times o~ payment, and one where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the interest is to be increased if not paid at the day.The quwre annexed by Vernon is a complete answer to the case; for there is no difference in reason, or the nature of things between the two contracts. The motive to pay, and the advantage from paying, is the same in both cases. In fact, it is a distinction without a difference, and dis~ countenanced by ~t1ier decisions.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqYj\">Stanard contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAIN\">Upon the true understanding of what is meant by a penalty, must depend the correct decisioit uf this case. A Penalty is the forfeiture of something not esthnated by the amount of advantage gained on one side, or of loss sustained on the other. Courts of law have, under the Statute, the same power to relieve against penalties that Courts of Equity liave.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeP\">In this case is the reservation of back-interest to be regarded as a liquidated compensation in damages, or as a Penalty? If any part (however small) of the principal be not paid on the day appointed, interest on the whole Sum is demandable from the date, according to the terms of this bond! Is this any measure of compensation? Does it not answer exactly to the description of a penalty? Is there any difference between a contract to pay interest from the date in case of default, and a contract to pay a certain additional sum in the same event? It is still the agi~e~memt of the parties. The usual penalty itself, is an agreement of the parties:-~-yet the Court of law mitigates its rigour~</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAI\">Phe n~aiu force of Mr. Wirt's argument is a supposed tustom oFth~ Country. I deny the existeiice of any such customs having always understood it a question concern~ lug which the best informed members of the profession have differed. But if there be ~uch a custom, it ought to be shewu to the court, as the particular custom was in Floyer v. Edwards. In that case, the custom was mat~ ter of exidence that there was no corrupt purpose of eva~1irig th~ Statute. Even in that case, the court, though 1t decided the contract not, to be usurious, yet said the surplus was not recoverable in assunipsit for rnoneif Itad sand received, whitch is an equitable action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABl\">If such claims can be supported in Courts of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>where is the guard to protect parties from the effect of agreements to pay penalties? If A owes B IDOL and B tells him that, if he will pay him 501. to morrow, he will relinquish the debt; he is not bound to do so, if the 50\u00cd. be not paid. But there is a distinction between a case where the creditor is willing to relinquish part of the debt in consideration of punctual payment, and one where the debtor agrees to pay <em>more </em>than the debt, if he fail to be punctual. This is the distinction recognized in Courts of Equity. If there was no penal par\u00ed, in the usual form, in the bond, and it simply was, \u201c1 A. B. bind myself to pay 501. twelve months after date; and, if I do not punctually pay that sum, I will pay interest upon it from this date;\u201d'-such interest would clearly be considered a penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAn\">In <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Slatten, 5 Bro. Parl. Cases, </em>233, the sum allowed had every appearance of liquidated damages.-. Not so here; for the interest may bo demanded during many months, on the whole amount, for a default of one moment, and as to one cent!</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al_\">If a debtor was to contract, <em>expressly, </em>to pay <em>all </em>dam\u00ae ages the creditor should sustain by his failure to pay the money on the day; the creditor could nevertheless recover no more than the Lawful interest. Yet Mr <em>Wirt </em>contends for a sum to be added, by <em>implication, </em>as a liquida\u00ae tion of such damages!</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoK\">In <em>Halifax </em>v. <em>Higgens, </em>1 <em>Vern. </em>134, the one per cent additional interest w as a compensation for failing to pay the <em>interest </em>regularly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A53\">The thstniction I have mentioned, is fully supported by the authoritics.<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> And no case can be found where re~ trospective interest ~ 1)ermitted to be added to the stun stipulated by the condition. To do this would he to al- low a forfeiture. In Gowlett v. Hansforth, 2 Bl. Rep. 958, it was not a forfeiture, and the Court went expi~essly up-Oil that groUn(1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnJ\">it appears on the face of this special Verdict, that the Jury have mis-calcelated the set-offs. ~I1hey have sebmitted one question only; whether the whole back interest is to 1e recovered, even though part was pui~ctuaJJy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>paid. At all events, such interest ought not to he charged on so much as was paid on or before the day appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-8\"><em>Wirt </em>in reply. My impression is, that if a payment in part be made on the day, the creditor is entitled to the back interest on the sum remaining due only. I have understood the custom of the country to be so; and such appears to be the <em>equitable </em>standard. If in this I am mistaken, and the practice has been to enforce the contract strictly, I insist upon it as my client\u2019s legal right upon the authority of <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Lawrence 4 Esp. Rep. 147, </em>before cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-9\">As to the custom of the Country, it was said in <em>Long </em>v. <em>Colston 1 H. &amp; M. </em>115, that a <em>general </em>custom was not to be proved. In <em>Floyer </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>the custom was <em>spedal, </em>and therefore proof was required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-10\">The distinction taken in Courts of Equity, relied upon by Mr. <em>Stanard, </em>is a distinction without a difference.*\u2014 The stipulation in both cases is that, although the interest would otherwise run from the date of the- bond, the plaintiff will give it up, if the principal be punctually paid. If a bond be given, conditioned to pay at a future day, with interest from the date, and an endorsement be made, that, in the event of payment of the principal on that day* the interest shall be remitted; such bond and endorsement would amount to the condition of this bond exactly, And, according to the case of <em>Shermer </em>v <em>Beale, </em>1 Wash. 11, 14; such endorsement is to be considered as incorporated with the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-11\">The distinction therefore, being <em>unreasonable, </em>ought not, (as Judge Roane said in <em>Baring </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>1 <em>H &amp; M, </em>162,) to be considered as of <em>binding </em>authority. But, even according to the British decisions,\u2014in <em>Halifax </em>v. <em>Higgens, </em>the interest was to be <em>raised </em>in case of failure in punctuality; yet the Court allowed the higher rate, not as the legal standard of interest; but on the ground that .such was the contract of the parties. In <em>Nicholls </em>versus <em>Maynard, </em>Lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>(by way of an <em>obiter dictum, </em>for it was not necessary to the decision in that cause,) does indeed recognize the distinction. In <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>not only the time of commencement of the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>was drawn back, but also that of payment of the principal sums; yet the contract was enforced, though more highly penal than this. In <em>Gowlett </em>v. Hansforth, there was a forfeiture, <em>in Mr. Stanard\u2019s sense; </em>but the court decided, that it should be enforced as the <em>contract </em>of the parties. Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>though notorious for a disposition to break down the barriers between the Courts of Law and Equity, no where asserts that he would enforce in a Court of law this distinction adopted in the Courts of Equity. It is a distinction completely overthrown by the cases I have cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-3\">This case was re-argued by the same counsel, March, 28th 1817, but, from a due regard to brevity, the second argument is not inserted.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> <em>Floyer v.

The penalty of the bond is conditioned to be discharged by the payment of 1942. 9s. <em>9d. </em>on or before the 25th of Dec. 1808, with interest from the date, \u201cif not punctually paid.\u201d It is evident that the agreement of the parties is completed, before the insertion of these last words \u201c with interest,\u201d &amp;c., at least so far as it respects the <em>time </em>of payment, and the <em>sum </em>to be then paid. The sum to be then paid is shewn to be 194Z. 9s. <em>9d. </em>only, in exclusion of the back interest, by this consideration, that the payment of that sum on or before the 25th of Dec. 1808, would have discharged the penalty of the bond. These last words were only inserted to enforce, more effectually, the payment of the principal; to <em>add </em>to the penalty, by which the payment thereof was already secured. <em>That </em>is no part of the sum agreed to be paid <em>on </em>a given day, which only becomes payable <em>after </em>that day, and in the event that payment is not punctually made <em>on </em>the day. It is only a penalty.</p>\n<author id=\"b97-6\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AkJF\">understands it to be a clear principle, that the clause in our Act, (1 Rev. Code of 1794, p. 111,) which prescribes the sum for which judgment is to be rendered on a bond, meant that, in eases of penalties by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>security, the final justice of the case should he attained in the Courts of law, for which, before, parties had been driven into the Courts of Equity. The Court is also of opinion, that, in effectuating this object, those Courts are to be governed by the same considerations which influence the Courts of Equity. If any authority is wanting to support this clear position, it may be found in the case of <em>Bonafous </em>v. <em>Rybot, </em>3 <em>Burr, 1373, </em>in relation to the English statute of 4 and 5 <em>Anne, </em>ch. 16, which is substantially similar to our Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The principle of Equity upon this subject, is, that, where the condition is for the payment of a sum of money at a certain time, if it is not paid, the Court will allow interest upon it, from the day <em>when it should have been paid, </em>and considers the forfeiture as a penalty which is a subject matter of relief, (2 <em>Fonb. </em>388.) Equity does not give more than the sum agreed to be paid, with interest thereupon from the <em>time </em>when it ought to have been paid. This is the just measure of repairing the breach of the agreement: all beyond it is relieved against, as being, in effect, a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Under .the influence of this principle, while it was held, in the case of <em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>521, that, where a mortgage was made reserving 5 per cent, interest, with an agreement to abate one per cent, in case of punctual payment being made, if payment at the time is not made, the five per cent, is payable, (for it was <em>reserved, </em>and the condition of abatement has not been complied with;)\u2014it was also decided that, if four per cent, only had been reserved, with a proviso or condition that, in case of non-% payment by a certain time, the interest should be <em>increased </em>to five per cent., such proviso would not b ave been good; because, continue the Court, \u201c where the interest is to \u201cbe <em>increased </em>if the money be not paid on the day, that is \u201cbut as a <em>nomine pocnm, </em>and relievable in equity.\u201d Where the greater sum is reserved, if the condition of abatement is not strictly complied with, it is to be paid; because it is reserved, and a contrary decision would contravene the agreement of the parties; but the greater sum is not to be paid where it is only reserved to enforce the payment of the smaller, which alone forms the measure of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tract of the parties. In other words, the agreement of the parties is to prevail, so far as it respects the sum agreed to be paid: it is to he relieved against, so far as it partakes of the nature of a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"AtnC\">These positions, supported by all the authorities, are decisive of the case before us. The party is to get only that which he would have received, had the contract been duly complied with, and legal interest thereupon from the time when it should have been paid. All beyond is in the nature of a penalty, and rclievable against, by the principles of equity. The cases which shew that the <em>rate </em>of interest can not he <em>increased, </em>equally shew that the <em>back </em>interest can not be given: it will not be given unless it is <em>reserved, </em>as a part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A4F\">On these grounds, the Court is of opinion, to affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
