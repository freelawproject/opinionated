Venabic a debtor of Peter-field Trent, and other defendants. The object of the suit was to get satisfaction of two judgmei~ts obtained hi the General Court, by the executors of Robert Thtral against Icte~field Trent in lis life time; whereupon, xecutions being issued against his body, his brother .~1exaiider Trent became his surety in two bonds for his keeping within the prison bound:, in which the'zj bound the'insel'ves and their heirs:-those bonds were forkited by the said ~reterfleld Trent's escaping from the bounds, and judgments were obtained upon them, in the County Court of Cumberland, against the executors of .~~lexander Treat. the surety; but uo executions were issued upon these judgments. The Bill stated that Fete~jieid Trent died intestate, without any personal estate, and rnnch involyodin debt, and that no person had taken out administra_ tion; but that he left real estate more than sufficient to pay off the judgments in qucstion:-that there were vo assets of ~texander Trent deceased, cm i~vhich executions could be le~cied; that the said .~~lexander Trent devised sundry lots of land to be sold by his executors for payment of his debts, and also devised lands to his chiIdren:~ that the defendant Venable acknowledged himself to be a - - r - See v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>c*c^or <em>Peterfield Trent, </em>in the sum of 100L at least, and was willing to pay the same undex* the direction of the Court. The Complainants therefore prayed an account of the personal and real estates of <em>Peterfield </em>and <em>Alexander Trents; </em>a decree directing their claims to be satisfied out of the real, in default of the personal property, and payment to be made to them of the money in <em>Venable\u2019s </em>hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVa\">After answers filed, and sundry pi\u2019oceedings in the cause, Chancellor Tavxok dismissed the Bill;-\u201c being \u201c of opinion, that the plaintiff\u2019s coming into equity befoi\u2019e \u201c executions were sued out upon the judgments of the \u201c County Court of Cumberland, filed among the exhi&lt;e bits, was premature.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AC\">Nicholas for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC4p\">There are several reasons for giving the Court of Equity jurisdiction in this case; 1. as to Pete~fleld Trent's estate; a disco~oery of assets is called for by the BiIl.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> There was iw represent ati've of the personal estate, the same being so obviously insolvent that no person would administer; which is admitted by the answer of the children. The suit was brought in equ~ity to charge the real estate. Conflicting claims of rnortgagees were also to be adjusted; and the Court of Chancery delights to prevent eircaity of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av4\">2. As to <em>Alexander Trent\u2019s </em>estate. The Bill charges a deficiency of personal, and a devise of real estate to pay debts. The Executors by their Answer l\u2019efer to an Account of the assets which came to their hands, taken by a Commissioner in the suit of <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Archer and others-</em>in the same Court. The Chancellor ought either to have been satisfied with that Account, or directed another to be taken..</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alxn\"><em>Peterfield Trent </em>was the i*eal original debtoi*. A Court of Equity ought not to <em>compel </em>a Creditor to go against a <em>surety </em>for satisfaction. Because we had got judgments against the executors of <em>Alexander Trent </em>the <em>surety, </em>the Chancellor decided that we were bound to look to those judgments, though we filed this Bill endeavoux'ing to get satisfaction out of the <em>principal. </em>This was against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>principles cf Equity, and a <em>harsh </em>application of tlie rule that relief will not be given in Chancery when it can be had at law%</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ake_\">3. A final decree should now be directed, as to the money appearing by <em>Venable\u2019s </em>answer to be in his hands. If not, the Court ought not to dismiss the Bill, but to send the cause back for farther proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ASM\"><em>William </em>Hay, <em>jr. </em>for <em>Alexander Trent\u2019s </em>executors.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1M\">I should be glad if the Court would make such decree as Mr. <em>Nicholas </em>suggests.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AYL\"> White, Whittle &amp; Co, v.

Trent </em>deceased, and under such conditions, to ensure the eventual forthcoming of the same, as to the said Court might seem proper. The Court is farther of opinion, that, as to the residue of the sums now in controversy, an account should have been taken of the personal and real estates of <em>P. </em>and <em>A. Trents </em>respectively, and that as much thereof as is not bound by superior claims should have been held liable to make good the same; applying the personal estate, if any, in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"ATs6\">The Decree is therefore reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, to be finally proceeded in pursuant to the principles of this Decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
