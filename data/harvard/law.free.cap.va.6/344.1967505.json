That other transactions since, (as per account annexed,) will reduce it to 43?. 175. <em>Id. </em>That they have assigned the bond to <em>Fraser, </em>who was apprised of the errors, and promised to account, but had not. The bill, therefore, prays an account, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-13\">The answer of <em>Murchie </em>states the assignment to <em>Fraser, </em>but, that he was informed it was given for an unset-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tier! account, and that it was taken without recourse. That he told him one of the discounts set up by the plaintiff was for a negro bought by <em>Simon Fraser, </em>who was a partner , of <em>Donald, Fraser &amp; Co., </em>but, that the defendant thought <em>Simon Fraser </em>only, and not the company, was liable for the negro.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-3\">The answer of <em>Fraser </em>states, that he knows nothing* of the transactions mentioned in the bill, except that <em>Donald, Fraser &amp; Co. </em>being indebted to <em>Thomas Fraser &amp; Co., </em>of which last named house the defendant is a partner and their agent and assignee, the defendant, <em>Mtirchie, </em>as surviving partner of <em>Donald, Fraser &amp; Co., </em>assigned the said bond to him in discharge of the debt due <em>Thomas Fraser fy Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">The answer of the <em>Maitlands </em>states, that they assisted in the settlement between <em>James </em>Fraser, and <em>Donald, Fraser 8? Co: </em>And that the bond was assigned without any knowledge of any equity against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">The deposition of a witness proves, that <em>Simon Fraser </em>was the acting partner of <em>Donald, Fraser &amp; Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">Another witness proves, that there were mutual dealings between <em>Banister </em>and the company, and between the plaintiff and the company, after <em>Banisters </em>death. That <em>Simon Fraser </em>bought two sows and a negro named So-<em>Chester, </em>at the auction by the executors of <em>Banisters </em>estate. That bonds were generally taken of the purchasers at the sales, except in a few instances, where discounts were .admitted; that if <em>Fraser s </em>bond had ever been applied for, he should probably have been the person who made the application, as he took several bonds from purchasers residing in the town of <em>Petersburg, </em>That he charged the two sows and the negro in the following words: se <em>Simon Fraser, </em>2 do. (sows being mentioned above,) at 48s. <em>6d., </em>spotted and black with one ear. <em>Simon Fraser, </em>Rochester, 83/. <em>5s. 0d.sl</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">Another witness says, that <em>Rochester </em>was always kept at <em>Fraser s </em>plantation, and considered as his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">The Court of Chancery referred the accounts to a commissioner, who corrected several articles, but submitted it to the Court whether credit for the two sows and the negro <em>Rochester, </em>was to be given the plaintiff?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\">The Court of Chancery confirmed the report, and allowed the plaintiff a credit for the two sows and the negro.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-10\">Upon application for a hill of review, the cause Was reheard by consent. When the Court of Chancery was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>opinion, that the plaintiff was not entitled to a credit for the two sows and the negro, and decreed accordingly. From which decree, <em>Rose </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-8\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellant. \u2022</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-9\">Although it is generally true, that a debt due from an individual partner cannot be set off against a company demand, yet there are strong reasons to believe, <em>from the </em>circumstances of the case, that the purchases here were intended to be on account <em>of the </em>company debt; and, under that impression, that the executor took no bond, which indeed was never offered by <em>Fraser: </em>Who thereby shewed his own conception of the transaction. Consequently, it would be unreasonable, that the confidence, reposed in him by the executor, should expose the latter to the loss of the debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-10\"><em>Rennet Taylor, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-11\">It is a general principle, that if one does an act, it is as an individual, unless it be shewn, that he did it in a different character. Therefore, <em>Rose </em>ought to have shewn, that' the purchase was made in his social, and not in his individual character; or else he reverses the general principle. But, in this case, there is the most conclusive proof, that the purchase was actually made in his individual capacity, and not as a partner; for, the- articles are set down to him and not to the company; and the slave is proved to have been carried to his own private estate, and there kept as his own property: Which removes every possible presumption, that the purchase was made for the benefit of the copartnery. Besides, the articles bought, were not of a mercantile nature, or purchased in the course of trade; and, therefore, the company could not be charged with them. Because a transaction of a single partner, unconnected with the nature of the business, does not hind the company, <em>[Harrison </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>et al.] 7 T. R. 207. And this principle is correct; for, otherwise, it would be in the power of one partner to ruin the concern, by improvident schemes of which they have no knowledge, and of which, consequently, their approbation cannot be presumed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Wickham,, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-4\">Although an individual partner will generally be understood to buy for himself, yet circumstances may rebut it. The executor might think the purchase was only a continuance of the transactions between his testator and the company; and if <em>Rose had </em>called for payment, or a bond, <em>Fraser </em>would certainly have refused, whilst the company\u2019s debt remained unsatisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-5\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-6\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">Delivered the resolution of the Court to\u2019the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\"><em>In January, </em>1788, <em>Banister </em>gave his bond, payable to Donald, <em>Fraser \u00a3y Co. </em>for 200/. the supposed balance of dealings of <em>Banister, </em>with that company, and another mercantile house of <em>Robert Donald fy Co. </em>blended together; in both which <em>Simon Fraser </em>was the active partner; and as such took the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In 1793, <em>Murchie </em>assigned this debt, with a large number of others due to <em>Donald, Fraser &amp; Co. </em>to <em>James Fraser, </em>assignee of <em>Thomas Fraser &amp; Co. </em>of <em>Britain, </em>for a large debt due to them from <em>Donald, Fraser </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>which debts <em>James Fraser </em>appointed the <em>Maitlands </em>to collect, who sued Rose, the executor of <em>Banister, </em>upon the bond, in the name of <em>James </em>Fraseras assignee as aforesaid. <em>Rose </em>confessed judgment, reserving his equitable defence; and filed this bill, stating, that <em>Banister\u2019s </em>bond, intended to include the balance due to both companies, was taken, without settlement, for a conjectural sum, far exceeding the real balance. He, therefore, prays an injunction; that the accounts may be adjusted, and the real balance paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Upon the several answers coming in, a replication is filed, and depositions taken. An order was made by consent, referring it to a commissioner to settle the accounts between the parties. Commissioner <em>Hay </em>reports the settlement, stating a balance of 41l. 3s. <em>7d. </em>to be due from <em>Banister\u2019s </em>estate, unless the estate was entitled to a credit of 83/. <em>5s. </em>for a slave and two sows, purchased by <em>Simon Fraser, </em>at a public sale of that estate. If that was allowed, the balance of 43l. 15s. would be due to the estate, with interest from <em>April, 1790.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>To this article, the dispute between the parties is confined: All other parts of the report being submitted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The facts are, that <em>Simon Fraser </em>was the acting partner of both companies; that, with him, the extensive dealings of <em>Banister </em>were transacted; and all the other articles, credited in the company\u2019s account, delivered to him' or his order; and no account subsisted between them in the individual character of <em>Fraser. </em>And that, <em>Fraser, </em>at the public sale, purchased the articles, which are charged to him, without any agreement or even conversation, about the application of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\"><em>Bander, </em>who acted as clerk at the sales, says, he expected the amount was to be credited in the company\u2019s accounts, not then liquidated, and gives his reasons. That the sales were upon credit, the purchasers giving bond and security; which was generally given, except where the executor allowed discounts to creditors. That he took the other bonds, and was not directed to take <em>Fraser\u2019s; </em>nor was one required, as far as he knows or believes.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\"><em>M\u2019Donald </em>says, that the slave purchased was always kept at <em>Fraser\u2019s </em>plantation, and considered as his property, until he and other slaves were conveyed in a deed of trust from <em>Fraser, </em>to the <em>Maitlands </em>and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Upon these facts, the commissioner reported his opinion in favour of the amount being charged to the company; and the <em>Chancellor </em>in his first decree confirmed it, making the injunction, to the judgment on the bond, perpetual; and decreeing the defendant to pay the 43/. 15s. with interest from <em>April </em>1790, (the day of payment for the sales) and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">Upon a re-hearing, by consent as on a bill of review, the credit was disallowed; the injunction dissolved, as to the 41/. 3s. <em>Id. </em>interest and costs; \u2019and perpetuated as to the residue. The appeal is from the latter decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">The rule, that the private debt of a partner cannot he set off against a company debt,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> does not apply; since the question is, whether it was such a private debt, or a payment of the company\u2019s debt to that partner, who, it is agreed, had authority to receive it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Trent, </em>in this Court, 1 <em>Wash. </em>77, the articles for which the discount was claimed, were confessedly delivered to the acting partner on his private account; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>on a state of them, it was endorsed, that when settled, the balance was to be credited in the company\u2019s account. That private account had not been adjusted so as to fix the balance, and on that ground, the discount was not allowed. But, even there the Court said <em>Scott </em>might be relieved in equity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We are in that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In considering this subject, the Court viewed the situation and practice of the country as to the present subject. <em>Simon </em>Fraser, or any other man, is the ostensible merchant opening a store for retailing goods and purchasing commodities. It is the store which gives him credit, and that is answerable for any commodities furnished, whether it belongs to him alone, or to a company, of which he is a partner, or for whom he acts as factor. True it is, if the company fails, the creditor may resort to the agent or factor, on the common principle of master and servant, where both are liable. As to the article furnished not being within the nature of the trade, how is the planter to know the objects of the trade ? He takes goods, and to pay for them, sells the merchant whatever he is willing to receive; tobacco, wheat, a horse, a slave, or any thing else, for which he is usually credited in the store-books, without enquiry for whom purchased, or how applied. Here the slave was sold to <em>Fraser, </em>still the acting- partner, and no bond was required, as in the case of a creditor. He was not a creditor in his private character, but as a partner of the company; and, in the store-book, the estate was entitled to a credit for the amount, which leaves the estate a creditor of <em>Donald, Fraser &amp; Co. </em>for 43l. 15s., to whom, or to <em>Simon Fraser*s </em>estate, the executor of <em>Banister </em>may resort for satisfaction; but, he has no claim as to that, upon the defendant, <em>James Fraser, </em>although he is bound, so far as the debt assigned him was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The last decrees are to be reversed, with costs, and the first affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-15\">[* <em>Armistead </em>v. <em>Butler's adm'r. </em>1 H. &amp; M. 1761 <em>Ritchie </em>et al. v. <em>Moore et al. 5 Munf. 396.]</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">[* See <em>Dunbar v.
