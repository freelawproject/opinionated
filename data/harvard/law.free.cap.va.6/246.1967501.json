Neither does it mention the penalty' or the suni in the condition, nor the names of all the obligors, or to whom the bond was payable. One forthcoming bond cannot be taken on two or ^ more executions; and, therefore, a summary judgment could not regularly be entered on it. The penalty of the bond involves uncertainty, for, the first whole 15,896/. <em>5s. 10 d </em>is stated, and then the obligors are bound in separate parcels, and lastly the aggregate sum is taken again. The act of Assembly, concerning forthcoming bonds, says they shall be payable to the creditor. But, here the Commonwealth was creditor, and yet the bond is payable to <em>Goodall; </em>and although it is afterwards said <em>to the use of the Commonwealth, </em>that will not satisfy the law. The day appointed in the condition of the bond, for the sale of the property, was <em>Sunday; </em>which is not a juridical day; and a performance of the condition would have been illegal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Nicholas, </em>Attorney General, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-3\">The notice is good; for, all that is required is, that the defendants should know on what bond the motion will be made, and any deseripition answering that end is enough. Here the defendants were sufficiently apprised of the bond on which the <em>Auditor </em>intended to move; for, from the various particulars mentioned, it was impossible for'them to mistake. As to the objection, that one bond was taken on two executions, it has no weight in the present case; because the act of Assembly, passed for that purpose only, expressly makes use of the word <em>bond </em>and not <em>bonds; </em>which seems necessarily to require that one bond only should be taken. The <em>Auditor, </em>as taking care of this department of the public affairs, was the proper person to give the notice, and not the Sheriff. That the property was to be delivered on a Sunday, makes no difference; because, that was formerly a legal day, and it is held, in 3 <em>Burr. </em>1601, <em>[Mackalley's </em>Case, 9 Co. 66,] that a ministerial act may still be done on that day. But what is decisive is, that the act of Assembly declares it may be done upon that day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-9\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\">[* <em>Oct. </em>12,1792, c. 100,13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>623.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b269-10\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A3O\">The bond, on which the motion is \u2022 founded, is to he considered as one of two several obligations entered into on the part of the two several Sheriffs and their respective securities, although consolidated in the same instrument. This construction arises not only from its being stated in the obligation that <em>Winston </em>and his securities are bound in thp sum of 10,158/. 15s. and <em>Cecilia Anderson </em>and her securities, in the sum of <em>5,7371. 10s. 10d. </em>but also from the terms therein used, that the obligors are bound for the payment <em>ee according to our obligation aforesaid. </em>\u201d What is mentioned of the amount of the aggregate sum, does not vary the construction, and is only as a memorandum of the amount of both bonds taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Considering this instrument, however, as containing either one bond or two several bonds, a question arises, whether, as it is subscribed by all the obligors, they are not all liable for the whole amount? And that they are so liable, derives some color from its being stated in the obligation that the obligors are bound jointly and severally? but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>this construction is done away by that part of the condition, which states, that on a delivery by each set of obligors, the bond is void as to them, which would not be the case if each set of obligors were bound for-the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">The words jointly and severally, therefore, in the obligation, are to be taken <em>reddenda singula singulis, </em>to extend to each set of obligors, and to each several obligation, and not to all the obligors with reference to both obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">If this be a separate bond, .though contained in the same instrument, with another bond, most of the objections to the bond and to the notice will fall to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Indeed, the bond seems taken agreeably to the act of Assembly, which has been cited/relating thereto; and .the notice is sufficiently particular and descriptive to warn the defendant of what he is to answer. The <em>Auditor </em>having signed the notice, its being dated at the <em>Auditor\u2019s </em>Office, and stating that instructions will be given the <em>Attorney General, </em>are circumstances clearly indicative of its being a <em>public bond, </em>which was to be moved upon. And when, in addition to this, it is recollected that the notice further states all the obligors except a deceased one; as well as the date of the bond; its being a bond for the forthcoming of property; the particular Sheriff by whom taken; and that the <em>property therein </em>mentioned, was taken in execution by virtue of two writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>issued from the Clerk\u2019s Office of the General Court, there is a reasonble degree of certainty, as to the very bond which was to be moved upon: And I believe that very many judgments have been affirmed in this Court, upon notices not more particular.' I am, therefore, for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">CARRINGTON, Judge. As the counsel for the plaintiffs in the <em>supersedeas </em>have insisted on their exceptions with great earnestness, I shall consider them in the order in which they were made, and give an answer to each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">The first exception is, that the notice does not state that the motion would be made at the instance of the Commonr wealth, or designate the\u2019parties to the bond, but merely . that a motion would be made on a bond payable to <em>Parke Goodall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">The date of the bond, however, is mentioned, and that the condition was for the delivery of the property taken by <em>Parke Goodall, </em>Sheriff of <em>Hanover, </em>by virtue of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>issued from the office of the General Court, against the estate of the defendant <em>Winston; </em>which was sufficiently descriptive of the bond. And if the defendants had given any other bond of the same date, under the like writs, so as to render it uncertain which was meant, they might have shewn it. But, as none such is suggested, the fair presumption is, that none such existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The next objection is, that neither the penalty nor the sum due is mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The answer to the last objection, is an answer to this also.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The third objection is, that all the obligors are not mentioned, <em>nor the person, to, whom the bond is payable, sufficiently described.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">But, as the defendants were all obligors, and the motion not intended to be made against any other; as, too, the bond was joint and several; and <em>Parke Goodall, </em>the obligee, expressly named, there was no occasion to be more particular, as those circumstances gave the defendants full notice of the bond on which the motion would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The fourth exception is, that one bond was taken on two executions.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">This, indeed, is not common; but it does not follow from thence thai the bond is void. No disadvantage could result to <em>Winston </em>from it, as he was not thereby subjected to more than he owed himself; for, care is taken to prevent that. Besides, it seems agreeable to the directions of the act of Assembly; which rather points at one bond only.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The fifth objection is, that two separate debtors are included in the same bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">This is nearly the same idea with that in the last exception, and may receive the same answer. For, the condition designates the debt of each, and provides for the discharge of each.\u2019 So that neither is in danger of sustaining any damage from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The sixth error assigned is, that the bond should have been made payable to the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">But, that was not necessary in this case; because the act of Assembly directed that it should be taken to the Sheriff for the use of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">The last exception is, that the day on which the property was to be delivered was <em>Sunday.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">But, this surely could be no objection in this case; because the act of Assembly had expressly directed it; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>therefore, if it he true that it was contrary to law in common cases&gt; it clearly was not so in this; for, the Sheriff stood justified by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq9\">Upon the whole, the exceptions taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, seem to me untenable; and, therefore, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">LYONS, Judge. Concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
