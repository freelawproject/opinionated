Spence, </em>against <em>John W. Bag-well </em>and others, the obligors in the bond. The plaintiff sought to recover damages for the seizure and sale of two slaves under an execution in the name of <em>Bagwell, Smith of Jones </em>against <em>William B. Jones.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">Upon the trial of the cause the defendants demurred to the evidence, and the Court compelled the plaintiff to join in the demurrer: And there was a verdict for the plaintiff subject to the demurrer to evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">The relator claimed the property as trustee in a deed of trust executed to him by <em>William B. </em>Jones; and the only question upon the demurrer was, whether the deed was or was not fraudulent upon its face. If it was not, the evidence fully made out the plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-11\">The deed bears date the 1st day of November 1841, and is between <em>William B. Jones </em>of the first part, <em>David E. Spence </em>of the second part, and <em>David P. Reese </em>and all the creditors of <em>Jones, </em>who at the date of the deed, resided in the town of <em>Lynchburg. </em>It recites that <em>Reese </em>is bound as endorser of <em>Jones </em>on various negotiable notes, amounting in the aggregate to about the sum of 2600 dollars, which notes are payable either at the Virginia or Farmers Bank in <em>Lynchburg; </em>and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>it was agreed between them he would endorse other <em>\u2022 </em>notes for the purpose of renewing those already in existence; and that it may be that <em>Reese </em>will endorse other negotiable notes for said <em>Jones, </em>besides those to be endorsed for the renewal of the notes aforesaid; and that <em>Reese </em>is the security of said <em>Jones </em>in various bonds executed by <em>Jones </em>to divers persons whose names are not now remembered, and that said <em>Jones </em>is indebted to various persons then residing in the town of <em>Lynch-burg, </em>in divers amounts not now remembered, and it is the purpose of said <em>Jones </em>to indemnify said <em>Reese </em>in the first place, and then to secure the payment of the other debts referred to. And it was further declared that any creditor intended to be secured by the deed, who should, on or before the 1st of March 1843, proceed by suit or by any legal process whatever, against the said <em>Jones </em>for the recovery of their respective debts, should be debarred from any right or benefit under the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">The deed then proceeded to convey to <em>Spence </em>a tract of land in the county of <em>Campbell, </em>certain slaves, and among them the two sold under the execution of <em>Bagwell, Smith &amp; Jones, </em>one shot gun, one mantel clock, the tobacco factory of the said <em>Jones, </em>with the fixtures, one hundred and fifty-eight boxes of tobacco then in the possession of <em>Fisher &amp; Co. </em>of <em>Boston, </em>and about two thousand pounds of bacon. The trusts were that <em>Jones </em>should be permitted to remain in possession of the property, and to use the same and enjoy the profits thereof until the 1st of March 1843. That he should be considered the agent of the trustee, with full power and authority to sell or dispose of any of the property conveyed, at private or public sale for cash, and to give title thereto, and to collect the proceeds of sale. But upon the condition that he should immediately pay over to the trustee all moneys received by him from said sales, which the trustee should apply to the payment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>curtailment of any of the said notes or bonds on which <em>Reese </em>was bound, as the said <em>Reese </em>might direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbI\">And it was expressly provided, that should the said <em>Jones </em>pay off in whole or in part any or either of the negotiable notes upon which said <em>Reese </em>was bound as his endorser, by moneys not raised by a sale of the trust property, then the said <em>Jones </em>should be considered as a creditor of the trust fund, and might retain for his own use and benefit, of moneys which he might receive on a sale as aforesaid, an amount of money corresponding with that so paid by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">And it was further provided', that if the debts secured by the deed were not paid by the 1st of March 1843, then the trustee, when required by <em>Reese </em>or the said <em>Jones, </em>should proceed to sell at auction, as prescribed in the deed, and should first pay off the debts for which <em>Reese </em>was bound, and then all others secured by the deed, which <em>Jones </em>should certify .as correct and a proper charge upon the <em>fund; </em>and the balance of the trust fund should restore to <em>Jones. </em>This deed was admitted to record in the clerk\u2019s office of the Hustings court of <em>Lynchburg, </em>on the acknowledgment of <em>Jones, </em>on the 4th day of April 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">There was a judgment for the defendants on the demurrer to evidence. Whereupon the plaintiff applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-8\"><em>Garland, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-9\">The demurrer to evidence concedes the credibility of all the evidence, all the inferences which could have been fairly deduced by a jury, in favour of the appellant, and the <em>bona fide </em>intention with which the deed was executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-10\">The simple question then is, is the deed of trust of the first of November 1841, void <em>per se 1 </em>The only provision in the deed to which the slightest exception can be taken, or the slightest inference to the prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of the deed be drawn, is the following: \u201c And upon this further trust, that the said <em>Jones </em>shall be considered the agent of the said trustee <em>Spence, </em>and shall have full power and authority to sell or dispose of any of the property herein before mentioned, at private or public sale, for cash, and to collect the proceeds of such sale or sales, but upon the following condition: The said <em>Jones </em>shall immediately pay over to the said trustee <em>Spence, </em>all moneys which he may raise, receive or collect from or by the sale of any of the property herein before mentioned, and such moneys shall, by the said <em>Spence, </em>be applied to the payment or curtailment of any or either of the said notes or bonds upon which the said <em>Reese </em>is bound as the endorser or security of the said <em>Jones, </em>as the said <em>Reese </em>may direct.\u201d When it is considered that this deed was executed on the 1st of November 1841, and if the vendor is in default, authority is reserved to the trustee to close it after the 1st of March 1843; that <em>Jones </em>the vendor, was constituted a mere agent <em>ad interim, </em>to sell, receive and pay over the money received, to the trustee, for the purposes of the trust, and that, as conceded by the demurrer, it was done in good faith, 1 cannot perceive how this provision can vitiate the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\">The power of a trustee to appoint an agent, when his own commission authorizes him to do so, I imagine cannot be doubted, and the exercise of the power is valid, unless coupled with a fraudulent design. In this case the deed of trust created the agency of <em>Jones, </em>and was certainly valid, unless coupled with a fraudulent design, which is not only not pretended, but admitted not to have existed. If the agent had betrayed the confidence of the trustee and <em>cestuis que trust, </em>the loss would have fallen on the <em>cestuis que trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-7\">The object of the statute of frauds was to punish fraudulent design, and the object of the Courts has been to protect against fraudulent design. In this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>this object cannot be achieved, because it is conceded <em>, </em>that there was no fraudulent design. This Court, in <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex'or </em>v. Cunningham, 8 Leigh <em>271, </em>decided , , ' that \u201cthe statute to prevent fraudulent conveyances applies to no conveyance made <em>bona fide, </em>for valuable consideration, and does not prevent a debtor in failing circumstances, from preferring one class of creditors to another.\u201d In the cases of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Timmerman, 7 </em>Wend. R. 436; <em>Seward </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>8 Cow. R. 405 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>4 Wend. R. 300, the Supreme court of <em>New York </em>established the doctrine, \u201cthat there is no such thing as fraud <em>in law </em>distinguished from fraud in fact; what was formerly conclusive evidence of fraud is now held to be but <em>prima facie </em>evidence, to be submitted to the jury;\u201d and this I understand to be the doctrine of this Court established in the recent case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>4 Gratt. 422. The <em>bona fide </em>intention in this case being admitted, these cases conclusively overrule the judgment of the Court below, sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-9\">It may be, and I doubt not will be, attempted to sustain the judgment of the Court below, by the authority of this Court in the case of <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>3 Rand. 410. The Court is invited to compare the provisions of the deed in the case of <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>with the provisions of this deed, and it will perceive that the powers reserved to the vendor over the trust property in that case, were very different from those reserved to the vendor in this case; indeed there is scarcely any similitude. In that case the whole deed is beset with fraudulent circumstances ; in this there is not one. In that case there is no satisfactory proof of <em>bona fide </em>intention ; in this it is conceded and the case put, solely, upon the ground of fraud <em>per se. </em>But if the provisions of the two deeds were similar, I consider the case of <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee, so </em>far as it established the doctrine of fraud <em>per se, </em>as overruled by the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Turner, and no presumption of fraud can attach to this deed, because the demurrer concedes the <em>bona fide </em>intention : and if it did not, it is proved. The case of <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>however, is no authority in this or any other case, even if it applied. It was decided, so far as the question of fraud <em>per se </em>was concerned, by only two Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-4\">Fraud, according to the established doctrines of this Court, being a question of fact, ought to be determined by a jury. In this case the question of fraud was made one of law and not of fact, while it was conceded that in fact there was no fraud. It seems to me, from these views, that the judgment of the Court below is erroneous, and ought to be reversed and a judgment rendered for the appellant according to the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-11\"><em>Stanard &amp; Bouldin, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-12\">The only question is, whether the deed upon its face is or is not fraudulent. The counsel for the appellant seems to suppose that the demurrer to evidence concedes the <em>bona fides </em>of the deed: But this we submit is a mistake. The utmost extent to which it can go is to concede the facts which the parol proof tends to establish, and the fair inferences of fact which may be deduced from it, and from the deed. <em>Tutt </em>v. <em>Slaughter, </em>5 Gratt. 364; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>5 Rand. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-13\">The parol proofs shew that <em>Reese </em>was bound as endorser for the grantor in the deed. Then if the deed provides for benefits to the grantor, and <em>Reese </em>consented to this provision either willingly or unwillingly, the deed is fraudulent. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>4 Rand. 282. In that case there was no fraud in <em>Garland, </em>and yet he having taken the deed, though unwillingly, with the fraudulent provision in favour of another, the deed was held to be fraudulent. In <em>Twine\u2019s </em>Case, 3 Coke\u2019s R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>80, the deed was for value, yet because of other provisions in the deed it was held to be fraudulent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Tl\">In this deed we insist that there was a reservation inconsistent with the deed, and that it was therefore fraudulent. <em>Sheppards </em>v. Turpin, 3 Gratt. 373; <em>Lang </em>v. Lee, 3 Rand. 410. The first badge of fraud in this deed is, that it bears date on the 1st of November 1841, and was not admitted to record until the 4th of April 1840, That was one badge of fraud in <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee. </em>A second badge of fraud is, that not one debt is specified. This was also the case in <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee. </em>These two with another condemned the deed in that case. That other was that the grantor was allowed to remain in possession of the property for nine months with power to sell, and with the duty to account to the trustee for his sales. Here <em>Jones </em>was allowed to have possession for sixteen months, with power to sell, and as agent to account to the trustee. So that this case is stronger than <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\">A fourth badge of fraud is, that the grantor reserves a power of indefinite future charge. In this it is like <em>Sheppards </em>v. <em>Turpin. </em>A fifth is the provision reserving to <em>Jones </em>an interest in the property, and constituting him a creditor on his own trust fund. This is condemned by <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Rives, supra; </em>and <em>Twine\u2019s </em>Case. A sixth is, that no person but <em>Reese </em>or <em>Jones </em>is authorized even after the 1st of March 1843, to require a sale of the trust property. And a seventh badge of fraud is, that after <em>Reese </em>is indemnified, the trustee is <em>not </em>allowed to pay any debt unless <em>Jones </em>certifies it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-8\">We know but one case which can be relied on to sustain this deed against any one of the foregoing objections: that is <em>Janney </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>11 Leigh 100. In that deed the grantors were authorized to act as agents of the trustee for a short period. But the deed provided that the trustee should assume the debts of the creditors to a greater amount than the value of the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>conveyed. There, too, the possession of the grantors only continued about four months; and before the suit was brought the trustee had taken possession of the property: And then the deed was only sustained so far as to indemnify the trustee.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-13\"> Judge <em>Daniel </em>had been counsel in the cause in the Court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b471-10\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AUk\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
