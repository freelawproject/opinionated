The defendant pleaded payment, and the plaintiffs took issue. On the next day, on the motion of the defendant, he was allowed by the Court to withdraw the plea of payment, and, thereupon, he filed the following plea: <em>is James Morton </em>&lt;\u00a7* <em>Co. </em>for the benefit of <em>Alexander </em>Boyd, plaintiff\u2019s, against Sir <em>Peyton Skipwith, </em>defendant. And the said <em>Skipioith </em>comes and defends the force and injury when, &amp;c. and saith, that the plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their said action against him, because he saith that he hath paid to the plaintiffs.the debt in the declaration mentioned, and this he is ready to verify. And the said <em>Skipioith, </em>for farther plea, according to the act of Assembly, in that case made and provided, saith, that the plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their said action against him, because he saith, that in the year of our Lord 177 , a certain medium or kind of money called paper money was made, issued, and established, by act of General Assembly, passed and enacted in the said year 177 , which said paper money was, by the said act of Assembly, declared to be a lawful tender in discharge of all debts contracted or due before that time. And that the said tender, if refused, should operate as an extinguishment of interest. And the said <em>Skipwith </em>in fact saith, that on the fifth day of <em>May, </em>in the year 1778, the said <em>Skipwith </em>did, in pursuance of the said law, tender, and offer to pay to the plaintiffs, the full amount of the debt, in the said declaration mentioned, together with interest after the rate of ten <em>per centum per annum </em>from the date of the bill of exchange mentioned in the declaration, and also the full charges of protest of the said bill in bills of the said medium or currency called paper money, which was by law established as aforesaid. And the defendant farther avers, that the said plaintiffs, on the day and year aforesaid, did refuse to receive or accept the said paper money, in discharge of the said debt, interest, and charges as aforesaid. Whereby, by force of the said act of Assembly, all right in the said plaintiffs to recover of the said <em>Skipwith </em>ahy interest on the debt in the declaration mentioned, from the day of the said tender, is forfeited: All which the said <em>Skipwith </em>is ready to verify; and, therefore, he prays judgment, if the plaintiffs ought to have or maintain their said action thereof against him.\u201d The cause was, thereupon, sent back to the rules, for an issue to be made up therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnKG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>And, at the rules, the plaintiffs, as to the first plea of the sa^ Skipwith, in manner and form by him pleaded, replied, that the said <em>Skipwith </em>had not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned. And as to the second plea, they demurred; and for causes stated; 1st. That the said second plea does not sufficiently set forth the act of General Assembly, in the said plea mentioned, the time of making, nor the purport thereof. 2d. That the said second plea does not sufficiently set forth in what bills or species of paper medium the tender or offer of payment was made. 3d. That the said second plea does not shew that the defendant has always been ready, since the cause of action accrued, or ever since the time of making the pretended tender aforesaid, to pay the debt and interest accruing before the time of making the tender, and the charges of protest in the declaration mentioned, to the plaintiffs. 4th. That the said second plea does not aver and shew that the said defendant still is ready to pay to the plaintiffs the debt, interest, and charges so by him pretended to have been tendered and offered. 5th. That the said defendant, in his second plea, does not make a profer\u00ed <em>in curia </em>of the said debt, interest, and charges that is over. 6th. That the said second plea is contradictory; that it states the act of Assembly aforesaid to extinguish interest from the time of making the tender; and also states that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover interest from the said defendant from the time of the pretended tender, is forfeited, yet begins by averring, that the plaintiffs ought not to maintain their action; and concludes by praying, whether the plaintiffs ought to have or maintain their action, &amp;c. 7th, and lastly. That the said second plea of the defendant is uncertain, and wants form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">The record then proceeds thus: \u201cAnd at another day, to wit: at a Court held for the district aforesaid, the 29th day of <em>Jlpril, </em>1796, came the parties by their attornies, and the plaintiffs demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea of tender was argued, arid it was considered by the Court that the plea and matters therein contained were not sufficient in law to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action; and it was farther considered by the Court, that the cause be continued till the next Court, for the trial of the issue on the plea of payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">And at another day, to wit: at a Court held for the district aforesaid, <em>September </em>29, 1796, came the parties aforesaid, by their attornies' aforesaid,- and the attorney for the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>dant relinquished the former plea of the said defendant. Therefore it is considered by the Court, that the plaintiffs should recover against the said defendant three hundred and two pounds sixteen shillings sterling, being the principal, interest and charges of protest of the bill of exchange in the declaration mentioned, together with interest thereon, to be computed after the rate of five <em>per centum per annum </em>from this day to the time of payment, and their costs by them about their suit in this behalf expended, and the defendant in mercy, &amp;c. But, the said sterling money may be discharged by twenty-eight <em>per cent, </em>difference of exchange.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">To the judgment <em>Skipwith </em>obtained an order from a Judge of this Court for a writ of <em>supersedeas. </em>The petition stated, that <em>Morton fy Co. </em>instituted an action of debt against the petitioner for 100/. sterling on a protested bill of exchange; that to this action the petitioner filed a plea of a tender of paper money; to whieh plea, a demurrer having been filed, the said plea was overruled; that the petitioner is advised, that, let the reasons assigned in the said plea, be even valid, (which he in no manner admits,) they are founded upon the principle of a tender at common law: Whereas, the petitioner is advised, that under an act of the <em>October </em>session, 1787, when paper money was about to expire, he was at liberty to offer in evidence, any circumstances for the purpose of rendering a judgment more equitable, in cases where the non-payment was owing, as in this case, to the creditor; that this over-ruling of the said plea did in fact preclude the petitioner from offering that evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-5\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the plaintiff in the <em>supersedeas.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">Although the plea would be bad, upon mere common law principles, it is nevertheless sufficient under the acts of Assembly, passed in the years 1777, [9 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>298,] and 1781, [10 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>471.] For, by the first, it is expressly declared, that a tender and refusal shall operate an extinguishment of interest; and, by the latter, the Court, in such case, are to adjust the claim according to the principles of equity. The defendant, therefore, ought to have had an opportunity of proving the tender and ex-tinguishment of the interest; which he was prevented from doing by the Court\u2019s over-ruling the plea.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-8\">The plea unquestionably was. not sustainable upon any principle of common law, <em>Downman </em>v. <em>Downman\u2019s ex\u2019rs. </em>1 Wash. 26, which case expressly over-rules the plea; and it is, therefore, properly abandoned as a common law plea by the opposite counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">Neither can it b*e supported upon the acts of Assembly. Because, it is not an answer to the whole demand; since it merely offers a bar to the interest subsequent to the tender, and neither says nor claims any thing, in bar of the principal debt and interest, prior to the tender. For, the' rules laid down in <em>Downman </em>v. <em>Downman\u2019s ex\u2019rs. </em>not having been pursued, the tender itself was no bar to the debt and interest prior to the time of making the tender. So that the plea is plainly a partial answer only, to the demand, and, therefore, cannot be supported. For, if a declaration demand 100/. and the plea is, that the defendant has paid 50/. without saying any thing as to the residue, it is clearly bad. So, if in trespass for damage done, in two closes, the defendant justifies the trespass in one, without saying any thing as to the other, the plea is insufficient. The principles of these cases are all fully weighed and considered by the Court in the case of <em>Baird &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Mattox, </em>1 Call, 257, in which it was determined, that if the defendant be sued both as <em>heir </em>and <em>devisee, </em>and pleads <em>nothing by </em>descent, without saying any thing as to the <em>devise, </em>that the plea is bad; which case comes up to the present in all its parts; and proves beyond all contradiction, that the plea in this case was properly over-ruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-10\">The defendant, therefore, if he only meant to insist on an extinguishment of the interest from the date of the tender, ought to have pleaded in the manner in which sett-offs are frequently plead in <em>England; </em>that is <em>to say, he </em>should, in <em>his plea, have </em>acknowledged the plaintiff\u2019s right of action, for the principal debt and interest to the day of the tender; and then gone on and stated the tender and consequent extinguishment of the future interest, under the act of Assembly: which would have been an answer to the whole declaration; but, having omitted to do so, his plea was ill; and, therefore, rightly over-ruled by the Court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-11\">But, if the defendant was entitled to any deduction, under the acts of Assembly, he ought, either to have given the circumstances in evidence, under the plea of payment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>(which he might do according to the decision of this Court in <em>M\u2019Call </em>v. Turner, 1 Call, 133,) or else he should have offered them to the Court, after the verdict was rendered. Having, however, declined all these modes, the fair presumption is, that he had no circumstances to offer, or tender to prove. But, if he had, he, as every other defendant, was bound to shew his circumstances, or plead his tender, according to the forms and manner prescribed by the law. Instead of this, however, he afterwards withdrew his plea of payment, and gave judgment for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand; thereby plainly shewing, that he had no circumstances to offer, or tender to prove; at the same time that he shut the door against all exceptions to the proceedings; because the confession of judgment was equal to a release of errors, under the act of <em>Jeofails.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-3\">Randolph, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-4\">If the defendant had plead generally to the whole demand, his defence would have been untrue; and, therefore, the doctrine contended for, goes to prove, that it is necessary for the defendant to plead an untruth, in order to avail himself of what is true. Although the defendant might have given the tender in evidence under the plea of payment, that did not preclude him from a right to plead it specially, if he chose to do so. No common law rules of pleading apply to the case of paper money, which stands upon its own bottom; and all the decisions of the Courts proceed on that idea. The withdrawing of the plea of payment, did not alter the merits of the case under the other plea, which admitted the residue of the demand, by admitting to answer it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-5\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">The last position does not satisfy the objection to the plea, on account of its offering only a partial answer to the demand set forth in the declaration; because it makes the issue immaterial, and produces the necessity of a repleader: as happened in the case of <em>Baird </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Mattox.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>Cur. adv. milt.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-8\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A7F\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the plea was clearly bad, in point of form; and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>fore, was very properly over-ruled by the District Court. That the defendant might have given the tender in evi-. dence, under the plea of payment, in order to have extinguished the interest, subsequent to the tender; but, having omitted to do so, and having withdrawn his plea of payment, he had relinquished the evidence, and could not now be received to make an objection upon the ground of a right which he had voluntarily waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">ROANE, Judge. The last clause in the act of 1781, [c. <em>22, </em>10 <em>Stat.
