Dear sir, This is to inform you, that I am willing to agree to see you paid, within sixteen months from this date, for <em>Mr. Gregory </em>on account of your deed of trust on his mill and land, 500 dollars which was signed and admitted to have been written by <em>Colgin, </em>and addressed to <em>Henley </em>at <em>Williamsburg. </em>4thly, A deed of trust executed by <em>Gregory, </em>and dated the 4th August 1821, by which,\u2014reciting that <em>Gregory </em>was indebted to <em>Colgin </em>in the sum of 1400 dollars, and that <em>Colgin </em>was <em>Gregory's </em>surety <em>to one Alien </em>for 400 dollars, and had agreed that when he should make his collections, which he expected to do at the Christmas following, he <em>Colgin </em>would pay off the amount due <em>Henley </em>on the deed of trust held by him; the 1400 dollars to be paid the 1st January 1822, the debt of 400 dollars to <em>Allen </em>on the bond held by him, dated the 19th July 1821, and 650 dollars to <em>Henley </em>on the 1st January 1822, <em>and </em>the balance of the debt due <em>Henley </em>on the 1st January 1823 <em>;\u2014Gregory, </em>therefore, conveyed the equity of redemption of the same property, which had been previously mortgaged by him to <em>Browne </em>to secure the debt contracted to him, and by him assigned to <em>Henley, </em>to a trustee, in trust to secure and indemnify <em>Colgin: </em>which deed of trust was offered in evidence on the part of <em>Henley, </em>for the purpose of proving a consideration moving from <em>the </em>original debtor <em>Gregory to Colgin, for Col-gin's </em>promise to <em>Henley, </em>contained in his letter to <em>Henley </em>of the 24th February 1825. Whereupon, <em>Colgin's </em>counsel moved the court to exclude the letter of <em>Colgin </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Henley </em>of the 24th February 1825, from going in evidence to the jury, because (as he alleged) the same did not proceed upon the request of, or any consideration moving from, <em>Gregory </em>to <em>Coigin, </em>and because the letter was variant from the agreement or promise set out in the declaration. And <em>Coigin's </em>counsel also objected to the deed of trust of 4th August 1821, and moved the court to exclude the same, as inadmissible evidence for the purpose for which it was offered. But the court overruled the objections, and admitted both of the papers as evidence; being of opinion that, if request or consideration was necessary to support the promise imported by the letter of <em>Coigin </em>to <em>Henley, </em>the consideration was sufficiently evidenced by the deed of trust executed by <em>Gregory </em>for the benefit of <em>Coigin ; </em>which deed the court held, was proper evidence for the purpose for which it was offered: to which opinions <em>Coigin's </em>counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\">There was a verdict and judgment for <em>Henley </em>for 500 dollars, with interest from the 24th June 1826; from which <em>Coigin </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-5\"><em>Claiborne </em>and <em>Scott, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIK\">argued, 1st, that, to charge one person with the <em>debt of another, the </em>undertaking must manifest a clear intention to bind himself for that debt; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Clark's ex'ors, </em>7 Cranch 69. 90. But <em>Colgin's </em>letter to <em>Henley </em>of February 1825, imported no promise, no <em>agreement; it </em>simply expressed a willingness to agree. <em>It </em>was, in truth, a mere proposal,, an overture to guarantee, which might have been binding on <em>Coigin, </em>if <em>Henley </em>had acceded to it, and given notice of his acceptance of it to <em>Coigin; </em>but there was no direct evidence that <em>Henley </em>acceded to the proposal j and none at all from which it could be inferred, that he returned any answer to it, much more accepted the proffered guarantee. The circuit court ought to have instructed the jury, that such a proposal, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>being accepted, and notice thereof given, was not bind- \u00b0 ing on <em>Colgin.

[Cake, <em>J. </em>asked, whether there was not a material difference between the english statute of frauds and that of <em>Virginia </em>?<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] They admitted there was a difference, but they thought it was not a materia] one; for the reasoning of the court of king\u2019s bench, in the next ca.se in which the principle of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>was approved and enforced, would he found to be iust as applicable to our statute as to theirs. <em>Saunders Wakefield, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 595. 6 Eng. C. L. R. 531. .md they argued, that the policy of both statutes, and the mischiefs intended to be prevented, were the same; and that a door would be open for all those mischiefs here, unless the construction put on the statute of <em>England, </em>should be put on ours also. 3rdly, They said, that the declaration, in all its counts, set out the promise of <em>Colgin, </em>as one made on a consideration therein specially stated; and as <em>Colgin\u2019s </em>letter to <em>Henley </em>did not state a.ny consideration at all, the contract imported by that letter was variant from that stated in the declaration, and the letter ought for that reason to have been excluded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Ju\">submitted, that the <em>first </em>point made in the argument for the appellant here, not having been presented to or decided by the circuit court, could not be considered by this court. But if it could, he said, it was impossible to advert to the circumstances of the transaction, without seeing that <em>Colgin's </em>letter to <em>Henley </em>intended a promise to guarantie to <em>Henley </em>500 dollars for <em>Gregory </em>within sixteen months from the date. <em>Gregory </em>owed a debt to <em>Henley, </em>and had given him a deed of trust to secure the payment, under which the mortgaged property was liable to be sold to satisfy the debt; and he had given <em>Coigin </em>a deed of trust mortgaging the equity of redemption of the same property, in which deed <em>Coigin </em>had agreed that he would pay the debt due <em>Henley; </em>and then, <em>Coigin </em>wrote this letter to <em>Henley, </em>to inform him that <em>he </em>was willing to agree to see him paid 500 dollars for <em>Gregory </em>within sixteen months. It could not be doubted, that he intended to propose a guarantee of that sum to <em>Henley, </em>and thereby to put off the execution of <em>Henley's </em>deed of trust for sixteen months. <em>Henley </em>forbore, accordingly, to enforce his deed of trust, or to demand the debt due him; and so, by his acts, acceded to <em>Colgin's </em>proposal. <em>Coigin got </em>the benefit of the delay he wanted, and must have had notice, from those same acts of <em>Henley, </em>that his guarantie was accepted and relied on. 2ndly, He said there was, without doubt, ample consideration for <em>Colgin's </em>promise to <em>Henley; </em>a consideration <em>moving </em>from <em>Gregory </em>to <em>Coigin, </em>manifested by the terms of <em>Gregory's </em>deed of trust to him; and a consideration from <em>Henley </em>to <em>Coigin, </em>in <em>Henley's </em>forbearance to demand the debt due him, and to enforce the deed of trust by which payment was secured. The objection was, that these, considerations were not expressed in <em>Colgin's letter to Henley. </em>The case of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters, </em>which was cited to support it, had been doubted and denied; <em>Minet, ex parte, 14 </em>Ves. 189. <em>Gardom, ex parte, </em>15 Ves. 289. <em>Hunt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Mass. Rep. 358. <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>1<em>7 </em>Id. <em>122. </em>it was true, that the reasoning or the court m <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Wakefeld, </em>proceeded on broader grounds <em>than </em>that on which <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>was decided; <em>but </em>the subsequent case of <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>3 Brod. &amp; Bing. 14. 7 Eng. C. L. R. 328. replaced the principle on the reasons on which <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>had put it; namely, on the particular wording of the english statute of frauds, that the action should not be maintainable, unless the \u201c <em>agreement's </em>should be in writing. But the words of our statute were,\u2014unless <em>\u201cthe promise or agreement </em>should he in writing. And chief justice <em>Marshall, </em>in <em>Violet </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>5 Crunch 142. 151. adverting to this difference, said, that the reasoning of the judges, in the cases on the english statute, in which they had decided that the consideration ought to be in writing, turned on the word <em>agreement, </em>of which the consideration formed an <em>integral </em>part; <em>and that reasoning did not </em>apply to the statute of <em>Virginia, </em>in which the word <em>promise </em>was introduced. This authority, he said, was conclusive of the point. There must, indeed, be a consideration to support the promise, averred and proved; but it was not necessary, that the consideration should be expressed in the written undertaking. 3rdly, As to the variance between the evidence and the declaration, he said it was not necessary to plead the written contract in the declaration, and here no attempt was made to set out the letter from <em>Colgin </em>to <em>Henley, </em>in any of the counts: they all stated the promise, and the consideration on which it was founded, as matters of fact; they stated, the contract, according to the legal effect; and the evidence proved the contract exactly as it was laid. There was no variance.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Hc decided the cause in the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> See 1 Rev.

These stipulations of <em>Colgin </em>in this deed, throw great light both on the consideration moving <em>Colgin </em>to give the pajier called the promise to <em>Henley, </em>and on that paper itself. I think, therefore, that this deed was clearly admissible: it was a link in the plaintiff\u2019s chain of proof, and proper for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Let us see now, whether the paper relied on as a promise, was admissible? And first, did it, either taken by itself, or in connection with the other evidence, amount to a promise ? We must recollect, that there is nothing technical either about this action of <em>assumpsit, </em>or in the word <em>promise. </em>It is a word in free and common use. I consider that any writing signed by A. and addressed or given to B. by which the writer declares his willingness, assent or intention, to pay B. a certain sum of money, is a promise to pay that sum, whatever be the form of words in which it is cloathed: and where the words of the party promising are at all doubtful, the court will take into consideration the situation and circumstances of the parties, to enable it to judge of their respective intentions and understanding, at the time of the agreement made; Fell on Merc. Guar. 39. <em>Keate </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 158. And in <em>Russell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Clark, </em>7 Cranch 89. chief justice <em>Marshall </em>(discussing the necessity alleged in the bill for coming into equity upon certain letters said to amount to a guaranty) remarks,\u2014\u201c So far as respects the question whether these letters constitute a contract of guaranty, there can be no doubt that the construction <em>in </em>a court of law or a court of equity must be precisely the - same, and that any explanatory fact, which could be admitted in the one court, would be received in the other.\u201d What are the explanatory facts here ? 1. The bond of <em>Gregory, </em>shewing the amount he owed <em>Henley; </em>2. the deed of trust given by him on the mill and land to secure it, dated the 8th February .1821; 3. the deed of trust from' <em>Gregory </em>to <em>Colgin, </em>dated 4th August 1821, covering the same property with <em>Henley\u2019s, </em>and bearing on its face, as one of the considerations for giving it, the undertaking and agreement of <em>Colgin, </em>to pay off <em>Henley\u2019s </em>debt; in pursuance of which engagement, we see, 4. an indorsement on <em>Gregory\u2019s </em>bond, that <em>Colgin </em>paid 400 dollars on the <em>12th </em>February 1825 ; and 5. <em>Colgin\u2019s </em>letter to <em>Henley, </em>bearing date the 24th of the same month, in which he says\u2014\u201c This is to inform you, that I am willing to agree to see you paid, within sixteen months from this date, for <em>Mr. Gregory, </em>on account of your deed of trust on his mill and land, 500 dollars.\u201d Now, I ask, is it possible with these facts before us, not to understand this letter? Here was a subsequent incumbrancer, bound by his deed to redeem the prior incumbrancer; bound too by the strong ties of interest, to prevent a sacrifice of the mortgaged subject, which <em>Henley </em>had the power at any time to effect by a sale under his deed, and which <em>Colgin </em>could only prevent by paying the money or making terms: standing thus, he writes and sends this letter. Is it not clear, that he meant to put off the sale of the mortgaged property, by a promise to pay the 500 dollars in sixteen months ? I cannot for one moment doubt it. It is objected, that he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>promise to pay, but says, \u201c I am willing to agree to see you paid:\u201d but is not the meaning the same? I am willing to agree,\u2014or I do agree,'\u2014or I am willing to see you paid; are they not different forms often used, especially by unlearned men, to express the same idea? Look at the cases: they will shew, that the courts never catch at words, where the meaning is clear. Thus in <em>Saunders </em>v. Wakefield, cited at the bar, the form of the promise <em>was\u2014\u201cMr. Wakefield will engage </em>to pay the bill drawn by <em>Pitman </em>in favour of <em>Stephen Saunders;\u201d </em>and this was never doubted to be a promise, an actual engagement, though on account of there being no consideration expressed, it was thought to fall within the statute of frauds. Again, in <em>Pillans &amp; Rose </em>v. <em>Van Mierop &amp; Hopkins, </em>3 Burr. 1663. a mercantile house being written to on the subject, replied, \u201cWe <em>will </em>give the bill due honour:\u201d lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, this was in effect accepting it. I ask what could be the meaning of <em>Coigin's </em>letter, if not an undertaldng to see <em>Henley </em>paid? It did not assume the form of a proposition; but <em>Coigin, </em>living in <em>Hanover, </em>sent this letter to <em>Henley </em>at <em>Williamsburg, </em>more than a hundred miles off, announcing at once his promise to see him paid; he did not ask to hear from him. It was said, that <em>Henley </em>ought by all means to have returned an answer, saying whether he would accept the terms, in order that, in case he did, <em>Coigin </em>might secure himself. ' I think it not improbable, that he did reply by letter; but, assuredly, this was not necessary for <em>Coigin's </em>protection, for he had already received the consideration for his promise in <em>Gregory's </em>deed of trust to him, and had bound himself by that deed to pay this money. An additional consideration was, his interest to save the property from sacrifice, as it was pledged to him for a considerable sum. By these considerations he seems to have been determined to make this effort, and to let the event shew whether the terms were accepted or not, taking a sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>of the land, within sixteen months as a rejection, and a forbearance for that time as an acceptance. In <em>Egerton </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>6 East 309. it was held, that a note thus\u2014\u201cWe agree to give <em>Mr. Egerton </em>19d. per lb. for 30 bales of <em>Smyrna </em>cotton,\u201d signed by the buyers, was a sufficient memorandum of the <em>bargain, </em>although it did not import an agreement of <em>Egcrton </em>to make any sale, and might, as well as the case here, he called a more proposal. I think then that this was clearly a <em>promise </em>by <em>Colgin </em>to pay <em>Henley </em>500 dollars, within sixteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"ARg\">But it was objected, that it was not properly do-scribed in the declaration. That describes it, in several counts, as a promise to pay the 500 dollars, in part of the debt due from <em>Gregory </em>to <em>Henley </em>and secured by deed of trust; and, surely, this is accurately enough pleaded, to justify its admission as the promise laid in those counts. The declaration, to he sure, alleged this promise to have been made on a consideration which does not expressly appear on its face; but this was not stated as forming any part of the promise itself, but merely as the moving cause, the ground of support to the promise, and surely could furnish no reason for excluding from the jury, the promise which was well described. We must remember that this was a question, not upon the <em>weight, </em>but the <em>admissibility </em>of the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"Aycj\">If it were necessary to discuss the question of consideration here, it would be sufficient to say, that all admit it to be a well settled principle of the common law, that to support every engagement not under seal, there must he a sufficient consideration. And I think, there are more than one, to support this promise; 1. that stated in the declaration, the forbearance to proceed on the deed of trust, within the sixteen months, which, though not expressed, is strongly implied by the nolo itself, and made still more clear by the explanatory facts in the case; and <em>2. </em>the direct interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>promiser to redeem the mortgaged property for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"AVd\">There is one more objection to this note, which I shall consider, but more briefly than I could have wished, but for the length to which these remarks have already grown. It is said to be an undertaking for the debt of another, and therefore void by the statute of frauds, because the consideration of the promise is not expressed upon its face. The english statute of frauds was first adopted into our code in 1787, more than a century after its birth. It was not till 1804 that the case of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>was decided, in which it was held, that not only the <em>agreement </em>to pay the debt of another, but the <em>consideration, </em>as an essential part of that agreement, must be stated on its face. That this was a new construction, then first given to a statute which had been more than a century in operation, is clear from the fact, that neither the bar nor the bench cited any former decision in support of it. The judges rested it entirely upon the technical meaning of the word <em>agreement, </em>and the mischiefs meant to be prevented by the statute. The case seems to have given both surprize and dissatisfaction, as we see by the frequent attacks upon it made in subsequent cases, and the seeming evasion of it, in some, by the court. Indeed, lord <em>Eldon </em>(a judge second to few in law learning), has in the court of chancery, positively denied its correctness, and in one case overruled it. In <em>ex parte Minet, </em>he says\u2014\u201c There is a variety of authorities directly contradicting the case in the king\u2019s bench, which is a most important case in its consequences <em>\u2022, </em>for the undertaking of one man for the debt of another, does not require a consideration moving between them.\u201d Again, in <em>ex parte Gardom, </em>he says\u2014\u201c The first objection, <em>viz. </em>that which <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>was cited to support, is of great importance. Until that case was .decided some time ago, I had always taken the law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>be clear, that if a man agreed in -writing to pay the debt of another, it was not necessary that the consideration should appear upon the lace of the writing.\u201d There are many more cases, both <em>pro </em>and con, which though I have examined, I will not now discuss. But I will state, that in <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>cited at the bar, <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>was supported, though upon principles and reasoning wholly different; and in <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>the court of common pleas also supported it, but went back to the view taken by Jord <em>Ellenborough, </em>of the import of the word <em>agreement. </em>In this country, the case has been followed in <em>New York, </em>in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Vredenburgh, </em>8 Johns. Rep. 29. 30. and in other cases; but chief justice <em>Kent </em>declared himself not altogether satisfied with the decisions. In <em>Massachusetts, </em>it has been wholly departed from; 5 Mass. Rep. 360. and 17 Id. 122. where chief justice <em>Parker, </em>in an opinion of great research, learning and ability, entirely dissents from it: see also the argument; of the late chief justice <em>Swift </em>of the supreme court of <em>Connecticut, </em>in <em>Day\u2019s </em>edition of East\u2019s reports, as anote to the case of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters. </em>I have thus touched this part of the case, to shew that even if our statute were taken exactly from the english, I should not (as at present inclined) approve the construction given it there. But our statute varies materially from theirs\u2014 \u201cNo action shall be brought, whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt &amp;c. of another &amp;c. unless the <em>promise </em>or <em>agreement </em>&amp;c. be in writing &amp;c.\u201d This word <em>promise </em>is not in this part of the english statute ; there, the word <em>agreement </em>alone is used. And upon this difference, the case of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>turned. <em>Lawrence, </em>J. says\u2014\u201c If the question had arisen merely on the first part of the clause, I conceive that it would only have been necessary that the <em>promise </em>should have been stated in writing but he adds, that the statute going on to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>\u201c </em>that no person shall be charged &amp;c. unless the <em>agree-</em>A . . . \u00b0 \u00b0 <em>ment </em>&amp;c. be m writing, shews that the word <em>agreement </em>was meant to be used in a sense different from <em>promise, </em>and something besides the mere promise was required to bestated.\u201d <em>Le Blanc, </em>J. says\u2014\u201c I should have been as well satisfied, however, if recurring to. the words used in the first part of the clause, they had used the same words again in the latter part, and said, unless the <em>promise </em>or <em>agreement </em>&amp;c. be in writing. But not having so done, I think we must adhere to the strict interpretation of the word <em>agreement, </em>which means the <em>consideration </em>for which, as well as the <em>promise </em>by which, the party binds himself.\u201d Now, that which this judge wishes the parliament had dope, is the very thing which our legislature has done, as if specially to avoid this construction. This is the opinion the supreme court of the <em>U. States, </em>as delivered by chief justice <em>Marshall </em>in <em>Violet </em>v. <em>Patton. </em>He says, <em>\u201c </em>The statute of <em>England </em>enacts, that no action shall be brought, in the cases specified, unless the <em>agreement </em>on which such action shall be brought &amp;c. shall be in writing &amp;c. The <em>Virginia </em>act enacts, that no action shall be brought in the specified cases unless the <em>promise </em>or <em>agreement </em>&amp;c. shall be in writing. The reasoning <em>of </em>the judges\u201d (he adds) \u201c in the cases in which they have decided, that the <em>consideration </em>ought to be in writing, turns upon the word <em>agreement, </em>of which the <em>consideration </em>forms an integral part. This reasoning does not ajiply to the act of <em>Virginia, </em>in which the word <em>promise </em>is introduced.\u201d I do not quote this as binding authority, for I know that it belongs to this court <em>alone </em>to settle authoritatively the construction of our own statutes; but I cite it as the opinion of an enlightened court, delivered by a judge bred up under our law; and I concur in the opinion. It is objected, that this construction would <em>leave </em>open a wide door for the mischiefs which the statute meant to prevent; as parol proof must be resorted to, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>consideration </em>be not required to be stated in the promise. But where the words o\u00ed a statute are clear, we must lake them as tbe index of the meani ng. Our statute says the <em>promise </em>shall be in writing. Now, we all know that this word has never been taken to include not only the <em>undertaking </em>but the <em>consideration </em>moving to it. They are perfectly distinct things. Nor can 1 think that so wide a <em>door is </em>left open, as seems to be imagined. The statute, in this branch of it, meant to prevent those perjuries so apt to occur in swearing parol promises or agreements upon men, and those mistakes also, which are often made, even by those who mean honestly, in stating from memory, the substance of parol contracts loosely made perhaps, and carelessly listened to: it therefore said, that the <em>promise </em>to pay the debt of another must be in writing. This was thought a sufficient <em>guard; </em>for the reigning principle with most men, self interest, would generally prevent their deliberately entering into a written promise to burthen themselves with the debt of another, without a sufficient consideration. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, there would in fact he a valuable consideration for such written promise; and then it would be easier as well as more natural, to prove this true consideration, though by parol, than to invent and prove a false one. I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b117-7\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AOg\">The main question is, Whether our statute of frauds makes it essential to the validity of a written promise to pay the debt of another, that it should express, on its face, the consideration on which it is founded ? I am clearly of opinion that it does not. The court of king\u2019s bench in <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters, </em>decided that, under their statute of frauds, the consideration must be expressed in the writing declaring the promise. But the english statute is different from ours. For although ours is, in general, almost a literal transcript from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>english statute, yet there is an important addition to one <em>. </em>... , r _ . .. o\u00ed its clauses, bearing directly, as I conceive, on this question. The english statute provides, that no action shall be brought on certain promises, contracts or agreements, \u201cunless the <em>agreement </em>upon which the action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\u201d Our statute of frauds declares, that no action shall be brought on the same promises, contracts or agreements, \u201c unless the <em>promise or agreement See. </em>shall be in writing <em>See.\u201d </em>The case of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters </em>turned on the strict technical construction of the word \u201c agreement.\u201d It was the only word used in. the english statute, <em>to </em>express what must be in writing, and it was construed to include, <em>ex vi termini, </em>not only the <em>promise, </em>but the <em>consideration! o\u00ed </em>the promise. All the judges put the case on this ground. It is clear, however, that two of the judges, <em>Lawrence </em>and <em>Le Blanc, </em>would have decided the case differently, if the word <em>promise </em>had been repeated, as well as the word <em>agreement, </em>in the latter part of the statute; and I think it is fairly to be inferred from the language of <em>Grose, </em>J. that he was of the same opinion. Now, as our <em>statute does </em>repeat the word <em>promise </em>as well as the word <em>agreement </em>(\u201c unless the <em>promise </em>or <em>agreement </em>shall be in writing\u201d), I think the case of <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters, </em>so far from being an authority against the construction of our statute, for which the appellee\u2019s counsel contends, affords a strong argument in its support. The case of <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Wake-field </em>decides the same point that was decided in <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters, </em>and assigns new and additional grounds for the decision. But that case was decided as late as 1824, and is not authority to which we are obliged to submit; and, with all my respect for the decisions of the courts of <em>Westminster Hall, </em>my mind cannot yield its assent to the new grounds taken in <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Wake</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>field. </em>In <em>Violet </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>the supreme court of the <em>\u00b0 </em>........ <em>United States </em>expresses the opnuon, that the introduction of the word <em>promise </em>into our statute, makes it essentially different from the english statute, and renders it unnecessary that the writing expressing the <em>promise, </em>should express the <em>consideration </em>also. It is worthy of remark, that the decision in <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warliers, </em>even supported as it was by the technical meaning of the word <em>agreement </em>(the only term used in the english statute), was condemned by some of the ablest judges in <em>England, </em>as giving a construction to the statute different from that which it had received for a century. It is true, that our statute did not mean to give validity to any promise which was not valid at the common la,w; and it did not, therefore, give validity to a promise for which there was no consideration. It did mean, however, to add a new requisite to promises previously valid ; namely, that the <em>promise </em>shall be in writing. But the <em>promise </em>is one thing; the <em>consideration </em>is another; and our statute, while it requires the former to be in writing, is silent as to the latter. It is not for ns to add to the requirements of the statute, in the hope of more effectually advancing its objects. I am of opinion, therefore, that the consideration need not he expressed in the promise, but may be proved, at the trial, by parol evidence, as at the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"ADed\">Then, as to the other points in the cause. On the trial, the defendant moved the court to exclude from the jury, the written promise made by <em>Coigin </em>to pay the debt of <em>Gregory, </em>on the ground that the promise did not proceed upon the <em>request </em>of, or any consideration moving from <em>Gregory </em>to the defendant. Nothing can be clearer than that neither of these grounds was sufficient cause for excluding the promise as evidence. No request from <em>Gregory </em>was necessary. It was surely competent to <em>Coigin </em>to engage <em>to </em>pay the debt due by <em>Gregory, </em>and such engagement, even although unknown to <em>Gregory, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>would be binding on <em>Colgin, </em>provided it was founded on sufficient -consideration. And as to the consideration, it is perfectly clear, that it need not have any relation to the interest of the party making the promise; it is sufficient if it affect the interest of the person to whom, it is made. Loss or disadvantage to the person to whom the promise is made, is as good a consideration, as benefit or advantage to. the person making it. Thus, a forbearance to sue, or the surceasing of an action, is a good consideration, although that may operate exclusively for the benefit of the original debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"AJv\">But it was contended, that if the court ought not to have excluded the evidence, for either of the causes alleged by the defendant, yet, as it was objected to, the court should have informed the jury, that the promise was of no avail, unless there should be proof of its acceptance by the plaintiff. I cannot think so. The evidence was not objected to on that ground, and we may fairly infer from the absence of such objection, that acceptance was proved. Every body knows, that what may be intended as a promise, is in truth no promise, until it is accepted. Until then, it is a mere declaration of intention. In cases of this sort, the evidence consists of various links, and these links must, of necessity, be exhibited successively and in detail. If the plaintiff fail to exhibit airy one of them, it is the right and the duty of the defendant, to demur to the evidence, or to move the court to instruct the jury, that the action cannot be sustained, unless they shall think that the whole chain of evidence is completed. If, however, he fail to demur, or to move for such instruction, but objects only to a part of the evidence, on some insufficient ground, it is not proper either for the court trying the cause, or the appellate court, to treat such partial objection, as a demurrer to evidence. In such a case, the proper course of the defendant, is plain and obvious. If there be no evidence of acceptance, he should demur, or move the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>court to instruct the jury, that a promise not accepted, is no sufficient cause of action. In the case before us, <em>there is </em>no demurrer to evidence, nor any exception on the ground that the promise was not accepted; and the jury having found a general verdict for the plaintiff, we must infer that every thing necessary to support the action, was proved on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">These remarks apply also to another objection, which was made in the argument, to the promise given in evidence\u2014that it was not in fact a promise, but only a proposition to enter into an arrangement on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Even if it were admitted, that the words of the writing were somewhat doubtful or ambiguous, in this respect, <em>that </em>is no valid objection to its introduction as evidence, since it is competent to the party to remove such doubt or ambiguity, by other evidence as to the situation and circumstances of the parties, at the time the writing was executed. And, in this view of the subject, I think the deed of trust, given to <em>Colgin, </em>excepted to in the court below, was properly permitted to go to the jury. I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Tucker, P. concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
