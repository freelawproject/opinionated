On the 21st January ISOS, <em>Stewart </em>sold the land to <em>Mark Duncan, for </em>800 dollars, of which <em>Duncan, </em>paid 200 dollars, and gave <em>Stewart </em>his bond for 100 dollars, payable the first January 1810; whereupon <em>Stewart </em>gave possession to <em>Duncan, </em>and executed a bond to him, with condition to convey him a good title in fee on or before the 25th December 1808. In December 1812, <em>Stewart </em>ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tained from his vendor <em>Lane, </em>a written promise to convey the title whenever he should be required ; but no conveyance of the title was ever made by <em>Lane, </em>and none was ever made by <em>Stewart </em>to his vendee <em>Duncan. </em>In March 1810, <em>Duncan </em>sold the land to <em>Thomas Christian, </em>gave him possession of it, and assigned to him <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>bond to convey .the title; and, in November 1823, <em>Christian </em>sold the land to <em>Joseph Goare, </em>and, in like manner, gave him possession, and assigned him <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>title bond. <em>Duncan\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Stewart, </em>for 100 dollars of the purchase money payable the 1st January'' 1810, remained still unpaid; and of this <em>Goare, </em>at the time of his purchase of the land from <em>Christian, </em>had notice. And, in July 1824, <em>Stewart </em>assigned <em>Duncan\u2019s </em>bond for 100 dollars, and all his <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>claim upon the land, to <em>Fredericlc Beuhring.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\"><em>Beuhring </em>filed a bill in chancery, in the county court of <em>Logan, </em>against <em>Goare, Duncan, </em>the infant heirs of <em>Lane </em>who was now dead, and <em>Stewart </em>who was a nonresident,\u2014stating the facts, charging that <em>Duncan </em>was insolvent, and praying that the land in the hands of <em>Goare, </em>might be subjected to the payment of the 100 dollars with interest, due from <em>Duncan </em>to <em>Stewart </em>on account of the purchase money which <em>Duncan </em>contracted to pay for the land, and assigned by <em>Stewart </em>to the plaintiff. The proceedings in the county court were irregular; and that court made a decree for the plaintiff which was erroneous in its details. The defendant appealed to the superiour court of chancery of <em>Greenbrier, </em>which reversed the decree, and retained the <em>cause; </em>and <em>it </em>was afterwards transferred to the circuit superiour court of <em>Logan, </em>where it was regularly matured for hearing as to all the parties, and the facts of the case, as above stated, were clearly proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">At May term 1833, the circuit superiour court decreed, that, unless the defendant <em>Duncan </em>or <em>Goare </em>should pay to a commissioner specially appointed by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to receive the payment, the debt of 100 dollars with interest from the 21st January 1810, the land should be sold by a commissioner appointed for the purpose, after due advertisement &amp;c. on a credit of six and twelve months, taking bonds with surety for the purchase money ; and that the commissioner should report his proceedings under this decree, in order to a final decree. From this decree, this court, upon the petition of the defendant <em>Goare, </em>allowed an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-5\">The case was submitted by <em>Smith </em>for the appellant and <em>Summers </em>for the appellee, without argument.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b603-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AmeA\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014 That the decree was erroneous in this, that the court ought to have directed a conveyance in fee simple of the land in the proceedings mentioned, to have been executed to the defendant <em>Goare </em>by a commissioner, for and on behalf of the infant heirs of <em>Lane, </em>with special warranty, and for and on behalf of the absent defendant <em>Stewart, </em>with like warranty; and that a sale of the premises should not have been directed before the execution of such deed; this court being of opinion, that, as a general rule, the sales of mere equitable titles, ought not to be decreed, since such sales lead to sacrifices, as bidders must purchase in a state of doubt and uncertainty, altogether unpropitious to a fair and advantageous sale. And that, therefore, the decree should be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to the circuit superiour court, to be there proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
