A parol agreement, betweenhushand and wife, that, in consideration of her joining him in a conveyance ofapar~ ccl of her lands, he would purchase certain other 1~ncls, build thereon, and convey the same to her, being clearly prov~ ed, and part~ ly executed, by her joining in the deed, and his making the purchase and erecting the build-</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-7\">ings, ought to be enforced in equity against his heirr,. notwitlistatiding a great disparity in value between the lands so bought and sold; it appearing that, at the time of the marriage, the husband was very poor, and that all the real property in his possession, (except the land purchased as afor~said,) was held in right of the wife.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-8\">=@ See Quarles v. Lacy, 4 Munf. 251</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-4\">THE appellants exhibited their Bill in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Richmond Bistrict, (in 1807) setting f~rtli, that the female plaintiff Mar~j was forinerly wife of Joel Tucker ancestor of the defenda~its;that she, being seized in fee in her own right of a parcel of land, called the Bowling Green, adjacent to the city of~ Richmond, consented, after much importunity from her husband Tucker, to join him in a sale of that property, hi consideration of a positive verbal agreement and promise on his part, that he would purchase other land on Shockoc hill, build thereon, and convey the same to her for the same estate she held in the Bowling Green; that she accordingly did join in the sale of the Bowling Green; and Tucker actually bought and built on a lot on Sliockoe lull containing two acres;-but died withoul settling the same on her according to his agreement. The grayer of the Bill therefore was, that time defendants should be decreed to convey the lot on Shockoe hill to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>the female plaintiff, or at least assign her dower therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">A joint answer of the adult defendants, admitted the plaintiff <em>Mary\u2019s </em>title originally to the Bowling green, and the sale thereof by <em>Joel Tucker, </em>in which she joined; but denied the agreement alledged in the Bill, which, however, (the plaintiffs having put that fact in issue by a general replication,) was fully proved by depositions. It also appeared by exhibits, that four acres of land in Duval\u2019s addition (the Bowling Green) were conveyed by Tucker and wife to <em>James Thomson, </em>for the consideration of 48Z., by deed dated June 26, 1800; and that, on 1 lie same day, <em>Alexander M\u2018Rae </em>and wife conveyed to <em>Joel Tucker </em>the two acres of land on Sliockoe hill, for the consideration of one thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-10\">At September term 1809, Chancellor Tavxor dismissed the Bill as to so much thereof as prayed specific execution of the agreement, but directed the plaintiff <em>Mary\u2019s </em>dower, in the lot bought of <em>M\u2018Rae, </em>to be assigned her by commissioners: and, at June term, 1813, it being admitted that her dower had been assigned in another suit, the bill was finally dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-11\">This Court granted the plaintiffs an appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-12\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1\">contended that a Court ot Equity will enforce a contract between husband and wife, founded on the consideration of her relinquishing her right to dower, or joining in a sale of her real property;\u2014 in like manner as if she were a feme sole. Itlias long been settled not to be necessary to interpose trustees, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The Court will set up the contract, tho\u2019 void at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-13\">As to the agreement in this case, the testimony is clear; and the Statute of Frauds does not apply, the contract having been executed on one side,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-14\">\n<em>Leigh contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE\">The proof of the agreement, I admit, is sufficient; but the question, is, will the Court enforce it? The property of Mrs. <em>Tucker </em>sold for 4 8Z. only; that afterwards purchased by her husband, was ten or twenty-times its value. And that property, so much more valuable, is what she claims;\u2014not to be paid her 48Z., with interest. Is this claim reasonable? Surely a more unreasonable one was never exhibited. The Chancellor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>right in dismissing the bill altogether. I know of no instance of an executory contract, for a sale from husband to wife, being enforced iii equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-5\">Wick/tam in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay\">All contracts are executory when first made.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> iuadeq~tacy of consideration is not sufficient to vitiate a fair contract. Besides; it appears by the record, that the husband, in the present case, had not a shilling on earth hut what he got by the wife. This circumstance repels the objection of hardship. The truth is, lie chose to lay out her money for her benefit. It is not pretended that there are any creditors; and, if there were, their claims would not be affected by any decree between these parties.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b22-5\"> 1 <em>Fonbl. </em>102\u20143; 3 P. <em>Wms. </em>337, <em>Slanning </em>v. <em>Style; Ibid </em>339, <em>Calmady </em>v. <em>Calmady.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b23-22\"> Moore v.

For this c~nse, the Decree is to be reversed, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
