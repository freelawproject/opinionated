One of the Counsel made oaths that he believed the plaintiff to be a resident of the town of Portsmouth in this State; that he had received letters from him dated there, ai~d addressed him there; that, on account of the distance at which he resided from the Court, the Counsel had promised to have the Witnesses, one residine; in Petersburg and the other at City Point in Prince George County, regularly subpmnaed for him; that, in performance of that promise, he gave a written memorandum to the Clerk of the Court to issue Subpmnas to the Sheriff for Josiah Thomas, and to the Serjemit of Petersburg for James ~. Chalmers; that he had twice seen the said Thomas attending the Court as a witness, when the cause was not called; and, from a conversation between them, consider. ed him a material witness, and indeed regarded his cvideuce as sufficient to sustain this action; that, in July last, when a special term of the Court was to have been ho]den, but was not, the said Thomas informed the sai~l Counsel of his probable removal to Norfolk or Hampton; and that the said Counsel gave him a blank subpmna, which he, the witness, promised to have executed if he did remove; a fact of which the Counsel was yet ignorant:-that, on the morning appointed for the trial, the said Counsel was informed, for the first time, that the other witness, (who was stated by the plaintiff to be the most material,) had removed from Petersburg to Tennessee; and that he knew of no other witness in Peters-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>burg, wlio could prove the claim; and had had no communication with the plaintiff since July last. The Clerk of the Court also deposed, that it was his general rule to deliver subpoenas, &amp;c., to the Sheriff and Serjeant, or to leave them at a store in Petersburg, where the Sheriff frequently called, and requested them to be left; and, therefore, without any particular recollection of this case, he believed the subpoenas to have issued accordingly. The Sheriff also stated that said <em>Thomas </em>had removed from City Point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">But, there being no proof of the <em>receipt </em>of the Subpoenas by the Sheriff of Prince George, or of any having been directed to the Sheriff of any other County, the Court refused to continue the cause:\u2014to which opinion the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\">Verdict, &amp; Judgment for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ats\">The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-7\">By this Court,</author>\n<p id=\"ALIu\">the Judgment was reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
