That the testator devised lands and slaves of considerable value to his said sons; and being possessed of a great personal estate, and having debts outstanding, more than sufficient, as he supposed, to pay his debts, as well as of a large tract of land in <em>Bedford, </em>containing upwards of 50,000 acres, <em>then unpatented. </em>He devised all the <em>residuum </em>of his estate (which included the said tract of unpatented land) to be equally divided between his said four sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">That the said <em>Richard, </em>the son, qualified as executor; received the profits of a considerable part of the estate allotted to the younger sons; collected the debts due the testator; and sold the said tract of unpatented land; but never made up any account of his administration; nor did he ever account with his brothers, for their proportion of the residuary estate, although considerable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">That the said <em>John Randolph </em>being very young, at the death of the testator, lived with the said <em>Richard </em>his brother, for many years; and some time after he came of age. That the said <em>Richard </em>received the rents, and profits of his estate, furnished him with suitable and necessary things, and probably made him advances in money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-9\">That on the 3d of <em>April, </em>1764, the said <em>John Randolph </em>gave the said <em>Richard, </em>his bond, for 635/. 15s. <em>Id. </em>current money; but the plaintiff has reason to believe, that this bond did not include a full and final settlement of all their accounts, to that period; but was rather intended as an evidence of the advances, made by the said <em>Richard </em>to the said <em>John; </em>subject nevertheless to a further settlement, when the accounts of the estate of the said <em>Richard Ran</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>dolph, </em>the elder, should be made up. For, the said <em>John ' Randolph, </em>having entered into an agreement with Messrs. <em>Capel 8? Ozgood Hanbury </em>of <em>London, </em>for a loan of 4,000/. sterling, the said <em>John Randolph, </em>out of that sum, paid the said <em>Capel 8?

In which suit, the <em>said-David Meade Randolph, </em>afterwards, obtained judgment in the District Court, in <em>April, </em>1790, for 1,271/. 10s. <em>2d. </em>and costs: Which he threatens to enforce without any deduction; although the said <em>John-Randolph </em>never received any satisfaction for the said 960/ 13s. <em>6d. </em>paid <em>Capel 8? Ozgood Hanbury </em>as aforesaid, as the plaintiff believes; nor hath the said <em>Richard Randolph's </em>administration account ever been made up, so as to ascertain, whether any thing was due thereout, to the said <em>John Randolph.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">That the plaintiff hath requested the said <em>David Meade Randolph </em>to account concerning the administration aforesaid; to give credit for the said 960/. 13s. <em>6d. </em>sterling, paid <em>Capel fy Ozgood Hanbury. </em>and to let a full and fair settlement of all accounts between their testators, take place. But he refuses to do so, insisting that the said sum of 1,271/. 10s. <em>2d. </em>is not subject to any deduction, and that the said <em>John Randolph </em>had no set-off against thesaidbond; although the plaintiff alledges, that the bond having lain more than twenty years, without any claim made thereon, affords a strong presumption, that some right to a discount did exist: And, as the payment to the said <em>Capel fy Oz-good Hanbury, </em>was made some years subsequent to the date of the said bond; and to discharge a debt properly payable by the said <em>Richard </em>in his character of executor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>out of the estate of his testator, which was amply sufficient for the purpose; as the account of his administration had never been made up; and as the receipt granted to the said <em>John Randolph, </em>for the money paid to the said <em>Danbury a </em>expresses (as the plaintiff hath been informed and believes,) that it was to discharge a debt due from the estate of <em>Richard Randolph </em>the elder, and was subsequent in date to the bond, the plaintiff has no doubt but that some such settlement as above mentioned, was to have been made between the said <em>John </em>and <em>Richard-, </em>which might have been prevented by the death of <em>John, </em>and the succeeding confusion occasioned bjr the war; and might have been further interrupted by misplacing of the receipt, the existence of which the plaintiff doubts not, and trusts he shall be able to prove, as well as the payment of the said 960/. 13s. <em>6d. </em>sterling, in manner above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">The bill therefore prays a full answer to the premises, interrogates the defendant <em>David Meade Randolph, </em>as to the consideration of the said bond, the payment of the said 960/. 135. <em>6d. </em>sterling, and the consideration of the assignment to himself: It likewise prays a full settlement of all accounts between the said <em>John </em>and <em>Richard, </em>as well those of a private nature, as those which may relate to the estate of <em>Richard Randolph </em>the elder: that credit may be allowed the said <em>John Randolph, </em>for the said 960/. 135. <em>6d. </em>sterling, with interest from the time of payment: that the defendants may-make up an account of their testator\u2019s administration, on the estate of the said <em>Richard Randolph </em>the elder, and credit be allowed the said. <em>John Randolph </em>for his proportion of the residuary estate, if any; that the said <em>David Mead,e Randolph </em>may be injoined from further proceedings on his judgment; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">To this bill <em>Jerman Baker </em>made an affidavit, <em>\u201c </em>That some time previous to the late war, about the year 1774; he thinks he was appointed, by an order of <em>Henrico </em>Court, a commissioner to examine the account of the administration of <em>Richard Randolph </em>upon the of his father <em>Richard Randolph, </em>the elder. Progress was made in the settlement; but in consequence of the interruption occasioned by the war, the same was not finished; nor doth he believe, that an account of the administration aforesaid was ever made up, and rendered by the said <em>Richard Randolph; </em>nor any settlement made with his brothers <em>Brett, Ryland </em>and <em>John, </em>who were interested in the estate of <em>Richard Randolph </em>the elder.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The answer of <em>David Meade Randolph </em>states, that the said <em>Richard Randolph </em>his father, a little before his death (in consequence of the defendant having been his security for several sums, and also for his administration of <em>Ryland Randolph\u2019s </em>estate, and having also paid for him <em>\u00a3 ,) </em>assigned the said bond to the defendant, on the 3d of March, 17S5, to the use, expressed in the assignment, but the same was intended as an indemnity to the defendant for his security-ships and advance aforesaid. That his father was executor, and he believes sole acting executor of the said <em>Richard Randolph </em>the elder; but, believes the said <em>John </em>was entitled to nothing, or very little, as one of the residuary legatees, for the defendant has often heard his father say, that after the testator\u2019s debts were paid, there was nothing to divide; except a debt due from Colonel <em>R. Bland, </em>and from his brother <em>Brett Randolph, </em>the amount of which the defendant does not know, but the same were never received. That the defendant knows not \u25a0 whether the <em>Bedford </em>lands were ever patented, or sold by his father, in short he knows nothing about them; but, when the defendant was in that, county, he understood they were barren, and not worth 6c?. <em>per </em>acre. That the said <em>John </em>lived with the defendant\u2019s father, until his marriage; which 'was some time after he came of age. That he was an expensive young man, and the testator furnished him with very large sums of money from time to time; and imported goods for him, to a great amount, from year to year, as appears by the annexed account, from the books of the said <em>Richard; </em>and by which, in 1762, there was a balance due the testator of 645/. 15s. <em>Id. </em>That the said account is carried down to 1769, when the balance due was 641/. 13s. 11$; and, by inspecting the account, it appears, that the said <em>Richard </em>continued to make advances to him, and has credited him for considerable sums, but the balance almost always continuing nearly the amount of the bond. That it is probable the said <em>Richard </em>never may have made up any account of his administration, on the estate of the said <em>Richard </em>the elder; but the said John, who had attained his age of 21 years, some time before the bond was given, never would have entered into it, if he had not been satisfied that his brother <em>Richard, </em>as executor of his father, owed him nothing; and at this distance of time a Court of Equity will presume so, unless there was any suggestion, or proof of undue influence; for which there is not the smallest ground, ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>iher from the character, or conduct of the said <em>Richard. </em>That, although, the estates devised the said <em>John, </em>were considerable, yet it is well known, that <em>Virginia </em>estates, at a distance, are not profitable; that the said <em>Richard's </em>under his own eye, were not so; and, it is probable, that the expenses of the said <em>John, </em>were more than the profits of his estate. That as to the length of time, which elapsed after the date of the bond, before any steps were taken, with respect thereto, it was to be observed, that the said <em>John </em>was the brother of the said <em>Richard; </em>who always had an aversion to quarrel, as well as to bring suit against his brother, Besides, eight or nine years of the time were during the war; near six of which are, by the act of Assembly, but one day; so, that no conclusive argument is to be drawn, from the length of time. That, instead of a deduction for the 960/. 13s. 6iZ. sterling, the defendant is advised a contrary conclusion ought to he drawn; because, the said <em>John Randolph </em>must, at the time of executing the said mortgage, have been, at least, 26 or 27 years of age; had been some years married, and must have known, whether it was incumbent on him, to have secured that sum to the <em>Hanburys, </em>and therefore took upon himself to pay the amount of his fathers debt to the house.. Which assertion is corroborated by an account from the house of <em>John Hanbury </em>-\u00a7* <em>Go. </em>dated in 175 j by which, there was then due to the said house, a balance of 493/. 10s. <em>8d. </em>from the estate of the said <em>John, </em>arising, as the defendant presumes, for necessaries imported for the use of his estate; and, it cannot be presumed, that the said <em>John </em>would have given his bond for 600/. if nothing was due from him; and afterwards mortgaged his estate, for upwards of 900/. sterling, if not due also. That the facts, stated in the bill, appear to be the suggestions of <em>Jerman Baker; </em>who knew a great deal of the transactions <em>between the </em>said <em>John </em>and <em>Richard; </em>and to whom the defendant shewed the bond before he brought suit. That <em>Baker </em>looked at it for some time, as if endeavouring to recollect the transaction, and then observed, that he was satisfied the money was due, and must be paid; or words to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\">In <em>June, </em>1796, general replication and commissions;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">In <em>January, 1797, </em>the cause was set for hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">There is, in the record, a copy of the will of <em>Richard Randolph, </em>the elder, dated the 18th <em>o\u00ed December, </em>1747\u00b0 and proved and recorded in' <em>June, </em>1749.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>There is also a copy of the mortgage from <em>John R\u00e1ndolph </em>to the <em>Hanburys, </em>dated the 22d of <em>February, </em>1768.

Added to which, the profits of <em>John Randolph\u2019s </em>own estate, must have been very great, during his long minority; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>and it ought to be shewn, how they were disposed of. Besides, the great payment made to the <em>Hanburys, </em>on account of the estate, several years after the bond was given, entitled the plaintiff to a discount for that sum; and ought to have been so applied. At least a further opportunity of enquiring into the matter, ought to have been afforded the plaintiff, by sending the cause to account, before a commissioner. The antiquity of the bond, moreover, affords a strong presumption of its being satisfied. Otherwise, it is not easy to conceive, why it was suffered to remain so long, without payment having been enforced or even demanded. The account in the record related to another <em>John Randolph, </em>and not to this <em>John Randolph; </em>who, by reason of his tender years, could have liad no account against him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-6\"><em>Call </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-7\">An account would have been improper, after so great a distance of time, when the circumstances must all have been forgotten, and the evidences lost. For, as on the one hand the payments cannot be known, so on the other, the property, debts, and transactions, must have escaped all recollection: Insomuch, that perhaps the delivery of a single slave, or any other article, could not now be shewn The Court, therefore, will not, at this day, indulge an enquiry into such stale matters. <em>[Hercy </em>v. <em>Dinwoody,] </em>4 Bro. C. C. 258. Which ease expressly applies. For, here the testator has lain by, and suffered the estate to be distributed, and then the appellant, in the language of the Judge there, comes forward to demand an account, after the right has been so long <em>slept </em>on, of transactions originating above half a century ago. The granting of which request, would expose the appellees to every possible inconvenience. But, the bond is a presumption of a settlement, until the contrary is shewn; and the long acquiescence afterwards confirms the presumption; especially as the mortgage itself would have been an incitement to demand it. Added to which, <em>Richard Randolph, </em>whose character is not impeached, assigned this bond to his own son, as a security; and it is not probable that he would have done so, if he had not considered it as actually due. The mortgage was a transaction between <em>John Randolph </em>and the <em>Hanburys, </em>and, therefore, strictly speaking, is no evidence against <em>Richard Randolph: </em>But, al= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>lowing it the fullest force, yet it was probably no more than <em>John Randolph\u2019s </em>own share of the debt due from the estate; and, although the mortgage states it as money <em>borrowed, </em>that was merely the mistake of the writer; and proves nothing. Besides, the bond is due to <em>Richard Randolph, </em>in his own right; and, the sum mentioned in the mortgage, was a debt due from the estate. So that the mortgage could not form a proper discount against the bond. . The uncertainty, in all these matters, is alone sufficient to repel the application for an account; because, it proves how unsatisfactory the enquiry must be, and to what difficulties it would expose the parties against whom it is prayed. The antiquity of the bond was a proper subject for the consideration of the jury; and they have decided it in favor of the creditor. Besides, the delay to sue upon the bond, is accounted for, by the answer; and was owing to the family connection, and the friendship between the brothers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-5\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-6\">If the appellees would be under any difficulties in taking the account, it is the fault of their own testator; who ought to have come to a settlement at an earlier period. But, as it is not stated that any vouchers are lost, it does not appear that there would be any inconvenience in taking the account. If it were true, that the bond was given for transactions between <em>John Randolph </em>and <em>Richard Randolph, </em>yet, the debt, taken up by the mortgage, was more than sufficient to pay it, and ought so to be applied.
