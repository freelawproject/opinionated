M\u2019Clintic, </em>who assigned it to <em>S. Dunn, </em>who assigned it to <em>J. Withrow; </em>that./. <em>Withrow </em>brought debt . . \u00b0 on the bond against <em>W, Withrow </em>and <em>J. SJceggs, </em>the obligors, in which action, it being proved that the obligors had paid off the debt to <em>Masterton </em>before he assigned the bond to <em>Callison, </em>a verdict and judgment were rendered for the obligors; and that thereupon, <em>Callison </em>paid \u00ab/. <em>Withrow </em>the assignee, the debt due by the bond and interest thereon accrued, and costs by him incurred in his suit against the obligors, amounting to 160 dollars ; by reason whereof <em>Mays </em>became liable to pay <em>Callison </em>the sum of 160 dollars, and so being liable, in consideration thereof, assumed the payment thereof to him &amp;c. To this special count, were added general counts, for the price of the horse ; for money paid, laid out and expended, by the plaintiff for the defendant\u2019s use; for money lent and advanced; and for money had and received. Plea, the general issue. On the trial, the jury found a verdict for the plaiuliiT for 148 dollars with interest &amp;c. The defendant moved for a new trial, on the ground, that the verdict was against evidence ; but the court overruled the motion, and gave the plaintiff judgment j and the defendant hied a bill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to grant the new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\">This bill of exceptions stated, that \u201c the facts which appeared on the trial were as follows That <em>Callison </em>proposed to sell a horse to <em>Mays, </em>and <em>Mays </em>agreed to give him 160 dollars for the horse, 60 dollars to be paid by <em>Mays, </em>and the residue, 100 dollars, by the transfer of a bond for that amount, executed by <em>W. Withrow </em>and ./. <em>SJceggs </em>to <em>Masterton, </em>payable at a future day, which bond was then held by <em>Mays, </em>though <em>Masterton </em>had not assigned it to him, and <em>Mays </em>was to procure an assignment of the bond by <em>Masterton </em>to <em>Callison; </em>and that the bargain being concluded, <em>Mays </em>procured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>an assignment of the bond by <em>Masterton </em>to <em>Callison, </em>which <em>Callison </em>received, and the horse was delivered to <em>Mays. </em>The bill of exceptions then stated, \u201c that the witness\u201d (meaning the witness who had proved the facts above stated) \u201c had no further recollection of what passed at the bargain: and that another witness stated\u201d the same facts in substance; and stated further, that <em>Callison </em>agreed to take the bond with <em>Masterton's </em>assignment thereof to him, which <em>Mays </em>was to procure, without any responsibility of or recourse against <em>Mays </em>whatever : that both parties were well acquainted with <em>Masterton; </em>he was <em>Callison!s </em>uncl\u00e9: that nothing was said, at the time, as to the solvency of the obligors or of the assignor, or about the bond having been discharged; and that <em>Callison </em>had admitted, that he thought <em>Masterton </em>solvent, at the time of the transaction. The bill of exceptions proceeded to state, that the assignments of the bond, by <em>Callison </em>to <em>M'Clintic, </em>by <em>M'Clintic </em>to <em>Dunn, </em>and by <em>Dunn </em>to <em>J. </em>Withrow,\u2014the suit on the bond by this last assignee against the obligors,\u2014and the verdict and judgment therein for the obligors, on the ground that the debt had been paid by them to <em>Masterton, </em>before notice of <em>Masterton's </em>transfer to <em>Mays, </em>or assignment to Callison,\u2014appeared by the record of that <em>suit: </em>that it also appeared, that <em>Masterton </em>was insolvent; and. that <em>Callison </em>had paid <em>J. Withrow </em>the debt for which he was liable by his assignment of the bond. That the court overruled the motion for a new trial, because it was the province of the jury to judge, whether <em>Callison's </em>agreement to take the bond, with <em>Masterton's </em>assignment thereof to him, without any recourse to <em>Mays, </em>extended further than to the solvency of the obligors and the assignor <em>Masterton, </em>and had respect to the circumstance of the bond having been paid, <em>or </em>being otherwise void, at the time of the transfer; and if the jury found from the facts, that the contract had no respect to the fact of the bond having been paid, or being otherwise void, the verdict was right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>s </em>excepted to this opinion, and a judgment to this court. ppealed from the</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AlV\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Nicholas </em>for the appedant, and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5J\">I. The first point was, whether the bill of exceptions was well taken ? <em>Johnson </em>objected, that even in the first part of it, in which it professed to state the <em>facts </em>that appeared on the trial, it was obvious that it only stated the <em>testimony </em>of the first witness ; and then it proceeded, in express terms, to detail the <em>testimony </em>of another witness. The following cases were cited; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>6 Munf. 125. <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 Leigh 340. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>2 Id. 337. <em>Jackson\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>3 Id. 196. and the recent case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Ashby, </em>reported <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A90\">II. Upon <em>the </em>merits, <em>Nicholas </em>said, there was no proof of fraud on the part of <em>Mays, </em>and no imputation of the kind. It was apparent from all the circumstances of the transaction, that <em>Mays </em>had no reason to apprehend that the bond had been paid off to <em>Mastcrton, </em>and that all he intended to transfer, was the bond itself, with the security of <em>Mastertoris </em>assignment, without recourse to him in any <em>event; </em>and that <em>Callison </em>intended to take the bond upon the credit of <em>Masterton\u2019s </em>assignment and responsibility. <em>Masterlon </em>was still undoubtedly liable for the money, upon the contract of assignment; and it was immaterial, as between <em>Callison </em>and <em>Mays, </em>whether <em>Masterlon </em>was solvent or not, for the plain purpose of the contract was to exempt <em>Mays </em>from liability, in ca,se <em>Masterton </em>should prove insolvent. He cited <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>M\u2019Donald, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 189. where an agreement for the conveyance of lands was assigned by <em>Cranford </em>to <em>M\u2019Donald, </em>without recourse, accompanied by a delivery of a paper purporting to be a grant, with certificates as to the quality of the land, and the goodness of the title; and it turned out afterwards, that ail these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>papers were forgeries; yet, there being no proof of fraud, or knowledge of fraud on <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>part, it was held that he was not liable to the assignee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-8\"><em>Johnson </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxK\">that <em>Callison </em>took the bond, not upon the credit of the assignor alone, but upon the credit of the obligors as well as of the assignor; that neither party contracted with a view to the fact that the bond had been already paid off to the obligee; that <em>Callison </em>did not intend to taire, nor <em>Mays to </em>impose on him, any risk of that kind, but only the risk of the insolvency of the obligors and assignor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b250-9\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AeY\">This is an appeal from the refusal of the circuit court to grant a new trial, asked on the ground, that the verdict was contrary to evidence: and the first question raised in the argument, is, whether the bill of exceptions was well taken ? whether the statement therein given by the circuit court, is 'a state of the <em>facts </em>proved at the trial, or only of the <em>evidence </em>? I feel pretty confident, that the judge meant it as a state of <em>the facts; </em>that is, that he did not intend to set down any fact, which he did not consider as a fact proved, though his manner of stating the <em>facts, </em>may make it seem, in some parts, like a statement of <em>evidence. </em>The judge refused the new trial, because he thought <em>it </em>was the province of the jury to decide, whether <em>Callison, </em>in taking the bond with <em>Mastertor\u00fas </em>assignment to him, without recourse to <em>Mays, </em>meant to take upon himself all risks, and among others, that of the bond having been, at the time of the assignment, already paid off? or only to take the risk of the insolvency of the obligors and of the assignor ? And it is most clear, that it was the province of the jury to decide this question; for they were to judge of the whole contract, and this was of the very essence of it. The true question for the judge, and for us, is, whether in deciding that the plaintiff' only meant to take the risk of insolvency, the verdict is contradicted by the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>(lence ? And here, it is well to recollect what this court has said in other cases, and especially, in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>3 Call 309. that \u201c a new trial, because the verdict is contrary to evidence, ought to be granted, only in a case of a plain deviation, and not in a doubtful one, merely because the court, if on the jury, would have given a different verdict; since that would be to assume the province of the jury, whom the law has appointed the triers.\u201d Is this verdict then plainly contradicted by the evidence ? I cannot say so. On the contrary, I strongly incline to think the jury was right. Here was a man selling a horse, for which he asked 160 dollars ; we are not told that this was an extravagant price. A bond for .100 dollars is offered in part: it purports to be for so much money, under the hands and seals of the parties. The holder says, \u201c I will get this bond assigned to you by the obligee, but then you must take it without recourse to me.\u201d What was the meaning of this proposition ? What was the risk in the contemplation of the parties ? for this makes the contract. I think it was this : \u201c here is the evidence of a debt of 100 dollars, at this time owing from <em>Withrow </em>and <em>Skeggs </em>to <em>Masterton; Masterton </em>shall assign to <em>you; </em>and thus you cannot lose <em>your </em>money, unless a,11 three of them should prove insolvent; this risk you must run; and this risk (says the other party) I am willing to run.\u201d How can we suppose, that it occurred to the mind of either, that there was any other risk ? The very possession of the bond, the claiming it as property, as something binding the obligors, precluded the idea that it was at that moment discharged, or satisfied; for then it was no bond; it bound nobody; it was not the representative of money. The bond too, was payable at a future date: who could have dreamed, that it was already mere wax and paper,\u2014not a cent due on it ? I hold, then, that this contract was made on the basis, that the bond was unpaid, and that this risk did not enter into the contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>But if this be not clearly so, we must all agree, that it is at least doubtful, whether this risk was contemplated; \u00e1nd that the jury has not committed so palpable a breach of propriety, has not gone so directly in the teeth of the facts proved, as to justify us in saying the court did wrong in refusing the new trial. I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The other judges concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
