That afterwards, to wit, on the 13th of <em>November, </em>1790, the defendant appointed <em>Jonathan Purcell </em>of the said county, one of his deputies. That the said <em>Purcell </em>on the 13th of <em>November, </em>took the oath of office as deputy' Sheriff for the defendant, who thereby became liable for his conduct as deputy Sheriff That the said <em>Purcell, </em>afterwards, on the 1st of January, 1792, in order to injure the plaintiff, at the county aforesaid, sundry horses, the property of the plaintiff\u2019 of fifty pounds, drove or procured them to be driven upon the land of <em>James Mercer, </em>where <em>Samuel Bonnifield </em>then lived as tenant, in order that he the said <em>Jonathan </em>might levy a <em>distress warrant </em>upon the said property as deputy Sheriff, which he did, and afterwards, to wit; on the day and year last mentioned sold the said horses, the property of the plaintiff of the value aforesaid, to the plaintiffs damage 100/.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">The defendant pleaded <em>not guilty; </em>and issue. Verdict for 30/. and the Court gave judgment accordingly. The plaintiff then released 10s. of the damages; and, thereupon, the defendant filed a plea in arrest of judgment, which assigned the following reasons; 1. Because, -the defendant was not sued as late High Sheriff. 2. Because, the defendant is not legally liable as Sheriff for the conduct of <em>Purcell. </em>The County Court overruled the plea in arrest of judgment, and <em>confirmed </em>their first judgment. <em>The </em>defendant. offered to appeal to the District Court; but, the County Court refused to permit him to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-10\">The District Court granted a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; and totally reversed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-11\">Whereupon, <em>James </em>appealed to this Court</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-12\">Williams, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The first point stated in the petition for the <em>supersedeas </em>is very clear against the defendant; and the second is equally so. It is a rule, that the Sheriff shall answer <em>civilly </em>for all the acts of his deputy. 6 <em>Com. </em>Dig. 416; [Buller, J. in <em>Woodgate </em>v. <em>Knatchbull,] 2 </em>T. R. 156. In this case, the deputy acted as deputy, when he drove\" the property on the land, in order to make distress; for, it was like taking one man\u2019s goods under an execution against another. <em>[Sanderson </em>v. <em>Baker </em>et al.] 3 Wil. 309, 317; <em>[Ackworth </em>v. <em>Kempe,] </em>Dougl 40. The act.of 1748 directs, that the Sheriff shall advertise, in order that the owner may claim; but, here, <em>it </em>was omitted and the deputy sold the property on the same day, on which he took it. This was expressly contrary to the act of Assembly; which requires that the property shall be sold in the same manner as if it had been taken under a <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-9\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b252-10\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AmR\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">(* <em>Moore's adm\u2019r. </em>v <em>Dawney </em>et al. <em>3 </em>H, &amp; M. <em>127; Hazard </em>v. <em>Israel, 1 </em>Binney, 240; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Phelps 17 </em>Mass.
