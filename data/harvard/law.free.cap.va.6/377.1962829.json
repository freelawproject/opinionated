that various impediments, (detailed at large in the Bill,) among which was the pendency of several suits in Chancery, the result whereof was uncertain, and upon which the <em>quantum, </em>of assets depended, had prevented their pleading fully administered; that their Counsel informed them, when the trial was about to come on, that he could not, while the amount of the assets was so uncertain, put in that plea for them, and advised them that, at all events, they would be protected by the Act of Assembly, passed the 13th of January 1807, entitled, <em>\u201can Act concerning the abatement of suits, and Executors and Administrators-\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that in the subsequent suit suggesting a <em>devastavit, </em>they were ruled into trial in the absence of the Counsel who had attended to the greater part of their business for the estate in the Court, and on whose attention they principally relied for their defence, notwithstanding their motion for a continuance upon the ground that he was at the time gone to Kentucky; and, under these circumstances, judgment was obtained against them, notwithstanding such of the intestate\u2019s effects as were not contested, had actually been applied to, or were bound by, claims of superior dignity to that of <em>Stuart, </em>as would appear by the Commissioner\u2019s report, in another suit, referred to and made an Exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-13\">Chancellor Tayyor granted the Injunction, upon the terms of the Complainants\u2019 confessing judgment upon a forthcoming bond, and executing the usual release of er* rors at law\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The answer of <em>Stuart </em>stated that the judgment in his favour had been transferred to <em>MiCoull; </em>and that of <em>M\u2018Cmll, </em>relied upon the Estoppel created, at law, by the original judgment upon the plea of <em>\u201c payment\u201d as proof </em>that they had in their hands assets sufficient to discharge the same; and upon the return of <em>nulla bona </em>as <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the <em>devastavit: </em>remarking, too, that the involved situation of their intestate\u2019s affairs, if such as the complainants represented, might have been urged with propriety as a ground for the continuance of the <em>original </em>suit; and, if a motion to that effect had been made and overruled, they might, as the respondent was advised, have had relief \u201c <em>in a Superior Court of </em>law, <em>or, at least, in a Court of Equity; </em>or, if the Complainants had shewn the difficulties and embarrassments mentioned in their bill, and that they had no assets, during the pendency of <em>that </em>action, they might <em>then </em>have applied to a Court of Equity to restrain proceedings at law, until a reasonable time had been allowed them to examine the situation of their intestates\u2019 affairs; or they might have compelled the plaintiff in that action to take a judgment, <em>when assets, </em>and thus have thrown the burthen of proof upon <em>him, </em>to shew, at any future time, that assets had come to their hands: but, instead of this, they thought proper to rely on the plea of <em>payment! </em>The difficulties in relation to the mode of proceeding, seemed to this respondent altogether imaginary. If the complainants had no <em>notice, </em>at the date of the original judgment, of the existence of claims of superior dignity sufficient to consume the assets, they were bound to discharge th\u00e9 said judgment, and plead the same in bar to suits subsequently instituted: if they <em>had notice </em>prior to that judgment, they ought to have pleaded those claims in bar; shewn that they were sufficient to swallow up the assets; and given a judgment, <em>when assets. </em>But, even if the complainants might have availed themselves of the ground of relief set forth in their bill against the <em>original </em>judgment, it was too late to rely upon such grounds after a suit had been prosecuted on that judgment, suggesting a <em>devastavit, </em>and a judgment obtained against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>them on the plea of \u201c <em>no waste.\u201d </em>As to the pretence that they were improperly ruled into a trial in the absence of their Counsel, if the Court erred in this respect, it was competent to a superior Court <em>of law </em>to correct the error: but the fact was, that, although one ^ie Counsel employed by them was absent, they had counsel present in Court, of long standing at the bar, retained in their behalf a considerable time before the trial, and every way qualified to defend them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-4\">The Chancellor dissolved the Injunction, and, notwithstanding <em>affidavits </em>afterwards filed in support of <em>the </em>Bill, refused to re-instate it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">The affidavit of <em>William Marshall </em>stated, that, soon after administration was granted on the estate of <em>John </em>Pendleton, the Complainants employed the deponent to attend to the business of the estate in the County Court of Henifico and Hustings Court of the City of Richmond; when a great number of suits were soon instituted; . that, upon conversation with the complainants or some of them, he was informed that the assets were in a very embarrassed situation, in consequence of difficulties about, the title to sundry certificates, for services and supplies rendered the public, found in the said <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>possession, and claimed by other persons and the Commonwealth, on which suits were instituted, and an unsettled administration account of the estate of <em>Mr. Heitman, </em>on the favorable termination of which suits the ability of the Complainants to pay the demands against them, then in suit, depended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The deponent <em>thinks </em>that, under these circumstan- <em>\u201c </em>ces, <em>he obtained a continuance </em>of the causes, but, at a \u00ab subsequent Court, not being able to state the proba- <em>\u201c </em>ble time when the difficulties would be removed, he was <em>\u201c compelled to go to the trial of the cases then </em>ready, wfiiich \u00ab he felt little reluctance in doing, as he felt satisfied \u00ab that the defendants at law would not be subjected to \u00ab the payment of more than the assets which really came \u00ab to their hands, although judgment to a greater amount might be rendered against them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Asd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The affidavit of charles copland stated, that he ~vas employed as an assistant Counsel to William Jfarshall, by the administrators of John Pemdletom~ to defend them in a suit brought against them by .N~orrnan Stuart, in the Court of Henrico, suggesting a deDastavit; that the cause was set for trial at a time when William Marshall was absent on a journey from home; that the deponent moved the Court for a continuance on the ground of Mr. Marshall's absence, who was the Counsel relied on, and had been engaged in the defence of the suits brought against the administrators; but the Court refused to grant the continuance. r1~l~e deponent stated to the Court that it was a cause of great importance to the defendants; that he had been only employed to aid in the defence; that lie was unacquainted with the merits of the case, and wholly unable to go into the trial; and that, if the Court WoUld not continue the case, he should withdraw himself from the suit: but the Court was inexorable. The deponent then directed his name to be stricken from the docket; and the cause was tried and determined without any defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASH\">Upon a Petition, an appeal from the decree was granted by this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AtL3\">Call for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aup\">observed, that lie never knew a case, until the present, in which an Executor, who in fact had fully administered, was refused relief in Equity.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Where the Court below ought to have granted a continuance, this Court has repeatedly decided the judgment not to be binding. The d'officulty and length of the plea of fully administered, is a good excuse for not putting it in. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The circumstance that the Court of law has jurisdiction, does not always take away that of the Court of Equity; but the jurisdictions of both are concurrent:-especiahly, where the Court of Equity once gets jurisdiction, it does not lose it on the ground that the Court of law has it also. In many cases, therefore, Equity gives a defendant relief, though he might have obtained it, at law, if he had pleaded; as in the cases of gaming, ~isury, and the like.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3yR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Is a plaintiff entitled, in conscience, to the benefit of a judgment, for assets which the executor never received?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac5\">Whether a new account was necessary, or not, seems doubtful. According to the British authorities, an account taken in any one cause, may be read as evidence in. another, if no exception be taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\"><em>Wickham </em>on the same side, referred to <em>Price\u2019s ex\u2019or. </em>v. <em>Fuqua\u2019s ad\u2019mr., </em>4 <em>Munf. </em>68, as shewing that the appellants ought not to be prejudiced, even if their Counsel were <em>mistaken </em>as to the proper defence at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANQ\"><em>William Hay, </em>jr. contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqX\">It is not true that, when this judgment was obtained, there were no assets to satisfy it. The act of Assembly indeed made the Decree, directing the <em>residuum </em>in <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>hands, as administrator of <em>Heitman, </em>to be paid to the Commonwealth, there being no distributees, a debt of the first dignity\u00bb but <em>Hopkirk\u2019s </em>claim as a <em>creditor, </em>against <em>Pendleton </em>executor of <em>Gunn, </em>does not appear to be of superior dignity to our\u2019s. A claim against an executor for a <em>devastavit </em>is, in England, a simple contract debt. In this country, I admit it to be a <em>specialty, </em>because the Executor gives bond, and the damages maybe ascertained by the judgment: but, as to <em>creditors, </em>it is no higher than a specialty; for the act of Assembly isnot in favor of <em>creditors, </em>of <em>legatees </em>or <em>distributees </em>only.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The distinction of dignity of debts, is an <em>odious </em>one, and therefore ought to be <em>strictly </em>construed. A large payment too, was made by the administrators to an open account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-11\">I am willing to admit that, notwithstanding mispleading &amp;c. in the <em>original </em>suit, they might have shewn, in the action suggesting the <em>devastavit, </em>that in fact they had no assets. The intention of the Act of 1806 was to remove the estoppel produced by the <em>first </em>judgment. But, surely, it was not intended to give an Executor the unlimited privilege of failing to make <em>any </em>defence at law, and of then going into Equity. After \u00e1 judgment in an action suggesting a <em>devastavit, </em>it is surely too late to ask relief of a Court of Equity on grounds which might have been taken in opposition to <em>that </em>action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-iZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>There was no difficulty in making defence at law in this case. The plaintiff might have been compelled to accept a judgment payable when assets;<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> for the certificates of public debt were, like bonds, only evidences ol debt, and not assets in hand until turned into money; and, besides, a suit was pending to determine whether they belonged to the estate of the intcstatc~ or not. Suppose the Executor had entered, in the hiventory, a negro or horse; might lie not h\u00ecave defended himself at law. by shiewiug a suit of a third person pending against him for the specific property~ The number of claims i~ nothing to the purpose. The administrators ought not to have amused the plaintiff by proceedings at law; but, if necessary, should have filed a bill of conformity in the first instance. Neither is the rejection of their motion for a continuance, any ground for coming into Equity; for they might have excepted to the Court\u2019s opinion, and appealed. In short, every defence now relied upon, might have been made in the second action; in which tiie whole merits came in question, and the plaintiff was bound to prove the defendants guilty of the <em>devastavit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABV\">Cases of gaming and usury are not like this, but founded on special acts of Assembly, making the bonds or other securities, in such cases, <em>idterly void. </em>It is said to be monstrous iniquity to refuse relief to an <em>Execidor, </em>who has no assets. But there is equal hardship in other cases, whenever a defendant has failed to make defence at law, without good'excuse for such neglect. Executors and Administrators are not <em>privileged </em>persons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEi\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply. The circumstance that a contest was pending concerning the right to the certificates, could not be pleaded, nor given in evidence upon a <em>special </em>plea of <em>fully administered. </em>The <em>general </em>plea would not answer the purpose. Certificates are considered assets, as much as Bank notes, which are not <em>money, </em>but are <em>assets, </em>because they can be turned into money. So also is stock in the funds of the United States. Certificates circulate from hand to hand without assignment. The administrators asserted a <em>right </em>to the certificates, which were in their possession:-of course, they could not plead that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>they were not assets. Under such circumstances, no plea could have been filed at law that would have protected them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-11\">The continuance was properly refused. The Court <em>can not </em>compel a plaintiff to take judgment <em>when </em>assets; neither ought it to continue a suit at law <em>ad infinitum </em>on the ground of the pendency of a suit in Chancery; but should leave the party to be protected by the Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-12\"><em>Surprise, mistake, </em>the Court of Chancery\u2019s having jurisdiction, <em>whose decree can not be pleaded at law, </em>are equally arguments for relief, after judgment in the action for the <em>devastavit, </em>as after judgment in the original suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-13\">In this case, the administrators were guilty of no ne' gleet. Their Counsel deserted their cause:\u2014but no defence that could have been made, would have protected them. As the case now stands, it is <em>prima facie </em>apparent that the plaintiff <em>at law ought not to </em>recover.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\"><em> </em>Edit. 1808, c 101, p. 127; R.
