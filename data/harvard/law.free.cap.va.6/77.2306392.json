A clerk was appointed within the year following, and the office thenceforward remained full. Yet the plaintiff in error made no application for the writ of <em>supersedeas, </em>till a lapse of more than ten years from the time when the office of clerk was filled, and more than thirteen years from tho date of the judgment; and then the clerk refused to issue the process. Meanwhile, a <em>fieri facias </em>had been sued out on the judgment; and the sheriff returned, that he had levied it on the debtor\u2019s goods, but that the order of the judge allowing the <em>supersedeas </em>being shewn to him, he applied to the agent of the creditor for a bond to indemnify him for proceeding on the execution, which he refused to give, and thereupon the property was restored to the debtor. About two years after, the plaintiff in error applied to the clerk for the <em>supersedeas, </em>and that officer refused to issue the process; a motion was made to the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>court, to direct the process then to be issued; and the court, on a hearing of both parties, directed the clerk to issue a <em>supersedeas, </em>according to the original order allowing the same. The <em>supersedeas </em>having been issued, and returnec] executed, the circuit court reversed the judgment of the hustings court; from which judgment an appeal was taken to this court, by <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, against whom, on the death of the executors, the proceedings had been revived in the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-4\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellee; no counsel for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-5\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AUh\">The first, and I think, the only question to be considered in this case, is, Whether the <em>supersedeas </em>was properly directed by the circuit court to be issued ? The statute says, that no writ of <em>supersedeas </em>shall be granted to any judgment of a court of law, after five years from the time when the judgment shall be made final: 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 19. p. 492. In <em>Overstreet </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>3 Call 192. it was decided, that the order of the judge or court awarding the writ, was the commencement of the proceedings on the <em>supersedeas, </em>and if that order was within the five years, yet if the <em>supersedeas </em>bond were not given until after the expiration of the five years, so that the writ could not issue till after that lapse of time, yet on the execution of the bond the writ might issue. But the case presented by this record, is different from that. Here, the order was made, and a <em>supersedeas </em>bond immediately executed, in little more than two years after the judgment. But it so happened, that there was no clerk of the court at' that time, so that the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>could not <em>then </em>issue. That vacancy, however, did not continue till the end of the five years. A new clerk was appointed, within a year after the <em>supersedeas </em>was granted; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the office appears to have been constantly full ever since. No proper application was made for the emanation of the writ till after the lapse of more than fi f-teen years from the date of the judgment, and nearly twelve years after there was a clerk, who might have issued it. The appellee having failed for so many years to carry the order into effect, it seems to <em>me </em>that he was in no better situation, than if he had then for the first time applied for his <em>supersedeas, </em>which could not then have been granted. I think that, by analogy to the statute of limitations, the appellee ought not to have been allowed to sue out the writ; that the order was erroneous ; and that the judgment should be reversed, with the costs of both the circuit court and this court, and the <em>supersedeas </em>quashed as improvidently issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Carr and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b95-5\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5G\">Though it was decided in <em>Overstreet </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>that the proceedings on a <em>supersedeas </em>were to be dated from the issuing of the order allowing it, and if that was within the five years prescribed by the statute, the bond might be given, and the writ issued, after lapse of the five years, I think the delay to proceed on the order allowing the <em>supersedeas, </em>in this case, too great to be admitted. If, after the expiration of five years from the date of the final judgment, the law forbids the granting of the order for a <em>supersedeas, </em>I incline to think the obtaining the order for the <em>supersedeas </em>should not authorize a delay to proceed, longer than the period prescribed by the statute for the issuing of the order by the court or the judge. In this case, twelve years were permitted to elapse, after obtaining the order for the <em>supersedeas, </em>and the execution of the <em>supersedeas </em>bond, before application was made for the writ. The circumstance of there being no clerk of the court for a short portion of the time, cannot be admitted as an excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>for such a delay; otherwise, after getting the order, and giving the bond, the delay to proceed might be extended to an unlimited period$ and the object of the statute, limiting the time of proceeding in such cases, would be dgfga^d. I concur in the opinion, that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b96-4\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Ash\">It has been decided by this court, that the order of the judge allowing a <em>supersedeas, </em>is to be taken as the commencement of the proceeding in reference to the operation of the statute of limitations. It is not less true, however, that the order for a <em>supersedeas </em>is not a <em>supersedeas </em>of itself: it is but the declaration of the judge, that it is fit under the circumstances that a <em>supersedeas </em>should <em>issue; </em>and may be recalled by him at any time before it is complied with, if upon consideration he deems it improper or improvident. <em>Ex parte Leicester, </em>6 Ves. 429. <em>Ex parte Layton, </em>Id. 484. Such being the charafcter of the order, it must be admitted to have been by a liberal construction that it was considered as the commencement of the proceeding, so as to avoid the bar of the statute. In this view of it, however, it is reasonable that it should not be unlimited. The law forbids the emanation of a <em>supersedeas </em>after five years have elapsed from the date of the judgment. The order for the <em>supersedeas </em>should, therefore, either be construed to imply a compliance within the limited period, or it should impose a limitation. It' cannot be within the spirit of the statute, to permit the order to be held up for twelve or fifteen years, and then for the first time to be effectually prosecuted. I am inclined to think, that the fair construction of such an order would require the party to sue out the writ, and execute the bond, at a date anterior to the first term to which it could be made returnable. And if this be not done, then a new order should be obtained. If, indeed, as in this case, there was no clerk, then, as the party was not in default, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>it would be competent to direct it to issue <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>provided tbe motion was addressed to the court in due season. But it would be a gross abuse to permit the party, at any length of time however remote, to have his <em>supersedeas, </em>after having so long held up the order of the judge. Admitting that order to have been the commencement of the proceeding, yet upon all the analogies of the law, it can only avoid the statute by being duly prosecuted. A process discontinued or abandoned lias not that effect. Again, the clerk, in this case, having refused to execute the order, considering it abandoned, the motion, I think, must be considered as addressed to the discretion of the court. If so, the motion, after such a lapse of time, should have been denied, for, surely, the party cannot be in a better situation from his neglect. Now, if he had sued out his <em>supersedeas, </em>he must have brought up the record within two terms or his <em>supersedeas </em>would have been dismissed. As the case actually stands, the record is not brought up for more than thirteen years; the cause is not even docketed, for it could not be docketed until there was a writ; and though a bond was given, yet it was obviously ineffectual and vain, since it bound the party to prosecute a writ which had no existence. By exhibiting the order of the judge, he prevailed, on the sheriff to restore the property; and having got it, he is then satisfied, and takes no farther steps in prosecuting his <em>supersedeas. </em>These facts certainly furnish no title to the exercise of the discretion of the court in his favour. I am of opinion, therefore, that the order ought not to have been made; and that the judgment should be reversed, and the <em>supersedeas </em>quashed, as improvidenfly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
