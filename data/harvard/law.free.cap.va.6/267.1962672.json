In this case the circumstances shewn were that the defendant against whom \u25a0 lie decree was rendered, was prevented by <em>mistake </em>and <em>accident </em>from filing his answer, and that, in fact, his title was good to the land in controversy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-14\">Sabah Etswin widow, executrix and devisee of <em>Ed\u25a0ward Erwin </em>deceased, in her own right and as next friend to <em>Hannah Erwin </em>and <em>John Erwin </em>his infant i . dren and devisees, presented a 33x11 to the Superior Court of Chancery for the Staunton District, on the 9th day 0f _ \u201e July 181G, to set aside a decree of the said Court pronoiinced, on the 8th of December 1815, against the said \u00b0 <em>Edward Erwin, </em>in his life time, <em>by default, </em>in consequence of his having failed to answer a Bill exhibited by <em>WilHam Vint </em>against him, with <em>William, John </em>and <em>James Bells </em>defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AMY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The ^ccree *n question, as to the said <em>Edwaril Erwin, </em>required him <em>to execute to the </em>plaintiff <em>Vint </em>a conveyance of a tract of land, with special 'warranty; and permitted the said plaintiff to take peaceable, possession thereof: directing that he be forever quieted in the said possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-4\">As to the <em>Bells, </em>it was decreed, that, on the said plaintiff\u2019s paying or tendering to the defendant <em>William Bell </em>a certain sum of money, the said <em>William Bell </em>should execute to him a deed of bargain and sale for the same tract of land, with special warranty, and covenant to refund the money writh interest, in case the plaintiff should at any time be evicted by a title paramount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">The grounds alledged for setting aside the decree, were, that the defendant <em>Erwin </em>had been prevented at one time by a <em>mistake </em>as to the day of session of the Court, (which had frequently been changed by the Legislature,) and disabled by an <em>accidental </em>hurt to his knee at another time, from attending and filing his answer; and that the Complainant his executrix and devisee was now prepared to shew that, in fact, his title was good to the land, and paramount to any claim on the part of the other defendants <em>William, John </em>and <em>James Bells, </em>or of the plaintiff <em>Vint, </em>neither of whom had any title, in law or equity, to recover the said land, against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">The Bill prayed that <em>Vint </em>should be held to <em>answer; </em>but, without waiting for his answer, notice w'as given that a motion would be made to set aside the decree; and the statement in the Bill for that purpose was supported ~by exhibits and affidavits: but Chancellor Bnowx overruled the motion with Costs; whereupon the Complainant <em>Sarah Erwin </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-7\"><em>Stanard </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgIy\">As a general proposition, it is admitted that, after the term at which a final decree has been rendered, the Court rendering such decree has no power to set it aside or change it, except by bill of review, or on the ground of <em>fraud. </em>But to this proposition there is an exception, where the decree has been by <em>default, </em>and without investigation of the merits.\u2014 Cases of this kind are not within the scope of bills of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>review, nor of bills to set aside decrees obtained by fraud; and therefore it is unnecessary, as it would ho fruitless, to resort to either of <em>those </em>remedies. Yet, in such cases, it is within the sound discretion of the Court, for good cause shewn, to open the decree or the enrollment of it, and let in an enquiry into the merits.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">The decree This exception to the general rule, is supported not only hy authority, hut the soundest reason, being hy <em>default, </em>the cause of the default can <em>never </em>be a subject of enquiry until the decree <em>has been pronounced, </em>and <em>generally </em>not <em>until after the term has past. </em>But the party may have been prevented from asserting his rights in proper time, by insuperable obstacles, without any <em>laches </em>on his part, and may he prepared to shew a clear title to the subject in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-12\">A Bill of Review will not redress the mischief; because that only lies for error apparent <em>on the face </em>of the decree, or for evidence discovered after the decree. A Bill to set aside the decree for fraud will not lie; because the plaintiff obtained it not by fraud, but hy the misfortune of the defendant. It follows therefore that, unless the Court cau give relief upon an application in some other form, a most unjust decree may be rendered, (as in this case,) against a party whose default is perfectly excusable, and yet there can be no redress!</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-13\">\n<em>Leigh contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWqu\">challenged the Counsel for the appellant to produce any other case in which the exception contended for was recognized. He suggested that, in the cases cited, the suit may have been still pending as to some of the parlies, though finally decided and enrolled as to others. He also referred to <em>Mussel </em>v. Morgan, 3 <em>Bro. Ch. cases, </em>74, as tending to establish a different doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-14\"><em>Stanard </em>in reply. The case in 1 <em>Vezey senr. </em>205, was decided with much consideration, upon a search for precedents; and the cases there cited are directly in point. In <em>Robson </em>v. <em>Cranwel, </em>1 <em>Dick. </em>61, the first precedent, the applicant for opening the enrollment was the only plaintiff, and the decree was one dismissing his bill; and, while it does not appear that there was more than one dc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>fondant, yet, if there were many, the dismission of the bill terminated the suit as to all. In <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>3 <em>Bro. Parl. cases, </em>626, and also in the principal case of <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>Squire, </em>there was but one plaintiff and one defendant. I am sure that Mr. <em>Leigh, </em>would not have <em>deliberately </em>hazarded the surmise he has made, even if the cases were not so explicit. For deliberation would have satisfied him, that a decree is never <em>enrolled </em>until the suit is terminated as to <em>all </em>the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">The case from 3 <em>Bro. Ch. cases, does </em>not conflict with that from <em>Vezey. </em>It only shews that a decree obtained by <em>fraud </em>cannot be set aside, on motion, or by <em>petition. </em>And why? Because, fraud or no fraud being the matter .in dispute, both parties are entitled to be heard <em>regularly </em>on that question; and the decree stands or falls as it may be decided. The Court with good reason say, we will not anticipate the decision of that question by a <em>summary </em>\u00e9nquiry, but a bill shall be filed, that it may be <em>regularly put in issue. </em>Between that case and this, there is a broad line of distinction. The power I contend for, is exercised only over decrees by default. The grounds on which it is exercised, are the matters of <em>excuse </em>for the default, which are <em>collateral </em>to the questions that may be brought in issue, and on which the decree must be founded; and these are always proved in a summary manner, often by <em>affidavits </em>of the parties, and in no wise operate on, or influence the decision of the questions involved in the litigation. A formal Bill is therefore unnecessary in cases like the present. But where the question is, whether the decree w'as obtained by <em>fraud, </em>the decision upon the merits of the case may obviously be affected in a great measure by the decision of that question.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b287-27\"> Note. A <em>Bill </em>to set aside the decree, was filed in this case; but the proper mode of proceeding appears to be by <em>Petition. </em>See 1 <em>Vezey senr., </em>205; and <em>Ambler, </em>89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A8g\"> <em>Kemp </em>v.
