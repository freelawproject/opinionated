That this lease was made for the sole object of providing more competently for the lessor\u2019s daughters; and was subsisting at the death of <em>Matthew Woodson; </em>who devised the same, or, which is the same thing, the monies arising therefrom, to his daughters, the plaintiffs. That the defendant <em>P. </em>Woodson, being entitled by devise from the said <em>M. Woodson </em>to the reversion of the said coal mines, after the expiration of <em>Graham\u2019s </em>lease, the said Graham, after the death of <em>Matthew </em>Woodson, purchased the said reversionary interest; and, thereupon, surrendered the lease, and gave notice thereof to the executrix and devisees aforesaid of <em>Matthew </em>Woodson. That this was done by Graham, to obtain the land for less than its value. That, by this means, the rights of the plaintiffs will be defeated, if the surrender should be allowed to prevail against them; which they insist it ought not, as the plaintiffs are entitled either to the money, or to the unexpired term of years in the land itself. The bill, therefore, prays an account and payment of the rent till the regular expiration of the lease by efflux of time; or, otherwise, that he may deliver possession of the lands to the plaintiff, during the residue of the term for which the lease was granted, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">The answer of <em>Graham </em>admits the lease, and devise; insists upon his right to surrender, under the express words of the lease; and that it was on account of the right to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>so, that he had agreed to give so high a rent. That the lease being defeasible in its nature, those claiming the benefits, were subject to the disadvantages of it. That the uncertainty of its duration, was frequently spoken of in conversations between the defendant and the said <em>M. Woodson. </em>That, after searching for coal for some time, without any competent success, the defendant, in the lifetime of the said <em>M. Woodson, </em>had determined to annul the lease, unless he should, in a short time, find a body of coal which promised more. That things were in this state when the said <em>M. Woodson </em>died; and, in a short time afterwards, the apprehensions of the lease being ruinous to him increasing, he determined to abandon, when he was informed that the defendant <em>P. Woodson </em>would sell; and conceiving that a purchase would be the best means of recovering his expenditures already made upon the lease, he bought the fee simple. That this circumstance induced him to make greater exertions in seeking for coal; which, after great expense, he at length found in such a degree as to promise success. Yet, notwithstanding these prospects, he is willing to relinquish his interest in the coal lands, on receiving his expenditures, without interest, and a reasonable hire for the slaves which have been employed on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\">The answer of <em>Woodson </em>says, <em>Graham, </em>during the treaty for the reversion, frequently told him, he would give up the lease to his sisters, so as to prevent the defendant from receiving any benefit from it. That he \"sold his right to <em>Graham, </em>without any intention of defrauding the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AY\">The depositions prove <em>M. Woodson\u2019s </em>intention of providing for his daughters by the lease. That <em>Graham, </em>when he bought the fee simple, secured <em>\u00a3 </em>100 each to the two youngest daughters, if they were satisfied. And one of the witnesses says, that after the purchase, <em>Graham, </em>in a conversation,- said to the defendant <em>Philip, </em>that if he had thrown up the lease, he should have done it in favor of the legatees, and not of <em>Philip, </em>as that seemed to be his father\u2019s <em>will.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">The Court of Chancery decreed the defendant <em>Graham </em>to pay the rents with interest; and if he should choose afterwards to abandon the lease, to deliver the possession of the lands, during the unexpired term thereof, to the plaintiffs. From which decree, <em>Graham </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Call </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">Insisted, <em>that </em>it was like the ease of a specific devise; the devisee of which, is liable to all the casualties which may attend the thing bequeathed. Thus, if there be a de-' vise of a debt, and the debtor becomes insolvent, or the testator releases the debt, the legatee loses it altogether, and cannot claim satisfaction out of the other estate of the testator. That the lease in the present case was, in its creation, liable to be surrendered; and, therefore, if the testator did not make provision for that event, he meant that the interest of the daughters should depend upon the contingency in the lease, and determine with it, if the lease should be surrendered. Consequently, the daughters could no more claim compensation for the loss in this case, than the legatee of a debt could in the other. That the contingency of the surrender was a benefit which belonged to the remainder-man; and, if fortune threw it in his way, the daughters could not complain; because they had the devise as the testator gave it to them. For, he bequeathed it, subject to be destroyed at the election of the lessee, who was at liberty to exercise the right, when he pleased; and the daughters had no authority to control <em>him, </em>because the lease itself expressly bestowed the power on him. <em>That </em>it was strange reasoning to say, that the daughters were injured by the lessee\u2019s exercising a right which he had over the estate, and which right he had stipulated for in express terms. Consequently, the principles of the decree were wholly erroneous, and the bill should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">But, if it were true, that the plaintiffs were entitled to the rents, which they by no means admitted, still the decree for interest was clearly wrong; because that is never given on rents, unless there be a penalty. [<em>Creuze v. </em>Hunter,] <em>2 </em>Ves. <em>jun. </em>163; [The Countess of <em>Ferrers </em>v. Earl Ferrers,] Cas. Temp. Talb. <em>2.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-10\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-11\">Contended, <em>that </em>the surrender was a stratagem to defeat the interest of the daughters, which would not be supported in a Court of Equity; because they were not to be ousted of their rights by a contrivance between the lessee and remainder-man. <em>That </em>there was less reason for it, in this case, than in others: because the defendant had in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>bought the estate himself before the surrender; which was a device, afterwards, made use of' to defeat the legacies of the daughters; although their claim had enabled hini to buy the remainder, at an under rate. <em>That </em>a devise of the rents, and a devise of the term itself, were substantially the same; and the true exposition of the will was, that he intended them to have the emolumehts of the land, during the term of the lease. <em>That, </em>therefore, the change of owners would not affect their interest. For, whether the possession of the land was with the remainder-man or the lessee, their claim was still the same. So, that if the remainder-man had retained the lands, he would, after the surrender, have been liable for the rents, or else he must have yielded possession to the daughters; and, therefore, the defendant, who had less equity, must do the same. <em>That </em>the rents being for a liquidated sum, ought to carry interest; for, the uncertainty of the amount is the only reason why interest is not generally allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b232-9\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that there was no error in the decree upon the merits; and as to the interest, that it was discretionary in the Court to allow it or not. But, in this case, the defendant had no title to have it taken off, as he had endeavored to defeat the rents altogether, and thereby delayed the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Decree affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\">[* See next case.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
