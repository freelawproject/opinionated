Before they separated, however, it was verbally agreed by <em>Baker </em>as well as <em>Glass, </em>that other referees should he appointed at some other time, <em>hut no daij was fixed on for making such </em>appointment; and <em>Baler, </em>soon afterwards, declared that lie considered the contract void, and demanded a surrender of the writing. <em>Glass </em>refused to give it up, and tendered to <em>Baker </em>a Deed conveying to him, in fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>simple, with general warranty, the House and Lot in Middletown, witli twenty or thirty dollars, which he considered the difference in value between that property and the Lands in Kentucky: which Deed and money <em>Ba-her </em>refused to receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKc\">A Bill was thereupon filed by <em>Glass, </em>in the superior Court of Chancery \u2019foi* the Winchester District, praying that <em>Baker </em>be decreed to convey to him the Kentucky lands, \u201cupon his doing <em>what the Court should think pro- </em>\u201c <em>per,\u201d </em>and that such other relief be given as justice required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACp\">Tlie defendant by his answer, contended that the Court oughtto pronounce the contract <em>void, </em>but said he was \"willing that a sale of the House and lot on twelve months credit should be directed, with an assignment to him, by the Complainant, of the Bonds taken at such sale, (the property to be held liable for payment thereof,) and a decree for the balance, with interest from the date of the written' agreement; or that the Complainant should be decreed to pay for the <em>whole land, in cash, </em>at two dollars per acre, the last day of payment having nearly arrived. The respondent ~\\vas then and had always been willing .to let him have the land for <em>money, </em>at the price, and according to the alternative terms of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am15\">Chancellor Carr appointed <em>Edward McGuire </em>and <em>James Stephenson, </em>(or, if they should disagree, <em>Daniel Lee </em>as their umpire,) to say how much the House and Lot were worth in cash on the 12th of May 1810, and how much at the time of their valuation; directing them if the value was less at that time than on the said 12th .of May 1810, to say . what, in their opinion, had caused such depreciation of valqe. The said referees reported the value at both periods to be the same; to wit, twelve hundred dollars: whereupon the Chancellor was of opinion, that the Complainant, having executed the Deed filed among the proceedings since the last term, wrould 'be entitled to a specific performance of the contract in the Bill mentioned, upon his paying the balance of the purphase money for the Kentucky land. He therefore de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>creed that if the complainant, on or before the expiration of six months, from the date of this decree, should pay to the defendant the sum of <em>$733 33 </em>cents, with interest \u2019till paid, on one third of that sum from September SOth 1811, on another third from September 30th 1812, and on the residue from September 30th 1813, then the defendant should forthwith make and execute to the Complainant a Deed in fee simple, with general warranty, for the Lands in Kentucky mentioned in the articles of agreement; should accept the Deed for the House and Lot, and pay the costs of the suit: but, if the Complainant should fail in making the said payment, his bill should be dismissed w ith costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">This decree was afterwards so modified as to permit the Complainant to pay the money and interest intoCourl, to be handed over to the defendant; which payment he accordingly made; but then appealed from so much of the decree as directed that he should pay <em>interest. </em>The \u2666defendant also appealed; and, on his motion, a Receiver w as appointed to put out the money to interest, until the said appeals should be decided.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-6\"><em>Wickham </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATa\">(among other points which need not here be mentioned,) relied upon the cases of <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Hansbrough, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>290; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Call executor of Means, 5 Munf. </em>396; <em>Cooth v. Jackson, </em>6 <em>Vesey jr. </em>34; and <em>Milnes </em>v. <em>Gery, 14 Vesey jr. </em>400, as shewing that the bargain in this case was too incomplete to be enforced by a Court of equity. It is true that <em>Baker </em>made a proposition in his answer; but il w as not accepted, and therefore was not binding.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-8\"><em>Stanard </em>for the complainant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALcO\">said the contract was of two parts; first, to sell at a stipulated price the Kentucky land: .so far, it was consummate, as soon as <em>Glass </em>agreed to take the land. Subordinate to this, wras the second part, prescribing the modes in which <em>Glass </em>was at liberty to effect the payment of the purchase money. The selection of either of those modes had no influence on the main contract. If it were true that the disagreement of the val uers liberated <em>Baker </em>lrom proceeding farther in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>valuation, it merely discharged him from the obligation of taking payment in <em>that </em>mode: it did not deprive <em>Glass </em>of the privilege of paying in the other mode authorised by the contract. The effect of such an event is only co-extensivo with the subject oil which it operates: it excludes the house and lot as a means of payment, but it docs not defeat the contract, unless the exclusion of the house and lot as a means of payment, works that effect <em>per se. </em>That such can not be the case, is plainly demonstrable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-10\">Suppose the house had been destroyed; would <em>Glass </em>be deprived of the privilege of paying for the Kentucky ' land by the instalments stipulated? An abortive attempt to give it a price, so as to make it a means of payment, would, at most, disable <em>Glass </em>from making the payment in that way; but such disability would not deprive him of the privilege of embracing the other alternative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-11\"><em>Glass </em>had the privilege of one of two modes, as his choice. If the effort to pay in <em>one </em>mode was frustrated, surely he is entitled to claim the benefit of the contract, on paying in the <em>other.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-12\">The prayer of the Bill is framed with a view to any construction the Court may give the agreement; and while <em>Glass </em>insists that he has done every thing that he ought to .have done to entitle himself to the benefit of the contract, he declares his readiness to do any thing the Court shall think he ought to do. It is therefore insisted that, at all events, <em>Glass </em>is entitled to the execution of the contract, whether <em>Baker </em>be or be not bound to proceed in the valuation of the house and lot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-13\">But, 2dly, the Court did right in proceeding with that valuation, and making it a payment in part for the Kentucky land. According to the terms of the contract, the house and lot were to be valued in cash by two persons. Is this more or less than a sale at valuation general ? If the words were, <em>\u201cto be valued in cash,\u201d </em>it would be so ; or there could be no sale at valuation. If you go farther, and say, \u00abto be valued <em>by one or more persons </em>in cash,\u2019? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>this is but an equivalent expression; lor the words added are nothing more than the expression of what is implied in the original phrase. In what does the phrase used in the contract differ from this ? Tt can not, with any shew of reason, be contended, that there is, or ought to be, any essential difference in the rights of the parties, to have the aid of the Court to get the valuation made, under either form of expression. If, when the stipulation is to take the property at valuation, or at the valuation of <em>one or more </em>persons, the aid of the Court may be obtained; it ought not to be withheld when the stipulation is to take it at the valuation of <em>two </em>persons. In truth, under this contract, neither party was absolutely bound to receive as a valuer the nominee of the other : both possessed the right to have the intervention of a Court in the nomination of the valuers, and it\u2019s superintendance over the valuation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-4\">In this view of the question, the cases quoted by Mr. <em>Wickham </em>are direct and explicit authorities in my favour. That parties may waive the exercise of their own judgment, and substitute the judgment of others, as to the price, or other constituent parts of a contract for the. sale of property, is not denied. This substitution may be <em>specific, </em>as to the person or persons substituted, and the time and manner of giving their judgment; as in <em>Smallwood </em>v. <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Hansbrough, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>290, and <em>Milnes </em>v. <em>Gery, </em>14 <em>Vesey jr. </em>400. Where this is the case, all the specifications must be strictly observed to make the contract binding; for the parties have assented to be bound, only in the mode specified. Or the substitution may be general, indefinite, or limited to certain classes of persons only; in which cases the Court may make the appointment. This principle prevailed in <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>1 <em>Wash, </em>326, and applies a <em>fortiori </em>in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">The case of <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Call </em>has no application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-9\">But if <em>Baker </em>be not bound but by persons of Ms <em>own </em>choice, he <em>is </em>bound here; for the valuation was in fact made by such persons. Tie waived the privilege, of nam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ing valuers himself, and consented that those nominated' by the Court should act.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b233-15\"> Note. <em>Glass </em>never declared his <em>election </em>to pay the <em>money, </em>in preference to letting <em>linker </em>have the house and lot Jt seems too, that the rent that could be obtained was <em>less </em>than <em>75 </em>dollars per annum, so that the alternative allowance of gl500,was thrown out of the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"A4a\"> Note, The Court of Chancery in the first instance, directed that the <em>parties </em>should, on or before a day specified, nominate one person each, as a valuer, and also a third valuer in case the two first should not agree; providing- at the same time, that, if <em>they </em>should fail to nominate, tile persons appointed by the Court should act: Afterwards, by <em>consent of parties, </em>so much of this order as gave <em>them </em>the time and privilege to choose valuers, was set aside, and the valuers appointed as aforesaid were ordered to proceed, with all convenient dispatch, to perform that duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AtK0\">November 2nd 1818, Judge Roane pronounced the Court\u2019s opinion, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AuC\">Upon general principles, and on the authority of the cage Milnes <em>v.
