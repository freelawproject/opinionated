A defendant being party or privy to a deed, can not avoid it, in a court of common law, by <em>parol </em>evidence, on the ground of <em>-want of consideration; </em>for he is <em>es-topped </em>from averring such matter against a <em>specialty.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b378-13\">3. The Trustee in a deed of trust takes a <em>legal, </em>though defeasible title; and a deed from him to a purchaser, con eys an <em>absolute title, in a Court of common law; </em>whether the conditions of the Trust Deed have been complied with, or not: but the rul\u00e9is different <em>in Equity.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b378-14\">4. A Court of <em>Equity </em>will not permit the original owner of the land, or his alienee, to be injured by a breach of trust on the part of the trustee; and, therefore, will set aside a sale and conveyance by him, if the requisitions of the deed of trust have not been complied with.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b378-15\">5.

Lewis, </em>who was thereof seised, and, while in actual seisin, being indebted to <em>Reuben and Randolph Ross </em>in the sum of Si,515 32 Cents, on the 3d. day of February 1809, executed, jointly with his father, a Deed of Trust to <em>Henry Edmundson, </em>to secure the payment of the said sum of money to the said <em>Reuben and Randolph </em>Ross; which Deed, being duly recorded, was found <em>in hcec </em>.verba:\u2014that, on the 4th of June 1811, the said <em>Reuben and Randolph Ross, </em>for a valuable consideration, fairly and <em>bona fide </em>transferred their interest, in the said deed of trust and the money secured thereby, to <em>John M\u00a1 Taylor </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, by a writing under seal, found also <em>in hcec </em>verba:\u2014that, on the 14th day of December 1811, the sum of g!273 145 Cents, secured by the said Deed of Trust, being due on account of princiPal ant* interest, the said Trustee, having fixed on Montgomery Court house, as the place of sale, distant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the premises about ten miles, and, at the request of the said <em>Taylor, </em>having duly advertised the time and place of sale according to the provisions of the Deed, proceeded to expose the Land and appurtenances according to the tenor and in the terms therein stipulated; and, after due outcry at the place designated, the same was struck off to the said <em>John M. Taylor, </em>(who was the only bidder,) for the said sum of $1273 14\u00a7 Cents: that, before this sale, and before the date of the advertisement, the suit mentioned in the said deed, depending in the Court of Appeals, between <em>Andrew Lewis </em>appellant and the heirs of <em>William S. Madison, </em>had been finally determined in favour of <em>Andrew Lewis, </em>so as to secure the title, as in the said Deed is mentioned, to <em>Charles G. Lewis: </em>that <em>Henry Edmnndson </em>the trustee, by a deed of bargain and sale, (found also <em>in heec verba,) </em>conveyed the premises to the lessor of the plaintiff:\u2014that <em>Charles G. Lewis, </em>after he had made the said deed of trust, did regularly sell the land and premises for a valuable consideration, to wit, $15,000, to <em>Joseph King </em>the defendant, and put him in possession thereof:\u2014that, on the day of sale of the premises under the deed of Trust, and before the land had been knocked off by the auctioneer, a certain <em>Garnett Peyton </em>attended, and had made a positive and satisfactory arrangement to purchase the land <em>in partnership with him, the </em>Trustee; and, in consequence of that arrangement, the said <em>Peyton </em>had come to the resolution to bid as far as $8000, if the land could not he got for less: that, afterwards, on the same day, and before the sale had taken place, the said <em>John M. Taylor, </em>understanding that arrangement and determination, then and there agreed with <em>Peyton, </em>that, if he bought the land, the said <em>Peyton </em>should have it at the price of $8000: that, <em>in consequence of this agreement, and the conduct of Taylor, Peyton did not bid at the </em>sale: that, on the morning of the day of sale, one <em>James Craig </em>asked <em>Taylor, </em>if it would not he right for him to hid to the amount of the Deed of Trust; that <em>Taylor </em>then approved the said <em>Craig\u2019s </em>intention of bidding, <em>but, in the evening, and before the land was struck off, came to him, and requested him not to </em>bid,* <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>consequence of which he did not bid; </em>but, if <em>Taylor had not made the </em>request, he would have bid to the amount at which it was cried offto the said Taylor, and more rather than have lost the land: that <em>Craig </em>had not, at that time, by him, more than about $1100, but <em>believed himself able </em>to procure more money: that, in consequence of this conduct of the said <em>Taylor, </em>he was without a competitor in the market, and did obtain the land as the only bidder, at a very inferior and inadequate price; the land in the general estimation being worth from $8,000 to 10,000: that the said <em>John M.

So a mortgagee may bring Ejectment, befoi'e forfeiture; and the only remedy of the mortgagor is in equity.\u2014At <em>law, </em>the person giving the deed, retains no estate, either in fee, or freehold, or for years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-6\">The Deed therefore from the Trustee to the purchaser passed the estate; being good <em>between </em>them.\u2014The Trustee can xxot x-ecover fx*om the purchaser, or defend himself from a suit for the land, founded on his own act.\u2014 Admit it not binding as to the <em>debtor:\u2014this </em>can be,in relatioix to <em>his right only, </em>which is <em>merely </em>equitable.\u2014Can a fraud committed by others, turn it into a legal right?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-7\">Sxxppose the fraud had been between the Trustee and a purchaser, without the creditor;\u2014would the deed be void <em>absolutely, </em>or only <em>pro </em>tanto!\u2014Suppose the creditor a pai-ty to the fraud; what becomes of the estate?\u2014Does it x\u2019emain <em>in the Trustee, </em>notwithstanding his own deed? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Uaii the debtor bring Ejeetment, where the land has been sold, and possession delivered, by the rrrustee to the purchaser~ why shouldhe? for the purchaser with notice of the trust, and of it's not being duly executed, is himself a trustee. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The proper remedy of Xing is by Bill in Equity to redeem or to set asidethe sale; making the purchaser a par_: ty, who, then, must prove the sale regular, or the decree' will be against him.-So, if A. sells to B., but makes no conveyance to him, and afterwards conveys to C.; (a purchaser with notice of B.'s right;) the conveyance is good at law:--the fraud of .~. &amp; C. does not give B. a legal estate:-his only remedy is in Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASo5\">It may be contended that a Court of common law has jurisdiction in cases of fraud.--! answer, that the Deed of Trust, which passed the legal estate, was not founded in fraud: but, if it were, the Court of law can not take cognizance of it, for the estoppel operates.--The case of Chew ex'or. of Wormley v. Moffett, lately decided, (ante) turned on the circumstance that, by joining issue, the objection to the legality of the plea was waived:otherwise, the decision would have been different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZVj\">The rule laid down in the Books, is, that all contracts of a nature generally repugnant to the policy, or contrary to the prorisions, of the common law, are void.-.-But the rule relates to contracts whose general nature and object is illegal; such ~s bonds for compounding prosecutions for perjury;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> for the wages of prostitution, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> A similar rule applies to contracts prohibited by Statute. For example, a conveyance of all the goods of a trader, is an act of bankruptcy and void:<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> so also, bonds tainted with Usury, &amp;c., are void.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8J\">Iii like manner, a Bond may be avoided on the ground of fraud committed in it's execution; as, if an illiterate person be induced to sign it, by reading it to him in words different from those in which it is written;<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> for, in such case, the mind of the obligor does not assent to the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqC\">The consequunces of extending the rule farther, would be very inconvenient. Suppose the creditor, on a settle-meat, brings in a false charge of 51. 0. 0 in 10001., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>takes a bond, for too much, to that ainount:-if the debtor could plead the fraud at law, the bond would be avoided altogether; whereas the rule iii Eq?tit1j is, that the fraudulent instrument is void oniy so far as it ought to be so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtL2\">Again, if a person defrauded, executed a Deed, would it be proper to permit him to avoid it in the hands of a purchaser without notice? f so, what becomes of tit1es~</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOOJ\">There is not a case like this, in which the conveyance has been decided to be void at common law:-but there are thousands in equity. Questions relating to purchasers without notice, breaches of trust, &amp;c., form a main pillar of equitable jurisdiction, which would be thrown down, if the judgment now in question should stands</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYrG\">Call for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJrO\">1. The deed from the trustcewas void between the pajrties; for every fraudulent act is void in law; and a Court of. law is competent to declare it so. <footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> Neither is there any difference between a deed and simple contract; for wh~it is base in it's origin can not be made good by forms.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> If you put the question upon the foundation of the mind's not assenting; that reason is as much applicable to one species of fraud as another. If a man, intending to give a bond for twenty shillings, is imposed upon, and made to give one. for twenty pounds, the bond is void, (says Mr. Wicktarn,) because his mind never assented: but the truth is, the ground of avoid anc\u00e8 is the fruul committed by his adversary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH6d\">A defendant is not estopped from pleading a collateral matter, which makes a deed ~ooid, or voidable;-not by the old law; as in the cases of the deed obtained by fraud from an illiterate man<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark>, and where a man persuaded a woman to execute writings to another, as her trustee upon an intended marriage, which in truth contained no such thing, but only a warrant of attorney to confess a judgment, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark>: nor by the present law; for the party may skew that the deed was founded upon an illegal consideration;<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> or was obtained from a drunken man; om~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>from a lunatic;<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> or by a fraudulent niisrepresemtaiion of the plaintiff's right to a patent for an useful invenLiou.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa2\">The modern doctrnie is that, even an equitable defence may be pleaded at law;<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> which abolishes the old doctrine of Estoppels, or shews that they only apply in support of justice; so that, in every case, the instrument being admitted, the bad consideration may he shewn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUO5\">.t2ctual fraud is a matter of fact, and therefore proper to be ascertained by a Jury; SO that, in such cases, the\u2022 Court of Equity is generally obliged to direct an issue. Is it not monstrous, then, to drive the party into Equity, in order that he may be sent back to law to ascertain the fact? r1~he distinction is this. Where the fraud depends on matter offact, the case is cognizable at law, am! the jurisdiction of both Courts is concurrent; but where it results from equitable iiifereucc only, the Court of Equity has excluei~ce jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av68\">~. The deed is void also, as against the pre~emt defend~ ant. If void between the parties, it can have no effect any where, or against any body. So, a bond given by an infant, or founded on gaming &amp;c., is void in the hands of an assignee. But if good between the parties, it can not aflbct this defendant; for estoppels do not bind a stranger; <footnotemark>(o)</footnotemark> and therefore he may I)lead \"rien passa per lefait.\" <footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark> The plaintiff in Ejectmeiat must 1~ecover upon Ihe strength of his own title; am!, here, his claim is founded on a fraudulent conveyance, which passes no estate; in like manner as a void bond creates no debt.<footnotemark>(q)</footnotemark> That the legal estate passed by the deed of trust can not avail him; because the question is whether the legal estate passed by the deed to the lessor of the plaint~f; for, if not~ he can not maintain Ejectrnent. The deed to him is void, not only as to equitable right, but altogether, anti passes nothing. `l'ho' the defendant caii not deny the deed of trust, he still has a right to hold the land against all hilt him who has the legal title; and the lessor of the plaintiff has not even equal equ?tJ; foi, tho', as creditor, lie has ~ ?i~ht to hi~ money, Ii~ has none to the</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>rule that only deeds contrary to Statutes, or to the general policy of the common law, are void, is too narrow. The cases prove that <em>allfraudulent </em>deeds are void. The inconvenience, that, at law, a bond would be avoided, <em>altogether, </em>for <em>one </em>fraudulent item, makes no difference; for, if so, it is a punishment for the perfidy of the party: but, perhaps, the Jury might, under the Act, find the true sum due;<footnotemark>(r)</footnotemark> and, at any rate, the old debt, so far as just, would not be extinguished by defeating the bond. Neither is it important, that a purchaser -without notice would not be safe; for such is the effect in every case where the deed is void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AAqC\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0e\">Not a single case referred to by Mr. <em>Call </em>is analogous in it\u2019s circumstances to this. For example, <em>Cockshott </em>v. <em>Bennet, </em>2. <em>Term Rep. 763, </em>is not a case of a <em>bond, </em>but of a note; in <em>Hayne </em>v. <em>Maltby, 3 Term Rep. </em>441, the Deed was <em>not contradicted, </em>but avoided by-collateral matter; and the case in 9 Bast 417, was one of a bond with <em>illegal </em>consideration. There are multitudes of instances, in England and this Country, of relief <em>in equity </em>in cases of this nature; but not one of relief at <em>law. </em>Does not this shew, that Mr. <em>Call\u2019s </em>whole argument is founded on a misapplication of the authorities? Hia client has a mere <em>equitable </em>title. The Court of common law does not recognize his having any right at all. Any position that leads to an absurdity, or inconsistency with the uniform course of law proceedings, must be wrong, however plausible it may appear, No doubt, the common law abhors fraud; but there are cases in which it can not give relief against it, tho\u2019 a Court of Equity can.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1oM\">The question is, do the <em>forms </em>of the common law permit the fraud to be pleaded in such a case as this? In <em>Chitty </em>on Pleading, 2 vol. 464, there is a form of a plea offraud to a bond; but it is not supported by any authority, and is not to be found in any other book of Entries. Is there not a substantial distinction between a cas\u00e9, where the party intended to sign a bond for <em>one </em>thing, and, by fraud, was made to sign one for <em>a, different </em>thing, and a case in which tho bond he signed was such as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>intended, but his ground of defence is, that he was deceived in the settlement of accounts, and gave it for more than was due? In the former case, the Court of law will give relief on the plea of <em>non est factum; </em>in the latter, the only remedy is in equity. The plaintiff\u2019s being indictable for the fraud, does not prevent his recoveiing at law upon the <em>bond.\u2014Factum valet, fieri non debet, </em>is the maxim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-4\">Can Mr. <em>Call </em>contend that the Chancellor\u2019s sending an issue to be tried at law proves the case to be one in which the Court of law has original jurisdiction? If so, the jurisdiction of the Court of Equity would be destroyed in a great number of cases in which it\u2019s existence has never been doubted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-5\">Estoppels operate upon <em>privies, </em>as well as parties. The <em>lessor of the plaintiff </em>claims under the <em>trustee, </em>to whom the Deed was originally made, and who has made <em>him </em>a Deed. He is therefore privy <em>in interest.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AW6\">Fonbl.

At the trial, upon the general issue, the appellant relied upon a deed of February 7th 1812, made to him by <em>II. Edmundson, </em>the trustee in a Deed of Trust of February 3d. 1809, executed by <em>Andrew </em>and <em>Charles Lewis </em>to him, to secure the payment of a debt due to <em>Reuben and Randolph Ross, </em>which debt was duly assigned by them to the appellant. Both these deeds are in the common form, and are in themselves unexceptionable. The defendant claims under a Deed from <em>Charles Lewis, </em>for the consideration of g15,000, made <em>after </em>the trust deed aforesaid, and before the sale to the plaintiff, and was put in possession of the premises. That deed is, therefore, subject to the incumbrance contained in the deed of trust, and must yield to any title <em>legally </em>deduced under it. Both the deeds being unexceptionable as aforesaid on their face, and that of <em>February 7th </em>1812, being only produced on the <em>trial, </em>it could not be assailed but by <em>evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqsZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The Jury found a special verdict, detailing certain acts committed by the appellant at the <em>time </em>of the sale, which <em>are </em>fraudulent, as to the defendant; and they also ^iem ke fraudulent. These facts tended to prevent competition at the sale, by means of which, it is also found, the appellant got the land for about one seventh part of its value. There is no doubt but that, in a Court of Equity, these facts would vacate the sale, and the defendant be deemed to hold the land subject to the trust. Nor is there any doubt, but that, in a Court of law, a fraud may be given in evidence to vacate a deed, if that fraud relates to the <em>execution </em>of the instrument; as, if it be misread to the party, or his signature be obtained to an instrument which he did not intend to sign. It would be too much, however, to vacate a bond at law, because a pai\u2019ty was imposed on, in a settlement of accounts which <em>preceded </em>it\u2019s execution, or a bond or deed which was founded on a false or fraudulent statement of facts. Such circumstances go to shew a want of consideration; and a defendant can not avoid a solemn deed on that ground, by parol, in a Court of law. In that Court, and on such an instrument, the principle that fraud and covin vacates every contract, is to be taken in subordination to another principle, namely, that the party is estopped from averring a matter of the kind against a specialty. If this position needs support, it may be found, among other cases, in that of <em>Mease </em>v. <em>Mease, Cowp. 47, </em>and <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Munsel, </em>13 <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>N. <em>York rep. </em>430. In the last case it is expressly decided, that the fraud to be proved upon a plea of <em>non est factum, </em>must be such as relates to the <em>execution </em>of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">With respect to the <em>Deed </em>in this case, it is not at this day to be questioned that the Deed of a Trustee conveys a <em>legal </em>title, The Trustee himself takes a legal, though defeasible title; and that title becomes absolute in his vendee, by the Deed, in a Court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We are also of opinion that, in a Court of law, the Vendee need not shew that the conditions of the Trust deed have been complied with. There have been some. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>opinions and <em>dicta </em>in this Conrt<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> seeming to countenance a contrary idea; but this is our opinion upon due consideration. While, however, the vendee gets a <em>legal </em>title by the mere execution of his deed, the original owner of the land, or his alienee, is not to be injured by a breach of trust on the part of the trustee. A purchaser from him, the requisitions of the Deed not being complied with, does not, <em>in </em>equity, get a complete title. He does not get it, because, until then, the trustee is not authorised to convey it.</p>\n<p id=\"AVp\">On these grounds, we find ourselves compelled to reverse the judgment, and enter one for the appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"Aol7\"> Note.
