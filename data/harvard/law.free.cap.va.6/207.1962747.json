Upon a Bill of In. junction Iii-ed, t~ new trial at law wa~ grante4; verdict was found for the complainant, but contified by the iudge to b~ against the <em>weight </em>of evidence; another trial being- directed, a second verdict was found as before; whereupon, the Judge certified with the verdict <em>all the evidence </em>given to the Jury; _ from which it <em>clearly </em>appeared that Hie <em>merits </em>of the case were <em>against </em>the complainant. The Court of Appeals thex-eupon, did not award <em>another </em>trial, hut dissolved the Injunction, and dismissed the Bill with costs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AASF\">2. The assignor and assignee of a bond being made defendants to a bill exhibited by the obligor, for an Injunction and for <em>general </em>relief; he alledging that he paid the money to the assignor without notice of the assignment; if that allegation be afterwai-ds disproved, whereupon the Injunction is'dissolved, and the Bill dismissed as to the assignee; the cause ought yet to be retained and farther pro\u00bb, rne.ded in, to give the complainant relief against the assignor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVh\">The appellee exhibited a bill in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Staunton llllstrict, against Dainiel R~ff~ ncr, Joseph JlajTmcr and Samuel Ifen~rg, setting forth that he executed his bond to Joseph ihtjJ~er and Samuel lienry executors of .1. linffner, for ~1 1 9,5O~ that Joseph Ruff_ ncr assigne(1 it to Daniel R~ff~ier ; that the complainant paid the iiioney to Samuel henry, without notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ass'Snmen^ and took his receipt, to which one <em>John llenrl! </em>was subscribing witness; that the assignee brought suit on the bond in the <em>Superior Court of </em>Cabell county, and obtained j udgment, the subscribing Witness to the receipt being absent. He prayed an injunction, and <em>general relief.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\">The injunction was awarded. The <em>Ruffners, </em>by their answers, stated that the sale of the property, for the price of which the bond was taken, was made by the executors for the benefit of <em>Daniel </em>Ruffner; and that this was notorious at the time; that, accordingly, the bond was immediately transferred to him ; that <em>Barrett </em>the Complainant was well apprised of all this, and, before his payment to <em>Samuel Henry, </em>had <em>full notice </em>of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">T,o these answers the plaintiff replied generally:\u2014a decree <em>nisi </em>was entered against <em>Henry, </em>but does not appear to have been served.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\"><em>Barrett </em>exhibited his receipt, and filed several depositions proving the payment, and tending to provd it was <em>honafde.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\"><em>Daniel Ruffner </em>filed a deposition to prove that <em>Barrett </em>had notice of the transfer of the bond to him, at the very time of it\u2019s execution. Upon a motion to dissolve the Injunction, Chancellor <em>Brown </em>directed anew trial at the bar of Cabell Superior Court: a verdict was found for Barrett; but the Court certified, with it, that the weight of evidence was in favour of <em>Ruffner. </em>The Chancellor directed another trial, which being had, the Jury found again for <em>Barrett. </em>The Court certified the verdict, and with it <em>all the evidence given before the </em>Jury; from which it clearly appeared that <em>Barrett, </em>before he paid the money to <em>Henry </em>had full notice of the assignment of the bond <em>to Daniel Ruffner. </em>,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">The Chancellor perpetuated the Injunction; and <em>Ruffner </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-9\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-10\">Since all the evidence which was before the <em>Jury </em>appears to this Court, and the merits are clearly in favour of the plaintiff at law, there is no necessity for awarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>another trial, but the Court may direct the Injunction to be dissolved and the Bill dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-4\">\n<em>Stanard contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak9I\">It is not necessary for me to discuss the evidence after two concurring Verdicts. This Court cannot judge of the credibility of the Witnesses, as the <em>Jury </em>could. Their manlier of giving testimony, their looks, could be seen by <em>them, </em>but can not now be known by this Court, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In strictness the Chancellor ought not to have granted the second new trial, the Judge\u2019 certificate being, merely, that the <em>weight </em>of evidence was against the verdict. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-11\"><em>Leigh </em>in reply. The verdict and decree are not only against the <em>weight </em>of evidence, but against the evidence altogether; for there is no contradictory testimony in the case, in <em>Shanks </em>and <em>McRae </em>v. <em>Fenwick, 2 Munf. </em>478, this Court regarded the weight of evidence, and discarded all other considerations. In <em>Stanard </em>v. <em>Graves, three </em>concurring verdicts had been given on the same evidence. If in this case there were three such verdicts, I should submit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em> Stanard </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>2 <em>Call </em>369-374.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AAp\"> <em>Swain v.
