This was held a binding compromise of her right to the share of the crop.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ai40\">IN assumpsit, by .Tarnes Daniel, and .~nne his wife, against John B. JWaciin, and William W. JJfaclin, the declaration charged, that the defendants were indebted to the p1aintifi~ ~mne while sole, in the sum of ~ISS6 ~O cents, for 49~ barrels of corn, (being the proportion of corn, belonging to the said ./inne while sole, of a certain crop n~ade, in pursuance of the last Will of her lirst husband William .Maciin, upon the plantathrn whereon he resided at tihe time of his death,) which corn was by the defendants applied to their own use; and, being so indebted, they assumed, &amp;c., in the usual form. Plea non assumpsit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>At the trial, the plaintiffs introduced testimony in support of their claim, and, among other things, the Will of <em>William Maclin, </em>whereby the testator directed that his executors should purchase a plantation for his widow, and furnish the same with \u00e1 sufficient quantity of <em>corn </em>and <em>pork, and necessary working utensils, </em>for her support and that of her family the first year; and, also, that, until the said land should be purchased, she should continue to reside on the home plantation, and work her hands with those of his son <em>William W. Maclin. </em>It was admitted that, during the said year, when the said <em>Anne </em>and <em>William W. Maclin </em>worked their hands together on the said plantation, the said 494 barrels of corn were made. It appeared that both the defendants, together with <em>Joseph </em>. <em>Wilkins </em>and the said <em>Anne, </em>were named executors in the said Will; but one of them only, with the said <em>Wilkins, </em>administered. The defendants proved, by a witness, that the plaintiff <em>Anne, </em>in the fall of the year 1806, agreed with the defendants, to give up her proportion of the corn, then growing and making by her hands and those of <em>William W. Maclin, </em>if they would purchase as much <em>corn </em>and <em>provisions, </em>in the ensuing winter as herself and a <em>Mr. James Lewis </em>should judge sufficient, to settle her on the plantation which had been purchased agreeably to the said Will. They also proved that the corn last mentioned, <em>was purchased for her by the defendants. </em>It was \u25a0 admitted* that the said <em>provisions </em>were furnished agre\u00e9ably to the contract stated by the witness; and that the defendants divided between them, and applied to then* Own use, the said 494 baiTels of corn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\">The plaintiffs demurred to the Evidence* and the Superior Court gave judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ay6k\"><em>Bouldin </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5Q\">Under the circumstances of this case, the law raised an <em>assumpsit, </em>without proof of an express promise. The slightest appearance of contract will change the action of trover or trespass for taking goods, into <em>assumpsit </em>for their value, at the elec^on 0 the plaintiff.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The declaration charges a promis\u00e9 to pay for the corn of the plaintiff used by the defendanta. the question is, whether by law such contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>results from the evidence. The proof is, that the plaintiff promised to give the defendants the corn, if they would give her <em>what was already her own!: </em>they used her corn, and paid her only what they before were bound by the Will to pay. Does not the law imply a promise to pay the value of the property thus improperly received by them?</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbII\"><em>Mrs. Maclin </em>was not by law compelled, nor in conscience any way bound by her consent, to relinquish the 49J barrels of corn, in consideration of the executors\u2019 giving her the provisions, to which by the Will she was entitled. It was a mere naked agreement, which gave no right to the party claiming under it, and ought not to. defeat the claims of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOo\"><em>May </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axc\">Wherever the presumption of a contract is <em>expressly </em>excluded, <em>assumpsit </em>will not lie.-Instead of a promise to pay for the 495 barrels of corn, there was an express agreement between the parties, that it was not to be paid for. This agreement was binding on <em>Mrs. Maclin; </em>for <em>William W. Maclin </em>one of the defendants was not executor, and there might not have been assets if he had qualified. This was surely <em>not nudum pacturn. </em>The contract was with him and the other defendant as <em>individuals. </em>They actually paid and advanced the \u00ab <em>corn </em>and <em>provisions,\u201d </em>a broader word than <em>\u201cpark.\u201d </em>She gained another advantage by it: she was to have as much corn , and other provisions, <em>as she and her friend Lewis should judge sufficient. </em>Besides, she was named in the Will as one of the Executors, and fully acquainted with all it\u2019s provisions. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AILD\">Bouldin in reply. This is a plain attempt on the part of the defendants to cheat the widow out of the corn.They used it under a contract, and not tortiously. The question is, w hether that contract may not, for purposes of justice, be extended a little, to imply a promise to pay in <em>their </em>property, instead of <em>her </em>own, which would be ridiculous and absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF8\"><em>William W. Maclin </em>was named an Executor in the Will. So far as he acted in this case, it was as Executor;-in his own wrong, if you please. His acting with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>brother who had qualified, does not make it the less nudnrn ~actwin. They did not in the slightest degree overstep the allowance by the Will, which is evidence in this cause.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b82-5\"> <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>2 Bos. and <em>Pul. 553</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AQn\"> Bible v.
