A testator, after setting apart a fund for the payment of his debts, and after certain specific devises and bequests, directs the remainder of his estate to be sold, and out of the proceeds of sale, gives specific sums to his wife and nephew, and directs the balance to be divided between his sister and niece. And he further directs, that if the fund for the payment of debts is not sufficient, his wife, nephew, sister and niece shall contribute ratably to pay them. The fund proves insufficient, and the legacies are abated; and the fund in the hands of the executor, out of which these legacies are to be paid, is all interest, and therefore does not bear interest. Held : The legacy given to the wife, after being abated, shall be paid with interest.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-11\">2. In this case the testator died in 1791, a suit was commenced in 1818, by the administrator of the wife, against the executors of the executor, for the recovery of the legacy left to her, to which neither the nephew nor the sister, or their representatives, were at any time made parties. In 1845, the final decree was made, which ascertained the amount in the hands of the executor applicable to the payment of the four legacies, and directed the payment of that given to the wife. The administrator of the sister then filed his bill to enforce payment of the legacy to the sister, and made the administrator of the nephew a party defendant, who answered, claiming his legacy. The executors relied on the lapse of time, and shewed facts from which it was inferrible that both legacies had been paid. Held: That independent of the probability that the legacies had been paid, the lapse of time is an insuperable bar to the claims.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-12\">This case was before this Court in 1831, and is reported in 3 Leigh 384, under the style of <em>Burwell\u2019s ex\u2019ors v.

By his </em>will, after providing a fund for the payment of his debts, and making some specific bequests, he devised all the rest of his estate to his wife for life; and after her death, the whole was to be sold and \u201c distributed in the manner following: I desire my beloved wife, by her will or otherwise, as she pleases, may have the absolute disposal of <em>\u00a3 500 </em>part thereof. I give my nephew <em>William Pasteur, </em>to be paid to him when he attains the age of twenty-one years, the sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>200 sterling, other part thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">\u201c And it is my will and desire, after deducting the two last mentioned sums, that two third parts of the residue be paid to my niece <em>Ann Smith, </em>for her own use, and that the remaining third part of the residue be paid to my friend <em>Nathaniel Burwell </em>of <em>Martin\u2019s </em>hundred, for the use and benefit of my sister <em>Ann Craig, </em>to be always at her disposal, in such manner that her husband <em>Thomas Craig, </em>and the creditors of said husband, may have no power over it. I give to my said beloved wife the absolute property in my chariot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">\u201c It is my will and desire, that if the estate hereby before directed to be sold for the payment of my debts, should not prove sufficient for that purpose, that whatever sum my other estate should be called upon to make up, shall be deducted in equal proportions according to the sums devised in money to my wife, to my nephew, to my niece, and my sister as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6G\"><em>Nathaniel Burwell </em>was appointed executor of the will, and qualified as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\">This Court, when the case was first here, decided that the legacy of <em>\u00a3 500 </em>to <em>Mrs. Pasteur, </em>was given to her <em>absolutely; </em>and that although she had made no disposition of it, her administrator was entitled to recover it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>And it having been ascertained that the fund provided by <em>Dr. Pasteur </em>for the payment of his debts was not sufficient, it was held that the legacies to <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>and <em>William Pasteur </em>must abate ratably with the bequests to <em>Mrs. Smith </em>and <em>Mrs. Craig. </em>And the rule by which the legacies were to abate was prescribed. After the second decision of this Court upon the case, the cause came on to be heard in the Court below, in March 1845, and the balance found against the executor being all interest, and therefore not bearing interest, that Court held that the money legacies bequeathed by the will of <em>Dr. Pasteur </em>to his wife, his nephew, and his niece and sister, were all in the nature of residuary legacies, and were intended by the will to be placed on a similar footing; and that as the fund was insufficient to pay even the principal of these legacies, interest ought not to be allowed to any of them to the prejudice of the rest. And it appearing by a statement made according to the rule prescribed by this Court, by which these legacies were to abate so as to ascertain the proportion of the distributable fund which belonged to each, that <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>was entitled on account of her legacy, to <em>615 </em>dollars 99 cents, and that she was entitled on account of the chariot bequeathed to her, and which had been sold by the executor, and on account of a debt due to her, to the further sum of 251 dollars 32\u00bd cents, on the 1st of January 1816, of which 234 dollars 82 cents was principal, making the whole amount due her 867 dollars 32\u00bd cents, the Court decreed that the executors of <em>Nathaniel Burwell. </em>out of the assets of their testator, if so much they had, and if not, out of their own estate, they admitting assets, should pay to the plaintiff the said sum of 867 dollars 32\u00bd cents, with interest on 234 dollars 82 cents, part thereof, from the 1st day of January 1816, until paid, but without costs. Upon this decree, the plaintiff took out an execution, and the clerk fixed the interest at six <em>per cent, per an</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>num, </em>instead of five <em>per cent.; </em>the debt having been in<em>c</em>urred m 1793.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIq\">At the same term of the Court, <em>Robert Anderson, </em>as administrator of <em>Ann Craig, </em>who, or whose representative) had not before been a party to the suit, asked leave to file an amended and supplemental bill, claiming the legacy of said <em>Ann Craig </em>as unsatisfied; and <em>George W. Richardson, </em>administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>William Pasteur </em>the younger, at the same time asked leave to file his answer to said bill. These motions were opposed by the executors of <em>Nathaniel Burwell, </em>on the grounds that the amended bill was offered by the representative of a new party not claiming in any way under the plaintiff in the suit; and that it was the assertion for the first time of an old and stale claim, asserted after the lapse of more than fifty years, on behalf of parties who never asserted such claims in their lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">The Court allowed the bill and answer to be filed, and sent the cause to rules for further proceedings to be had thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">The amended and supplemental bill sets up the claim to <em>Mrs. Craig\u2019s </em>legacy; states that <em>William Pasteur </em>the younger, was also entitled to a legacy under the will of <em>Dr. Pasteur, </em>and makes <em>Richardson, </em>sheriff of the county of <em>Fluvanna, </em>and as such administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>William Pasteur </em>the younger, and <em>Nathaniel Burwell\u2019s </em>executors, defendants, and asks for the amount due the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-9\"><em>Richardson, </em>in his answer, says he has no personal knowledge of the matters stated in the original and amended bills; but he claims from <em>Burwell\u2019s </em>executors the amount of the legacy bequeathed to his intestate by <em>William Pasteur </em>the elder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-10\"><em>Burwell\u2019s </em>executors answered the amended and supplemental bill. They say, that <em>William Pasteur </em>died in 1791; that in 1792, after the death of Mrs. <em>Pasteur, </em>the executor sold all the property and paid the debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and legacies : That in the year 1810, he settled his accounts before commissioners appointed by the Court of probat, and the account was returned to the clerk of said Court, by which it appeared that there was a balance in favour of the executor of \u00a3 328. 3. 8\u00bd. That from an account, kept in the books of their testator, between himself and <em>Ann </em>Craig, it appears that from the year 1792, when she is charged with her purchases at the sale of <em>William Pasteur\u2019s </em>estate, to 1796, when the account terminates, he had advanced to her \u00a3211. 9. 2\u00bd. That they learn from the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental bill, that <em>Ann Craig </em>died after the year 1818 ; and during her life she does not appear ever to have claimed that her legacy remained unpaid. That it had not been set up by her representative until a few months previous. They, therefore, rely upon the lapse of more than fifty years since her right accrued, as a bar to this suit, especially as both the executor and <em>Mrs. Craig </em>are dead, and neither of their present representatives can have any knowledge of the original transaction. That the only knowledge they have of the payment of this claim by their testator to <em>Ann Craig, </em>is that contained in the settled administration account aforesaid, in which they find the sum of \u00a3 211. 9. 2\u00bd. charged to her on account of her interest under the will of <em>William Pasteur, </em>in his estate. And this, they have no doubt, was more than she was entitled to, as on that account the executor was in advance to the estate \u00a3 328. 3. 8\u00bd. They have no doubt that the items in this account, against <em>Ann Craig, </em>were supported by vouchers before they were admitted by the commissioners, but they do not know where these vouchers now are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-9\">They say they have no personal knowledge of the mode in which the legacy of \u00a3 200. to <em>William Pasteur, jr., </em>was paid ; but they believe it was adjusted by his purchasing at the sale of the property of <em>William Pasteur, sr., </em>an amount fully equal to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>his legacy. That this belief is induced by the fact that after the treaty with <em>Great Britain, </em>known as <em>Jay's </em>treaty, the executor of <em>William Pasteur </em>was obliged to pay large sums of money to British creditors of <em>William Pasteur; </em>and he instituted an action in the County court of <em>Fluvanna </em>against <em>William Pasteur, jr., </em>to recover back the whole or a part of the money paid to him on account of said <em>legacy, </em>which suit, they are informed by a letter written about the time by a gentleman who was counsel in the cause, but who was not present at the trial, was lost through the mismanagement of counsel. That all the distributees of <em>William Pasteur, sr., </em>except <em>Ann Craig, </em>who was very poor, and <em>William Pasteur, jr., </em>did pay back a part, if not <em>the </em>whole, of <em>the money </em>they had received from the executor <em>Nathaniel Burwell, </em>when he was obliged to pay the British creditors. They do not know when <em>William Pasteur, jr., </em>died, but he was alive in 1809, when the suit aforesaid was pending against him; and they rely upon the lapse of time as a bar to the claim, especially as they believe it has been fully paid at least fifty-five years since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-4\">The defendants filed with their answer the letter referred to, and also a copy of the record in the case against <em>William Pasteur, jr. </em>This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>founded on an account which purports to be for slaves and other property purchased at the sale by the executor, and money paid by the executor\u2019s agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">The cause came on to be heard in March <em>1848, when </em>the Court made the following decree: The Court regarding the present proceeding by an amended and supplemental bill as virtually a new suit to recover legacies due more than fifty years ago to <em>Ann Craig </em>and <em>William Pasteur, jr., </em>and being of opinion that these circumstances, independent of the presumption from length of time, tend strongly to shew that the claims of both <em>Mrs. Craig </em>and <em>William Pasteur </em>have been satisfied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and being further of opinion that were this less probable, the length of time is itself an insuperable obstacle to the relief asked by the amended and supplemental bill of <em>Ann Craig\u2019s </em>administrator, and by the answer of the defendant, the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>William Pasteur </em>deceased, because the Courts ought not, upon sound principles of equity, as well as of public policy, to open their doors to parties who have slept on their rights for a time double that which would bar a writ of right, unless perhaps in cases of fraud, doth therefore adjudge, order and decree, that the said amended and supplemental bill be dismissed, with costs. From the decrees of March 1845 and March 1848, <em>Anderson, </em>as the administrator of <em>Mrs. Pasteur, </em>and of <em>Mrs. Craig, </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-5\"><em>Stanard &amp; Bouldin, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-6\">The Court below erred in refusing to give interest upon <em>Mrs. Pasteur\u2019s </em>legacy. <em>A </em>legacy in its own nature bears interest at least from the end of the year after the testator\u2019s death, unless some other period is fixed by the will: And this is without regard to the question whether the fund out of which it is to be paid is or is not productive. 2 Roper on Leg. 1245; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Atk. R. 108; 2 Rob. Pr. 106, 7, 8, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-7\">The ground on which interest was refused in the Court below, is, that the fund out of which the legacies were to be paid, was unproductive, and if interest was allowed on <em>Mrs. Pasteur\u2019s </em>legacy, the fund would be exhausted, so that the residuary legatees would get nothing. This objection was suggested in some of the earlier cases, but it has been exploded. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Bott, </em>7 Ves. R. 89; <em>Pearson </em>v. Pearson, 1 Sch. &amp; Lef. 10; 2 Roper on Leg. 1251; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Atk. R. 108; 2 Lomax\u2019s Ex\u2019ors 154; 2 Maddox Ch. 78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Another ground taken by the Court below is, that all these legatees are residuary legatees. There is nothing in the will of <em>Dr. Pasteur </em>to authorize this assumption. The will directs that <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>and <em>William Pasieur, jr., </em>shall be first paid; and then that <em>Mrs. Smith </em>and <em>Mrs. Craig </em>shall have the residue of the fund. The provision of the will providing for the abatement of the legacies had the effect to reduce the sum which <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>was to receive as her legacy, but not to change its character. If <em>William Pasteur </em>had died before the testator, it cannot be pretended that <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>would have been entitled to share this fund; and if not she cannot be a residuary legatee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">We have found no case in which the point involved in this case has been directly decided; but the principle involved in it has been repeatedly recognized. 1 Roper on Leg. 412; <em>Farmer </em>v. Mills, 3 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 580; <em>Scott v. Salmond, </em>7 Id. 86; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Poulden, </em>3 Hare\u2019s R. 555.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-8\">The supplemental bill of <em>Craig's </em>administrator was dismissed on the hearing by the Court below, on the ground that it was filed too late. The bill was filed so soon as a residuum was ascertained to exist. We do not understand that Courts of equity ever refuse relief on the ground simply of lapse of time. In this case there has been no payment away of the fund; no new rights have accrued, no innocent persons are to suffer, no loss of evidence has occurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-9\">The executors of <em>Nathaniel Burwell </em>do not pretend that they have paid <em>Mrs. Craig's </em>legacy. Then, did their testator pay it ? These parties attempted to defend themselves upon the ground of the presumption of payment of <em>Mrs. Pasteur's </em>legacy in the case of <em>Bur-well's executors </em>against <em>Anderson, </em>but they failed. That was a specific legacy, and this Court held that the presumption of payment did not exist. It is <em>a fortiori, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>therefore, that there can be no presumption of the payment of a residuary legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">But further, <em>Nathaniel Burwell </em>made an <em>ex parte </em>settlement of his executorial accounts in 1810; certainly he did not admit then that there was a residuum. If there was no residuum, the residuary legatee could have received nothing; and in fact it was not ascertained that there was a residuum until 1845.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">In this account of 1810, the executor charges <em>Mrs. Craig </em>with \u00a3 211. 9. 2\u00bd. on account of her legacy. This was not a payment in money, but by an account of <em>Nathaniel B uno ell </em>against <em>Mrs. Craig. </em>If this is a proper charge, it must be conclusive to shew that he paid no more: And that was much less than the amount to which she was then entitled. But this account shews on its face that it is a private account between <em>Nathaniel Burwell </em>and <em>Ann Craig. </em>There is no proof of it, though there was an attempt and a failure to prove it in 1821, and again in 1826. If then they failed to prove it in 1848, it was not because of the loss of evidence but because it never existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">If <em>Mrs. Craig </em>had been a party to this controversy from its commencement in 1818, she could not have had a decree for her legacy until 1845, when the existence of a residuum was first established. She was entitled to nothing unless there was a residuum ; and this question was prosecuted by the specific legatee from 1818 up to 1845. Surely there was no necessity for two suits to establish the same facts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-11\"><em>Cooke, </em>for <em>Burwell's </em>executors,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANx\">submitted a printed argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-12\">In support of the proposition that legacies bear interest <em>when the executor has assets, </em>the counsel for <em>Anderson </em>referred to 2 Roper on Leg. 1245, <em>et seq.; Lloyd </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 Atk. R. 110; 2 Rob. Prac. 106, 107 and 108, and the cases there cited; 2 Lomax\u2019s Dig. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>154; and he could easily have referred to a hundred other cases to the same effect. For there is no doctrine better established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYLX\">But, to.make the doctrine useful to Anderson, administrator of <em>Mrs. Pasteur, </em>he must shew that <em>Col. Burwell, </em>executor of <em>Dr. Pasteur, </em>had assets in his hands wherewith to pay interest on her legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-7\">The Court of appeals, in its decree of December 10, 1831, took great pains to settle every principle which could bear on the question of the amount of assets in <em>Col. Burwell's </em>hands, subject to these legacies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-8\">It is impossible that anything can be more perspicuous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-9\">It is admitted by the counsel, that those principles have been carried out in the paper, which is the basis of the decree complained of, so far, at least, as to ascertain that the residuum, divisible on some terms, or on some principles, among <em>Elizabeth Pasteur, William Pasteur </em>the younger, <em>Ann Smith </em>and <em>Ann Craig, </em>is 4392 dollars 82 cents. They admit, too, that, according to the doctrines of this forum, reviewed and affirmed by this Court, in this very controversy, (3 Leigh 348,) there is no power in <em>Venice </em>which can make <em>Col. Burwell </em>liable for one dollar of interest on the 4392 dollars 82 cents, the whole of it being interest. They admit, too, that if it be conceded that <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>cannot recover interest from any quarter, the court below has correctly decided that 615 dollars 99 cents is the true amount of her abated legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-10\">Whence, then, is the <em>interest </em>claimed for <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>to come ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-11\">The learned counsel answer that it must come out of the shares or legacies of her co-legatees, <em>Ann Smith </em>and <em>Ann Craig. </em>And they have cited, in order to sustain this doctrine, that <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>has a right to devour her co-legatees, the sister and niece of her husband and testator, a number of English authorities, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Roper on Leg. 412; <em>Farmer </em>v. Wills, 4 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 86 ; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Salmond, </em>Id. vol. <em>7, </em>p. 86; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Poulden, </em>3 Hare 555.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">But these authorities merely set forth the undisputed doctrine that where a testator gives to A 500 dollars, and to B the residuum of his estate, A will receive interest on his legacy, to the diminution of B\u2019s residuum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">But this will of <em>Dr. Pasteur </em>is not such a will as I have just stated. It is a will of a special and peculiar character, and received an exposition by this Court, in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>on the 10th December 1831.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">The Court, after pointing out, in detail, and with great precision, the mode of ascertaining the amount and <em>character </em>of the fund remaining in the executor\u2019s hands, goes on to say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-7\">\u201c After having ascertained <em>the true state </em>of the executorial account, the commissioner should proceed to state an account, in order to ascertain <em>the proportion of their legacies which the respective legatees were entitled to receive, </em>after payment of the debts of the estate, in which statement <em>the whole </em>of the pecuniary legacies, including the risiduary legacies, <em>are to abate proportionally. </em>In order to attain the result, the commissioner should first ascertain the whole amount of the principal of the estate, then deduct that portion first appropriated by the will to the payment of debts, and the balance will shew what would have been the residuum (if not reduced by debts) out of which <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>was to have received her five hundred pounds, and <em>William Pasteur's </em>nephew his \u00a3 200 sterling ; and after deducting these, <em>Mrs. Craig </em>would have had one third of the residue, and <em>Mrs. Smith </em>the balance. And thus, the proportion of their respective legacies, in case the residuum was unimpaired, is ascertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">\u201cBut as the residuum was, in fact, greatly reduced by debts, <em>the legacies </em>must abate, <em>and as by the will the abatement is to fall upon all the legacies, and not on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>the residuum alone, </em>the commissioner will make the following statement: as the whole residuum, if unimpaired by debts, is to the five hundred pounds legacy, so is the real residuum, as reduced by the debts, to the <em>real sum </em>due <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>on account of the legacy of five hundred pounds.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">On this exposition comment is unnecessary. It is a total extinction of <em>Mrs. Pasteur's jus </em>devorandi\u2014or right of eating up her co-legatees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">2. But the petitioner, Anderson, insists that the Court below should have allowed him costs, viz: in the decree of 1845.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">The answer to this claim is, 1. That the decree was not a final one, as will presently appear; and so it was not <em>necessary </em>to decide the question of costs, though it might have been done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-9\">2. But if the decree is to be considered as final, then I say that the Court properly refused to give <em>Anderson </em>his costs. And for this I refer to <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Pearson &amp; al. </em>1 Sch. &amp; Lef. 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-10\">In this case, as far as regards <em>Mrs. Pasteur's </em>claim to the legacy of \u00a3 500, there were grave doubts whether she took anything. Nay, as late as 1831, it was strenuously urged by able counsel, that she took nothing, but a mere power to dispose of \u00a3 500, which she never exercised, and which died with her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-11\">Before I leave this part of the case, I beg leave to suggest that the decree of the Court below is erroneous, in omitting to state the rate of interest on the interest-bearing part of the decree against the executors. They are decreed to pay 234 dollars 82 cents, \u201c with interest thereon from the 1st day of January 1816, till paid.\u201d It ought to have been 5 per cent. For want of such specification, the plaintiff <em>Anderson, </em>obtained from the clerk ah execution for the amount of the decree, including the 234 dollars 82 cents, with interest at the rate of <em>six </em>per cent. And though he did not place the exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>cution in the hands of the sheriff, he received the six per cent, interest, as an authenticated copy of the receipt of his agent, now before me, shews. I ask that the decree may be corrected in this particular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-4\">The fact that <em>Ann Craig\u2019s </em>administrator and <em>William Pasteur\u2019s </em>sheriff-administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>who are the <em>actors </em>in this new suit, arc, in it, preferring, <em>for the first time, </em>their respective claims to a legacy which fell due <em>more than half a century </em>before this proceeding or new suit was commenced, is one which no ingenuity can explain away, or get round or over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">A large portion of the argument by <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>counsel, is devoted to the establisment of the proposition that the peculiar circumstances of this case repel and repudiate <em>the presumption that these legacies have been paid </em>by <em>Dr. Pasteur\u2019s </em>executors. If the learned counsel had succeeded in this effort, (which they assuredly have not,) they would have but established <em>an immaterial proposition.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\">For, if the adjudicated cases establish <em>any </em>principle, they establish <em>this, </em>that stale and ancient claims are rejected and repudiated by Courts of equity, simply because they <em>are </em>stale and antiquated, and on grounds of public policy, even though there be no ground to presume payment, but the contrary. Look at the doctrine of Lord <em>Camden, </em>in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>quoted in 5 Leigh 171, and see if any thing is said <em>there </em>about a presumption of <em>payment </em>from lapse of time, and no demand made :</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">\u201c A Court of equity, which is never active in relief against conscience or <em>public convenience, </em>has always refused its aid to stale claims, <em>where the party has slept on his rights, and acquiesced for a great length of time. </em>Nothing can call this Court into activity, but conscience, good faith and <em>reasonable diligence; </em>where these are wanting, the Court is passive and does no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>thing. <em>Laches </em>and neglect are always discountenanced, , and, therefore, from the beginning of this jurisdiction, there was always a limitation to suits in this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHM\">Again, Judge <em>Carr </em>says, in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>5 Leigh 173:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyS\"><em>a </em>Equity, always averse to stale claims, will not be \u2018called into activity,\u2019 in aid of <em>legatees </em>after a great lapse of <em>time; especially </em>if the original parties are <em>all dead, </em>[as in the case of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Burwell,] </em>and their representatives allege their inability to furnish the accounts. It was said that this rule did not apply to <em>residuary legatees; </em>but I think it applies to them <em>especially ; </em>for <em>their </em>claim always involves a settlement of the whole accounts of the administration.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-9\">Again, in <em>Bonney </em>v. <em>Ridgard, </em>1 Cox 145, (referred to by Judge <em>Carr, </em>in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>174:)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-10\">\u201c Lord <em>Kenyon </em>considered the transaction one which would have been set aside, and <em>relief given, </em>if the bill had been filed in <em>time; </em>but upon the length of time that had elapsed, between the plaintiff's\u2019 right accruing, and their prosecuting it, he refused relief.\u201d Not a word is said about a presumption of compensation or satisfaction of the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-11\">In the same page, (174,) Judge <em>Carr </em>quotes with approbation the opinion of Lord <em>Erskine, </em>in <em>Hillary </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>12 Ves. R. 239. Judge <em>Carr </em>says, \u201c The general ground of presumptions from length of time, is also very clearly taken by Lord <em>Erskine </em>in <em>Hillary </em>v. <em>Waller. </em>He considers the doctrine as founded on reason, the nature and character of man, and the result of human experience.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-12\">\u201c It resolves itself (says Lord <em>Erskine) </em>into <em>this, </em>that aman will naturally enjoy what belongs to <em>him.\u201d\u2014\u201cIt has been said you cannot presume unless you believe. It is because there are no means of creating belief </em>or disbelief, that such general presumptions are raised,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Again, Judge <em>Carr, </em>in p. 175, at the bottom, refers to <em>Hercy </em>v. <em>Dinwoody, 2 </em>Ves. jr. R. 87:</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-4\"><em>\u201c </em>There a bill was filed by creditors for an account: it was filed recently and answered; it remained in Court with but few further proceedings, and, thirty-three years after, the executors being dead, the bill was revived against their representatives and devisees; the master of the rolls refused the account and dismissed the bill. It was contended, there, that the matter being in suit, and the defendants called on to account, they could not discharge themselves <em>by a payment or settlement in pais; </em>and therefore that this case was not open to the <em>presumption </em>applicable to others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">The master of the rolls admitted this, but said, \u201c For the reasons given in <em>Deloraine </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 633, <em>independent of the question of satisfaction, </em>but on account of <em>the very neglect, </em>and the mischief and disturbance that may arise to families, though the presumption of satisfaction is not so strong, yet <em>the laches and neglect may be such as to make it matter of public policy, that the party guilty of it shall abide by the consequences.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-6\">It is abundantly clear, from these authorities, that it is not incumbent on the two surviving executors of <em>Col. Burwell, </em>executor of <em>Pasteur, </em>to contend that these legacies <em>must be presumed to have been paid. </em>The doctrine they have a right to rely on is, that these two actors, viz : <em>Ann Craig\u2019s </em>administrator and <em>William Pasteur, jr.\u2019s, </em>administrator <em>de bonis non, have forfeited by their laches, </em>all claim to the assistance of a Court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-8\">This is a naked, unmitigated case of <em>sleeping for half a century and more. </em>Neither the bill of <em>Ann Craig\u2019s </em>administrator, nor the answer of <em>William Pasteur\u2019s </em>administrator <em>de bonis non, attempts </em>to explain or excuse the long delay that has taken place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>But if the defence were merely, that, after so great a lapse of time, so long a <em>non-claim, </em>payment ought to be presumed, it would equally be borne out and sustabled. The <em>mere fact of </em>non-claim for fifty odd years\u2019 raises a strong presumption that there <em>was </em>no claim, or rather that <em>it was discharged at an early day.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">But the record of the action of <em>Pasteur\u2019s </em>executors against <em>Pasteur, </em>shews that the executors contended, in 1802, that young <em>Pasteur </em>had received, in purchases and cash, above \u00a3 400. They were defeated, it seems, by the mismanagement of their counsel, in 1808. There can be little doubt that <em>Pasteur </em>set up his legacy of \u00a3 200 sterling as an offset against the claim of the plaintiff. If he <em>did </em>not\u2014if the legacy was then unsatisfied\u2014why did he not, while his blood was <em>hot </em>with litigation, bring a suit for his legacy ? The parties were at war about the state of their accounts, in 1808. <em>The war ceased: </em>it is not renewed till after the lapse of thirty-seven years; and <em>then, </em>not by <em>Pasteur, </em>nor by <em>Pasteur\u2019s first </em>personal representative who, it must be presumed, got the <em>books and papers of </em>his intestate into his possession, but by a sheriff-administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>who frankly admits that he knows nothing about the claim, good, bad or indifferent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-6\">Then, as to the presumption that <em>Ann Craig\u2019s </em>legacy was <em>paid. </em>Gentlemen say that there is no proof that any part of it was paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-7\">Have gentlemen forgotten the A B C principle, that these County court settlements are <em>prima facie </em>evidence for the executor. The recorded settlement <em>made </em>in this case in 1810, credits the executor with \u00a3 211. 9. 2\u00bd. paid to <em>Ann Craig </em>\u201cunder the will.\u201d If the answer filed in this cause by the executors be true, the items making up this sum ran on from 1792 to 1796 <em>; </em>though in the settled account it is dated 1809. Gentlemen say that there was due to <em>Ann Craig, </em>as of <em>May </em>1806, 1156 dollars 28 cents. I have not examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>their statement or calculation; but concede it to be so. If on the sum of \u00a3 211. 9. 2\u00bd., or 704 dollars 87 cents, interest from 1794, the medium date of their payments, be calculated at 5 per cent., the amount will be 1127 dollars 75 cents, or within 28 dollars 53 cents of the alleged amount of the legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-4\">This was the state of things in 1806. In 1810 the account was settled by the executor, and no further payments had <em>then </em>been made. But <em>Col. Burwell, </em>for all that appears in this record, <em>(and in fact,) </em>survived this settlement several years, say seven. <em>Ann Craig </em>was exceedingly needy, and must be presumed, as she lived till <em>after </em>1818, to have asked and received further payments or advances by the executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">But it is said that the executors of the executor do not <em>claim </em>that more than \u00a3 211. 9. 2\u00bd. has been paid to <em>Ann Craig. </em>The answer is, that they know little or nothing about the matter, except that in a book of <em>Col. Burwell, </em>they find an account stated, beginning in 1792 and ending in 1796, shewing payments to <em>Ann Craig </em>of \u00a3 211. 9. 2\u00bd. For aught they know, their testator may have made payments after the settlement, the evidence of which is now lost. They say they know not where the vouchers are.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">But after all, the great question of the case is, will this Court of equity entertain a bill for a legacy exhibited fifty odd years after the legacy was due, in which bill not even an <em>attempt </em>is made to account for, or excuse the delay.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-14\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ab-\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The Court is of opinion, that <em>Dr. William Pasteur </em>by his will having directed that out of the proceeds of the residuum of his estate, directed to be sold, there should be paid a legacy of \u00a3 500 in favour of his wife <em>Elizabeth Pasteur, </em>and a legacy of \u00a3 200 sterling to his nephew <em>William Pasteur; </em>and that, after deduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ing these sums, the residue of said proceeds should be paid, in given proportions, to his niece <em>Ann Smith, </em>and for the use and benefit of his sister <em>Ann Craig: </em>the effect of these provisions was to constitute his said neice and nephew residuary legatees of said proceeds, in reference to the said pecuniary legacies to his wife and nephew. But that the said will having also directed that if a certain fund, thereby appropriated to the payment of the testator\u2019s debts, should prove inadequate for that purpose, then that the deficiency should be made up by deducting the amount thereof, in ratable proportions, from the legacies bequeathed as aforesaid to his wife, nephew, niece and sister; the effect of this provision was to place them all, in reference to the testator\u2019s creditors, upon the same footing, to wit, that of residuary legatees ; without, however, in any wise disturbing the relation above mentioned in which they stood in reference to each other. After the reduction, therefore, of the said several legacies requisite for the payment of debts, the reduced sums payable to the said <em>Elizabeth Pasteur </em>and <em>William Pasteur, </em>on account of their legacies, stood upon the same footing as if those reduced sums had been specified in the will, as the pecuniary legacies bequeathed to them respectively. And as according to the well settled rule of equity, pecuniary legacies payable out of the residuary estate bear interest until payment, whether the fund out of which they are to be paid be productive or unproductive, it follows that though the residue of the estate in the hands of the executor, after payment of debts, consisted wholly of interest, yet that the abated legacy of <em>Mrs. Pasteur </em>ought to carry interest at <em>the rate </em>of 5 <em>per cent, per annum, </em>from the 1st day of January 1793 until paid.</p>\n<p id=\"AN8U\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that so much of the Chancellor\u2019s decree of the 31st of March 1845, as fails to allow interest on 615 dollars 99 cents, the abated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>legacy of <em>Mrs. </em>Pasteur, at the rate of 5 <em>per cent, per annum </em>from the 1st day of January 1793 till paid, is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">And the Court is further of opinion, that by a clerical misprision, the said decree of the 31st of March 1845, is also erroneous in giving interest at 6, instead of 5 <em>per cent, </em>on 234 dollars 82 cents, also found in favour of <em>Mrs. Pasteur, </em>and which, with a portion of interest which had accrued thereon prior to the 1st of January 1816, and the said sum of 615 dollars 99 cents, her abated legacy, makes the aggregate sum of 867 dollars 32 cents directed to be paid to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the said decree of the 31st of March 1845, is moreover erroneous in refusing to allow to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">And the Court is further of opinion, for the reasons assigned by the Chancellor, that the claims to the pecuniary legacy of \u00a3 200 sterling to <em>William Pasteur, </em>and the residuary legacy to <em>Ann Craig, </em>ought not to he sustained ; and therefore that there is no error in the decree of the 14th of March 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that so much of the decree of the 31st of March 1845, as is in conflict with the foregoing opinion, be reversed and annulled, and that the residue thereof, and the decree of the 14th of March 1848 be affirmed, with costs to appellant : and the cause is remanded to the Chancery court to be proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
