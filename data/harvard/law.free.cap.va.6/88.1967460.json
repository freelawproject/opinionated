That all three were by rule of Court referred to four arbitrators, or any three of them; and that the money awarded to the said <em>Anderson, </em>if any, was to be paid to the Sheriff, for the benefit of his creditors. That, at a subsequent Court, two other referees were added to the former. That an award was afterwards made by three of the referees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>that is to say, two of those first appointed, and one of those who were last appointed, whereby, it was awarded that the petitioner was justly indebted to the said <em>Anderson </em>in the sum of 2057. 19s. <em>8d. </em>exclusive of a claim that the said <em>Anderson </em>had against the petitioner as common bail to <em>Gadberry. </em>That the County Court gave judgment for Anderson, \u2019according to this award, with costs. That the petitioner appealed to the District Court, where the judgment was affirmed. That an execution issued, on the District Court judgment; and the petitioner gave a forthcoming bond, which he forfeited; and judgment has been entered on it against him. That these proceedings were en-oneous. 1. Because the award was not legally made, or in pursuance of the authority given the said arbitrators; it being made up by only .two of the first named arbitrators and one of those last named. 2. Because the award was not final; as it appeared there was a matter in controversy between the parties, which was not s\u00e9ttled by the said arbitrators. 3. Because the Court in rendering judgment gave costs, although none were awarded by the arbitrators. 4. Because the execution and all subsequent proceedings were in the name of <em>George Anderson, </em>without mentioning the Sheriff, to whom the money was to be paid for the benefit of the creditors, according to the order of reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">The award, after \u25a0 reciting the suits, &amp;c. proceeds thus: \u201cWe are of opinion, and do award accordingly, that the said <em>Coupland </em>is justly, indebted to the said <em>Anderson, </em>in the sum of two hundred- and five pounds, nineteen shillings and eight pence; which will more fully appear by referring to the above statement of their accounts, exclusive of a claim that <em>Anderson </em>has against <em>Coupland, </em>as common bail for <em>William Gadberry, </em>now pending in the District, Court of <em>Prince </em>Edward. Given under our hands, &amp;e.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">The entry of the judgment of the County <em>Court </em>upon the award isas follows: \u201cIn consideration whereof, it is the opinion of the Court, that the plaintiff recover against the defendant, the aforesaid sum of two hundred and five pounds, nineteen shillings and .eight pence, <em>and his costs </em>by him in this behalf expended; to be paid to the Sheriff^ for the benefit of <em>George Anderson\u2019s </em>creditors, so far as just claims against the plaintiff may appear: To which opinion of the Court, the defendant by his attorney objected, because the submission of the three suits aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>are made in one award and blended together, when they 0US^ have appeared distinct and separate; and because the suit brought against the defendant,' in the name of <em>George Anderson, </em>is impropei\u2019, he having become an in-' solvent debtor before the commencement of the action. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The execution is, that the Sheriff should make of <em>Coup-land\u2019s </em>goods and chattels, <em>2051. </em>19s. <em>8d. </em>\u201cWhich <em>George Anderson </em>recovered against him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">The forthcoming bond is payable to <em>George Anderson; </em>and the judgment,\u201e on it, is rendered in favour of <em>George Anderson, </em>without mentioning his creditors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">Objected 1. That by the first order of reference, four referees were appointed; and then it was agreed that any three might make an award. But, as two others were afterwards added, this altered that agreement; and therefore, from that time three were not enough. For, it is apparent that it was the intention of the parties, that a majority should decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXO\">2. The submission was, of all matters in dispute between the parties; but the referees have not included the claim concerning the responsibility as bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-13\">3. The referees did not award costs, and yet the Court has given them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-14\">4. The execution and subsequent proceedings are in the name of <em>George Anderson </em>only,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-15\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-16\">Awards are construed more liberally than formerly\u201e The addition of the other two did not alter the first consent, that three might decide. That consent is not taken away by express words, and there is nothing .which implies it. On the contrary, the last order refers to the first;. and the agreement there extends to both. For, the last order is but a component part of the first.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmW\">As to the ease of the bail, it never was contemplated by the parties that the submission should extend to that. For, that claim was too contingent and uncertain, whether any liability would ever attach or not. <em>Kyd </em>on Aw. 91, has an excellent general rule on subjects of this kind; and proves the impropriety of extending submissions beyond the intention of the parties. The defendant has shewn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>his own idea on this point;' for, when the award was presented into Court, no exception was taken upon that ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">As to the costs, if wrongly given, no supersedeas or appeal will be sustained on that ground merely. But the Court had power to give them. For, originally the arbitrators could not; and. their authority to award them, was at last founded on the permission for that purpose given by the rule of Court. <em>Kyd </em>on Aw. 100. But, the Court always had a right to grant costs; and plaintiffs were entitled to them at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">That the execution and subsequent proceedings were in the name of <em>George Jlnderson, </em>without mentioning the Sheriff to whom the money was to be paid, is no objection. For the words of the judgment are, that they shall be paid to the Sheriff, which controls the subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>PER CUR.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court is of opinion, that the said judgment is erroneous in this, that it was omitted to be entered therein, that the money was to be paid to the Sheriff for the benefit of the creditors of the defendant, so far as just claims against him might appear. Therefore, it is considered that the same be reversed, &amp;c. and this Court proceeding to give such judgment as the said District Court ought to have given. It is further considered, that the defendant recover against the plaintiff, four hundred and fifty-seven pounds, five shillings and eight pence, the penalty of the forthcoming bond in the proceedings mentioned, and his costs in the said District Court expended, to be paid to the Sheriff for the benefit of the creditors of the defendant, so far as just claims against him may appear: But to be discharged by the payment of 228/. 12s. IO\u00e9Z. with interest thereon to be computed after the rate of five <em>per centum per annum, </em>from the 16th day of <em>Jlpril, 1796, till </em>payment, and the costs. <em>\u201d</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
