And, after other specific legacies: <em>\u201c </em>Item, my intent and meaning is, that my well-beloved wife <em>Susanna Simmons </em>shall enjoy the labor of the slaves given during widowhood, may be during her life, with their future increase, and then to be divided, at her discretion, amongst my children.\u201d That <em>Susanna Edwards, </em>one of the testator\u2019s children, was living at his death; and that his widow, in pursuance of the power, appointed and disposed of one of the said slaves (named <em>Joan) </em>and her increase to the said <em>Susanna Edwards, </em>to take effect, in possession, after the death of the said widow, who reserved to herself the use of the said slave and increase, during her own life. That the plaintiffs <em>Susanna Owen </em>and <em>John </em>Edwards, are the only children and legal representatives of the said <em>Susanna Edwards, </em>who died intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">That the said <em>Susanna Simmons, </em>the widorv, after-wards, had her will wrote; and, thereby, in pursuance of her power, devised four of the first mentioned slaves to the plaintiff <em>Susanna, </em>and her sister <em>Martha; </em>who is since dead intestate, leaving the plaintiffs <em>Susanna Owen </em>and <em>John Edwards </em>her co-heirs. That she, at another time, directed the writer of her said will to insert some other bequests; but, expressly desired that, just mentioned, to be retained unaltered. That the writer, through <em>hurry </em>and mistake, in copying the original draft, left <em>it out </em>That the will was executed, without being read to the testatrix; and, therefore, although admitted to record since her death, is not the last will of the said testatrix: But, if it is, that still the plaintiffs have sustained an injury, through accident. That, of all the children of <em>Henry Simmons </em>the testator, only <em>Mason, </em>the wife of <em>Morris, </em>was alive, at the death of the said <em>Susanna Simmons, </em>the widow: who, by her said will, devised sundry of the first mentioned slaves to the said <em>Mason; </em>and others of them <em>to the descendants </em>of the other children of the said <em>Henry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Simmons, </em>except the plaintiffs <em>Susanna </em>and <em>John; </em>who were deprived by accident as aforesaid. That the plaintiffs <em>Susanna </em>and <em>John </em>are entitled to the first appointment of the slave <em>Joan; </em>and to the four intended to be devised, if the said instrument is the last will of the said <em>Susanna. Simmons, </em>the widow. Or, if it is not, that then they are entitled, under the statute of distributions, as representing their mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">The answer of <em>Morris </em>and wife, denies the appointment of the slave <em>Joan. </em>Admits the defendants have heard of the said first will being drawn, but not executed, by the said Susanna <em>Simmons. </em>States, that a will was afterwards duly made, and executed by her; which devised one of <em>Joan\u2019s </em>children, by the name of <em>Moses, </em>to the plaintiff <em>John. </em>That the defendants have heard, the testatrix intended to insert a clause in favor of the complainants, but know nothing of their own knowledge, and call for proof, if the allegation is material. Admits that the defendant <em>Mason </em>was the only child, living at the testatrix\u2019s death; and submits to the decision of the Court. General replication and commissions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">A witness says, that she was present when the will was written: That it was not read to the testatrix; nor did she read it herself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\">Another witness speaks to the same effect as the last; and adds, that his father carried the will home: so that the testatrix never saw it afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-10\">A third witness says, that, in 1774, she was called by Mrs. <em>Susanna Simmons to take </em>notice, that she gave <em>Joan </em>(who was then present,) and her increase, to her daughter <em>Susanna Edioards; </em>reserving her own life therein. That, some time afterwards, <em>Susanna Edwards </em>wished to carry the slave home, but Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>refused, saying that she would never give them, out of her own possession, during her life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-11\">A fourth witness says, that, in 1791, Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>asked him to write her will; which he did; but, no witnesses being present, she deferred executing of it, until another time. That she did not carry a copy of it with her, but the deponent sent it to her a few days afterwards. That, in 1793, Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>sent for him, and told him she wished,some alterations in the will; which he found still unexecuted. That the deponent wrote the alterations; but, his mind was agitated, on account of his wife, who lay dangerously ill; and he does not recollect that he read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>over the transcribed copies to the testatrix. That the clauses, in the old will, were numbered; and he did the same in the new, making them equal, without adverting to the additional bequests; whereby, the devise to complainants was omitted. Recites the clause, and says, that the slaves, mentioned in it, he knows were once intended for the plaintiff <em>Susanna, </em>and her sister <em>Martha; </em>although Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>afterwards altered her mind as to <em>Moses, </em>and gave him to the plaintiff <em>John.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">A fifth witness says, that after the death of <em>Susanna Edwards, </em>she heard Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>say, she was sorry she had not given <em>Joan </em>to her, while living; as she feared she could not give her to her children, now she was dead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\">The will of <em>Susanna Simmons </em>(whereof the defendant <em>Morris </em>was appointed executor) gives a considerable proportion of the property to the defendant <em>Mason. </em>It also devises some trifles to the plaintiff <em>Susanna, </em>and her sister <em>Martha.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">The <em>Chancellor </em>decreed, that the parol gift of <em>Joan </em>and her increase to <em>Susanna Edwards </em>was good. And being of opinion that the plaintiffs could not claim her and under the will too, waived deciding the other points relative to the paper being a will; and, if a will, as to the right of correcting it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\">The defendants appealed to this Court; and so did the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-10\">The parol appointment, if good, is not sufficiently proved: For, there was a previous altercation between Mrs. <em>Edwards </em>and her mother, at the time of the supposed gift; and after the death of Mrs. <em>Edwards, </em>the mother expressed her concern, that she had not given her a slave, during her life-time; as she feared she could not now give it to her children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-11\">Besides, in order to make a gift effectual, it should be accompanied with a delivery of possession; otherwise, it amounts only to a mere intention, and is liable to be revoked. Want of possession, therefore, defeats the whole act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>But, if the parol gift were complete in all respects, it was still void, under the act of Assembly, [1758, c. 5, 7 <em>St at. Larg. </em>237,] for preventing fraudulent gifts of slaves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-8\">The claim for a provision under the will cannot be supported; for, although it might have been doubtful, whether, if the object of the intended appointment was capable of taking at the time, the Court would not have supplied the defective act, yet that question is not worth discussing in the present case; because the objects were incapable of taking: For grand-children cannot be substituted for children, under such a power as this. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>2 Ves. sen. 640; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams et </em>al. Cowp. 651; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Hardcastle, </em>2 Bro. C. C. 30, 344. The last case shews, that <em>Morris </em>may take the benefit of the devise, and a share of the surplus too.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-9\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-10\">The gift is proved expressly, and the subsequent declarations of Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>did not destroy if; for, it was not in her power to defeat the appointment, when once made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-11\">Possession was not necessary to be delivered; because, the gift was not to take effect, in possession, until after the death of the mother. It was, therefore, a mere gift of a remainder, which does not require actual tradition of the property. In this case, possession was, in fact, given, as far as the nature of the thing would admit of; because the slave was present, and the gift was attended with every circumstance, which could serve to shew a disposing mind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEU\">The statute respecting fraudulent gifts of slaves, <em>[April, </em>1757, c. 6, 7 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>118; <em>Sept. </em>1758, c. 5, Ibid. 237,] has no influence on the question: for the difference is, where an interest passes from the person making the appointment, and where it does not. The first requires the forms of the statute, but the other not. <em>Pow. </em>on Powers, 84. But here, no interest passed from Mrs. <em>Simmons; </em>because the devise to the children was absolute, and the mother had only a power of controlling it. So that her power was only collateral, and the exercise of it rather tended to divest the rights of the others, than to transfer a new interest to the appointee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-13\">Besides, it is a case not within the policy of the act; which was made to prevent <em>owners </em>from making fictitious gifts of their slaves, to the prejudice of creditors and purchasers. But here, Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>was not owner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>therefore the statute did not apply to her: For, neither a creditor or purchaser could complain of deception with regard to property, which she never owned, and with respect to which she was only a third person, exercising a collateral power over an estate, which belonged to another person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-3\">The will of Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>was void, because neither written by herself, nor wholly dictated by her at the time; nor read by herself, or to her, after it was written.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-4\">But, if the Court should be of opinion, that the parol appointment was insufficient, and that the will is good, but the grand-children could not be substituted for children, then the plaintiffs were entitled to their mother\u2019s share of the unappointed surplus; which ought to be decreed them,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-5\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-6\">If there is any question about the validity of the will of Mrs. <em>Simmo7is, </em>there should be an issue. But there is none, for it was written in her presence, and by her direction. The gift of the remainder of a slave without possession delivered, would not be good. In order to render it effectual, the donor should deliver the slave to the donee, with a stipulation, that the donee should re-deliver it to the donor, for his life. The act of fraudulent gifts does apply to the case: for, if a purchaser were to examine the will of <em>Henry Simmons, </em>and then to see a regular transfer from Mrs. <em>Simmons </em>in writing, he would be led to venture his money; although there might be a secret conveyance by parol, which was unknown to him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-7\">\n<em>Call.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWq\">The statute, neither in words or intention, embraces a case of this ldnd; for, it relates to owners only.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-12\">[* <em>Black. </em>Com.
