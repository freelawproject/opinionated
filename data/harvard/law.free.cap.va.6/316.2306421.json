The declaration <em>counted on </em>the bond as .being dated the 14th August 1811; and setting out the .condition, that the sheriff \u201c should well and truly execute and due return make of all process to him directed, and pay and satisfy.all sums of money and tohacco by him received in virtue of any such process, to the person or persons to whom the same should be due,\u201d\u2014assigned as the breach, that <em>Loyd, </em>in December 1810, sued out of the county court of <em>Loudoun, </em>a writ of <em>venditioni exponas </em>against the goods and chattels of one <em>Keene, </em>for 60 dollars, with interest &amp;c. which writ was delivered to <em>Binns, </em>a deputy of <em>Bennett, </em>then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sheriff of the county, and returned \u201c no sale for want of bidders;\u201d and afterwards in 3812, sued out another <em>venditioni exponas </em>for the same debt, which writ was also delivered to <em>Binns, </em>then also a deputy of <em>Bennett </em>the sheriff; on which last process, <em>Binns, </em>afterwards, on the 6th April 1816, acknowledged that he had received 72 dollars, which was then and there due to <em>Loyd, </em>by virtue of the process; and <em>Binns </em>had failed to pay the 72 dollars to <em>Loyd; </em>and so the condition of the sheriff\u2019s bond was broken. The defendant craved <em>oyer </em>of the bond and condition; and the bond shewn upon the oyer craved, was dated the 6th August 1810, instead of the 14th August 1811, the date of the bond counted on in the declaration. The defendant pleaded, 1. Conditions performed, on which an issue was made up. 2. That <em>Mr. Giles </em>was not the successor of governor <em>Tyler, </em>to whom the bond was given; to which the plaintiff replied, that he was, concluding with a verification; but no issue was formally made up. 3. That <em>Mr. Giles </em>was not, but <em>Mr. Monroe </em>was, the successor of governor <em>Tyler </em>to whom the bond was given; to which the plaintiff\u2019 demurred generally, and the court sustained the demurrer. A jury was sworn \u201c to try the issues on the first and second pleas,\u201d who found on both issues for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages by reason of the breach of the condition, to 128 dollars. Judgment for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by the payment of the 128 dollars damages &amp;c. to be levied <em>de lonis testatoris. </em>The defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-4\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AMd\">The plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the defendant\u2019s third plea, opened his own pleadings to objection, and made it the duty of the court to look back to the declaration. That counts on a bond dated the 14th August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>1811. The bond produced was dated 6th August 1810. This is a fatal variance; <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Graham\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>3 Cranch 229. Upon this ground, I think the judgment must be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant.</p>\n<author id=\"b334-5\">Tucker., <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AI8\">I think there are several fatal errors in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">1. The bond declared on, is recited as bearing date in 1811; that produced, and made part of the declaration upon <em>oyer, </em>is dated in 1810. That the variance is matter of substance, and fatal, appears by the case of <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Graham\u2019s adm\u2019r. </em>It appears by that case, too, that the error is not cured by pleading over: for the defendant there, pleaded conditions performed, as the defendant did <em>here; </em>the plaintiff replied, and assigned a breach, and the defendant rejoined a bad rejoinder, to which the plaintiff demurred; the court went back to the first fault, and entered judgment on the demurrer for the defendant. The case of <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrongs, </em>1 Leigh 491. is not in conflict with this opinion: in that case, the question was upon the trial of the issue before the jury; here, it is upon demurrer; and upon demurrer, where the defendant has taken <em>oyer, </em>he may take advantage of the variance; <em>Macon </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>1 Call 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">2. The declaration is further defective in averring, not that the deputy sheriff had <em>received </em>the amount of the execution, but that he had <em>acknowledged </em>he had done so. This was a bad averment. The receipt of the money was the gist of the action. It ought to have been directly averred, that the defendant might, if he chose, put it in issue. The <em>acknowledgment </em>of the receipt of it, did not offer proper matter upon which an issue could be made up. An issue made up on it would have been immaterial. For though it be true, that the deputy made the acknowledgment, it may be false that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>he received the money. And thus, though the issue was found for the plaintiff\u2019, the fact would not be established, on which his right of recovery depends; namely, the actual receipt of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">3. The plea itself to which the plaintiff has demurred, though evidently filed to entrap, cannot be pronounced to be bad in substance. It amounts, in effect, to a denial of the right of <em>Mr. Giles </em>to sue as the successor of governor <em>Tyler ; </em>and if the fact were true, as stated in the plea, it is obvious that <em>Mr. Giles </em>could have no right to sue. It was contended, that the same plea having been before pleaded, could not be pleaded a second time. This might have been a very good reason for the rejection of the plea by the court, but it does <em>not make the plea bad upon demurrer. </em>For the question on the demurrer is, whether the plea is a good plea, not whether the defendant should be permitted to file it. They are not equivalent questions; and, indeed, the first can never be presented to the court, until the second, has been decided, and decided, too, in favour of the party who offers the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Upon the merits, I incline to think the plaintiff is right; but for the foregoing errors, the judgment must be reversed, and a judgment entered for the defendant. In a future action, the plaintiff\u2019 may be more fortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Brockenbrough, Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred in the opinion of the president. Judgment reversed, and. judgment entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
