The conveyance was of 1000 acres, neither more nor less. But when the survey came to be made to ascertain the parcel so sold and conveyed, owing to some inaccuracy of'the surveyour, or to his misconception of, or inattention <em>to, </em>the lines indicated in <em>Garnett's </em>conveyance, a survey was made which comprised about 1230 acres; that is, 230 acres more of <em>Garnett's </em>land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>than he had sold and conveyed to <em>Powell, </em>lying below the true 1000 acre tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKLf\">Of the 1000 acres so sold and conveyed by, <em>Garnett </em>to <em>Powell, Powell </em>sold and conveyed 270 acres to <em>Gilliland; </em>178 acres to <em>M\u2019Allister; </em>94 acres to <em>Faught; </em>and 187 acres to <em>Burr Powell </em>to be laid off at the lower end of the <em>tract; so </em>that there remained of the 1000 acres to which <em>T. Powell </em>was entitled under <em>Garnett's </em>conveyance, only about 271 acres; and he contracted to sell the residue to <em>Stockton </em>at 12 dollars the acre. The conveyance of the parcel of 187 acres to <em>Burr Powell, </em>following the erroneous survey of the land conveyed by <em>Garnett </em>to <em>T. Powell, </em>in describing the bounds, placed the 187 acres on <em>Garnett's </em>land, without the bounds of the 1000 acre <em>tract; </em>that is, at the lower end of the erroneous 1230 acre survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-6\">A survey was made of all the parcels previously sold by T. <em>Powell </em>to the several purchasers in order to ascertain the exact quantity of the residue sold to <em>Stockton. </em>In making this survey also, the surveyour followed the erroneous survey that had been made of the land conveyed by <em>Garnett </em>to <em>T. Powell, </em>instead of the lines designated by <em>Garnett's </em>conveyance, which survey included 1230 acres as before mentioned, namely, 230 acres of <em>Garnett's </em>land, adjoining the lower line of the parcel of <em>1000 acres </em>which he had conveyed <em>to T. </em>Powell;\u2014and laying off the whole parcel purchased by <em>Burr Powell, </em>and part of the parcel purchased by <em>Faught, </em>at the lower end of the erroneous survey, he placed <em>Burr Powell's </em>187 acres and part of <em>Fatight's </em>94 acres on <em>Garnett's </em>land, without the true bounds of the 1000 acre tract, which <em>Garnett </em>had conveyed to <em>T. Powell; </em>and he made the residue of the tract sold to <em>Stockton, to </em>contain 501 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-9\">In the articles of agreement between <em>T. Powell </em>and <em>Stockton, </em>for the sale and purchase of the residue of the tract not previously sold, the residue had been esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>mated at only 250 acres. But the survey to ascertain the exact quantity having been made, and Stockton, be-mg thereby informed, that the survey originally made of the land conveyed by <em>Garnett </em>to <em>T. Powell, </em>contained acres over and above the parcels sold by <em>Powell </em>to the previous purchasers, made a new bargain with <em>Powell, </em>by which he gave <em>Powell </em>a horse, saddle and bridle, (in addition to the purchase money he had stipulated to pay for the residue of the land, according to the estimate of the quantity in the articles for the sale thereof, that is, 250 acres at 12 dollars the acre,) for all the land owned by <em>Powell </em>over and above the estimated quantity. Thus, if the rights of the parties were to be ascertained by the erroneous survey originally made of the land sold by <em>Garnett </em>to <em>Powell, Stockton got, for </em>a horse, saddle and bridle, 201 acres of land. And then, <em>Stockton </em>sold all the land he had thus contracted to purchase of <em>Powell, </em>to <em>Tompkins ; </em>and <em>Powell </em>at <em>Stockton\u2019s </em>instance, made a conveyance of the same to <em>Tomplcins, </em>describing the land by the bounds indicated in the erroneous surveys, and as containing 501 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-4\"><em>Purr Powell </em>exhibited a bill in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Greenbrier, </em>against <em>Garnett </em>and <em>Thomas Powell,\u2014Gilliland, M\u2019Allister </em>and <em>Fanght, </em>the purchasers from <em>T. Powell </em>previous to <em>B. Powell\u2019s </em>own purchase,\u2014and <em>Stockton </em>and <em>Tompkins, </em>the purchasers of the residue of the <em>land; </em>setting <em>forth </em>the facts above stated, which the several conveyances and surveys (exhibited with the bill) ascertained beyond doubt: charging <em>Stockton </em>and <em>Tompkins </em>with full notice of all the sales and conveyances of parcels, previous to their purchase of the residue; with notice that <em>T. Powell </em>had bought only 1000 acres of land of <em>Garnett, </em>that he sold the parcels of 270 acres to <em>Gilliland, </em>178 acres to <em>M\u2019Allister, </em>94 acres to <em>Faught, </em>and 187 acres to the plaintiff to be laid off at the lower end of the tract really sold by <em>Garnett </em>to <em>T. Powell; </em>with notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>mistake in the deed from <em>T. Powell </em>to the plaintiff, by which the 187 acres conveyed to him, instead of being parcel of the land which <em>T. Powell </em>had bought of <em>Gar-nett, </em>was in fact, land belonging to <em>Garnett; </em>with notice, in short, of the plaintiff\u2019s right to 187 acres of land to be so laid off from the true 1000 acre tract: and praying, that accurate surveys should be made; that the lands sold to <em>Gilliland, M'Allister </em>and <em>Taught </em>should be laid off for them respectively; that, then, the 187 acres sold to the plaintiff, should be laid off for him, at the lower end of the true 1000 acre tract; and that <em>Tompkins </em>should be compelled to release and convey to the plaintiff the 187 acres to which he was entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-3\"><em>Stockton </em>and <em>Tompkins, </em>in their answers, severally denied <em>all </em>notice of the equity alleged in the bill, and pleaded that they were fair purchasers without notice. T. <em>Powell, </em>in his answer, averred that <em>Stockton </em>purchased with full notice of the rights of the plaintiff, and of the other three purchasers previous to himself. <em>Gar-nett's </em>answer merely showed the particulars of the contract between him and <em>T. Powell, </em>and of his conveyance of 1000 acres to him, by lines exactly and clearly indicated in his conveyance thereof. And the bill was taken <em>pro confesso </em>as to the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-5\">It was, in the opinion of the chancellor and of this court, clearly proved, that the defendant <em>Stockton </em>purchased from <em>T. Powell, </em>with full notice of the plaintiff <em>Burr Powell's </em>equity. But there was not the least evidence to prove that the defendant <em>Tompkins </em>had any such notice before his purchase from <em>Stockton </em>was completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">The chancellor, on the hearing, declared, that the plaintiff was entitled to his 187 acres of land to be laid off, at the lower end of the true 1000 acre tract conveyed by <em>Garnett </em>to <em>T. Powell; </em>directed that it should be laid off by the surveyour, so as to give him a fair proportion of hill and bottom land; and decreed, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the defendant <em>Tompkins </em>should deliver possession thereof to him, so soon as it should be ascertained by the survey, and make a conveyance of the same to him, with special warranty, against himself and all persons claim- . i.. mg under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A124\">Upon the application of the defendants, <em>Tompkins </em>and <em>Stockton, </em>this court allowed them an appeal from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-7\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Summers, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALz8\"><em>Smith, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b596-9\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A09m\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014That the appellant <em>Tompkins, </em>appearing by the record to have been a purchaser without notice, and to have paid his purchase money, and obtained his deed, before he had notice of the appellee\u2019s rights, or of the error in the deed from <em>Thomas Powell </em>to him, was entitled to the protection df the court of equity, and the bill ought to have been dismissed as to him; leaving to the parties injured, to seek their redress from the appellant <em>Stockton, </em>for his' fraud in selling to the appellant <em>Tompkins, </em>after having had full notice of the error aforesaid, and of the rights of the appellee, without communicating those facts to his vendee. That a purchaser, who has notice of the rights of another, and sells to a third person without giving notice thereof to him, so as to place the subject of controversy beyond the reach of the right owner, becomes personally responsible for the demand. That, therefore, the decree was erroneous as to the appellant <em>Tompkins; </em>that the same should be reversed, with costs, so far as it affected him; and that the cause should be remanded to be further proceeded in, as to <em>Stockton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
