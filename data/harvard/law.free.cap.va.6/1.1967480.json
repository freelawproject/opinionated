The writ was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>on <em>John Fox, Jinn Fox, William, Fox, </em>and <em>Thomas B. Fox, </em>and upon their failing to appear, the conditional order was confirmed against them, in the Clerk\u2019s office. At the next Court, the following entry was made: \u201cOn the motion of the defendants by their attorney, who pleaded, <em>payment made by their ancestor and testator; </em>to which the plaintiff replied generally. It is ordered, that the judgment obtained in the office against them be set aside.\u201d At the next Court, <em>John Fox, </em>on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, was appointed guardian to the <em>defendant,,Henry Fox; </em>and, as to him, the plea of payment was withdrawn, and the cause sent back to the rules for further proceedings to be had therein, with leave to the other defendants <em>to plead a new plea, setting forth or denying assets. </em>A rule to plead, was afterwards given, in the Clerk\u2019s office, to the defendants; who, failing to comply therewith, the plaintiff, ' at a subsequent rule-day, took judgment by <em>nil dicit; </em>which not being set aside, at the succeeding term, stood confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-4\">The defendants afterwards petitioned this Court for a writ of <em>supei'sedeas; </em>and for cause assigned, \u201cthat the judgment was entered finally against all the defendants, although the plea of payment had only been withdrawn as to one of them; whereas no judgment could legally have been en\u00bb tered until the plea of payment had been tried, and a verdict found thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">Made two points; 1. That an order was taken at the rules against an infant defendant; which, he submitted, could not be done. 2. That the judgment at the rules was against all the defendants; which, he insisted, was wrong, as three of the defendants had plead payment, and the plea not being withdrawn, ought to have been tried, as to those defendants: For, the leave to plead a new plea, if not exercised, was no waiver of the first plea.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-7\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-8\">It is the constant course in all the Courts, to take orders at the rules against infant defendants as well as against adults; and no distinction in point of practice is ever made between them. The leave taken, by the other defendants, to plead a new plea, was a waiver of their former plea; but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>if this be not so, the judgment is certainly right as to the infant defendant: Because, the judgment, at rules, is that case to be considered as only applicable to him. For, the addition of the letter <em>s, </em>to the word defendant, is only a misprision of the Clerk; (as the setting aside the office judgment could not apply to the infant defendant, for none had been given against him; and, therefore, the entry could only relate to those against whom the office judgment had been rendered,) which being apparent upon the record, the Court will not regard it, but will consider the case in the same manner, as if the letter <em>s </em>had not been added; and then it will be a judgment against the infant defendant only; and the cause will remain, upon the issue docket, as to the other defendants; and as to them, may be tried hereafter, if it is found necessary.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-3\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-4\">The order at rules is certainly against all the defendants, which, for the reasons before given, was clearly wrong. If the contrary were true, and the cause as to the defendants who plead payment was still on the issue docket, it might be made to appear by writ of <em>certiorari. </em>But, tbe reverse is unquestionably the case; and the whole cause has been decided on, by the order, at rules, notwithstanding there was a good plea for some of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b23-7\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">delivered the resolution of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">There is clearly error as to the four defendants who are adults. Their plea of payment is not waived. The leave to plead additional matter prescribed in the order, left it optional in them to make use of it or not, as they thought proper; and, therefore, they could not be in default for not availing themselves of the privilege: But, on their failing to file a further plea, the issue, on the former, should have been tried in Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">The case of the infant defendant has some difficulty; but, since it does not appear that he was arrested, or ever appeared to the action, (for, if the plea.for the defendants generally, comprehends him, which is doubtful, that appearance, being by attorney, was certainly error,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tified afterwards,) a guardian was appointed by the Court on the motion of the plaintiffs; but, it is not shewn that he acted, or ever had notice of the appointment. The appearance of the infant by him, at the rules, is not stated, <em>but </em>a general rule to plead given against all; and, at the next rules, the judgment by default is entered: Instead of which, the Clerk should have certified, that upon the rule to plead, no plea had been filed for the adults,' nor any appearance entered for the infant, by his guardian. Upon which, the Court would have proceeded to try the issue as to the former, and have taken steps to compel the guardian to defend the infant, if they had power to do so,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or .have assigned another guardian for the purpose. The judgment, therefore, is to be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, for further proceedings to be had-therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">The judgment was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court is of opinion, that there is error in the said judgment as to <em>John, Ann, William </em>and <em>Thomas Booth Fox, </em>defendants in the original suit, in this, that their plea of payment not having been waived, although they had leave to plead at the rules further matter prescribed by the Court, the permission was optional in them, and they could not he in default for not availing themselves of it; but, on their failing to file a further plea, the cause should have been tried in Court upon the former issue joined. And, that there is also error in the said judgment as to <em>Henry Fox, </em>the other defendant in the said suit, who being an infant, is not stated in the record to have appeared by his guardian to defend the suit; nor does it appear that the guardian appointed by the Court, on the motion of the defendants, ever acted under, or even had notice of such appointment; and, therefore, instead of the judgment by default entered at the rules against the infant, a motion should have been made to the Court for proceeding against that guardian, or the appointment of another for the defence, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Therefore, it is considered, that the said judgment be reversed and annulled, and that the plaintiffs recover against the defendants their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their writ aforesaid here. And it is ordered, that the cause be remanded to the said District Court for further proceedings to be had therein. \u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b23-10\">[* <em>Beecher\u2019s </em>Case, 8 Co. 116; <em>Frescobaldi v.
