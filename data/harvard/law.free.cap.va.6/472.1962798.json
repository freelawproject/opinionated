A</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Three Bills successively, (the two last amendatory of the first,) were filed by the appellants in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Richmond District, for junctions to prevent the trustees from proceeding to sell the property conveyed by two Deeds in favour of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris, </em>for $6492, and $6900, and by one Deed in favour of <em>Charles Smith </em>for $11,851 92 cents; for a decree directing the said usurious Deeds, together with the notes and bonds, (to secure the payment of which the Deeds were given.) to be surrendered and cancelled,\u2014&gt; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-4\">The first Bill \u00a1\u00a11!edged that the Usury was publickly known, and the <em>plaintiffs hoped to prove it; </em>but that probably the defendants would attempt to elude the justice of the Court by pretending to have sold Stock to the decedent; particularly as <em>John I. Harris </em>was a director of one of the Banks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">To this Bill, <em>John L. Harris </em>answered, that, as acting partner of the firm of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris, </em>he, in March 1813, sold thirty shares in the Farmers\u2019Bank, for $4092, to the said <em>James Greenhow, </em>on two years credit, and took his bond and a deed of trust to) secure payment of the money without interest; that the sale was made upon an application of <em>Greenhow </em>to purchase; and, at that time, the company had stock to a large amount; that, in April 1814, <em>Greenhow </em>offered to purchase fifty shares more, and this defendant sold them to him for $6900, upon twelve months credit, and took his note and a deed of trust for the same; that, at this time also, <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>had stock to a much greater amount, and were willing to have transferred the said fifty shares immediately, but <em>Greenhow </em>preferred taking their note for delivery thereof upon demand, which, seven days after-wards, was presented for payment, with the said <em>Green-how\u2019s </em>endorsement to <em>Thomas Norvdl, </em>and <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>to <em>Charles Smith, </em>to whom the said shares were immediately transferred by <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris; </em>that there was no communication for borrowing or lending at either of the said transactions; that these are all the claims of <em>Shelton, </em>and <em>Harris </em>against the said <em>Greenhow; </em>but they had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>former note of his, endorsed by <em>Samuel Greenhow, </em>and secured by deed of trust, which had long since been wholly paid off and discharged, and had no connection directiy 0r indirectly with the two sales of stock aforesaid: that stock always sells higher upon credit, than ior cash, 011 an(^ regular sales in the market among people of good credit, and without any communication for a loan or any idea of usury on either side; that <em>Greenhow, </em>at the time of these sales, was a practising physician, having property to a large amount in possession, and this defendant had no expectation that his affairs were in the embarrassed condition stated in the Bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGI\">The Answer of <em>Thomas Norvell </em>(a Broker,) stated, that, in March 1813, Doctor <em>Greenhow </em>requested him to make negotiations for him to a considerable amount; and,, accordingly lie bought thirty shares in the Farmers\u2019 Bank, for the said <em>Greenhow, </em>of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris, </em>at $133 46 per share, upon two years credit; twenty of which shares were afterwards transferred to him, who credited <em>Greenhow </em>with them, at $138 per share: that, in April 1813, he bought of <em>Charles Smith </em>ninety three shares of like stock, at one and two years credit, for <em>Greenhow, </em>who gave his bonds for $5624 64, and $6227 28 cents, for the same; forty of which last mentioned shares were transferred to him to be sold for <em>Greenhow, </em>who had credit for them oil his books at $108 per share: that, in April 1814, he bought of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>fifty shares of like stock for $6900, for <em>Greenhow, </em>who gave his note and a deed of trust to secure payment of the money; but no transfer of the stock wras then made, as <em>Greenhow </em>did not wish it, but chose that he, the respondent, should sell the stock for money; and therefore he took the note of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris, </em>to transfer on demand; which note <em>Greenhow </em>afterwards assigned to the said respondent, who sold the shares for $5700 to <em>Charles Smith, </em>to whom the respondent assigned the said note, and <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>transferred the shares: that he transacted business as broker for <em>Greenhow </em>at various times; and, at the time of the transactions aforesaid,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>could not obtain as favourable terms for him from any other person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acr5q\">The Answer of <em>Frederick Harris </em>administrator of <em>Charles Smith. </em>lie understood, from bis intestate, that <em>Greenhow\u2019s </em>debt was contracted for Bank Stock, lae said <em>Smith </em>was a dealer in stock, which he sometimes bought for cash, and sold at an advance upon credit; but ho sometimes lost by stock\u2019s falling below the cash prices he had paid. This respondent believed the transactions with <em>Greenhow </em>were fair; and that stock could not then have been purchased, upon the same credit, at lower prices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">The plaintiffs in their 2d Bill, repeated their averment that the claims of the defendants were founded upon illegal and usurious considerations, and said they were <em>\u2022( now prepared la prove the facts in most </em>instances, and \u00ab hoped, by having sufficient time allowed them, to be \u201c able to prove the whole.\u201d They charged that, on or about March 1813, <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>loaned \u00a72000 to Doct. Greenhow, upon his note for \u00a72400 payable at twelve months after date, endorsed by <em>Samuel </em>Greenhow, which note was secured by a Deed of Trust; that the sales of the stock were merely devices to cover usurious contracts, and the pretended sale of fifty shares was made only as a kind of indulgence, for the \u00a72400 note, and to close some other transactions of the like nature; that <em>Shelton </em>and Harris, <em>Nor veil </em>and <em>Smith </em>were usnriously combining to shift the same stock from hand to hand; that no such stock was ever transferred <em>to the said Doct. Green-how by </em>the said <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>at the time spoken of, or at any other time; that <em>Smith </em>transferred 43 shares only, instead of 93; and had, during all the year ISIS, but 7 3 shares, as appeared by a Certificate of the Cashier of the Farmers\u2019 Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-6\">The Answer of <em>Thomas Norvell </em>to the last mentioned Bill, referred to, and insisted upon, his former Answer; averring that he never received any usurious interest of <em>Greenhow; </em>that ho had no interest in any of the contracts in question; and believed that <em>Greenhow\u2019s </em>transactions, with <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>and <em>Charles </em>Smith, were sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ra^6 and distinct\u2019 ^le statements in his answer coucerning the transfers of stock were true, notwithstanding the Cashier\u2019s certificate, which was itself erroneous, as wouId aPPear by two countervailing and explanatory certificates of the same Cashier: that this respondent knew nothing of the number of Bank shares standing in the name of Smith. further than the last mentioned certificates shewed:\u2014that <em>William JVorvell, </em>on the 19th of April 1813, transferred ten bank shares to Greenhow, which this defendant as his Attorney transferred to <em>Smith, </em>who, afterwards, transferred them back to <em>Green-how; </em>and that the said ten shares, added to the 83 mentioned in the Cashier\u2019s certificate, made up the 93 furnished by <em>Smith </em>to <em>Greenhow.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-4\">The Answer of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>administrator referred to his former Answer, and averred that his intestate actually transferred 93 shares; as appeared by two entries on the decedent\u2019s books, which were all that' he found relating to the subject; that, as <em>Smith </em>was a dealer in stock, he might without fault happen to sell <em>Greenhow </em>part of the same stock he had before purchased of him; it being of no importance to the purchaser in whose name it stood, if he got it; and that this defendant had discovered no document proving Usury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\"><em>John L. Harris </em>filed an Answer, and afterwards an amended Answer, to the said Bill, in which (taken together,) he repeated the allegations in his Answer to the first Bill, and denied that <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris lent Green-how </em>the money paid for the \u00a72400 note; averring that he <em>bought </em>the note fairly in the market at the price of \u00a72,212 or thereabouts, upon condition that \u201c the <em>holder\u201d </em>(\u00ab <em>not i6 mentioning who the holder was,~) </em>would get it secured; which was done; that that note had long since been discharged, and <em>had no connection with the sales of stock; </em>that <em>he knew not the consideration for which the said note was given; </em>that neither of the notes, given on the said sales, was usurious, or founded upon any communication for a loan; but that <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris </em>merely wished to sell their stock, of which they had a large quantity, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>could, on the same credits, have gotten the same for it, from persons of undoubted solidity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-4\">The third Bill stated, that <em>Greenhow </em>employed JV'or-<em>veil </em>to <em>raise money, and not to buy slock; </em>that <em>Shelton </em>ami <em>Harris, </em>and <em>Smith </em>all knew that the negotiations were undertakcn for usurious purposes, which, as to <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Harris, </em>was evidenced by their refusing to lake, without farther security, the 82400 note, though endorsed by <em>Samuel Greenhow, </em>and by their evading a <em>direct </em>answer to the charges respecting it. This Bill contained also other allegations concerning the possession, by the parties, of the several parcels of stock transferred, the rapidity of the transfers from one to another, and some conversations between <em>Harris, Smith </em>and <em>Norvell, </em>from which the complainants inferred usury, and a fraudulent connection and combination among them to the injury of <em>Greenhow. </em>It objected to the former answers for not stating the <em>prices per share </em>at which <em>Smith </em>sold to <em>Green-how, </em>but only that the latter gave his notes for gl 1,851 94 cents, for the supposed 93 shares. The 2d, &amp; SA Bills both demanded the production of the books and papers of the defendants before a Commissioner of the Court, without which it was contended the true nature of the transactions could not be fully known,' and a fair and legal settlement of the accounts between the parties be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">The answer of <em>John L. Harris </em>to the 3d Bill, denied that the sales of stock made by Mm to the said <em>Greenhow </em>were <em>pretended,, </em>or a shift or contrivance to cover a loan; repeating Ids averment that the stock was absolutely sold and transferred. <em>\u201c What might have been the views \u201c of said Greenhow in buying the slock, or what might </em>\u201c <em>have passed between the said Greenhow and Ms the said &lt;f Grcenhow\u2019s agent, it is impossible for this defendant to </em>\u201d <em>say; </em>but he can say, and does aver, that, in both in- <em>(&lt; </em>stances, the application was made to him not for a loan, <em>\u201c </em>but for the purchase of stock, which stock was then \u201c held by <em>Shelton </em>&amp; Harris. This defendant had no con- \u201c c-ern or connection with <em>Mirvell </em>or <em>Smith </em>in the mud <em>u </em>StocK, o? the proceeds thereof; and there was no en- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\" d~rstanding, stipulation or agreement hetwe~n him and \"the said Greenhow as to the use or application that the \" said Greenliow should make of it:--he had a right te \"do what he pleased with it.\" As to the note of S2,4OO~ this answer was nearly in the same words as the former, still failing to state who \" the holder\" was, of whom that note was purchased. The charges of Usury were again e~prcssly denied. The respondent said that his books, or the books ol' Shelton &amp; Harris, would not in any particulitr afford the slightest foundation or support to those charges; but insisted that the demand for their production was wholly unwarranted by the usage of this Court and the laws of the Country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AhV\">Smith's administrator and Yor'ocll again answered, denying the connection and combination charged, and new niatter of equity set fbrth, in the last :BiH; and also the right of the plaintifih to call for the books and papers, which had also been denied in their former answers. Xoroell particularly said, that \"when he purchased the \"said Bank stocks, he made no communication for a loan, \" as Greenhow did ~iot mean to borrow, but to purchase on ~` credit.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A23B\">The plaintiffs filed exceptions to these answers of harris and .Nbroell, as insufficient and evasive:-1. to that of Harris, for not stating the precise sum given for the note of ~24OO; nor how that note was discharged or settled; and for not stating (tim' required by the Bills,) who was the holder of the ~24OO note, and who procured the security for the payment of it, before Harris would take it:-2. to that of .TV'orvell, because it did not shew the transaction relating to the saId note, nor how it was discharged; and whether the balance received by him of Smith was applied to the discharge of it, or how that balance was applied; because the respondent refused to make any statement of Greenhow's notes in his possession which had been paid off; altho' the surrender of them was demanded by the Bill; and because he did not discover all that he knew of the transactions of Greenhow with the other defend ants~</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aa11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>eliancellor TAYLoI~ agah~ dissolved the Injunction, which, twice before, had been dissolved and re~instatet1.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> From this order, the plaintiff's were allowed an appeal, upon their Petition to a Judge of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQnW\">Upshur for the appellailts.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS8M\">Where the iiitentiou is to commit Usury, the particular form of the contract is iiet to be regarded.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It is evideiit that the intention in this case was not a purchase of stock; for Greenhow did not wish to keep the stock, but merely to raise money. lie actually kept it not more than two days. The idea that he bought on speculation, is contradicted by all the circumstances, which plainly shew that his object was to convert the stock into cash at whatever sacrifice. rube ~irice given was so exorbitant, that no maui in his senses would have made sarli a bargain, for purposes of spedlation, or to retain the stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMM\">JbJin L. Harris's Answers do not deity the charge that lie knew Greenhow's object t~ be merely the raising of money. He evades it even t~ the last, giving no direct answer as to this point, but struggling very hard to appear to an~~vcr the que~tioiLs put to him, without doing so. If lie had not actual notice that such was the object ci Greeniww's application, lie hal at any rate constructiv~ notice; for .TVbrcell, beii~g a public broker was the ageni of both parties,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and he had actual notice, by which therefore IIarri~ was bound. <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5pS\">The knowledge of harris, that Greenhow's object iii procuring the stock was to raise money, makes the transactiou usurious, as comt)letely as if the contract had been for a direct loan. <footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> From 2 Campb. 375, it appears that, where a ground of suspicion of Usury is raised, it is incumbent on the party to remove it, or he will be con sidered guilty. In this case, if the proof be riot direct, there are many stroiig grounds of suspicion. The risk of loss on the part of Harris was very srno~it and this is one of the badges of Usury. The sale of stock on long credit, is another; <footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> for bank stock is a cash article, and it is exceedingly unustial to sell it on long credit.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The <em>exorbitancy of price </em>in the sale oi' an article, furnishes also a reason for suspecting Usury; <footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and here the disproportion between the cash and credit prices of the stock was enormous. The <em>distressed condition of Green-haw </em>for want of money, (which <em>Harris </em>well knew,) is also to be considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avq3\">He relies in his Answers, repeatedly, on the circumstance that no <em>express communication </em>for a loan took place: but such communication will always he presumed where the real intention of the parties was to borrow on one side, and lend on the other. In <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 <em>Munf. </em>424, it was denied that there was any communication for a loan; yet this Court decided the contract was usurious; surely on the ground that such communication might be presumed. Go also in the case of <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fristoe, </em>1 <em>Call </em>62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASK\"><em>Harris\u2019s </em>not <em>thinking </em>the transaction usurious, if such were the fact, would make no difference in the casc.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZUy\">As to the note for g 2400, <em>Gresnhow </em>himself was evidently the \u201c <em>holder,\u201d </em>of whom <em>Harris </em>bought it at an usurious discount; otherwise, <em>he </em>would not have given the subsequent deed of trust to secure the payment; for if the note had been in the possession of another person who offered to transfer it, such other person, (being requested by the transferee,) would have given the security, and not applied to <em>Greenhow. </em>The sale of the note was therefore palpably a shift or device to evade the statute. But a note made for usurious purposes, is void in the hands of <em>any </em>body. <em>Quod initio non valet, tractu temporis non conva lesa t </em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1tc\">So far as <em>Charles Smith </em>is concerned, the Usury is yet' more apparent. It is a striking circumstance, that, v hen he undertook to sell ninety three shares of stock for the enormous sum of <em>$ </em>11,851 92 Cents, he did not own a single share! He never transferred more, than <em>eighty three </em>shares, though he took the bonds and deed of trust for the price of <em>ninety three. </em>Is not the conclusion irresistible that the ten shares not transferred were the premium for the loan ? It is impossible, by arithmetical calculation to find any integral sum as the price by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>share for the 93 shares of stock in this case. Tue very extraordinary fractional sum of $ 127 44, appears to have been the price ageeel upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao4Z\">There is no (lifference in principle between the case of Marks v. Morris, 2 Munf. 407. and this case. In this, the plain tifii~ do not sue for a discovery, any niore than in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhgX\">If, upon the ~~ho1e, the Court should not consider the Usury proved, the Contracts may perhaps be set aside as aneouscionable. <footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADV-\">Gall for the appellees, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adg\">1. That the prices of ~iie stock were not exorbitant; but, if they had been, that mere exorbitancy of price, without any previous cornmunic~ttion for a loaii, or forbearance, is not Ustiry.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaYG\">2. That there was no evidence of any loan, or coininuuication for a loan, or forbearance, as to Shelton and Harris; hiit the transactions were sales of stock in their possession at tile times of the sales, and for the credit prices at tho:~;e periods. There are no circumstances from which to infer an usurious intent; and usury is not to be presumed, without proof.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aof\">S. That Smith's contract was not usurious; because, in that case also, there was no communication for a loan or forbearance, and the price was the credit price of the 4lay. It is not maten al whether he had stock at the time or not; (hr there is nothing illiproper in a man's contraetmg to furnish stock, although he have none at the moment of contract. He was a dealer ifl the article, and every thing (lone in the course of trade is lawful.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> Ju ~fact, lie had some stock at the time, and purchiasel mome to enable him to comply with the contract. his gctting some from .Nhr~elL makes no difference; for both were in tile market, and he might lawfully buy of him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnR-\">4 Tj~~ ~v as no connection between Shelton and liar-us and Smith; nor between them, or either of them, and .1V'orveU.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoM1\">None of the circumstances resemble time case of Watkins v. Taylor, 2 Munf. 424; lhr that was, in substance, an advance of money. to be restored with interest be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>yond the legal rate. In Marks v. Morris, too, the usurp was proved, which is not the case here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqR8\">Leigh on the same side. The simple question before the Court Is, whether a sale of Bank stock on credit, at an advance abo'~e the cash price, be Usury? Could not Doctor Greemlww have wanted the stock to enable him to comply with a contract for the delivery of stock? If he might ha~c wanted it for any other purpose than that of raising money U~0fl it, the presumption of Usury does not arise. To constitute Usury, there must be a corrupt agreement, concurred in by both parties.<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> Harris is guilty of no evasion:-for lie says, expressly, that he did not know for what purpose Greenhoi~i wanted the stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACm0\">Stock is not like rnoi~ey, having ~t certain value, but an article liable to continual fluctuations. The value at a future day being contin\u00e7ent, a sale at a high price on credit is not nsurious.<footnotemark>(o)</footnotemark> Was it improbable that stock might have risen before the time of payment, to 122 or\u2022 1~3O per cent?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEhY\">Ph~ case of Hansbrough v. Baylor, 2 Munf. 36, is identically this; exce~pt that there the article sold was a bond; atid here it was bank stock. Suppose it had been tobacco or goods; would the vendor be an Usurer, because the vei~dee sold afterwards, for Cash, at a loss? if not, ~vhv i~ a vendor of Bank stock to be so considered?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ap15\">Wickharn on the same side, observed, that a Broker's being employed in the negotiation for the stock, was not a suspicious circumstance. The uniform practice, where a man wants \u2022to buy stock, is to go to a broker. The profession of a broker is honest and lawful; and stock is as much an article for sale, as wheat, or tobacco,land, or slaves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdfP\">Mr. lTps1i~r says the answer is evas~v~. How i~ it evasive? It says the transaction was a fairy bo7ia Jide sale, and not a loan. Is not this directly responsive to the Bill? lie says the Bill is not for a discovery. Yet it demands the production of books and papers, and accounts to be rendered. If then it be not a bill for discovery, what is 1t~ If the answers of the defendants be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>not relied on, where is the proof on the side of the plaintiffs?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aiak\">He is mistaken on the subject of the 93 shares. It appears in the record that <em>Smith </em>bought 10 shares of A A # <em>Norvell </em>to make up the quantity. A buyer and seller o\u00ed stock, as well as a trailer in bills of exchange, has a right to make his selling, different from his purchasing, price.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AVhf\"> Floyer v.

The transaction becomes usurious, only when the object is to borrow money, and not purchase stock, and the price of the stock is graduated as a device to effect that purpose; or where there is a combination between the seller of the stock on credit, and the purchaser for eash; as, for example, in this case, between <em>Smith and Shelton and Harris. </em>Such a combination or connection, is explicitly disavowed in this case, and is not proved:\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>nor is it in any manner proved, that the purpose lor which the parties met was to borrow money rather than buy stock. The contrary is not only shewn by the answers 0f <em>Harris, </em>but it is explicitly proved by <em>Nowell </em>that <em>Greentiow\u2019s </em>purpose was not to borrow money, but t\u00b0 purchase Stock. So much for the purchase of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">As for the note for \u00a72400, it is said the injunction has not been applied for, or granted, as to the Deed securing the payment of it. If it liad, it would readily have been perpetuated on the admission of <em>Harris, </em>that that debt has long since been paid. As to it, the transaction is said to be closed. If it had been paid by merely being carried into the <em>other debts, </em>it might deserve a different consideration:\u2014but that idea is explicitly reprobated by the repeated answers of <em>Harris, </em>that that debt ivas <em>wholly unconnected </em>with the sales of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Although, therefore, it is possible, and even probable, that these transactions were founded in usurious views on the part of all the parties, we can not say so upon this record, and therefore I concur in opinion that the decree be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Decree affirmed unanimously.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b503-15\"> The case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Bruce </em>was re-considered, and not, fina-W decided until June 1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
