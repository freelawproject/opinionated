Executors of Blaydes.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b330-13\">[Wednesday, Nove<em>mber </em>5th, 1800.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-9\">After three verdicts, the Court of Chancery did right in decreeing according to the opinions of the juries.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-10\">If the Court, before which the issues are tried, is dissatisfied with the verdict, this dissatisfaction must be certified on the record by the Court; or if refu\u00bb sed, it should be put on the record by a hill of exceptions : tis not to be supplied by affidavit, especially of counsel in the cause.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b330-11\">The discretion of the Chancellor is to be exercised on sound principles, of which this Court may judge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-12\">This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Chancery, where <em>Stannard </em>brought a bill against <em>Graves </em>and others, executors of <em>Blaydes, </em>to be relieved touching judgments upon two bonds given by him to <em>Blaydes, </em>for some carpenter\u2019s work done by the latter. After answer, replication, and commissions to take depositions, the cause was heard upon the bill, answer, exhibits, and the deposit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tions, which were very numerous: when, the Court of Chancery dissolved the injunction as to part of one of the bonds, and directed, \u201c issues to be made up between the parties, to enquire, whether the dispute between the plaintiff and the testator concerning breaches of the articles of agreement entered into by them, and referred to in the bill, was adjusted at the time when the plaintiff executed the two bonds on which the judgments were obtained; and, if not, to enquire, whether the testator was guilty of a breach of those articles, and to assess damages for such breach; and also, to enquire whether any agreement was made between the plaintiff and the said testator at the time of executing those bonds, or before, other than the first, that the latter should perform other work for the former', and whether such work was performed accordingly; and, if not, to assess the damages sustained, by the breach of that agreement.\u201d The jury found, Thatthe dispute between the plaintiff and the testator of the defendants concerning breaches of the articles of agreement, entered into between them and referred to in the first issue, was adjusted at the time when the plaintiff executed the two bonds, on which the judgments were obtained. And that an agreement was made between the plaintiff and the testator of the defendants, before the time of executing the two bonds mentioned, that the said testator should perform other work for the plaintiff, and that the second agreement was adjusted in the amount of the two bonds aforesaid, when executed.\u201d - .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">Upon the verdicts being certified into the Court of Chancery, that Court, for reasons appearing, set aside the verdict, and ordered a new trial of the second issue. And, \u00a3\u00a3 setting aside so much of the several orders as is inconsistent with what followeth,\u201d directed a jury to be impanneled between the parties to enquire, \u00a3\u00a3 Whether the testator of the defendants, at the time of the execution of the bonds, on which were rendered the judgments sought to be injoined, did agree to make good any defects in the building of the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house mentioned in the first agreement between the said testator and the plaintiff: and, whether such defects were made good accordingly; and, if not, to ascertain the damages occasioned by breach of that agreement: to enquire whether the said testator did perform the work, which he had agreed to perform, over and above the building of the dwelling-house in a faithful and workman-like manner; and, if not, to enquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>what damages the plaintiff sustained, by non-performance that work and infidelity of the builder: and, lastly, to enquire whether the damages sustained by the plaintiff, for either of both of those breaches, were satisfied, allowed, for, or otherwise adjusted between him and the said testator, at the time of executing the forementioned bonds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">Upon these last issues, the jury found: <em>\u201c </em>That the testator of the defendants did not agree, at the time of the execution <em>of </em>the bonds, <em>to </em>make good <em>any </em>defects in the building of the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house: That he did not perform ail the work which he had agreed to perform, over and above the dwelling-house: But, that, there was a complete settlement between the plaintiff and the testator of the defendants, at the time of the execution of the bonds, and that no allowance was made by the plaintiff to the testator of the defendants, at the time of executing the said bonds for any work, which was not done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-10\">Upon this last verdict being certified into the Court of Chancery, the plaintiff moved that the verdict might be set aside, upon two affidavits which he filed; but the motion was rejected by that Court, which decreed, <em>\u201c </em>if the money for which the, injunction was dissolved, had been paid, that the injunction as to so much should be perpetual; but, for the whole of that mon\u00e9y, or the part thereof yet unpaid, the judgment, which was to be discharged by payment of 179/., do remain as a security, and the bill was to be dismissed as to the other judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-11\">Prom which decree, <em>Stannard </em>appealed to this Court. One of the affidavits, <em>referred </em>to in the decree, stated, that the witness, after the last verdict, moved the District Court to certify, that it was contrary to evidence; and that one of the Judges, (Mr. White,) after they had considered the motion, said it was unnecessary, as it would appear from the account stated between the parties, which would be sent to the'Chancery Court, that the verdict was against evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXS\">The other affidavit stated, that, after the last verdict, one of the jurors, in a conversation with the witness, .mentioned, that, as the said <em>Stannard </em>had given his bonds to Blaydes, if all the proof in the world had been <em>given </em>in the said <em>Stannard\u2019s </em>favor, he would have given judgment against him; and that the rest of the jury were led to give judgment from the same principle.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Nicholas, <em>Warden, </em>and Wickham, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-3\">Contended, that the evidence contained in the record was clear; and, therefore, the <em>Chancellor </em>ought to have decided on it himself. Consequently, that he either ought to have directed no issue at all; <em>(Southall </em>v. <em>M'Keand, </em>from the order book,) [1 Wash. 336,] or, if any, that it ought only to have been an issue to ascertain the damages. That one of the Judges who tried the cause, thought the verdict wrong; and when asked fora certificate to that effect, declined it, saying, that the account would .\u00ab\u00a1hew it-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-4\">Randolph, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-5\">Contended, that the whole was a question of fact; and, therefore, proper for the determination of a jury. 2 <em>Com. </em>316, G2S. Consequently, that the issues were properly directed; and, after three verdicts, thaf the question ought to be at, rest. That there was no certificate, or other record, of the opinion of the Judge; and no other evidence of it was admissible. Besides, the reason ascribed to hlm\u201e for the opinion which he was said to have expressed, war. not sufficient</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-7\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AuB7\">Delivered the resolution of the Court as follows;</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The question made was, whether the <em>Chancellor </em>erred, in directing an issue to be tried in this case at all; or, at least, other than to ascertain the damages?'<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The appellant\u2019s counsel were correct in stating, that the discretion of the Chancellor, upon this, and all other occasions, is to be exercised by him, upon sound principies of reason and justice;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and that this, as an appellate Court, has a right to judge, whether he has <em>so </em>exercised his discretion, in the present ease ? But, they are unlucky in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The observation urged, thaf the evidence was so plain, the <em>Chancellor </em>ought to have been satisfied, might have been repelled by the even I, since two verdicts had been given against this plain evidence. But how did it then appear ?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The points in dispute had been submitted to a jury, in a suit on the bond; whether properly or improperly,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is immaterial: most of the same witnesses were examined; particularly those of the appellant, <em>Long </em>and Thorp, the most material; and a verdict passed against the claim. Three jurymen had sworn they gave little credit to their testimony, for reasons which they were the judges of; no matter what. Was the <em>Chancellor </em>to shut his eyes to this strong bar against the claim, and say with the counsel, the evidence was plain, and the credibility of those witnesses not in question? Strange supposition!</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">He might probably have been justified in dismissing the bill, as the subject had passed a jury ;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> but considering, that the jury might have been embarrassed by the bond, he more wisely directed an issue, framing it so as to avoid that embarrassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">A verdict is again found against this plain evidence, as it is called; and the appellant was indulged with a third jury, who still find an according verdict: And why should not the <em>Chancellor </em>be satisfied at last?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\"><em>Perry </em>speaks of a conversation with a juryman, intimating that he decided upon improper principles; a conversation probably mistaken, or garbled; and not to be regarded on any view of propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Mr. <em>Brooke </em>moved for a certificate, that the verdict was against evidence. Mr. White, the junior Judge, said, it was unnecessary; for the account would shew it, and Mr. <em>Brokoe </em>acquiesces. The other Judge was silent, and might not think it against evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">The certificate must appear of record, from the Court; or upon a bill of exceptions, if refused, and is not to be supplied by affidavits, especially of lawyers; a most dangerous precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Where is the account, which justifies Mr. White\u2019s opinion? The private accounts of the parties, in the record, prove nothing; not being authenticated themselves, but mere <em>ex parte </em>statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">The verdict stands unimpeached; was the third upon the subject; and all of them agreeing. It was, therefore, high time the matter should be put at peace. This is done by the decree; which is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">[* See <em>Pryor v.
