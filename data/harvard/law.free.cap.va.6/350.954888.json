In reducing the contract to writing, though it is stated that the crops are sold with the land, by mistake of the scrivener, the undertaking of <em>B </em>to put <em>If </em>in possession of the crops is omitted. <em>B </em>does not put <em>If </em>in possession of the crops; but they are claimed by <em>S, </em>who is living on the land at the time ; and he appropriates them to his own use.

Booth. </em>The bill, after stating the recovery of the judgment for 300 dollars, subject to a credit of 200 dollars, charged that the plaintiff had purchased of <em>Booth, </em>a tract of land with the crops growing thereon, for 700 dollars. That in their contract, the crops were estimated at 100 dollars. That a certain <em>Moses G. Carper </em>had been requested to reduce the contract to writing. That after <em>Carper </em>had written the paper, stating the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>land and the terms and time of payment, he read it to the parties, and he was then informed the crops were sold with the land, when he said he could still introduce that into the agreement, and proceeded to complete it; and the plaintiff executed the agreement, believing that it had been so written. That by the contract between them, <em>Booth </em>bound himself to put the plaintiff in possession of the crops; but that he had failed to do it. That a certain <em>Henry Shoemaker </em>was living on the land, and when <em>Booth </em>went with the plaintiff to the place to put the plaintiff in possession of the crops, <em>Shoemaker </em>claimed that they belonged to him; and <em>Booth </em>left the premises, and made no further effort to deliver them, and the plaintiff never received them. That the plaintiff had paid 600 dollars of the purchase <em>money; </em>which was all that <em>Booth </em>was entitled to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\"><em>Booth </em>answered the bill. He admitted that the crops were sold with the land. But he said that <em>Shoemaker </em>only occupied the house and garden by his permission, and he offered to the plaintiff to turn him out of possession if the plaintiff required it; and it was by plaintiff\u2019s consent that <em>Shoemaker </em>was allowed to keep possession of the house and garden until the end of the year. And he alleged that according to the agreement, he did authorize the complainant to go upon the land, and cultivate and gather the crops; and that complainant did enter upon the land, and held exclusive possession of it, from the date of the agreement. He denies that <em>Shoemaker </em>was entitled to the crops; or that the defendant bound himself to deliver them to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">It appeared from the evidence, that the crops were sold with the land, and were a part of the consideration of the 700 dollars which was to be paid by <em>Kesler ; </em>and that <em>Booth </em>undertook to put <em>Kesler </em>in possession of the crops. It further appeared that <em>Shoemaker </em>claimed the crops as belonging to him, and disposed of <em>them; </em>and that <em>Booth </em>did not put <em>Kesler </em>in possession of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Shoemaker </em>was himself examined as a witness, and said that he was entitled to the crops. <em>Carpet' </em>states what passed when he wrote the agreement substantially as it is stated in the bill. The agreement, though it states that the crops are sold to <em>Kesler, </em>does not bind <em>Booth </em>to put <em>Kesler </em>into possession of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Circuit court perpetuated the injunction; and thereupon <em>Booth </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-6\"><em>August &amp; Watkins, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b372-8\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
