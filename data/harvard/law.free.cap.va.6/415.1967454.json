Damage, ten pounds sterling. The declaration is also in debt; but is blank as to the sum declared for; as to the date of the bond; as to the assignment to the plaintiff; and as to the damage. The defendant having failed to appear upon the return of the writ, the proper proceedings were had, and an office-judgment regularly obtained. The bond, (which is in the penalty of 215/. sterling, conditioned for payment of 107/. 05. <em>4d. </em>sterling,) is copied into the record by the Clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">The District Court granted a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment, and reversed it with, costs; without entering a <em>nil capiat per </em>billam. Whereupon <em>Blane </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">, As the sum is right in the writ, it is sufficient, under the act of <em>Jeofails, </em>which says, that the judgment shall not be arrested, after verdict, in any such case. Besides, the bond is part of the proceedings, and certainly contains the true sum.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-10\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-11\">There was no verdict in this case, but a mere office-judgment. No <em>oyer </em>was taken of the bond; which, therefore, is no part of the proceedings. Consequently, the defects are not cured by the statute of <em>Jeofails. </em>Reference to the writ will not do; for, that does not say that the action is founded on a bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-12\">Cur. <em>adv, vult</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AKQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AfJr\">There is no error in the judgment of the District Court, as far as they went; but, they should have gone further, and reversed thejudgment of the County Court, and dismissed the suit with the costs of both Courts: which is to be thejudgment of this Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">[* <em>Mantz </em>v. <em>Hendly, </em>2 H. &amp; M. 303; <em>Darby </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>et al. 3 Munf. 115.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
