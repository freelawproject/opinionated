We proceeded to examine the vouchers produced and make a statement, as will appear from the foregoing account. It appearing to us, that the plaintiff hath been put to very great trouble by frequently travelling to the City of <em>Richmond, </em>on account of the <em>Commonwealth1s </em>judgments against him for arrears of taxes, and incurred considerable expense thereby. It also appears, that his negroes taken in execution to satisfy said judgments, were kept out of his possession and service at various times, from which he sustained losses. We have allowed interest on monies advaned, and rated the damages, as will be seen in the debt. We find a balance of three hundred and thirty-one pounds, fourteen shillings and one penny three farthings, due to the plaintiff from the defendants, and which sum we award him with costs of suit given under our hands, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">The District Court gave judgment upon the day of the return of the award for the 331/. <em>14s. 1% </em>awarded, and costs. And the plaintiff agreed <em>u </em>to release ten pounds for so much paid <em>William Cowan, </em>and four pounds four shillings paid <em>Andrew Reynold </em>in the account aforesaid mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">To this judgment, <em>Holcomb </em>and the others obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-11\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-12\">The Court were premature in entering up judgment upon the <em>award; </em>which ought to have lain in Court two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>terms, according to the express directions of the act of Assembly, <em>[Dec. </em>1789, 13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>63, c. 114, <em>R. C. </em>ed. 1819,] for, it is not shewn that the plaintiff appeared and contested the award: Which would have altered the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABV\">The item of 150/. contains matters not within the submission: For, that was of all matters in difference between the parties in the suit; and, upon the trial, such matters would not have been permitted to go in evidence to the jury. They were no more than the ordinary cases of. expenses incurred, and inconveniences sustained by a security. But, these were never yet thought to be a subject of damages, for which a suit could be sustained. On the contrary, they are literally <em>damnum absque injuria; </em>and no action lies for them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\"><em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>1 Call, 379, in this Court, decided the first point; and proves, that an order of reference of this kind is not within the act of Assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">The 150/. damages were justly allowed; because it was a bond to save harmless, and therefore the appellee had a right to insist on being completely indemnified; which could only be done, by making compensation for his necessary expenses, and the inconveniences and losses which he had sustained by the misconduct of the appellant. Besides, arbitrators have more latitude than a Court; and may decide according to equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-10\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-11\">However reasonable the demand, yet not being the subject of an action, it would not have been permitted to go to the jury; whose enquiry would have been confined by the Court to the money paid and interest; which is the only compensation and measure of damages which the law allows, in cases of this kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-12\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b388-13\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A3c\">Two objections are taken in this case. 1. That the award did not lie long enough in Court, according to the act of 1792, [13 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>63, c. 114, <em>R. C. </em>ed. 1819,] but was immediately confirmed by the judgment of the Court. 2. That the arbitrator, as appears by the report, allowed damages for matters not within the terms of the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Upon the first objection, it was observed by the appellee^ counsel, that it was decided in <em>Mitchell </em>v. Kelly, that the act of 1792, does not apply to orders of reference of this kind made during the progress of a suit, depending in Court; nor, upon examination of the act, do I think it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">As to the second objection, I observe, that one of the conditions of the bond is, to indemnify the High Sheriff, from all motions, judgments, &amp;e. Now this condition, as to the indemnity, will certainly extend to all just expenses sustained by the appellee, in consequence of -any such motion, judgment, &amp;c. as well as to all actual losses, occasioned by the detention of his negroes, &amp;c. These expenses and losses, which are actual, are capable of being ascertained by computation: and certainly the party cannot foe said to be indemnified, that is, kept harmless, without they are allowed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">At the same time, I agree entirely\u2019with the appellants counsel, that the arbitrators ought not to have taken into consideration, mere speculative damages, such as for trouble, anxiety, &amp;c. and that this would lead us into an imaginary and inexhaustible field.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The question then is, upon this distinction, how stands the report of the arbitrators?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The item in the account presents nothing to impeach the award. Interest on the money advanced was certainly proper; and damages sustained may justly be restricted, for any thing appearing to the contrary in the item, to such damages as might legally be awarded. We are not to hunt out such a sense, as that damages may he understood to destroy the award; which ought to be favorably construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">I take this, to foe merely a statement of the evidence, which appeared to the arbitrators; and it does not irresistibly follow, that the damages were given on such a part of the evidence as would not warrant it; that is to say, an indemnification for the personal trouble, &amp;c. of the appellee. It is a just maxim, that <em>what is useful shall not be vitiated by that which is not so, </em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> But it is not expressly stated, that the damages were given for personal trouble, &amp;c. and, if given for expenses and losses, as before-mentioned, it is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>My opinion is, that, <em>before we </em>overturn an award (in a case where justice seems fully attained,) it ought certainly to appeal\u2019, that the award was founded on illegal grounds. But, this does not' clearly appear to have been tbe case, in the cause now before the Court; and, therefore, I am for supporting the award, as what is relied upon, to impeach it, is merely a statement of the evidence, which appeared to the arbitrators. Upon these grounds, I am of opinion, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">CARRINGTON, Judge. This was an action, sounding in damages, for breach of a covenant. The arbitrators were judges of the parties\u2019 own chusing, to settle all matters in dispute between them; and it is a rule, that awards should always be construed liberally.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I think the <em>items, </em>including the damages stated by them, were clearly within the submission. The award, therefore, (which, although not formal, is founded in strict justice,) ought to be supported. I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">LYONS, Judge. I concur with the other Judges, upon the first point made by <em>the </em>appellant\u2019s counsel; but differ from them on the other. There is a reference to damages generally; but, the principal and interest is the true measure of damages in law; and mere speculative injuries and conjectural inconveniences do not enter into the subject of damages, at all. The Court never enquires how the party got the money with which he paid the debt; but merely how much he paid? and when he paid it? Therefore, these conjectural damages being included, the award, I think, ought to be set aside; but there is a majority of the Court for sustaining the judgment; and, consequently, it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-14\">[* See <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Cabot </em>17 Mass.
