A c~visee ofnearly all the estate of a principal debtor, gave a bond to indeninify the c~tate of the surety against the debt; in which bond one of the </em>executors of the surety bound himself, in his individual character, as surety for the said devisee. The creditor, afterwards, obtained a judgment, in the <em>Federal </em>Court, against the said executors; one of whom, (viz. the same who was co-obligor in the bond of indemnity,) paid off the Judgment. The said bond being in the possession of one of the obligees, who resided <em>out of the State, </em>and refused to let them have it, the.Executors brought a suit in <em>Chancery, </em>against the said devisee, (the plaintiffs and defendant being all citizens and residents <em>of this State,) </em>to recover of him the .money so paid; and the Court\u2019s jurisdiction was sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AaL\">2. <em>It seems, </em>that, if a judgment be rendered, in a <em>Federal </em>Court, against the executors of a <em>surety, </em>and they pay the money; they cannot recover it against a <em>devisee </em>of the principal debtor, by <em>motion, </em>or any action at <em>common lato, </em>in the General Court or any other Court of law, of this Commonwealth.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AYoX\">3. According to the practice in our Courts of Equity, <em>it seems </em>that a pill to set up a lost bond, need not be supported by the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVHQ\"><em>SOME time about the year 1771, ~Tosep1i Cabefl became bound, as the surety of Wilhiaia Megginson, in a bond to George Kippen &amp; Co. British merchants, for the sum of 511l. 17s. 8d. payable May 11th 1771. En the year 1777, William .i3fegginsom died, leaving to his son Joseph C. Megginson, by Will, nearly all his estate both real and personal, which was very considerable. Joseph cabell administered on that estate, and became the guardian at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the said <em>Joseph C. Megginson, </em>who was the son of his daughter. In 1797, he settled his accounts as administrator and guardian, and <em>Joseph C. Megginson </em>gave him a receipt in full for all his transactions as such. In 1798, he died, having by his Will given a considerable property to the same <em>Joseph C., </em>and farther devised as follows : \u201c It is also my desire that my grandson <em>Joseph \u201c C. Megginson </em>may be released by my executors from all <em>\u201c </em>demands and debts on account of his father\u2019s estate to <em>\u201c </em>mine, <em>except the British debt I stand bound as security-\u201cfor his father.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-3\">After the death of <em>Joseph Cabell, </em>his executors and other devisees and legatees, entertaining apprehensions on account of the said British debt, expressed the same to <em>Joseph C. Megginson, </em>who thereupon assured them that the debt was paid off or nearly so, and that he had vouchers to prove it; but, to prevent the possibility of injury from that quarter, they proposed to give him a thousand dollars to indemnify the estate of their testator; to which lie agreed, and accepted two negro men slaves, valued at that sum, in consideration whereof he executed a bond, to <em>Robert C. Harrison, William J. Lewis </em>(one of the executors,) and <em>John Brackenridge, </em>conditioned to indemnify the estate of his grandfather, against the said British debt, and all claims on account of his father\u2019s estate; and <em>Joseph Cabell </em>(the other executor,) became the surety to the said bond, in his individual character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\"><em>George Kippen &amp; Co. </em>afterwards instituted a suit in the <em>Federal Court, </em>and obtained a judgment, against the said executors, for the sum of 865l. 15s. <em>3d. </em>which was paid by the last mentioned <em>Joseph Cabell </em>to <em>James Lyle </em>the factor and agent of the said Company, on the 23d of October 1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">Suit was then brought, by the Executors, against <em>Joseph C. Megginson, </em>in the Superior Court of <em>Chancery </em>for the Richmond District, to recover of him the money so paid; the plaintiffs alledging in their Bill, that the bond of indemnity given as aforesaid was lost by time *r accident, and no copy thereof was in their possessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>^ie Par^ies interested considered the plaintiff <em>Cabell </em>responsible individually, in consequence of his suretyship aforesaid, but were willing that the claim should bo fixed at once on the proper person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aoh\">The defendant, by his answer, admitted the material statements of the bill, but alledged' that the sum recover\u2019ed by <em>ICippen Co. </em>was much more than was due; that, before the said recovery was had, the complainants were informed by him that he had sundry vouchers to prove this; a description of which was giren in the answer; that the Complainants failed to apply to him for the said vouchers, and to make the proper defence to the suit of <em>Kippen &amp; Co., </em>to whom, therefore, the Complainant <em>Ca-bell </em>paid the money in his own wrong. The defendant alledged that he had not received a portion of certain slaves devised to him by his grandfather, which were sold by the said <em>Cabell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afm\">He filed a cross-bill against the Complainants, making <em>Kippen &amp; Co., </em>and <em>James Lyle </em>their agent or factor, and <em>John Cabell, </em>defendants thereto; alledging his belief that the debt to <em>Kippen </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>was nearly paid; that, not being a party to the suit brought by them, he supposed he could not defend it; that he believed many of his father\u2019s papers were in the possession of <em>John Cabell </em>and of the said Coniplainants, of which he prayed a discovery from them; and, also, from <em>Kippen &amp; Co. </em>and <em>Lyle, </em>an account of all the payments made towards the said debt; and that their books be produced for examination. <em>John Cabell, </em>and the plaintiffs in the first suit, all denied possession of any such papers. <em>Joseph Cabell </em>in his answer stated that, during the pendency of the British suit, he frequently applied to <em>Megginson </em>for vouchers, but could not obtain them until after it was decided; and then he found that credit had been given for all the payments shewn by those vouchers, and for many more: that, as to the negroes, part of whom were devised by <em>Joseph Cabell </em>the elder to <em>Megginson, </em>they did not belong to the testator; that the other devisees had gratuitously given <em>Megginsonn </em>moiety of a tract of land of 3000 acres, and that the respondent had given a negro to each of <em>Megginson\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>children. He exhibited with his answer a copy of the bond of indemnity, (admitted by <em>Megginson </em>to be a tee copy;) stating the original to be in the hands of <em>Robert C Harrison, </em>in Kentucky, who would not give it up,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ao5\">The suits abated as to <em>Megginson </em>by his death, and were revived in the names of his administrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">The cross suit does not appear to have been matured for hearing as to <em>Rippen Co. </em>and <em>Lyle, </em>when both causes were brought on to be heard by consent of parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">Chancellor Tayuoh, 46 being of opinion that, when-44 the plaintiffs paid the debt in the bill mentioned, as re-44 presenting <em>Joseph Cabdl </em>the security of <em>William </em>Meg-44 <em>ginson, </em>to <em>George Kippen &amp; Co., </em>they, the plaintiffs, 44 had a plain remedy, at law, against the defendant in \u25a0' the first suit, as appears by their bill, and might have 44 been reimbursed by a motion, under the Act to em~ \u201cpower securities to recover damages in a summary 44 way,\u201d dismissed their Bill, with costs, 44 without prejudice to any suit they might be advised to institute, 44 either under that act, or at the common law, for recovery 44 of the money in the bill mentioned.\u201d He dismissed also the cross bill, at <em>.Megginson\u2019s </em>costs, and ordered the Clerk to put the costs of one suit against the other, that the balance might be known, so that only one execution .might issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-10\">From this decree the plaintiffs in the first suit appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-11\"><em>Stanard </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzS\">insisted, that, independently of the bond of indemnity, they were entitled, as executors of the surety, to relief in <em>Equity</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-12\">1st, Because the statutory remedy by motion does not oust the Court of Equity of its pre-existing jurisdiction over the subject;\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-13\">3dly, Because there was no <em>State </em>Court competent to give effect to the remedy by motion. The judgment was in the <em>Federal </em>Court, and the Act of Assembly gives the remedy in that Court only, <em>in which the judgment was rendered. </em>Even the Federal Court had not jurisdiction: for <em>all </em>the parties were <em>citizens </em>of this State:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARZ_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Sdly, Because there was no person against whom the motion could be made,- there being no living executor or administrator of the original debtor:-</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APHm\">4thly, Because, <em>at that time, </em>the statutory remedy was inadequate; since, on the i*ecovery by motion, interest was not allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbWP\">The complainants were also entitled to relief on account of the <em>loss of the bond, </em>of indemnity. Besides,-\u25a0 <em>Joseph Cabell, </em>who paid the amount of the Judgment, (being bound as <em>Megginson\u2019s </em>surety that it should be paid,) could not charge the disbursement in his account as executor. <em>He </em>had no remedy by motion against <em>Megginson, </em>as no judgment had been rendered on the bond to which <em>he </em>was the surety^ and ho was clearly entitled to relief. .</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3l\"><em>John Robertson </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACb\">This is a case purely of common law jurisdiction. Admitting that the plaintiffs, representing the original surety, had no remedy by motion, they might have r~sorted to their action of assnmpsit. But, in fact, their motion might have been made in the General Court. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It does not appear in the Record, that the estate of William Megginson the principal debtor was not represented. On the contrary, Joseph C. .~W~g_ ginson was his heir; arnl, by the Act of Assembly, the motion is authorised against \"heirs, executors or administrators.\"<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The Judgment being obtained in 1808, the remedy was complete for interest, as well as for the sum paid.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuB\">The ground taken to give the Court jurisdiction, that the Bond of inddmnity was lost, is admitted by the answei' to the cross bill not to be founded in fact. But, a~ to this point, the bill should have been supported by affl_ da~oit.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark>It is therefore defective on it's face, and was properly dismissed, though no plea to tliejurisdiction was filed. <footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATMB\">Samuel Taylor on the same side. The question resolves itself to this.

Admitting, bow-ever, it were necessary, advantage of the omission ought to be taken by demurrer. If it be not <em>demanded </em>in the Court below, objection for want of it ought not to be made in the appellate Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyT\"><em>Megginson\u2019s </em>answer does not deny the <em>loss </em>of the bond.
