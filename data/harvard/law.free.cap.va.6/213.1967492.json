In <em>August,177% </em>a similar lease of the same estate is executed. The rents are to be settled by the scale of <em>&lt;Mhy} 1777\u00b0</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-6\">Interest upon the rents refused.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Chancery; where <em>Clinch, </em>as executor of <em>Holl, </em>together with the children of <em>Holt, </em>brought a bill against <em>Skipwith, </em>stating, that on the 23d of <em>May, </em>1777, <em>SMpioith </em>leased of Holt, an estate for twenty years, at <em>1501. per annum, </em>with a proviso for payment of the further sum of <em>501. per </em>annum, provided there should be peace between <em>G. Britain </em>and <em>America; </em>the said 50to commence with the peace. That another lease was afterwards executed between the said parties, in every respect like the former, except that the latter is dated on the 31st of <em>August, </em>1778, instead of the 23d of <em>May, </em>1777. That the only reason for executing the second lease was, that the first had not been recorded. That the plaintiffs can prove that <em>specie </em>and not <em>paper money </em>was contemplated in the said lease. The bill states the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to the rents under the lease; the deed for which it states to have been lost; And prays, that the defendant may be compelled to pay the rents and perform the other covenants in the lease, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">The answer admits the two leases; but states, that the second was a-new contract, as there had been a misunderstanding between the parties relative to the first Denies that it was a <em>specie </em>contract; and says, it would not have been worth above a fourth or third of the nominal rent, had it been payable in specie. States, that the taxes, owing to the unjust valuation of the land by the commissioners, are excessively high, with other circumstances and difficulties, which have attended the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-10\">The deposition of a witness states, that <em>Skipwith </em>informed him that there was a lease of a date prior to that of <em>August, </em>1778, but, that the last had been executed at the particular request of <em>Holt, </em>although there was very little variance between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-11\">Another witness says, he understood from all he could learn from either party, that the rent was to be paid in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>specie, </em>or (what he understood by that expression,) <em>good money-</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACq\">Another witness says, he witnessed the original lease, which he has lately seen; and at the bottom was a note, in the hand-writing of <em>Holt, </em>as the deponent was informed, in these words, \u201cthis lease renewed the 31st <em>August, </em>1778;\u201d but the deponent knows nothing of the last mentioned lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">Another witness says) the plaintiff, <em>Clinch, </em>told him that the defendant had paid <em>Holt </em>the first year\u2019s rent in <em>paper money, </em>as appeared by <em>Holt\u2019s </em>books; and that he believed the reason why he did not annually pay it, to have been, because <em>Holt </em>would not receive it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">Another witness says, he lived with the defendant in 1778, and wrote the last, lease, which he attested as a witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-10\">The two deeds appear to be the same, except as to their dates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au\">The Court of Chancery was of opinion, that the rents were payable according to the value of money at the date of the first lease, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to the same benefits under the last lease, as if it had been executed on the date of the first. That Court, therefore, decreed the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs, 300/. of the present current money of <em>Virginia, </em>for the arrearages of the rents on the 1st of <em>January, </em>1784, (taken for the date of the peace;) and 1,044/. of like money for the arrearages to the 1st of January, 1797, with liberty to sue writs of <em>scire facias </em>from time to time to recover future arrears, and that upon all trials at law, the defendant should admit the deed of 31st of <em>August, </em>1778, to be of like force as if executed in May, 1777: Prom which decree <em>Skipwith </em>appealed to this Court. And the plaintiff likewise petitioned for an appeal, because the Court had scaled the rents instead of decreeing them in specie; and because interest was not allowed upon the rents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-12\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-13\">There is no pretext for considering this as a specie contract; as there is in fact nothing to shew that it was meditated by the parties, and the answer denies that it was a specie contract. The true way is to consider it as a contract of the date of the last deed, and subject to''the scale of that period. That is the only legal notion, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>circumstances lead to a belief that the parties intended it as a new substantive contract of that date. Consequently, the depreciation is to be settled by the scale at that time; and none of the cases in this Court are against us. <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>1 Wash. 8, is rather in our favor; because, the principle which it establishes is, that you cannot antedate the period of depreciation, unless there is something upon the face of the instrument to authorise it; but, here, there is nothing. The same doctrine was held by the Court in stronger and more explicit language in <em>Bogle, Somerville &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Vowles, </em>1 Call, <em>244, </em>and there, evidence of the date of the original contract was actually refused: Which was an express determination in the very point contended for by us; because, there is nothing particular in our case to take it out of the common rule. Finally, the principles laid down by the Court in <em>Watson </em>et al. v. <em>Alexander, </em>1 Wash. 340, instead of militating against the position we contend for, will on due examination be found to be consistent with it. Interest was properly disallowed by the Court of Chancery under all the circumstances of the case; for, the full value of the rent was agreed to be given, had there been no change in the property; and in event, it has proved a very hard bargain.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\">The style of the last deed, evidently shews that the drawer had the first before him; and, that the latter was intended merely as a renewal of the first, the time for recording of which had expired. Consequently, <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>1 Wash. 8, cited by the appellant\u2019s counsel, operates against him, and in every point applies in our favor. For, the last deed is for payment of rent from a day anterior to the date. The case of <em>Bogle, Somerville &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Vowles, </em>is very different from this, and cannot affect it; because, there was nothing, in that case, to form a ground of enquiry into the date: for it was a naked case, unattended with circumstances. As to <em>Watson </em>et al. v. <em>Alexander, </em>the spirit of that determination is clearly in our favor. Besides, all those were cases at common law where more strictness obtains; but, this a case originating in the Court of Chancery, and, therefore, to be governed by the principles of equity. At the least, we are entitled to the value of the money at the date of the first deed. But, there is strong ground to infer that specie was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tended by the parties; for, the lease was a long one, and probably to last beyond the period of the war: and at the close of that the rent was to be increased. All which circumstances lead to a belief, that specie was the object of the parties. Interest ought to be allowed upon the rents, because, they were liquidated and certain; in which case, and especially where there have been long delays, interest has been given. <em>[Litton </em>v. Litton,] 1 P. Wms. 542; <em>[Morris </em>v. Dillingham,] 2 Ves. <em>sen. </em>170; <em>[Newman </em>v. Auling,] 3 Atk. 579; <em>[Batten </em>v. Earnley,] 2 P.

That those were cases at common law, does not alter the rule; because the act makes no difference between a Court of Law and a Court of Equity in this respect. , On the contrary, it gives equal power to both Courts to decide according to Equity. The circumstances of this case are particularly hard; and therefore, interes\u00ed\u00bfought not to be allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b236-11\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A7I\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that there was no error in the decree, in establishing the date of the contract; and as to the interest, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to it. Because, if it was certain, they might have distrained, and therefore, should not have lain by and suffered the interest to accumulate; and if it was uncertain (as they themselves plainly shewed it was, by contending, at one time, that it was specie, and at another, that the lease was to be considered as of a different date from that admitted by the defendant, and therefore they did not venture to distrain,) then, according to the very cases relied on by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, interest was not demandable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nor ought the plaintiffs to have interest from the time of the decree;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> because they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>themselves appealed as well as <em>Skipioith; </em>and therefore contributed to rendering the amount uncertain and termined still.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\">[* Dow v. <em>Adam's </em>adm\u2019rs. 5 Munf. 21; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>et al. 3 H.&amp; M. 467, and <em>Obermyer </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>6 Binney, 159.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AeH\">[\u2020 See post, <em>Deanes </em>v. <em>Scriba </em>et al. 419.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
