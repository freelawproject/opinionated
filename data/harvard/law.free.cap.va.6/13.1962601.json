In an action of slander, for charging the plaintiff with pe1~jury in a judicial proceeding; the defendant, on the plea of list gviltg, (tho' not permitted to prove the falsit~j of the words sworn by the plaintiff,) may prove ~vha,t those ~vord~ ~ver~, in mitigation of' damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">THIS was au action of slander brought by the appellee against the appellant in the Superior Court of Kanawha County. The declaration charged the defendant with having said \"that the plaintifF was a peijured rascal,\" meaning thereby that \"the plaintiff was guilty of swear-\"lug falsely in a judicial proceeding where he was Ic\"gaily called upon to depose, and a lawful oath admin\"istered to him.\" Plea .lVbt Gnilt~q. At the trial, the defendant, (after having examined ~L1udrew liomnally, a witness introduced by him, (which witness was the mag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>istrate before whom the testimony impugned had been given by the plaintiff,) whether the plaintiff refused to answer any question put to him by the said magistrate, who said he did not refuse, but sometimes hesitated before he gave the answer,) then wished to interrogate the witness'as to <em>what </em>the plaintiff swore before him; but the Court would not permit the defendant\u2019s counsel to introduce such evidence, \u201c <em>considering that the truth or \u201cfalsehood of his answers were improper, upon the plea </em>\u201c <em>of not </em>guilty\u201c the opinion of the Court being that \u201cthe defendant, upon that plea, had a right, in mitigation \u201cof damages, to give in evidence any quarrel between \u201c the plaintiff and defendant at the time the plaintiff gave \u201cevidence, or that he was under the influence of the party \u201c for whom he deposed, or that he was a man of ill fame \u201c in witness-bearing; but that what hie swore upon the \u201c trial before the magistrate, was improper to go to the \u201cjury in mitigation of damages, or in any manner to \u201cjustify the speaking the words upon the plea aforesaid,\u201d Whereupon the defendant filed a bill of exceptions. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $500 damages;\u2014 from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-12\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3j\">The Court\u2019s opinion was clearly against law. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> If the plaintiff in his testimony had spoken ill of the defendant\u2019s character, or of the character of his wife, or of some near relation of his, would not evidence of this have been proper <em>in mitigation of damages? </em>Perhaps the defendant might have been sworn before the same magistrate, and his testimony might have been contradicted by that of the plaintiff. He might <em>then </em>have said that the plaintiff was perjured.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> This is a supposed case; but we cannot introduce any other; for the judge would not let us shew what the case was.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-13\">\n<em>Wirt contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae7\">A Bill of Exceptions is the joint act of the Court and Counsel. The only opinion given is that, on the plea of <em>not guilty, </em>the defendant could not give the <em>truth </em>of the words in evidence by way of mitigation.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The defendant should have stated, in the bill of exceptions, for what purpose he wanted to introduce the testimony, if it was not to proye the truth of the words__ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>That </em>appears to be the only object, according to this Bill of Exceptions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC4\">The opinion of the judge certainly went to exclude all evidence to shew <em>what it was </em>the plaintiff swore to; and this was wrong. It is not said in the bill of exceptions, that the defendant offered to prove that the plaintiff was <em>perjured. </em>His object in putting the question to the witness is not stated.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"><em> Chitty, </em>488.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b34-9\"><em> </em>6 <em>Bac. </em>226. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Clapham.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b34-10\"><em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>2 Stra. 1200; 3 <em>Selwyn </em>1066.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-6\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">delivered the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The Court is of opinion that, altho\u2019 it might have been improper to have permitted the appellant, in this case, to prove the <em>falsity of the words </em>charged to have been sworn before the magistrate, and thus, upon the plea of not guilty, to fix upon the appellee <em>indirectly </em>the charge of perjury, it was competent for the appellant to draw from the witness <em>what those words were, </em>in mitigation of damages: it being evident that the character of the words in question may have had a tendency to mitigate or aggravate those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The Judgment is, therefore, to be reversed, and a new trial granted, in which the question propounded by the appellant, is to be answered, if requested.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
