Some time during the same year <em>Tait </em>rented to <em>Dr. Humphreys </em>the tenement adjoining that rented to <em>Kyle if Mays, </em>for one year at \u00a3100. On the 10th of December 1812, <em>Caleb Tait </em>sold, and on the next day conveyed to <em>James C. Moor-man </em>the aforesaid two tenements, for \u00a3 4200. Of this sum, a part was paid by lands in <em>Kentucky, </em>a part by lands in the county of <em>Campbell, </em>\u00a3 600 in cash, \u201c <em>David Kyle\u2019s </em>lease on the house four years \u00a3 360,\u201d \u201c one year\u2019s rent of the tenement in the possession of <em>Dr. Humphreys </em>and on the balance amounting to \u00a31080, <em>Moorman </em>was to have a credit of ten years, upon his paying the interest yearly; and he was to give his bond for the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\">The rent due March 16th, 1816, from <em>Kyle if Mays, </em>was paid by them to <em>Caleb Tail\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r. But <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle </em>having in 1814, purchased from <em>Moor-man </em>the two tenements, and received a conveyance therefor, and <em>Moorman </em>insisting that <em>Tait </em>was not entitled under the contract between <em>Tait </em>and <em>Moorman, </em>to the rent which fell due in March 1817, the <em>Kyles </em>did not pay it. <em>Tail\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r thereupon in 1819, filed a bill in the Chancery court at <em>Lynchburg </em>against <em>Moorman </em>and the <em>Kyles, </em>in which he set out the contract between <em>Tail </em>and <em>Moorman, </em>and sought to recover this rent, and also to compel <em>Moorman </em>to execute the contract by giving his bond for the balance' of the purchase money, for which he was to have a eredit of ten years, and to pay up the interest thereon which was in arrear. <em>Moor-man </em>answered the bill, and denied the plaintiff\u2019s right to the rent which fell due in March 1817; and the <em>Kyles </em>answered, stating that they had paid the rent up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>to March 1816; and that they had not paid the rent for the next year, because the tenement had been sold and conveyed to them prior to the 16th of March 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">This cause was so proceeded in, that on the 20th of October 1823, the Court made a decree against <em>Moor-</em>man, by which he was directed to pay to <em>Tait\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r the sum of 4466 dollars 93 cents, with interest on 3489 dollars 33 cents, a part thereof, from the 10th of December 1822, till paid: that being the balance of purchase money, principal and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\"><em>James C. Moorman </em>having failed to pay to <em>Tait\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r the amount of the decree of October 1823, the administrator, in May 1824, filed his bill in the Chancery court of <em>Lynchburg against Moorman </em>and <em>David </em>and <em>William </em>Kyle, in which he set out the contract between <em>Caleb Tait </em>and <em>Moorman, </em>and the proceedings in the former suit; and charging that <em>Moorman </em>was insolvent, and that the <em>Kyles </em>purchased from him with notice of <em>Tait\u2019s </em>equitable lien for the purchase money, he sought to subject the two tenements in the possession of the <em>Kyles </em>to satisfy the decree against <em>Moorman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">The <em>Kyles </em>answered the bill. <em>David Kyle </em>says: That he has no knowledge of the contract between <em>Caleb Tait </em>and <em>James C. Moorman </em>in relation to the sale of the tenements therein mentioned, other than that derived from the proceedings in the suit referred to in the bill; which suit was instituted long after he bought the property from <em>Moorman, </em>and had paid for the same. He expressly denies that he had notice at the time of his purchase, of any lien either legal or equitable, on said property. He ascertained that said <em>Moorman </em>had an absolute deed of bargain and sale from <em>Tait </em>for the tenements, and having done so, he became the purchaser without any enquiry in relation to the contract between <em>Caleb Tait </em>and <em>Moorman. </em>That before the sale by <em>Tait </em>to <em>Moorman, </em>he had made to <em>Tait </em>an offer for the purchase of the tenements, which <em>Tait </em>rejected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>That shortly afterwards defendant left home : and when, after several weeks absence, he returned, and again proposed to purchase the property, he was informed by <em>Tait </em>he had sold it to <em>Moorman; </em>and to use his own language, \u201che had got paid for it.\u201d He denies most positively any knowledge of the contract between <em>Tait </em>and <em>Moorman </em>in relation to the terms of payment for said property. He contracted with <em>Moorman, </em>on the faith of his deed, and complied with that contract without the least suspicion or any notice whatever, of the claim now set up in the plaintiff\u2019s bill. Under all the circumstances he is advised the said property is not subject to the lien pretended by the plaintiff, especially as he was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration, and without notice. He does not admit that he paid the purchase money to <em>Moorman </em>after notice of the pretended lien to the plaintiff or his intestate. On the contrary, the payment was made before any notice of the lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\"><em>William Kyle </em>answered, and said that <em>David Kyle </em>was the acting partner of the firm in <em>Lynchburg. </em>He denied all knowledge of the facts stated in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, and referred to and adopted the answer of <em>David Kyle.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">There was no direct proof that the <em>Kyles </em>were informed of the terms of the contract between <em>Tail </em>and <em>Moorman; </em>but it was proved that at the time of the contract they occupied one of the tenements, and that the contract was generally known in <em>Lynchburg, </em>and talked of as an extraordinary one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">The cause came on to be heard in May 1830, when the Court below held that the answer of <em>David Kyle </em>was evasive, and that therefore he had not made it necessary by his answer, for the plaintiff\u2019 to prove that he had notice. And the decree was that the plaintiff should recover against <em>James C. Moorman </em>the sum of 4466 dollars 93 cents, with interest on 3489 dollars 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>cents, a part thereof, from the 10th of December 1822 until paid, and his costs. And that the marshal of the Court, after advertising the sale as prescribed in the decree, should proceed to sell for ready money, the lot and tenements in the bill mentioned, and after deducting the expenses of the sale, should deposite the proceeds in one of the banks in <em>Lynchburg. </em>From this decree <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-9\"><em>Samuel Taylor </em>and <em>Cooke, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-10\"><em>G. N. Johnson, for the </em>appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-11\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">The Court is of opinion, that according to the true intent and meaning of the parties, to be collected from the pleadings and exhibits in the cause, they contemplated a sale and purchase of the premises in the proceedings mentioned, subject to the lease, the vendor reserving the rent; and if in consequence of the absolute conveyance to the vendees, the right of the vendor to enforce the collection of the rents from the tenants, was lost or impaired, the vendees incurred a personal obligation to account for the same to the vendor, if the same was collected by them, or otherwise released by them. The Court is therefore of opinion, that there was no waiver of the lien for the purchase money or any part thereof, by the stipulation in regard to the rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">The Court is further of opinion, that under the pleadings in this cause, and the facts disclosed by the record, the appellants, notwithstanding their answers, cannot be regarded as <em>bona fide </em>purchasers without <em>notice of </em>the facts upon which depended the claim of the vendor Caleb <em>Tail, </em>to charge the property sold with the vendor\u2019s lien for the unpaid purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that there is no error in so much of the decree as holds the lot and tene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>merits in question liable for the amount of the purchase money ascertained by the decree in favour of the administrator of said <em>Caleb Tail </em>against the said <em>James C. </em>Moorman, to be due and unpaid, and in decreeing a sale of said property for the payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">But the Court is of opinion, that in the details of said decree there was error in this, that said decree gives no day to the appellants to redeem the property by paying up the amount charged upon it. And also in directing a sale for cash, instead of allowing a reasonable <em>credit; </em>there being nothing in the record to shew that in the exercise of a sound discretion a sale of such a valuable property for cash was required; and the relation of the parties, and the character of the lien rendering it proper that a sale upon a reasonable credit should have been directed. It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed that said decree, so far as the same is hereinbefore declared to be erroneous be reversed, and that in all other respects it be affirmed. That the appellants recover their costs, and that the cause be remanded with instructions to enter a decree providing that unless the appellants, or some one for them, pay to the appellee the debt and interest ascertained to be due by said <em>James C. Moorman </em>on account of said purchase money, and the costs of said suit, within 90 days, that said property be sold upon reasonable credits to be fixed by the Court; and for further proceedings in order to a final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
