Co. <em>Litt. 56, (b.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Nor can it be taken as a conveyance upon the statute; because, the parties appear to have clearly intended, that it should operate as a common law conveyance. But, it cannot operate as a statutory conveyance, for another rea\u00bb son; namely, because there is not a sufficient consideration, there being neither money or blood expressed. For, the finding of the jury that the deed was made, -for the purpose of settling it in her family, does not supply the want of a consideration; especially as the plaintiff (who is the son,) was as near, and nearer in blood than the defendant\u2019s wife, who was only the grand-daughter of Mrs. Jordan. But, another objection to the deed is, that the wife was not privily examined, as the act of 1748, [c. 1, 5 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>410,] requires. For, the commission issued in <em>blank, </em>instead of being directed to Justices; and it does not appear, that it was sent to the county, in which Mrs. <em>Jordan </em>resided. But, if there was a sufficient consideration, and the wife had duly relinquished, still the defendant\u2019s title would have been defective; because, by the deed, she had no power to convey a fee, but merely a life estate. For, the deed does not give her power to convey the whole interest; but, it merely gives her power to'appoint to such persons, as she thinks proper, without naming any estate in particular; which, in contemplation of law, only gave her power to convey an estate for life, to the appointee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-8\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-9\">The finding of the jury, that Mrs. <em>Jordan </em>made the conveyance, in' order to settle the estate in her family, is a sufficient consideration. 7 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 97, <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.] cites <em>Ld. Bac. Read, on Stat. of Uses, </em>310; and the defendant might aver, and prove the consideration. <em>Randolph v. Eppes, </em>[ante, 125,] in this Court. But, the connection, between husband and wife, or wife and husband, is a sufficient consideration to raise a use and support a conveyance; and, as it appears in the deed, that that connection subsisted between the donors in the present case; and that the husband, instead of a chance to be tenant by the curtesy, which is an estate liable to impeachment of waste, was to have an estate for life certain, without any impeachment of waste, there was clearly a sufficient consideration to sustain the deed. Because, ic-a man may covenant to stand seised to the use of A. his wife, and the consideration, that she is his wife, will raise a good estate to her; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>for, this is a good consideration in law.\u201d 7 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 99, 100, <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.;] <em>Bedell\u2019s </em>Case, 7 Co. 40; <em>Owen. </em>855; <em>Plow. </em>368. And, as the reason is the same, the . converse of the proposition must be equally true. Therefore, the deed, in the present case, operating as a covenant to stand seised to the use of the husband, that consideration was sufficient to raise an estate in him. Because, the estate, which he was to take under the deed, was more beneficial than that, which he would have been entitled to, without. It is not necessary to consider the conveyance, as at common law; because, most clearly, as there were sufficient considerations, it operated as'a covenant to stand seised to uses. For, the object plainly was, that the land should pass one way or another; and, therefore, it may be good either way, without adhering to any particular kind of way, or any particular mode, or form of conveyance. <em>Roe, </em>dem. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Trannmarr </em>et al. [Willes\u2019 R. 682,] 2 Wils. 75. Which case is an express answer to the argument, that it could not be considered as a statutory conveyance, because the parties intended a conveyance at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\">The deed was sufficient to enable Mrs. <em>Jordan </em>to convey a fee simple to her appointee. For, the trustee was to convey in any manner she might think proper, and it was clearly the general intent to enable her to dispose of the absolute property. Besides, the deed amounted to a consent, on the part of the husband, that the wife might make a will, and the verdict finds that she devised it in fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">The relinquishment was well taken. Because the commissioners are stated to have been.Justices of the Peace, and although the verdict finds that the commission issued <em>blank, </em>it does not state that it was returned <em>blank. </em>But, the practice is to issue them blank, and the Justices who take the relinquishment fill them up: which, for aught that appears to the contrary, might have been the case here. Besides, unless the contrary be expressly found, it is too much to say, that after the commission has been received and recorded by the Court, that it shall be supposed to have been improperly executed. The deed expressly states, that Mrs. <em>Jordan </em>was an inhabitant of <em>Buckingham; </em>and, therefore, the verdict does in effect find, that the commission went to the proper county. So, that that objection is obviated by the express finding- in the verdict; if, indeed it be necessary that the <em>feme </em>should be an inhabitant.of the county into which the commission goes; which may per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>haps admit of some doubt, as the words in the act are, \u25a0where the wife resides; which expression may be-satisfied by a temporary residence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQU\">It was a rule, at that time, that an heir at law should not be disinherited by implication, unless absolutely necessary; and, therefore, the Court will require the observance of the general forms prescribed by the law. Here was neither money lior blood; and without one there was no consideration to raise an use. Mrs. <em>Jordan </em>does not appear to have had her own blood in view; because the deed purports to give her an unlimited power of appointing; so that she might have given it to a stranger if she thought proper; and, in fact she did so; for, the limitation to the defendant, was a limitation to a stranger, as there was no blood between him and herself. Mrs. <em>Jordan </em>could not convey a fee under the first deed; which only gives a power to convey a life estate; for, there are no words of perpetuity; and if the will is relied on, it ought to have been found. The blank commission was void; as the statute expressly requires, that it should be issued to Justices of the Peace.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b250-10\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A4en\">Delivered the resolution of the Court; that there was <em>no </em>error in the judgment of the District Court; and that it was to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Judgment affirmed. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-12\">[* See on tills subject, <em>Jackson, </em>dem. <em>Houseman </em>et al. v. <em>Sebring, </em>(in error) 16 Johns.
