To ascertain that intention, the whole Will must be taken together; and the circumstance~s nuder which it was made may be taken into consideration.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At5\">Apply this rule to the Will in question. Upon it's face, the testator appears to have been a man in middling circmnstances, eudeavouriug to make some provision for every. one of his nmnerous family, of nine children, after providing a maintenance for his wife during her widowhood. He appears to have possessed at the date of the Will only two female negroes; viz. Beck and Nan. He gives Beck to Win. WoodSy, and Nan to his wife, absolutely, (but saying nothing' o[~ their increase,) after lending all his estate real and personal to his wife during widowhood. He bequeaths to his daughter <em>Jtgatha, </em>the first child whom Beck should raise; shewing thereby that he considered the progeny of Beck, Avliom he knew to be a <em>young breeding </em>woman, as one of the means of providing lor his other children, avIio, without this provision, would have little or nothing; and, immediately after giving Nan, without mentioning her increase, he says, \u201cItem, \u201c all the rest and remainder of my estate, <em>be it of what </em>\u201c <em>nature or quality soever, not herein particularly before \u201c given or mentioned to be given away, </em>it is my will all \u201cmy children above mentioned may have it equally di- \u201c vided among them.\u201d It is evident, from the strong wording of this residuary clause, and all the circumstances taken together, especially the <em>smallness of the residuary fund, if the increase of Beck and Nan were not included in it, </em>that he must have intended to comprehend that increase in the residuum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcjO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>^ie wor^Sj <em>\u201c be it of what nature or quality soever,\u201d </em>shew that he contemplated not only the household furniture, &amp;c. but <em>slaves, </em>which, when this Will was written, and also when the testator died, were to many purposes <em>real </em>estate; at all events, that he contemplated different Species 0f property; which words can not be satisfied without including the children of Beck. Besides, it must be admitted that the increase of Beck are not <em>\u00abparticularly </em>mentioned or given away in the foregoing part of the Will:\u201d they are therefore expressly included in the terms of the residuary clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJQ\">Even if those terms had not been as strong as they are, it has been repeatedly decided that a general residuary clause passes all <em>personal </em>estate, which is not otherwise sufficiently disposed <em>of </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Claiborne, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>262, shews that, in this respect, <em>slaves </em>were governed by the same Rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-6\">It may be contended, that, according to the maxim, <em>\u201cpartus sequitur ventresi,\u201d </em>the gift of Beck, without any other words, was a sufficient gift of her children. It might be so, in a case where no express words or conclusive circumstances demonstrated the intention of the testator to be otherwise. I admit that, in a <em>doubtful </em>case, (as Judge Roane says in <em>Reno\u2019s executors </em>v. <em>Davis,) </em>\u201cthe \u201c law of humanity ought to turn the scale, and prevent \u201cthe separation of the children from their mother.\u201d But, if the testator chuses, he has the light to give the children to one and the mother to another; and, in the case before us, he has done so by plain and positive words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-7\">As to Pat and her children, the bequest to <em>Agatha Woody </em>of \u201cthe first child Beck raises,\u201d must be construed as applying to the first child <em>born of Beck, </em>and raised by her, <em>after the testator\u2019s death; </em>because a Will does not take effect until <em>then, </em>and operates from <em>that </em>time: for \u00ab a Testament is a just and complete declaration or sen\u00abtence of a man\u2019s mind, or last will of what he would \u201c have to be done with his estate, <em>after his death, 7 Bac. </em>299.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>Wickham, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX_X\">This case is settled already; for it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>lias been repeatedly decided that, where slaves are given for life, the remainder-man is entitled to their increase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afq\">If the testator intended the increase as a fund for his other children, why did he not say so?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aiz\"><em>Beck </em>being given to <em>William Woody, </em>her <em>children </em>followed of course. It was not necessary to mention <em>them.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-5\">Mr. Wythe had no doubt upon this point. The residuary clause made no difference; if there had been no such clause, the effect would have been the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\">The bequest to <em>Agatha Woody </em>was not of the first child Beck should have, but of the first that should be <em>raised, </em>whether born before or after the death of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-7\">Suppose Beck had had <em>no </em>child born <em>after </em>the testator\u2019s death; then <em>Agatha Woody </em>would have received <em>nothing </em>according to Mr. <em>Munford\u2019s </em>construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-8\"><em>Munford </em>in reply. 1 wish Mr. <em>Wickham </em>had produced the cases, in which he says it has been settled, that the remainder-man, upon the termination of an estate for life in slaves, is entitled to their increase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-9\">If be had, I believe it would have been found that none of them resemble this. Admit, that <em>in general, </em>where the Will contains <em>no words disposing of the increase, </em>the law is as he has stated; yet, where, as in this case, the testator\u2019s intention appears to be to establish a different rule, such intention must prevail.. Here the Will by the residuary clause expressly disposes of the increase: the remainder-man is therefore not entitled.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ak84\"> Reno's Executors v.
