The defendant pleaded, 1. payment, generally; and 2. payment by <em>Clopton </em>to <em>Nicholas, </em>before notice of <em>Nicholas's </em>assignment to the plaintiffs. An issue was made up on the first plea by a general replication to it. To the second plea, the plaintiffs replied specially, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Clopton </em>did not pay the debts to <em>Nicholas </em>before notice of his assignment to the plaintiffs, because the assignment of a bond for 2247 dollars, dated the 27th August 1814, executed by <em>Nicholas </em>to one <em>Scott, </em>and by <em>Scott </em>pretended to be assigned to <em>Clopton </em>on the l\u2019lth August 1819, was, in fact, a fraud and collusion between <em>Scott </em>and <em>Clopton, </em>and was not a <em>bona fide </em>real sale and transfer of the bond, but the same was left by <em>Scott </em>in <em>Clop-ion\u2019s </em>hands, as a deposit, in order that <em>Clopton </em>might endeavour to set off and discount the same, and thereby defraud the plaintiffs of so much of the debts due to them on his own bonds; and so <em>Scott\u2019s </em>pretended assignment to <em>Clopton, </em>was not a real and absolute transfer of the bond, but conditional, collusive and fraudulent, made with purpose to defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of the debts due them from <em>Clopton. </em>The defendant put in a rejoinder, traversing the matters pleaded in the replication, and tendering an issue $ which was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">The three actions were consolidated by consent.

He testified, that <em>Scott </em>assigned <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond for 2247 dollars, to <em>Clopton, </em>at the same time: that the witness considered the contract to be concluded, and by no means to depend on any future stipulations between the parties; that <em>Scott </em>was bound to <em>Clopton, </em>and <em>Clopton </em>bound to him for what <em>he </em>had agreed to give. That, after the arrangement was made, there was an express understanding, that if by reason of, any law unknown to either party, <em>Clopton </em>should fail to sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tain the bond of <em>Nicholas </em>assigned to him by <em>Scott, </em>as a set-off against his own bonds to <em>Nicholas, </em>in that event neither should molest the other, both because each was bound to the other and could not, and because, if they could, neither had the disposition; that that express understanding was made at the witness\u2019s suggestion, to prevent <em>Clopton </em>from becoming uneasy, but the witness considered it as amounting to nothing, for it left the parties where they stood without it. That it was understood at the time, that <em>Nicholas </em>had failed, but it was not known that he had passed away <em>Ciopton\u2019s </em>bonds. That the witness believed, that the transaction between <em>Scott </em>and <em>Clopton </em>was perfectly fair, and free from fraudulent intention in either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">The circuit court held, that the law upon the demurrer to evidence was for the plaintiffs, and gave them judgments for the debts claimed in the declarations; from which <em>Ciopton\u2019s </em>administrator appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-6\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4l\">premised, that if the evidence adduced on the part of the demurrant, was in conflict with that of the other party, as set out in the demurrer to evidence, the demurrant\u2019s evidence must he entirely disregarded, and full credit given to the evidence offered by the other party. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, 5 </em>Rand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">1. <em>Hanshrough\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Thom, </em>3 Leigh 147. The state of the case, then, was to be collected from the evidence given for the defendant. And upon that evidence, the case was simply <em>this\u2014Clopton </em>was bound to <em>Nicholas </em>by bonds for debts payable at a future day; he had heard of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>failure, but he had. no knowledge that <em>Nicholas </em>had assigned his bonds to any other person. <em>Nicholas was </em>indebted to <em>Scott </em>by bond, to a less amount; and for the purpose of securing the debt due from <em>Nicholas </em>to <em>Sdott, Scott gave </em>an assignment of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Clopton, </em>expressed to be for value received, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>took <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>obligation to pay him the amount in three instalments, deferred for six months, respectively, after <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>debts to <em>Nicholas </em>fell due. After this bargain between <em>Scott </em>and <em>Clopton </em>was concluded, there was an understanding between the parties, that if, by reason of any law unknown to either, <em>Clopton </em>should fail in setting off <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond assigned to him by <em>Scott, </em>against his own debts to <em>Nicholas, </em>neither should molest the other; that is, <em>Scott </em>should make no demand on <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>obligation to him, and <em>Clopton </em>none on <em>Scott\u2019s </em>contract of assignment. And all this was before notice of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment of <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>bonds to <em>Morris </em>and <em>Bulloch </em>In this transaction, he said, it was difficult to see any thing illegal or unfair: there was nothing unfair on the part of <em>Scott, </em>unless it wa\u00e1 unfair to secure the debt due him from <em>Nicholas, </em>by procuring the undertaking of <em>Clopton </em>to pay it, and giving him indulgence for the payment, as a motive and consideration for the undertaking <em>; </em>nothing unfair on the part of <em>Clopton, </em>unless it was unfair in him to seek such indulgence for a debt from <em>Scott, </em>which he was not sure he could obtain fromis <em>Nicholas. Clopton </em>acquired, by <em>Scott\u2019s </em>assignment, legal title in the bond assigned to him. He might certainly have set off this bond against his own bonds to <em>Nicholas, </em>if these had remained in <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>hands, and <em>he </em>had brought suit on them; his right to such discount, arose at the time itwas assigned to him; and <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignees were bound to allow the same discount, since it would have been good against Nicholas\u2014to\u2019 allow all just discounts against their assignor, before notice of assignment given to the obligor. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 125. \u00a7 5. p. 484. The subsequent understanding,\u2014that, if <em>Clopton </em>should not be able to set off the bond assigned him by <em>Scott, </em>against his own bonds to <em>Nicholas, </em>neither party \u201c should molest the other,\u201d\u2014nowise varied the case: it left the parties, as the witness <em>Patteson </em>said, where they stood before; for <em>Scott </em>was responsible upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>his contract of assignment to <em>Cloplon, </em>and <em>Cloplon </em>was responsible on his obligation to <em>Scott, </em>for equal amounts, and if <em>Scott </em>should be unable to effect the set-off, or otherwise to recover the amount of the assigned bond from <em>Nicholas, </em>the two contracts would extinguish each other. These equities of the parties attached to their respective contracts, and would have followed them into whosoever hands they might pass. It could hardly be doubted, that if <em>Clopton </em>had purchased <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond from <em>Scott, </em>by the payment of the value of it in cash, at any agreed rate of discount, the bond would have been his property, and he might have set it off against his own bonds to <em>Nicholas. </em>Then, what was the difference, in principle, between paying the value in cash, and giving his obligation to pay it at a future day ? The contract of assignment of the bond, too, was supported by valuable consideration; a consideration moving from <em>Cloplon </em>to <em>Scott, </em>in the undertaking of <em>Clopton </em>to pay <em>Scott </em>the amount at a future day; and a consideration moving from <em>Scott </em>to <em>Clopton, </em>in the credit given him for the money, beyond that which he was entitled to for the debts he owed <em>Nicholas. </em>In short, he said, the true a,nd the only question on the merits, was, whether <em>Cloplon </em>had a right to acquire such a set-off against his bonds to <em>Nicholas, </em>before notice of the assignment of them.? If he had such right, he had exercised it, and that honestly and fairly. The issue on the second plea, was made up by the replication and rejoinder; and it was, whether the assignment of the bond by <em>Scott to Clopton </em>was a real and fair transaction, or pretended, fraudulent and collusive? And there was no fact in evidence, that could warrant an inference that the transaction was not really in fact, what it appeared to be on its face, or even a suspicion of fraud, practised or intended.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_V\">said, the true rule, with regard to demurrers to evidence, was, that the demurrant admitted the truth of all his adversary\u2019s evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>all inferences of fact fairly deducible from it, and waived his own evidence which was contradicted by that of his adversary: but he did not waive such of his own <em>J </em>.evidence as was nowise contradicted by that of the other party. If he did, the practice of setting out the demurrant\u2019s evidence as well as the other party\u2019s, which the settled rule of practice in such cases required, was idle and nugatory. The demurrants here, for example, would not have waived the evidence they offered of <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>bonds to <em>Nicholas, </em>and <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment thereof to them, if those points had been put in issue ; for there was no evidence on the other side contrary to it. So, it would be found, that the parol evidence adduced by the demurrant, was not contradicted, in the least particular, by the evidence offered by <em>Clopton: </em>the evidence of one party was perfectly consistent with that of the other; there was no question which was true and which false; all might be true ; and the question ought to be, what was the true state of the case to be collected from the whole evidence. But he contended, that, in truth, there was no substantial variance, much less contrariety, between the evidence on the one side and the other\u2014that every material fact stated by <em>Clopton </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, touching his transaction with <em>Scott, </em>was fairly, and indeed necessarily, inferrible from the testimony of the witnesses <em>introduced for </em>the defendant; the only difference being, that <em>Clopton </em>stated the circumstances of the transaction to the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, somewhat more in detail than it was stated by his witnesses (or rather by <em>Scott\u2019s, </em>for he was the real defendant). He entered into a minute examination of the testimony to shew this. But, he said, let the evidence of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Patteson </em>be talien alone, and <em>construed </em>with due regard to the subject matter. The debt which <em>Nicholas </em>owed <em>Scott </em>being jeoparded by <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>failure, and <em>Scott\u2019s </em>object being to secure it out of the debt which <em>Clopton </em>owed to <em>Nicholas; </em>and this being com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>municated to <em>Clopton, </em>and lie being willing to assist in the accomplishment of it; it was agreed between them, that <em>Scott </em>should assign the debt <em>Nicholas </em>owed him to <em>Clopton, </em>as for value received, that he might use it as a set-off, if he could, against the debts he owed <em>Nicholas; </em>and that <em>Clopton </em>should give <em>Scott </em>his note to pay him the amount, if he could effect the set-off. The assignment was plainly conditional; though it was absolute in form, and expressed to be for value received, and though <em>Clopton\u2019s assumpsit </em>to <em>Scott, </em>to pay him the amount of the bond, was also absolute on its face, yet the contract was, in truth, that if <em>Clopton </em>could not effect the set-off, neither was he to have any recourse against <em>Scott </em>on his contract of assignment, nor <em>Scott </em>any recourse against him on his undertaking to pay the money. It was truly said'by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that, in that case, the two contracts would extinguish each other. And the whole efficacy of the assignment of the bond, thus depending on the condition that it could and should be used as a set-off, the question was, whether the law would step in and perform the condition, allow the set-off and so make that a real and effectual contract, which otherwise would be wholly ineffectual? <em>Clopton </em>acquired no <em>title to the </em>assigned bond, by force of the assignment alone; his title to it could only be perfected by the performance of the condition subsequent, namely, making it available as a set-off; which he could never do but in the action against him on his bonds to <em>Nicholas. </em>This was not a just discount against <em>Nicholas, </em>acquired before notice of his assignment to the plaintiffs : the most that could be said was, that the acquisition had been commenced\u2014put in train; but it was not complete, and it never would be, unless this court should allow the set-off. Then, was the purpose a fair one, and such as the law would aid the parties in accomplishing ? <em>Nicholas </em>had failed; he had a right, in disposing of his effects, or any part <em>of </em>them, to give a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ference to one creditor over others, and the creditor who should be preferred by him, would have a just right to such preference; and with full knowledge, and indeed in contemplation of this, and with the avowed purpose securing <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>debt to <em>Scott, </em>out of <em>Ciopton\u2019s </em>debt to <em>Nicholas, </em>whatever disposition <em>Nicholas </em>had made or should make of that portion of his effects, <em>Scott </em>made an assignment to <em>Clopton </em>of the debt <em>Nicholas </em>owed him, and <em>Clopton </em>took the assignment, to <em>be used </em>as a <em>set-off </em>against the debts he owed <em>Nicholas, </em>in order that if the set-off could be effected, the amount of it should be paid to <em>Scott, </em>instead of <em>Nicholas, </em>or any creditor whom he should prefer. What was this but a contrivance to give <em>Scott </em>a preference for satisfaction <em>out </em>of this fund, over any <em>creditor </em>of <em>Nicholas </em>to whom he might give the preference ? to anticipate and defeat <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>right to give such preference, and any preferred creditor\u2019s just right to such, preference ? He said, a contrivance to defeat the just rights of other persons, of whatever nature they might be, was fraudulent in law; therefore, this transaction was, in its substance and purpose, fraudulent and collusive; and, as it could only be perfected,\u2014as the condition on which its efficacy depended, could only be performed, by the agency of the law,\u2014 there was no principle on which the law should lend its aid. Thfe cause had been argued for <em>the </em>appellant, as if the court should look at the outward form of the transaction, and consider nothing but <em>Scott\u2019s </em>absolute assignment of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Clopton </em>for value received, and <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>absolute <em>assumpsit </em>to pay him the amount at a future <em>day; </em>though this view of the transaction was directly contrary to the avowed purpose of the parties, and to their express understanding. But both <em>Scott\u2019s </em>contract of assignment to <em>Clopton </em>and <em>Ciopton\u2019s assumpsit </em>to <em>Scott, </em>were simple contracts ; and the real considerations on both sides, and all the circumstances, were open to examination, even at law. Indeed, the right of set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>off was In its nature equitable, though the statutes authorized the courts of law to administer it. <em>Scott\u2019s </em>contract of assignment to Cfoptos was a mere \u00ab\u00bf\u00bf\u00ab <em>pactum: </em>, <em>\u00b0 </em>\u201e \u2022 V \u2022 n \u25a0 . there was no real consideration whatever to support it. <em>Clopton </em>had paid nothing for it: he was not bound by his contract, or by the law, to pay any thing for it, unless the assigned bond should be available to him as a set-off; if it should not, <em>Scott\u2019s </em>contract of assignment, and <em>Clopton\u2019s assumpsit </em>to <em>Scott, </em>would both be merely void, since neither party could have any recovery against the other on either contract. The witness <em>Mr. Palteson </em>understood this; the parties understood and agreed to it. And as to the consideration moving from <em>Scott </em>to <em>Clopion, in the </em>indulgence given to <em>Clopton </em>for payment of the money, for six months beyond the time at which <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>debts to <em>Nicholas </em>were to fall due, and the remission of the interest for the six months ; that was no consideration to support <em>Scott\u2019s </em>contract of assignment to Clopton, but, .in fact, a premium to <em>Clopton </em>to take the assignment, and to assist in the contrivance for securing the debt <em>Nicholas </em>owed <em>Scott. </em>If <em>Clopton </em>had never told the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses so, yet it would result plainly from the account of the transaction given by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, that the defence of this set-off, was not <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>defence, but <em>Scott\u2019s; </em>that <em>Clopton </em>could not lose, <em>if the defence </em>failed ; that <em>Scott </em>alone could gain, if the defence succeeded. The court had only to decide, whether <em>Scott\u2019s </em>claim against <em>Nicholas </em>could be set off by <em>Clopton </em>in this action, for <em>Scott\u2019s </em>benefit, or rather by <em>Scott </em>in <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>name ? And as the attempt was in its substance unjust, so it was wholly irregular in practice : for the defendant\u2019s plea was payment to <em>Nicholas, </em>without notice of his assignment to the plaintiffs; not a plea of set-off or of payment, with notice of the particulars of payment or of set-off, as the statute required, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 87. p. 510. Yet the attempt was to prove a set-off.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Stanard, </em>in the reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC-\">said the notice of set-off required by the statute, was waived by the plaintiffs\u2019 replication, which distinctly admitted notice of the intended set-off, and the precise nature of it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b306-6\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A6a\">stated the pleadings, and the evidence of both parties set out in the demurrer, and then said\u2014The law as to demurrers to evidence may now be considered as fully settled by the cases cited at the bar, of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>and <em>Hansbrough\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Thom. </em>The practice of inserting in the demurrer, the evidence as well of the demurrant as of the party demurred to, is too well established to be now shaken: but <em>the </em>demurrant waives all evidence on his own part, that conflicts with that of the other party; he admits the evidence of his adversary to be true, and admits all inferences of fact that may be reasonably and fairly deduced from that evidence; and submits it to the court to deduce such fair and reasonable inferences. He thus gives every advantage to the evidence of his adversary; but still, if there is any part of his own evidence which does not conflict with that of the other party, nor with the fair and reasonable inferences from it, the demur-rant\u2019s evidence will be duly estimated by the court in rendering its judgment. Let us test this case by these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The plaintiffs gave in evidence the three bonds on which the suits were brought, with the indorsement on each of the name of <em>Nicholas </em>the obligee, whose handwriting they proved; they also proved, that on the 24th August 1819, a written notice was delivered to <em>Clopton, </em>the obligor in those bonds, that they had been regularly transferred by assignment to the plaintiffs, in whose possession they then were. So far, the evidence of the plaintiffs was proper to shew their title to recover, and being in no manner in conflict with the evidence of the defendant, was entitled to full weight. Whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>rest of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, that of their witnesses, <em>Dupuy, Poindexter, Yancey </em>and <em>Pryor, </em>was in conflict with the evidence of the defendant, I shall presently consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">The defendant, to support his plea, that <em>Clopton </em>had paid the debt to <em>Nicholas, </em>before notice of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment to the plaintiffs,\u2014offered in evidence, as a set-off the bond executed by <em>Nicholas </em>to <em>Scott </em>for 2247 dollars &amp;c. and proved the assignment of that bond by <em>Scott to Clopton, </em>thirteen days before notice was given him of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment of <em>Clapton\u2019s </em>bonds to the plaintiffs. This evidence of set-off would probably not have been admissible under the plea of payment, without an account filed with <em>the plea </em>stating the nature and particulars of the set-off so as to give the plaintiffs full notice of it, according to the statute, but for the replication, which shews that the plaintiff had full notice of its character, and its amount, and therefore dispensed with the filing of it, or rather admitted that it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Further to prove, that the set-off so offered was a genuine one, and that the bond from <em>Nicholas </em>to <em>Scott </em>sot forth in the replication was <em>bona fide </em>and for valuable consideration, and not for collusion and fraud, assigned by <em>Scott </em>to <em>Clopton, </em>before notice of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment of <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>bonds to the plaintiffs, the evidence of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>PaUeson </em>was introduced by the defendant ; and the evidence of these witnesses is admitted by the demurrant to be true. And what does it prove ? That <em>Clopton, </em>before he had notice of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment to the plaintiffs, <em>took </em>an assignment from <em>Scott </em>of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond to him; and that he gave his own obligation to <em>Scott </em>for it. Did no valuable consideration pass between them ? Fes : <em>Clopton </em>gained the time of six months, on each of the payments which he bound himself to make to <em>Scott, </em>in satisfaction of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>assignment to him. Was this a contrivance, between them, to defraud the plaintiffs of a part of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>debt, by obtaining a set-off for the benefit of a third person ? It could not be intended to defraud the <em>plaintiffs, </em>because the parties did not know that the plaintiffs held <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>bonds. Nor can it be fairly inferred, that there was a design to defraud any one. <em>Clopton </em>gained to himself an advantage, by purchasing the bond from <em>Scott; </em>and this negatives the position, that his intention was to benefit <em>Scott </em>at the expense of others. If it were doubtful whether such was the intention, the court ought not to infer such fraudulent design against the opinion of two intelligent men, witnesses to the transaction, and who are admitted by the plaintiffs to have told the truth. I conclude, then, that the assignment by <em>Scott </em>to <em>Clopton, </em>was a <em>bona fide </em>transaction, and that the latter became thereby the real owner of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond, to <em>Scott, </em>arid had a right to set it off against the plaintiffs\u2019 demand.</p>\n<p id=\"AiU\">There are some parts of the evidence of <em>Dupuy </em>and. <em>Yancey, </em>the witnesses of the plaintiffs, which do conflict with the testimony of <em>Shelton </em>and <em>Patteson; </em>not as to the transaction when it occurred, but arising from the declarations of <em>Clopton </em>at a posteriour period. I refer, more especially, to that part of <em>Yancey\u2019s </em>evidence, in which he states that <em>Clopton </em>told him, he did not consider the suits as his suits, but <em>Scott\u2019s; </em>and that he should insist on <em>-Scott\u2019s </em>employing counsel to <em>defend </em>them, to pay costs, and manage them as his own, for he should have nothing to. do with them. But we are bound to disregard that evidence, because it is in conflict with that which the plaintiffs have admitted to be true. If they had not withdrawn the subject from the consideration of the-jury, it is possible, nay it is probable, that that tribunal might, on weighing the evidence on both sides, have decided that it was a collusive, and not a <em>bona fide </em>transaction; it might have rightly so decided; and if so, this is another instance, added to that of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>of the hazard and danger of a demurrer to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>I think the judgment should be reversed, with costs; and a judgment entered for the appellees for the balanco duo them, after deducting the amount of the set-off, with the costs of the appellees in the circuit court.</p>\n<author id=\"b309-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AEqO\">The settled rule, with respect to demurrers to evidence, is, that the court must reject all conflicting evidence on the part of the demurrant, take for true all the evidence demurred to, and draw all inferences from it, which a jury might fairly draw. We are to take the facts proved by the evidence of the defendant, without regarding any countervailing evidence adduced by the demurrant. The question is, whether the bond of <em>Nicholas </em>assigned by <em>Scott to Clopton, </em>was a good discount against <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>bonds to Nicholas, in the hands of the plaintiffs, his assignees ? The transaction between <em>Scott </em>and <em>Clopton, </em>took place several days before notice of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment to the plaintiffs was given, to <em>Clopton; </em>and if it vested in <em>Clopton </em>a right to the assigned bond, there can be no doubt that it was a good discount, both under the plain words of the statute, and according to numerous decisions of this court. <em>Scott\u2019s </em>assignment to <em>Clopton </em>was absolute, and it purpurts to be for valuable consideration; and a valuable consideration was in fact given lor it, in the written <em>assumpsit </em>of <em>Clopton </em>to <em>Scott, </em>though, I. presnme, this last fact is matter of no moment, in the question of set-off; for though it had been given to the assignee, the bond in his hands would be equally binding on the obligor, and equally a discount against: his own bond to the obligor. But the subsequent understanding and agreement are said to vary the ease. They certainly could not affect the power of the assignee over the bond: he might have sold it, destroyed it, assigned it away; and, in either case, must have accounted for it under his written promise. Many of our cases decide, that the assignee of a bond is in no better situation than the <em>oh</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ligee, in case of any discount or equity affecting him. If <em>Nicholas </em>himself had sued on these bonds of <em>Clopton, </em>and <em>Clopton </em>had offered this discount, could he have resisted it ? I cannot see on what possible ground. The amount of the subsequent agreement, was merely, that if by any law unknown to the parties, the assignment should be pronunced invalid, <em>Clopton </em>'should not be exposed to a double payment. But there was no' such law; this subsequent understanding was perfectly nugatory, and could have no effect, to invalidate the assignment. It was founded in the caution and ignorance of the parties. They intended, the one to sell and the other to buy the bond, with the express view of setting it off against the debt for which <em>Clopton </em>had <em>given </em>his bonds <em>to Nicholas, </em>knowing, at the same time, that <em>Nicholas </em>had failed, and. that this was the only mode in which the bond could be made available. But although they knew that no notice,had been at that time given to <em>Clopton, </em>of any transfer of his bonds by <em>Nicholas, </em>they did not know, but there might be something else, some matter of fact or law, which might render the assignment invalid; and they provided for that event; a provision wholly idle, both because the assignment was good and lawful, and because if it had not been, the law made the very provision, which the parties undertook to make. I think the judgment <em>should be </em>reversed, and entered for the defendant on the demurrer.</p>\n<author id=\"b310-4\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AOU\">I am of the same opinion. The real issue between the parties was, whether the bond of <em>Nicholas </em>to <em>Scott </em>was actually and <em>bona fide </em>assigned by <em>Scott </em>to <em>Clopton, </em>before the latter had notice of the assignment of <em>Clopton1 s </em>bonds to the plaintiffs ? I shall not go into a minute examination of the evidence of the defendant set out in the demurrer. I am satisfied, beyond a doubt, that that evidence, unopposed by the evidence of the plaintiffs, proves ail actual, absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and <em>bona fide </em>assignment to <em>Cloplon, </em>of the bond exccuted by <em>Nicholas </em>to <em>Scott, </em>before notice of the assignment of <em>Clopton\u2019s </em>bonds. And if there be, in the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, any thing calculated to make a different impression, that evidence being contrariant to the evidence of the defendant, must be disregarded, according to the established law in relation to demurrers. In every action by the assignee of a bond, the defendant is allowed to avail himself, by way of discount, of every right acquired before notice of the assignment, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if the bond had not been assigned, and as if the action had been in the name and for the benefit of the obligee. <em>Now, if this </em>action had been brought by <em>Nicholas </em>himself, <em>and for his own </em>benefit, no one, I think, could doubt, but that, on the evidence adduced by the defendant, the judgment ought to have been in his favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b311-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AmQd\">Upon looking into this record, I think the question arising out of it lies within a very narrow compass. On the one hand, it is beyond question, that the assignee must allow all just discounts, not only against himself, but against the assignor before notice of the assignment was given to the defendant. On the other hand, it is, I think, equally clear, that discounts mean counter demands of the defendant himself against the plaintiff; that they do not embrace demands of third persons against him, and that such demands are not within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, where the defendant offers a discount of a bond or note of the assignor to a third person, he must shew that he is the owner of that bond or note; and without such ownership, lie cannot be entitled to the discount; for without it, he could not maintain an action ; and a set-off or discount is but a substitute flu a cross action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Indeed, without the ownership, payment to the party claiming the discount, would be no discharge, as against the real owner; and, whether the payment be in cash, or in a credit by way of discount, the obligor in the discounted note would be equally exposed to the action of the owner, notwithstanding the discount or payment to the other party. Then, the only question is, whether <em>Clopton </em>or <em>Scott </em>was the real owner of the bond of <em>Nicholas </em>to <em>Scott, </em>which purports to have been assigned to <em>Clopton, </em>about thirteen days before <em>Clopton </em>received notice of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>assignment of'his bonds to the plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">I cannot perceive any reasonable ground to doubt, that <em>Clopton, </em>by that assignment, became the owner of the bond. There was an express assignment made by <em>Scott </em>to him, which passed the ownership, whether we consider it the legal or equitable title. <em>Scott </em>could never set up the legal title (if he retained it, according to the case of <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Richeson, </em>4 Rand. 266. to which decision I refer, though my reason has never been convinced by it) against the person to whom he had actually assigned for a valuable consideration; and the obligation given to <em>Scott </em>by <em>Clopton </em>was a valuable consideration. If, therefore, <em>Clopton </em>had assigned over to another, <em>Scott </em>would have been bound; so, if <em>Nicholas </em>had paid the money to <em>Clopton^ Scott would </em>have been barred; or if <em>Clapton </em>as assignee had sued <em>Nicholas, </em>the judgment would have been a bar to any subsequent claim of <em>Scott. </em>So too, upon the plea by <em>Nicholas </em>of no assignment by <em>Scott </em>to <em>Clopton, </em>it is obvious, the evidence in this record would have negatived the plea, there having been an actual assignment for valuable consideration. Nor, in this view of the subject, does it make any difference, that it was understood that <em>Clopton </em>might return the bond, if he could not get the discount; for this is not only what the law would in effect have declared, without the agreement, but more<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>over, it was a privilege given to him which he might waive, and the existence of which, for that reason, could not impair his complete ownership of the property. Clopton, then, was the owner of the property. He had a complete title to demand payment from <em>Nicholas, </em>and had <em>Nicholas </em>sued him, would have had a complete right to set off this demand in that suit. And if so, he had the same right to set it off against the plaintiffs\u2019 demand, as he obtained the complete right to the set-off before notice of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The objection, however, seems to be, that, as in the event of his foiling to get the discount, he might return the bond to <em>Scott, Scott </em>was still interested, and he was not so. <em>But Scott </em>would have been interested, independent of this agreement; <em>for </em>as he did not assign without recourse, he was liable as assignor. If, therefore, the existence of an interest in the assignor, would be fatal to the discount, no defendant could avail himself of an assigned bond by way of discount, unless he took the bond without recourse; a proposition which, I presume, will not be contended for. And as to the supposition that <em>Clopton </em>was not interested, that is negatived by the transaction. He was to pay full value, it is true, and he has not yet paid up the consideration. But in case the discount was allowed, he was to get time; and \u201c time is money\u201d in the eye of the law, as well as in the estimation of the sage. Forbearance to sue, is a sufficient consideration to support an <em>assumpsit; </em>for the forbearance may be an inconvenience or risque to the creditor, and is generally an advantage to the debtor; and these are ample considerations. In this case, <em>Clapton's </em>interest was deep and direct. If the discount was not allowed, there would be an instant judgment against him for his whole debt. .Tf the discount was allowed, that judgment would be avoided, and he would be only bound to <em>Scott </em>for payment in easy instalments. The first might bring inevitable ruin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to his affairs; the last would relieve him from a destrucfive pressure, and enable him to pay off his debt without distress. Is not this an interest ? Would not this be a profit to <em>Clopton </em>? And shall he be compelled to relinquish it ? Shall he be deprived of it, when he purchased it before notice of the assignment to the plaintiffs ? Had he actually paid the consideration, had he purchased the bond at a large discount from <em>Scott, </em>I presume, it would not be contended, that he should be denied his discount, when he procured the assignment prior to notice. The statute was intended to protect and preserve the rights of a debtor, who purchases fairly before notice of assignment. But it does not protect a right or interest of one description, more than another. It protects the defendant\u2019s right in this case, to have the benefit of his contract with <em>Scott </em>for time, as much as it would have protected his light to the money, had he actually paid up to <em>Scott </em>the consideration money for the assignment As to the alleged fraud, and want of <em>bona fides, </em>I see nothing of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Judgment reversed; and judgment entered for the appellees, for the debts in the declarations demanded, to be discharged by the payment of 990 dollars, with interest <em>See. </em>that being the balance of the debt due by <em>Clopton </em>on his bonds to <em>Nicholas </em>assigned to the appellees, after discounting therefrom the amount, with interest, of <em>Nicholas\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Scott </em>assigned to <em>Clopton.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
