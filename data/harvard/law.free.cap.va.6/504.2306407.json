After the treaty of 1794, they revived their suit against the executors of <em>Maury, </em>\u201cwho was then dead, and who by his will bad empowered his executors to sell his real estate, and especially directed the payment of this debt to <em>Spiers Bowman Sf Co. </em>The county court decreed a sale of the mortgaged land to satisfy the debt; and it was accordingly sold in January 1S07, and the proceeds applied in part discharge of the debt and interest; but there still remained a balance due to the mortgagees, of 2307 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\"><em>Hopkirk, </em>surviving partner of <em>Spiers Bowman &amp; Co. </em>then exhibited his bill against the executors of <em>Maury, </em>the mortgagor, and <em>Green, </em>the purchaser under the deed of February 1783, in the circuit court of the <em>U. States </em>for the district of Virginia,\u2014setting forth the previous history of the transaction; alleging that <em>Green </em>was then in possession of sundry slaves, which were the increase of the female slaves mortgaged to <em>Spiers Bowman &amp; Co. </em>by the mortgage of June 1767; and praying a decree for the sale of those slaves to satisfy the balance of the mortgaged <em>debt.

Therefore, the bill prayed accounts of the real and personal estate of <em>Poindexter, </em>and that his real estate in the hands of his devisees, should, if necessary, be subjected to the claim of the plaintiffs, for the above mentioned sum of 1940 dollars with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">The executors of <em>Abram Maury </em>were proceeded against as absent defendants, and the bill regularly taken <em>jpro covfesso </em>as to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Batte, </em>the surviving executor of <em>Poindexter, </em>answered, and stated, that he could not say with certainty, whether the personal estate of his testator was sufficient to discharge the claim <em>set up </em>in the <em>bill; </em>and he insisted, that, as the claim therein asserted was strictly legal, and a claim for unliquidated damages, the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">The devisees in remainder of <em>Poindexter </em>also answered, and stated, that <em>Poindexter's </em>widow, <em>Mary Poindexter, </em>was also named an executrix of his will, that she had qualified as such, and afterwards married <em>Green, </em>the testator of the plaintiffs, whom she survived for a short time, and died leaving estate of her own; that the testator <em>Poindexter </em>by his will, bequeathed certain personal property to his wife absolutely, and then devised and bequeathed to her all the residue of his estate, real and personal, for life, with remainder to these defendants; and that thus, all the personal estate of <em>Poindexter </em>came to the hands of <em>Green </em>and wife, and <em>Green, </em>in right of his wife, held and enjoyed the whole of it, during his life, part under the absolute bequest thereof, to his wife, and an estate for her life in the residue, as well a.s in the testator\u2019s real estate. And these defendants insisted, that, as <em>Green </em>had, by his intermarriage with <em>Poindexter's </em>widow, executrix and legatee, become possessed of and enjoyed the property out of which the debt now claimed by his executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ought to have been satisfied, therefore they were not entitled to the relief they asked in their bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsrU\">Hereupon, <em>Green\u2019s </em>executors filed a supplemental bill, . . making the executor of <em>Mary </em>Green, relict of their own testator, and relict and executrix of <em>Poindexter, </em>party defendant, and praying such relief against him, as the court should hold them entitled to. And this defendant appeared, and answered the bills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-7\"><em>P.

He then gave his wife <em>Mary, </em>a\u00edl the estate that came by her, clear of any incumbrance, in absolute property; and all the residue of his estate, that should be left after payment of his debts, for and during her <em>life; </em>remainder to the defendants in this cause, charged as his devisees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-8\">It appearing in the progress of the cause, that <em>Matthew Maury </em>died in <em>Virginia, </em>and it being suggested that he left real and personal estate, another supplemented bill was filed, making the persons said to be accountable for the same, parties defendants; but it turned out,&gt;in the sequel, that there was no estate of <em>Matthew Maury </em>to be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah9\">The court having, upon a hearing, ordered accounts of the administration of <em>Poindexter\u2019s </em>estate by <em>Batte </em>his surviving executor, of the administration of the same estate by <em>Green </em>and wife who was the deceased executrix of <em>Poindexter, </em>and of the administration of <em>Mrs. Green\u2019s </em>estate by her executor,\u2014it appeared, by <em>two reports </em>of the commissioner, that the surviving executor had assets in his hands to the amount of 2723 dollars, principal and' interest; and that the estate of <em>Mary Green, </em>the deceased executrix of <em>Poindexter, </em>was charged with the balance of the debt claimed by the plaintiffs, and that her executor had ample assets to pay that' balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The defendants charged in these reports, took no ex- \u00bb ceptions to them; and, therefore, the accounts were not made a part of the record sent to this court, being omitted . ,, -, . . \u00ab , <em>,, </em>. _ jn pursuance ox the provisions ox the statute ox 182o-6. ch. 15.

From this decree, the surviving executor of <em>Poindexter </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-8\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>John Robertson </em>for the appellant, and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellees. And <em>Statiard </em>was retained as counsel for the executor of <em>Mary Green, </em>who did not appeal.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-10\">1. The counsel for the appellant moved, that the <em>last </em>report made by the commissioner should be brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>up; which was ordered. And they shewed, by that <em>r . . J J </em>report, that in decreeing 2723 dollars with interest &amp;e. against the appellant, the court had decreed compound o x * j. interest. They also shewed, that the debt of 1940 dollal's, ought to have borne intei'est from December 1814, instead of 1813. Whereupon, <em>Leigh </em>admitted, that the decree ought to be corrected in these particulars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">2. The appellant\u2019s counsel then made other objections to the decree, which could neither be supported, explained nor answered, without having the <em>first </em>report of the commissioner before this court. <em>Leigh </em>said, this court could not consider such objections, unless the appellant\u2019s counsel would move to bring up that report. This they declined to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-10\">3. The <em>last </em>report (which was brought up by order of this court) shewed, that the money in the hands of <em>Poindexter's </em>surviving executor, arose from the profits of some few slaves which had accrued during the long pendency of. the suit in the court of chancery; and that only one of those slaves was living at the date of the <em>last </em>report. The appellant\u2019s counsel said, that if the decree was right in principle, that slave should have been subjected to the plaintiff\u2019s demand; and inferred from the circumstance of there being no decree against the appellant for the value of that slave, that the decree must be wrong or incongruous. <em>Leigh </em>answered, that it did not appear, whether or no, the slave was living at the time of the decree; and, besides, the appellant had no right to complain, that he was not charged with the value of this slave;\u2014that the objection could only avail for the other defendant, the executor of <em>Mrs. Green, </em>who was decreed to pay the balance which should be left unpaid by the <em>appellant; </em>and he acquiesced in the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-11\">4. The appellant\u2019s counsel next insisted, that the personal estate bequeathed by the will of <em>Poindexter </em>to his widow, and the life estate in the residuum thereby given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to her, ought to be made to contribute to the payment of this debt; and that as <em>Green, </em>by his marriage with the widow, acquired the whole of her interest, <em>his </em>estate \u2022 \u00ab \u2022 ought to be held to such contribution; at least, it was his duty to keep down the interest of this debt, accruing during his life,\u2014upon the same principle, that where am estate under mortgage is devised to one for life with remainder to another, the tenant for life must apply the rents accruing in his time, to keep down the interest of the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-12\">To which it was answered, that it was plain from <em>Poindexter\u2019s </em>will, that the estate he gave his wife absolutely, <em>clear of any incumbrance, </em>was, as between her and his legatees and devisees in remainder, exempt from his debts : that, as to the application of the life estate given to the widow to pay this debt, or of the profits thereof to keep down the interest of it, that could not have been done, since the debt was not ascertained to be due, till after the death of both <em>Green </em>and his wife: that the ground on which <em>Mrs. Greeks </em>estate was held liable for the balance of this debt, and only for the balance, after applying to it the amount of assets in the surviving executor\u2019s hands, could only be ascertained by bringing before the court the <em>first </em>report of the commissioner, in which her estate was charged with that balance; neither, without that report, could it be ascertained, whether <em>Green </em>got any part of the property bequeathed to his wife by her first husband\u2019s will. It might appear by that report, that that property had been settled on <em>Mrs. Green </em>to her separate use; or that she incurred a debt to her first husband\u2019s estate, in the course of her administration previous to her second marriage; or that <em>Green </em>and wife had discharged other debts of <em>Poindexter, </em>to a large amount,\u2014which, indeed, was the truth of the case. And the appellant\u2019s counsel declining to call for the report, and no exception having been taken to it in the court of chancery by any party, this court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>take it, that the chancellor was right in making his decree against the parties according to the reports.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">5. But the main question was, whether the bill shewed a case which was properly relievable in equity ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-10\">The appellant\u2019s counsel said, that <em>Green's </em>executors having recovered no judgment at law against <em>Poindexter's </em>executors, were creditors at large; and coming alone to assert their single claim against the personal assets of their deceased debtor, not for an account and distribution of the assets among themselves and the other ere-' ditors, they could not be entertained in equity; for <em>to </em>admit them to do so, would be to assert a jurisdiction in the courts of equity in every case of a demand against a dead man\u2019s estate. They cited <em>M'Kay </em>v. <em>Green, 3 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 56. and <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>4 Id. 619. 631. Moreover, <em>Green's </em>executors came into equity, to assert a claim for unliquidated damages for the breach of a covenant of warranty; and, they said, it was well settled, that courts of equity were not the proper tribunals for the trial of claims sounding in damages. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 287. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Crouch, </em>6 Rand. 519. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Hogsheads, </em>3 Leigh 667. This bill, however, professed to have for its object, to charge the real estate of <em>Poindexter </em>in the hands of his devisees; but, in fact, there were sufficient personal assets to satisfy the claim, and the suggestion in the bill to the contrary, could not help the case; and as to the allegation, that <em>Poindexter's </em>will charged his real estate, it was doubtful, whether it provided for debts not his own but for which he was only bound as surety; and, besides, the bill, in that aspect, ought to have called all the creditors before the court, for a rateable distribution of the real equitable assets. s</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-11\"><em>Leigh </em>said, that this was a claim founded <em>in </em>a contract, namely, a covenant of warranty, and no otherwise a claim for damages than every claim in <em>assumpsit </em>on simple contract; and, in truth, the claim was a liqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>dated one. This bill, as against the personal representative of <em>Poindexter, </em>was \u201c for satisfaction of a duty out of assetswhich lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, in <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Church, 2 </em>Ves. sen. 106. a plaintiff might maintain \u201ceither on a debt due in point of law, and for which there was a legal remedy, or where equitable; for though, in genera], a legal demand cannot be turned into an equitable, yet if a demand is made out of assets, he is entitled to an account of assets here; and then this court will not put him to sue doubly, in one court to have an account of assets, in the other satisfaction, but gives remedy here.\u201d And, he contended, <em>any </em>creditor by contract might maintain a bill in equity against the personal representative of his debtor, for an account of assets, and satisfaction. 1 Madd. Ch. Pract. 579-581. <em>Ashurst </em>v. <em>Eyre, 2 </em>Atk. 51. 3 Id. 341. <em>Plunket </em>v. <em>Penson, 2 </em>Atk. 51. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Ormonde, </em>and <em>Beauchamp </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>Jacob 108. 546. 4 Condens. Eng. Ch. Rep. 47. 259. But, however this might be, the creditor hero went into equity, alleging a deficiency of persona] assets, and claiming to charge the real estate in the hands of the devisees, on the grounds, that the real estate was bound for the duty, by the covenant of warranty binding the heirs, and that the devisor had charged his lands with all his debts. The devisees were trustees for the <em>creditors ; </em>and there could be no doubt, that such a case was proper for relief in equity, and indeed, that equity alone could administer the relief. It was true, it turned out that there was a sufficiency of personal assets; but the personal representative himself, in his answer, expressed his doubts whether there was or not ,\u2022 and the persona] assets to satisfy the decree arose out of profits which accrued pending the suit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\"> The statute provides, \u201c that when appeals shall he allowed from any superiour court of chancery to the court of appeals,\u2014if any account shall have been taken, and there be no exception filed thereto, such account shall not he copied in the record, without the order of the court, or the judge thereof in vacation: <em>Provided always, </em>that the court of appeals may order any part of the record which shall be omitted by virtue of this section, to be supplied by the clerk of the superiour court of chancery, and a copy thereof, certified by the clerk in obedience to such order, may be used in the same manner as if it properly formed a part of the original record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AFiR\">The general question, whether any creditor at large can file a bill in equity against an executor, for an account of assets, and satisfaction of his claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>was very much discussed at the bar. It is a question ^ of great importaface, never settled by any decision of this court j and I should regret exceedingly that we have , .. . \u00b0 \u00b0 <em>J . . </em>but a bare court, it it were necessary to act upon it m this case; but I do not thinlc it is necessary. The bill of sale,Af February 1783,'binds the parties, their heirs &amp;c. jointly and severally. <em>Philip Poindexter, </em>by his will, charged his whole estate, real and personal, with the payment of his debts. The bill is filed against his real and personal representatives; it calls for a discovery of the personal assets, charges that they are insufficient to satisfy the claim, and prays, in case of such deficiency, a sale of the land. This makes the question of jurisdiction, to rest on ground very different from the general point discussed at the bar. A charge of this kind in a will, converts the real estate into equitable assets, which can be reached only by a bill in chancery; and in such a case, the door of equity is open to creditors of every description to come in and call for an execution of the trust. A suit at law to establish the debt, is never considered a necessary prerequisite to such bill. The books are full of cases of creditors at large, whether by bond, note or open account, coming into equity for satisfaction out of the land, where it is made equitable assets by the will. In such cases, it is proper to make the personal representatives parties also, that the personal fund, which is the natural one, for payment of debts, being before the court, proper inquiries may be made, and care taken, that so far as it will go, it shall be applied in ease of the real estate. I cannot think it worth while to cite cases for this every day doctrine and practice of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">But does it affect the right of coming into equity, that the claim sounds in damages ? Equity looks at the substance, not the forms, of things ? It is true, the claim sounds in damages; but it is for damages for the loss of property bought on a warranty of title, where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>is a clear standard by which to measure the claim. The plaintiff\u2019s testator held certain slaves, which he had purchased upon the covenant of <em>Poindexter </em>to make good the title. These were taken from him by the decree of a court, under a prior lien, and they sold under the hammer, for 1940 dollars. Does it make any difference in equity, whether you call this damages, or by any other name ? Every action of <em>assumpsit </em>sounds in damages, yet equity constantly receives such creditors upon a bill for satisfaction out of equitable assets. I do not think there is any weight in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The next objection to the decree, is, that the life estate of <em>Mary Green </em>was not made to contribute. The testator gave to his wife all the estate that came by her, to do as she <em>pleased </em>with it, free of all incumbrances ; and then gave her all the rest of his estate, left after paying his debts, for life. It is compared to the case of an estate incumbered by a mortgage, which is given to A. for life, remainder to B. in fee; where the rule is, that A. shall keep down the accruing interest on the mortgage, even if it takes the whole of the rents and profits, and shall not be permitted to throw them upon the remainderman. The rule is unquestionably so; but I think the analogy fails entirely. The mortgage is a certain existing incumbrance fixed upon the land, carrying an annual interest. The testator knowing of this charge, gives the land to one for life, and to another in fee. \u201c As a question of intention,\u201d says lord <em>Thurlow, </em>in <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Hereford, 2 Bro. </em>G. C. 189. \u201cthe testator considered it as a fund to be divided, and that each tenant for life should leave the estate to his successor, in as good a condition as he found it; his intention was to give it subject to all reprizes; all reprizes must, therefore, be borne by each tenant, for life.\u201d Again, in <em>Ld. Penrhyn </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>5 Ves. 107. lord <em>Loughborough, </em>after laying down the rule as perfectly settled, that tenant for life must keep down the accruing interest, says\u2014\u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ground is, that the estate in the hands of tenant for life, liable to incumbrances, is in the first place amesnable, and may be made so by an application by the reversioners, to all the inter\u00e9st accrued upon incumbrances prior to that estate for life. It is very hard, I admit. He may lose all his interest. But it must always be remembered, that both the tenant for life, and the incumbrancers, have a right to have the estate sold; and if so, then the tenant for life will have his interest in what remains of the money produced by the sale; and it will be divided, as the law provides, in the proportions their interests bear to the estate.\u201d Where is the resemblance between such a case and the one before us ? The testator here, gives his estate to his wife for life, subject to his debts. If creditors sue and get judgments, of course, they must come out of the estate, and it may be, that this executrix paid many in this way. But the claim of the plaintiffs was one which <em>Poindexter\u2019s </em>estate was not bound for, absolutely: he had warranted the title of the slaves sold by <em>Maury: </em>it was only in the event of that title proving bad, and the slaves being lost in consequence of the defect, that his estate would be <em>liable; </em>and this liability must be established by a suit. Until it was so established, the tenant for life, who was also executrix, was not called on to pay it, and would not have been justifiable in paying it. This did not happen in her lifetime. She was never, therefore, in default in this respect; never bound for the debt during her life; and of consequence, I think, her life estate cannot be called on to contribute, when, in after time, the claim was established. On her death, <em>Baile, </em>the surviving executor, qualified and took possession of <em>Poindexter\u2019s </em>estate; and in his hands it is certainly liable, and the first fund to be applied in the discharge of <em>Green\u2019s </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">I do not consider the accounts or reports at all before us, farther than merely to look at them on the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the compound interest and other errors in detail; which, <em>i </em>1 7 it was admitted, ought to be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed with costs, for the acknowledged errors in the details, and a corrected decree for the appellees entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
