The marriage took place. The husband died, the wife surviving him; and administration of his estate was committed, by the hustings court of <em>Richmond., </em>to <em>Wren, </em>sergeant of the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">A bill was exhibited in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>by <em>Roper </em>the trustee and <em>Mrs. Robinson, </em>against <em>Wren, </em>the administrator of the deceased husband, setting forth the provisions of the deed of mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>riage settlement, and alleging that <em>Robinson </em>the husband, in his lifetime, received and appropriated to his own use, all the rents and profits of the property settled by the deed; but the wife constantly remonstrated against this, and repeatedly demanded of her husband, an account of the rents and profits by him received, and the payment thereof to the trustee, for her sole and separate use; and the husband as often promised, that he would render such account, and make such payment, but never complied with his promises. The bill prayed, that <em>Wren, </em>the administrator, should be compelled to render an account of the rents and profits received by his intestate, and to pay the amount of the same out of the assets of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\"><em>Wren, </em>in his answer, disclaimed all knowledge of the facts alleged in the bill, and called for proof of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">Depositions were taken and filed, by which, in the opinion of this court, it was satisfactorily proved, that neither the wife nor her trustee received any part of the rents and profits during the coverture; that <em>Robinson, </em>the husband, received and enjoyed them all; that the wife frequently demanded the rents of her husband, and he repeatedly acknowledged that they were due to her from him, and promised that they should be paid, but he never paid them, excusing himself on account of his being pressed for money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The chancellor directed accounts of <em>Wren\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>estate, and of the rents and profits of the trust property received by <em>Robinson </em>in his lifetime, in stating which last account, the commissioner charged interest on the rents ascertained by estimate; but, on the final hearing, the bill was dismissed; and the plaintiffs appealed from the decree to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-7\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Claiborne </em>and <em>Scott </em>for the appellants, and <em>Mayo </em>and <em>G.

Lord <em>Hardwiclce </em>held, that when a wife accepts a payment short of what she is entitled to, or lets the husband receive what she has a right to receive to her separate use, her consent will be implied to that method of proceeding, but that her complaint that she had not her full allowance, and his promise, that she should have it at last, destroyed the implication, and the promise that she should have it at last, was an undertaking on his part that she should be paid the arrears. In the case before us, it does not appear that the wife received any part of that which was settled on her to her separate use; but she frequently demanded it, and the husband as often promised it to her; so that her consent to part with it to him without reimbursement, cannot be implied. I do not think this case comes within the rule in <em>Moore's ex'x </em>v. <em>Ferguson. </em>There, the wife did not, during the coverture, exercise any act of ownership over the property, nor interfere with the husband\u2019s receipt of the profits: she did not complain of his receiving them, nor demand them, nor did he promise that she should afterwards have them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Her consent was, therefore, implied, that her board and clothing, or her support and maintenance, during the coverture, should be deemed an equivalent for the profits of her separate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">I am of opinion, that the decree be reversed with costs, and a new account directed; in which, however, the commissioner should not allow interest on the estimated rents.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b57-8\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHx\">I concur with my brother <em>Brockenbrough. </em>It seems that the wife did demand the rents due her, frequently, during the coverture, and the husband always promised that she should have them. There was no waiver of her right, and no acquiescence in the wrong done her, further than that she did not resort to coercive measures. She gave up dower, and every thing else by the marriage contract. The property settled was to return to the husband\u2019s estate at her death. She is expressly entitled to the rents and profits, to her separate use during coverture; and where is the law or the justice which shall deprive her of this pittance, because she chose rather to submit to wrong, than stir up strife with her husband ? especially as there are no creditors to lose by this act of sheer justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
