A plaintiff suing for slaves as ad. ministrator of his Wife, is not barred by a decision against him, in her life time, in a suit to which she was not a party; the ground of that decision having been that, under theAct of Liniitations,the opposite palty had obtained a legal title to the slaves by five years possession con~~ niencing during the~vertitre; during which also the right of the Wife accrued; and</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AXXi\">- 2. if slaves specifically bequeathed, be in the possession of a person who is at the same time executor of the testator and husband of a legatee, such possession will enure to him in the character of executive only, unless there be some ejection, or some act indicative of an intention to take, in\"the character of husband, especially, where the bequest is to several legatees jointly, and no division among them has taken place. division among them has taken place.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8Y\">AFTER the decision of this Court, in the case of Newby's adminstrators v. Bankey, s H. &amp; M. 66, a bill in eiuity was filed, against the said. administratois, by John Chowning, and Cataharine his wife, who was formerly Catharine Chowning, Lucy Street who has Lucy Chowning, and Churchill Blakey administrator of his deceased wife .thiiie, who was ~dnne Chow~ing, all daugh-. ters and devisees of William Chowning the elder, to recover the slaves of which Oswald .JSPewby was possessed in right of his wife Catharine, legatee of her aunt Eli~abeth Chowiii~g and heiress of her sister .~nnc U. Taylor, and which the Court of Appeals, in the case aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>had adjudged to the said administrators. The Bill stated that the slaves in question were improperly bequeathed by <em>Elizabeth Chowning; </em>because, at her death <em>without is-</em>s\u00abe, they belonged to the plaintiffs, by virtue of the Will ef <em>William Chowning; </em>the plaintiffs <em>Catharine </em>and <em>Lucy, </em>and the deceased <em>Anne, </em>having survived the said <em>Elizabeth, </em>and all being married at the time of her death; but that his executors, being misled by erroneous advice of Counsel, gave them up to her legatees, <em>Anne C. Taylor, </em>and <em>Catharine Taylor, </em>who afterwards married <em>Oswald </em>Newby:\u2014that, after the death of the said <em>Catharine Taylor, Churchill Blakey, </em>one of the complainants, as executor of <em>William Chowning, </em>and in right of his wife <em>Anne </em>and her sisters, made a demand of the slaves from the said <em>JYewby, </em>and was about to commence a suit for them, which suit was prevented by a compromise or special agreement, that, if the claimants would not bring suit, but permit 1dm to hold the said slaves during his life, he would, by a last Will, bequeath them to the complainants, to be divided according to the Will of <em>William Chowning; </em>that, by virtue of the said compromise the slaves remained with <em>Oswald Newby </em>during his life; and the Complainants understood and believed that, in fact, he left a Will made in conformity therewith, which, after his death, was fraudulently concealed or destroyed:\u2014 that the case agreed in <em>Newby\u2019s administrators </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>was defective in not setting forth all the points involving the merits of the cause; particularly, the important facts, of the agreement or compromise aforesaid, and <em>coverture </em>of some of the Complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-3\">The prayer of the Bill was, for an injunction restraining the defendants from selling or distributing the slaves, and fox1 general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\"><em>Newby\u2019s </em>administrators, filed separate answers, but, in general, to the same effect; denying all knowledge of the compromise alledgcd, or that he left a Will; and claiming the slaves, which they believed were taken from their possession in an improper and illegal manner. <em>Pritchard Newby, </em>oxxe of them, admitted that <em>William Ghowning\u2019s </em>legatees remained in possession of their legacies with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>assent of liis executors; but the respondent knew not they claimed title under the Will, or under the gift which was said to have been previously made by the <em>William Chowning </em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjI\">Sundry depositions were taken, shewing probably, that the compromise stated in the Bill was actually agreed upon, and that <em>Oswald Newby, </em>in pursuance thereof made a Will, which was destroyed by his mother; that one of the slaves, a negro boy, was sent to <em>John Chowning\u2019s, </em>in New-by\u2019s life time, as a nurse, and stayed there twelve months, and then was carried back to see the said boy\u2019s mother at <em>Newby\u2019s </em>plantation; shortly after which, the said <em>Newby </em>died; and then all the said slaves absconded, and went to <em>Churchill Blakey.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-4\">The proceedings in the suit at common law, of <em>Newby\u2019s administrators </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>were an exhibit in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">Chancellor Neison dismissed the Bill as to the plaintiff <em>Blakey, </em>and decreed in favour of the other plaintiffs for their respective proportions; being of opinion, \u201cthat \u201c the limitation over of the slaves mentioned in the be- \u201c quest from <em>William Chowning </em>deceased to his daughter \u201c to <em>Elizabeth, </em>was not too remote; and, upon the death of \u201c the said <em>Elizabeth, </em>\u201c without leaving issue, <em>then\u201d </em>the \u201c said slaves became the property of, and should have \u201c been equally divided among, the surviving daughters \u201c the said <em>William; </em>and that <em>Catharine Taylor, </em>(who in- \u201c termarried with <em>Oswald Newby </em>deceased) and <em>Anne </em>\u201c <em>C. Taylor, </em>derived no title to the slaves bequeathed to \u201c them by <em>Elizabeth Chowning; </em>she having no right to \u201c devise them; that the rights of <em>Catharine Chowning </em>\u201c and <em>Lucy Street, </em>in the said slaves, survived to them, \u201c as to their respective interests therein, upon the deaths \u201c of their husbands, which rights were protected from \u201c the effect of the act of limitation, or of length of time, \u201c by their <em>coverture; </em>but that <em>Churchill Blakey </em>lost the \u00ab interest, which he was entitled to in the said slaves in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>right of Ms wife, upon the principles and for the rea- &lt;\u2022' sons stated in the report of the case in the Court of Ap- *'\u2022 peals.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AeW\">From this Decree, <em>Blakey </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AEq\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOT\">This case now comes up, on an appeal from a decree in Chancery; and is totally different in facts and principles from that formerly before this Court. There was no evidence of the special agreement in that case; and if such evidence had been adduced, it could not have availed at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akn\">The following points are relied upon by the appellant;</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4U\">1. That the Act of Limitations is no bar to the recovery of Mrs. <em>Blakey\u2019s </em>share:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMk\">2. That the decision in <em>JYewby\u2019s administrators </em>v. <em>Blakey </em>is no bar, nor even a precedent against him, suing as <em>her administrator:</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVx\">3. That a Court of Equity ought to decree a specific execution of <em>Newby\u2019s </em>agreement, that the negroes should he given up at his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alu\"><em>First, the act of Limitations is no bar. The assent of William Glwwnin\u00e7's executors to the bequest to Elizabeth Uhowning the tenant for life, cnured to the benefit of those in remainder,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> who, at her death, had right to take possession without intervention of the Executors. Blake~j's right as administrator of his Wife, never accrued until the death of the latter:</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> his surviving her gave him nothing in his own right, but only as her administrator. If she had owed debts to the full value, the property would have been liable for it in liis~ hands. A husband representing his wife is, according to clear principles ot' law, not barred by the act of Lhnitations. lIe sues in her right:-she, during the coverture, was protected by the saving in the Act. If she had survived him, her right would certainly have been saved.</em>Surely, <em>his </em>surviving <em>her </em>does not prevent her estate from having the same benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adu\">Besides, the act is not <em>pleaded. </em>It may be said that in detinue this is not necessary; but whether such be the taw, is questionable. In 1 <em>Saund. </em>283, note 2, <em>Duppa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>v. <em>Mayo, </em>Serjeant <em>Williams </em>says, that, in his opinion, a patty relying on the Act ought in <em>all </em>cases to plead it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-12\">2. <em>Mrs. Blakey </em>was no party to the suit at common law,- nor was her right affected by it. The record in that suit could not be given in evidence against /ier,-<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and though it is inserted as an exhibit in this cause, it is to be considered according to its legal effect only. Suppose <em>Blakey </em>had afterwards <em>bought </em>the slaves of <em>Newby, </em>would the former decision be a bar to a claim founded on this new title ?\u2014But, if the judgment be a bar <em>at law, </em>it is not, <em>in equity; </em>for the slaves were delivered by <em>mistake, </em>and therefore relief ought to be given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-13\">3. The special agreement was obligatory, for the consideration was suificient.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The on'ly question is whether, in point of fact, the agreement be proved. It is in proof that <em>Blakey </em>strictly complied with it\u2019s terms on his part, by refraining to bring the suit in <em>Newby\u2019s </em>life time. It may be said, that he might have sued at law after <em>Newby\u2019s </em>death, the bar of the Act of Limitations being done away:'\u2014but <em>he </em>never could have sued <em>for the slaves </em>at law, though his wife might, if she had survived him. <em>Detinue </em>would not lie in <em>his </em>favour, the contract not being executed, but executory. His only remedy was <em>assumpsit </em>for breach of the agreement, or hill in equity to compel specific performance. Such a Bill may he maintained upon an agreement to deliver <em>slaves, </em>though not for stock in the funds.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-14\"><em>Green </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgU\">The former decision of this Court is a complete bar to the claim now in question, upon the principle that a party shall not avail himself in equity of that of which he might have had the benefit at law. In the suit brought against him by <em>Newby\u2019s </em>administrators, <em>Blakey </em>might have set up in defence, <em>whatever title he had. </em>I admit that, if his title had been acquired <em>since </em>the trial at law, the Judgment would have been no bar:\u2014but he is precluded from now assei-ting any right which he <em>then </em>had, and failed to assert. Tho\u2019 joined in this suit with other plaintiffs he was party to <em>that </em>in all the characters he could possibly have sustained:\u2014the decision is therefore conclusive as to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>A promise to leave property l\u00bby Will, does not prevent the act of Limitations from being a bar in detinue, <em>lilakey </em>endeavoured to avail himself of it, in the case at law, without success. In that case it was decided that the five years possession gave an <em>absolute title. </em>The promise too, was a mere <em>nudum pactum; </em>for, at the time it was extorted from <em>Newby, </em>he had an absolute title to the negroes;\u2014a title that <em>was not doubtful; </em>hut, for the sake of peace, he said, if they would not sue him, he would leave them the property by his Will. The parties on both sides must have known all the facts. There was, of course, no consideration for the agreement. And if it could be supported at law, it is, at any rate a <em>hard </em>contract, which a Court of Equity is not <em>bound </em>to enforce:\u2014 it has a discretionary right in such cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-4\">But, independently of all these questions, the right of <em>Newby </em>under <em>Elizabeth Chowning\u2019s </em>Will was good: for neither the Will of her father, nor the act of any other person could take away her absolute title founded on fire years\u2019 possession <em>under the parol gift in </em>1783.<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply. Two other sisters have recovered by the same title by which we claim, and no objection w as made. There can not be a clearer title than our\u2019s, if the case of <em>Newby\u2019s administrators </em>v. <em>lilakey </em>be not against us. <em>Elizabeth Chowning\u2019s </em>possession was not adverse to our claim, which commenced at her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">No <em>luches </em>can he imputed to a married woman. The wife of <em>lilakey </em>was no party to that suit. If he failed to make the defence founded on her right, it was not hex-fault but his: and her right is not haired. The suit was against him <em>individually. </em>If he had sued in her right, and got a judgment, and died in her life time, it would have survived to her benefit; for the property would not have been his, unless he had reduced it into possession.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\"> Note.\u2014See 3 <em>H. &amp; M. 57. </em>But whether that gift was absolute, or with a reservation of a right to dispose of the slaves by a \"VVilh does not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Aeu\">\n<em> Adams v.

In this predicament were <em>Mrs. Street, Mrs. Chowning </em>and <em>Mrs. Blakey, </em>by reason of their coverture: unless, in relation to the two latter, their rights respectively were extinguished in favour of their husbands, in consequence of the said slaves having at any time come into the possession of their said husbands. As to the possession, acquired by <em>Churchill Blakey </em>and <em>John Chowning, </em>of the slaves of <em>Elizabeth Chowning, </em>after her death, and which were tx\u2019anferx\u2019ed to <em>Catharine Taylor </em>and <em>Anne C. Taylor, </em>(under whom <em>Oswald Newby </em>claimed,) under a misconception of the title thereto, that possessioxx enux\u2019ed to them, only ixx their character of Executors of <em>Elizabeth Chowning, </em>and not in right of their wives uxxder the will of their father: nor is the case different as to the possession acquired by <em>Churchill Blakey </em>in and to a part of the slaves in contx\u2019oversy, and which gave rise to the action of detinue in the District Court of King and Queen. That possessioxx is also to be referred to his character of Executor of <em>William Chowning, </em>and did not enure to hinx iix his character of husbaxxd. The case of <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Taliaferro </em>(2 Call) is conclusive to shew, that, whexx these two characters concur in the saixxe pei\u2019son, this conclusioix will follow, unless there be some election, or some act indicative of an intention to take in the character of husband. That pi\u2019inciple applies emphatically to cases like the present, where the light as husband, did not attach, specifically, to all of the slaves in question, but only to a part of them, after they should have been divided or allotted; and in which the possession of them in mass accords sti\u2019ictly with the party\u2019s claim as Executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In ibis view of the subject, the right of <em>Mrs. Blakey </em>in and totiie slaves in controversy, did not come in question in the action in King and Queen, and ought not xxow to be barred or affected thex\u2019eby. Her husband defended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that suit in his own right, and not in her\u2019s. If she had survived him, her right would certainly not have been affected thereby; nor is the right of her administrator so affected, in the contrary event, altho\u2019 that administrator is her husband, who was a party to the former action, In this case, the maxim that \u201cwhen two rights concur in \u00abthe same person, they are to be considered as if they \u00abwere in different persons,\u201d strictly applies. Her <em>administrator </em>in this case was not a parly to the farmer suit, nor is he a privy to any who was. Nothing done in that suit, therefore, ought to bind him. On this ground, the Court is of opinion, that the said decree is erroneous, and that the appellant ought to be let in to recover his share of the slaves in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Decree reversed, with costs, and cause remanded to the Court of Chancery, to he finally proceeded in pursuant to the principles of this Decree,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
