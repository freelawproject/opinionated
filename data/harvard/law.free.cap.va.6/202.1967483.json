The plaintiff also proved, by <em>John </em>Wilder, that he, <em>John Wilder, </em>lived in the store of the defendant in the month of <em>April, </em>1790, and bought a paper of one <em>Jesse Woodward, </em>which purported to be a public certificate signed by <em>Mayo Carrington </em>and <em>Samuel Jones, </em>as commissioners, for 140/. for a wagon and horses, which he afterwards sold on account of the defendant, to the plaintiff, but put no mark on it, by which he can know it to be the same that he sold to said plaintiff; neither does he know if either of those now produced is the same. That he, the said <em>Wilder, </em>acting for the defendant, also sold to the plaintiff, three or four other certificates of the said description, all of which amounted to one hundred and sixty-four pounds and some shillings, for which he was paid at the rate of <em>5s. 6d. </em>in , the pound, by the plaintiff. That he does not know whether any of the said certificates so sold as last aforesaid, are either of the said papers now produced. The defendant then proved by said <em>Wilder, </em>that before he bought the said certificate of 140/. of Woodivard, he applied to <em>William Hax~ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>all </em>to know if the same was counterfeit. That the plaintiff was there at the time. That <em>Haxall </em>gave it as his opinion, that the same was not counterfeit. That the plaintiff, on the same day, and before he bought the last mentioned certificate, told the deponent that the plaintiff \u25a0would give <em>5s. 6d. per </em>pound to the deponent for the same, if the deponent bought it. That after the deponent had bought it, which was on the same day aforesaid, the plaintiff did apply on that day, once or twice to deponent, to know if he would sell it him for <em>5s. 6d. </em>That he did afterwards sell it to the plaintiff for the sum of <em>5s. 6d. </em>in the pound, and received the jjurchase money accordingly, and this being all the evidence which the plaintiff and defendant offered to the jury, the defendant demurs to the same as insufficient in law to maintain the plaintiffs action, and says that he is not, neither is he bound by the law of the land to make any further or other answer thereto, and this he is ready to verify: Wherefore he prays judgment and his costs in his behalf expended, to be adjudged to him. And the plaintiff doth aver, that the same evidence is sufficient in law to maintain his said action, and prays judgment and his damages aforesaid, to be adjudged to him, together with his costs about his suit in this behalf expended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-4\">The District Court over-ruled the demurrer .to the evidence; and setting aside the verdict and proceedings subsequent to the issue, awarded a new trial. The record then states, that the defendant prayed an appeal: <em>vjhich the Court refused to grant, because as yet they have rendered no final judgment in this </em>cause. At a subsequent Court, the suit was continued, <em>by consent of parties. </em>And at a future Court, the record proceeds thus: <em>Ci </em>This day came the parties by their attornies, and, thereupon came also a jury, &amp;c. who being elected, &amp;c. say that the defendant did assume upon himself in manner and form, as the plaintiff against him hath declared, and <em>they do assess the </em>plaintiffs damages by occasion of the non-performance of that assumption to sixty-three pounds six shillings, besides his costs.\u201d Therefore, it is considered by the Court, that, the plaintiff recover against the defendant his damages aforesaid, in form aforesaid assessed, and his costs by him about his suit in this behalf expended, and the said defendant in mercy, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">To this judgment the defendant obtained a writ of <em>sicpcrsedeas </em>from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Call, </em>for the plaintiff in the <em>supersedeas.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIc\">Contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-9\">1. That the District Court erred in over-ruling the demurrer and awarding a new trial, as the demurrer clearly-disclosed a sufficient' bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-10\">For, the plaintiff did not shew, that the papers were forged. His only evidence, as to that, is, that he applied to the Treasurer; and he has neither summoned the commissioners, nor taken the common precaution of applying , at the Auditor\u2019s office. He has, therefore, precipitated his case, without the proofs necessary to support his action. Besides, <em>Knox </em>was an innocent purchaser, in the fair course of his business, of the papers in question, and, therefore, he is not liable to refund the money, which he afterwards sold them to the defendant for, without any knowledge of their being counterfeit. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Neal, 3 </em>Burr. 1354. The reasoning of Lord Mansfield, in which case, expressly applies to that before that Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For, whatever neglect there was, in the present case, was upon the side of <em>Garland; </em>as the defendant had actual encouragement from him, and <em>bona fide </em>paid the whole value to <em>Woodward. </em>So, that it is a misfortune which has happened, without the defendant\u2019s fault or neglect, but, if there be any fault or negligence, it was on the part of the plaintiff as already observed. Consequently, there is no reason for throwing off the loss from <em>one innocent </em>man, upon <em>another innocent </em>man.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-11\"><em>2. </em>That the demurrer to evidence was a proper mode of bringing the case before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-12\">Whenever the plaintiff\u2019s evidence does not maintain his action; the defendant may demur and refer it to the Court to decide whether the plaintiff can recover or not. For, ffie is not obliged to risque the law of his case with the jury, but has a right to draw it <em>ad aliud examen. Cocksedge </em>v. <em>Fanshaw, </em>Dougl. 119; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>White, 2 </em>Wash. 203. The demurrer, therefore, ought to have been sustained, and judgment entered on it in favor of the defendant in the Court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-13\">3. That the subsequent proceedings make no difference, and were no waiver of the defendant\u2019s right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-14\">For, the defendant offered to appeal; and, as he had a sufficient case upon the record to entitle him to judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the refusal of the District Court to allow the appeal ought not to prejudice him; and all the subsequent proceedings, there, ought to be considered as <em>in invitum. </em>Of course, no inference from thence is to be drawn against him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-6\"><em>M\u2019Craw, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">The justice and law of the case are both in favour of the plaintiff in the Court below; for, -whenever a man has paid money to another upon a consideration, which happens to fail, he is entitled to recover it back in an action for <em>money had and </em>received. But, the demurrer to evidence was clearly improper. For, the defendant, thereby, prevented, the jury from inferring, from the evidence, the very facts, which his counsel now insists were not proved. But, this he could not do; for, he was bound either to have admitted the facts, or suffer the cause to have remained with the jury. Bull. N. P. 313. Besides, the defendant has, by his subsequent conduct, waived the objection. For, at a succeeding term, he consented to a continuance of the cause; and finally went into the second trial, without taking any exception. He ought not, therefore, to be allowed to do it now. If, contrary to what is the fact, the evidence stated in the demurrer was insufficient to have enabled the jury to make the necessary inferences, the presumption is, that every essential proof was supplied upon the second trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-8\">Call, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-9\">There is nothing, which, <em>ex sequo et bono, </em>entitles the plaintiff to recover of the defendant; who, was an innocent person, acting in the regular course of his business, and guilty of no fault. Whether the defendant was liable or not, was a question of law, proper for the consideration of the Court, and not of the jury. The demurrer, therefore, was clearly proper. For, the jury could not have made any such inferences from the evidence, as is contended for on the other side. There was nothing in the testimony which inevitably led to such conclusions. But, the inferenees ought to be inevitable, or the jury can no more make them, than the Court; and, where they are inevitable, the Court may as well make them, as the jury. This is the spii\u2019it of the decisions in <em>Cocksedge </em>v. <em>Fanshaw, </em>and <em>Stephens v</em>. <em>White, </em>No waiver ought to be presumed. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>cause, the defendant offered to appeal, which operated like a bill of exceptions. .The defendant was obliged to submit . to the second trial; for, the authority of the Coux-t, in awarding* it, could not be resisted, as they would not allow Jxis appeal, but obliged him to remain where he was. It is no answer to say, that the defendant ought to have made another exception at the second trial. Fox-, it would have been nugatory and disrespectful, to the District Court, to have presented the same demurrer again. Besides, the parties would, by that means, have forever run round in a circle; and the cause could never have been ended.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-15\">[* See on this subject <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Summers </em>et al. 3 Yeats, 531; <em>Jones </em>et al. v. <em>Ryde </em>et al. 5 Taunt. 488, 1 Marsh. 157, S.
