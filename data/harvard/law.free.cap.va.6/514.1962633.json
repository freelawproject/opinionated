and all the estate which she claimed or then had under the Will of jiei. father <em>Robert Lewis, </em>was vested in the said <em>William </em>. , , _ 7 7 _ <em>Lewis, </em>m trust, for the use of the said <em>iraaay Thompson </em>ant* hei's\u00b0lf during their lives and the life of the longest liver; and, in case he should die without issue by her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>then the said estate was to return and be vested in her in the same manner as she then held it; but, if she should die leaving only one child, she was to have a rigid to dispose of one half; or, if two or more children, of one third part, in fee simple:\u2014that the true meaning of the contract was, that, in the event of her being the survivor, she should enjoy the whole during life:\u2014that <em>Waddy Thompson </em>died in March 1801; having, by his Will, but not intentionally, made a different disposition: that <em>Waddy Thompson, </em>executor of the deceased, insisted that the crops made that year were <em>assets </em>in his hands, although the plaintiff was entitled to them under the marriage contract, by virtue of which her interest, for her sole use and benefit, <em>vested at Ms death; </em>and especially, because, at least one half of the hands employed on the plantation of the decedent were of her own estate:\u2014 that, at the time of her said husband\u2019s death, she had issue by him five daughters:\u2014that, after his death, and during the year in which he died, a considerable crop was made on the land which was in his occupation at the time of his death, besides a crop of tobacco, on hand, of the preceding crop, all w hich came to the hands of the executor, who refused to allow her any part for the maintenance of herself and two daughters living with her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-4\">The Bill therefore prayed an account to be rendered by the said executor; and for such decree as might be agreeable to equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">The defendant, by his answer, referred to the marriage contract, and insisted upon the crops as <em>assets; </em>remarking too, that, by the Will of the testator, ample and liberal provision was made for the complainant and the children he had by her, far exceeding the provision made by the said contract, and much more than he made for his-children by his first Wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">The County Court decreed the plaintiff to be entitled to the crops of 1801, and directed an account before a Commissioner, who reported 219L Is. <em>6d. </em>in her favour;

be- \u201c cause he says that, after the decree from which the <em>(i </em>said appeal was prayed, and the said appeal had been <em>\u201c </em>prayed and allowed, and after the death of the said <em>\u201c\u25a0 Mary Thompson, </em>administration on her estate was duly <em>\u201c </em>committed to the said <em>Rice Garland </em>as Sheriff of Al- <em>\u201c </em>bemarle, by the order of the County Court of Albe- <em>\u201c </em>marie; and <em>George\u25a0\u25a0 W.

Kinsolving </em>as ad- \u201c ministrator aforesaid, and the said appellee, by their <em>\u201c </em>bond, sealed with their respective seals, and now to <em>\u201c </em>the Court here shewn, did mutually and interchange-<em>i( </em>ably bind themselves, each to the other, in the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201c one thousand dollars, to be paid when thereto required, <em>\u201c </em>with a condition there underwritten, reciting the facts, <em>\u201c </em>of the said decree of the Superior Court of Chan- <em>\" eery </em>for the Richmond District; the appeal therefrom \u201c by the said <em>Mary Thompson, </em>and her dcatii; and stat- \u201c intg that the said <em>George Kinsolving </em>administrator \u201c the said <em>Mary Thompson, </em>and the said appellee had by \u00ab mutual consent referred the matter in controversy to <em>\u201c </em>the decision of <em>Samuel Shelton, Charles Yancey </em>and \u201c <em>William Woods, </em>and to abide by their award, to be \u201c binding on them as if determined in the regular course \u201c of law; and, in that event, if the party against whom \u00ab the award should be made, should abide thereby, then \u201c the said obligation to be void, else to remain in full \u201c force: and the said appellee avers, that the said referees \u201c did take upon themselves ttie burthen of the said arbi- \u201c trament, and did, thereafter, to wit, on the 6th of \u201cApril 1813, at the County of Albemarle, in the pre- \u201c sence of the parties to the said submission, in pursu- \u201c anee of the said submission, arbitrate and determine of \u201c and concerning the matter in controversy in the said \u201c appeal, and did then and there award and determine \u201c that the said <em>Mary Thompson </em>was not entitled to any \u201c part of the crop made, in the year 1801, on the land \u201c held by her deceased husband <em>Waddy Thompson </em>the \u201c testator of the appellee; the said year 1801 being the \u201c year of the death of her deceased husband, and the crop \u201c made that year, claimed by the said <em>Mary, </em>being the \u201c matter in controversy in the said appeal; and they did \u201c farther award, that the said <em>George W. Kinsolving </em>\u201c should pay the appellee the costs by him expended in \u201c the said suit, in which the said appeal was prayed, up \u201c to the time of the said award; which award, subscrib- \u201c ed by the said arbitrators, is also to the Court here \u201c shewn, and of which the said <em>George W. Kinsolving </em>\u201c then and there had notice; by reason of all which pre- \u201c mises, the said appellee says all manner of error and \u201c errors, defects and imperfections, done or suffered, in \u201c or by the said decree, were removed, destroyed and \u201c released, and the said representative of the said <em>Mary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>\u201c Thompson </em>disabled from urging the same on the said \u201c appeal: all which the said <em>Waddu Thompson </em>is ready <em>\u201c </em>to verify.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-12\">Upon the motion to receive this plea, the following was the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-13\">The Court, not deciding whether a plea, such as that offered in this case, would have been proper in this Court, had the alledged submission been agreed to by <em>Rice Gar~ land the </em>Sheriff, who is the party to the suit now depending, is of opinion that the <em>Deputy </em>Sheriff had no right to make the submission; and therefore the plea offered is re-jected by the Court. The case is therefore to come on, upon it\u2019s merits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-14\">After argument, by <em>Wickham </em>for the appellant, and <em>Stanard, Call </em>and <em>John Robertson </em>(Attorney General,) for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A_Dr\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AVC\">pronounced the opinion of the Court as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">The Court is of opinion, that the provision contained in the 54th section of the Act concerning Wills, &amp;c., (R. Code of 1819, 1st vol. p. 388,) and which provides that the Emblements, severed between the 1st of March and 31st of December in any year, shall be assets in the hands of the executors, does not apply to this case, if it .applies to the case of lands held for life only; it being a new provision materially affecting the rights of the parties, and introduced into our Code subsequently to the execution of the marriage contract in the proceedings contained:\u2014but the opinion of the Court is, that the principle of the common law in relation to Emblements, and which is in some respects more favourable to the representatives of the tenant for life than the provision of that section, is to govern in this case; it being wholly unimportant whether the husband holds in right of his wife by virtue of a marriage contract, or by the general principles of law. That principle gives to the executors such emblements, and such only, as were <em>seeded </em>in the lifetime of the tenant for life:\u2014but, in relation to such crops as were <em>afterwards put in, </em>the Court is of opinion that, in the case which has happened, the executors should be charged a reasonable rent for the land, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>be paid to the wife and the children, according to their several rights accruing on the death of the husband, and for which purpose the said children ought also to have been made parties.</p>\n<p id=\"ALoc\">The Court is farther of opinion that, as the provision contained in the 53d section of the said Act, was in force at the date of the contract aforesaid,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it concludes the said wife and children from demanding any hires for the slaves remaining on the land at the time of the death of the testator, but that the same were to continue thereon until the end of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"AOj\">Both decrees are to be therefore reversed with Costs, and the cause remanded to have the requisite parties made, and the cause finally proceeded in, pursuant to the principles of this decree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"A6E0\"> Note.
