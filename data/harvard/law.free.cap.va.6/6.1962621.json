Where an obligee covenants not to sue one of two joint and several obligors, (and much more, where he bindshimself not to sue him for a limited time,) this does not amount to a release, but a covenant only; he may still sue the other obligor a~ law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A_\">2. The majority of the Court were inclined to think that a surety is exonerated in eguit~i, tiLo' not at law, by the plaintiff's accepting a confession of judgment fl~om the principal, and covenanting thereupon to grant him a stay of execution for a Iimited time; the surety not having assented to such new contract and compromise.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyS\">THE Judgment in the case between these parties, ~rc~ Ported in 1 J~1~f. 45,) being certified to the Superior Court of Greenbrier County, Ward flied a plea stating, in substance, that he was surety for William Long, in the bond on which the suit was originally brought; that the confession of judgment, with stay of execution, was given and accepted without his assent; and that thereby he was discharged; stating also, (as the fact was,) that the confession of judgment was ~n termsg Long having liberty to discharge it by a conveyance of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"As2\">To this plea the plaintiff' demurred, and judgment was given in his favour; whereupon Ward obtained a iSuperse(teas from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AIcX\">Wickliam for the pl aintifr in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar1q\">The Judgment with a stay of execution, (especially with such a condition,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>was a merger of the original obligation, so that no farther proceedings could take place upon it, either against Long the principal or Ward the surety. Especially as to the surety; a new contract with the principal, appearing on the record in the suit, to which contract the surety never assented, is, on legal principles, a bar to any future proceedings on the bond against him, in that action or any other.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-3\">Wirt con Ira.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aip\">The doctrine is laid down by Buller, J., in 1 Bog. &amp; Pul. 422, that no favour shown to the principal, which does ~w iwjur~j to the surety, can discharge the latter. The cases cited by Mr. Wickharn, from Brown &amp; Atkins, `were not at `aw, but in equity.-In Nisbet v. Smith, a credit of three years was given to the principal, against the surety's express directions: the debt too was safe as against the princqal: the Court therefore h~joined the plaintiff from proceeding against the surety. In Skip v. Huey, the bond was surrendered to the surety, with a receipt in fall, to quiet him; and other notes and a draft were given, in lien of the bond.-Lord JIar&amp;wi eke says explicitly, that the whole transaction was intended ex~ pressly to discharge the surety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">WickiLarn in reply. 7 Bac. 506, contains a reference to th~ authorities on this subject, and lays down a principle, which has been repeatedly recognized by this Court, in Baird v. Rice, 1 Call 18, and Croughton v. Duval, 3 Call 69; that \"if an obligee in a bOnd make any variation in \"the original contract with the principal, without the privity of the surety, as, if he change the nature of the \"security, or agree to postpone the day of payment, he \"thereby discharges the surety.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-10\">How is the line to be drawn between six months' indul-. gence., or three years'?-If you change the contract, and tie up your own hands, so that you cannot proceed against the principal, is not the surety cxonerated?-Thc principal is discharged from the old contract; how then can the surety be bound by W He surely is not bound by the new contract to which he was no party~-he therefore must be discharged altogether.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-11\">The possthility of injury to the surety is enough, with-~it any actual injury.-The time of performance is of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>essence of the contract.\u2014I am confident that the principle on which the Court went in <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Barrington, </em>2 <em>Ves. p. </em>540, and <em>Nisbet </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>was not that another security was taken, but that the extension of the time without the surety\u2019s consent, discharged him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-3\">A <em>mere forbearance </em>for years to enforce a contract, is a very different thing from making a new contract <em>binding </em>the plaintiff to wait six months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-4\">The case of <em>Peel </em>v. <em>Tatlock, </em>in 1 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pul., </em>has no bearing that I can see upon this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">I admit there is some difficulty in the question whether a Court of <em>common law </em>can take notice of this discharge. But the exoneration of the surety being by matter of record <em>in the same cause, </em>I contend that he ought not to be turned \u2019round to a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">If a creditor can take a confession of judgment, in a <em>joint </em>action, from one of the defendants, <em>giving him time, </em>and can afterwards get a judgment against another, he can favour one improperly to the injury of the other, and make that several which before was joint.\u2014The bond in this case was joint and several; but the suit, having been brought against both, was an election, on the part of the plaintiff, to consider it joint. He might either have sued them jointly or severally; but, having sued <em>jointly, </em>he has no right to make a distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-7\"><em>Wirt. </em>None of the authorities in this country have departed from the principle laid down by Judge <em>Buller </em>in <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pul.\u2014Baird </em>v. <em>Rice </em>was a case of particular hardship:\u2014the favour shown was to the <em>prejudice </em>of the surety.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b27-12\"> Nisbet v. Smith, 2 Bro. ch. cases. 579; Skip v. Huey, 3 Atk. 91; 7 Bac. 506.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b28-8\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AUV\">pronounced the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The Court is of opinion, upon the authority of the cases of <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Newhall, (1 Term Rep. </em>68,) and <em>Lacy </em>v. <em>Kynaston, </em>(12 <em>Mod. </em>551.,) that, where an obligee covenants not to sue one of two joint and several obligors, (and much more where the obligation is only not to sue him for a limited time, <em>(Ayloffe </em>v. <em>Scrimshire, Carth. </em>63.,) this obligation does not amount to a release, but is a covenant only; and that the obligee may still sue the other pbligor <em>at </em>law.\u2014And, on this ground, the Court affirms the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>At the same time, the <em>majority </em>of the Court are inclined to think, upon the authority of the case of <em>Nisbet </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(2 <em>Bro. ch. </em>cases, 581,) recognized in this Court in the case of <em>Croughton </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>(3 <em>Call </em>69,) that, where, as in this case, during the pendency of a suit, the creditor enters into a covenant, upon receiving a confession of judgment by the principal, to stay execution for a given time,\u2014as (to use the words of the Court in <em>Croughton </em>v. <em>Duval,) </em>\u201cthis amounts to anew contract \u201c and compromise with the principal, without the con- \u201c sent of the surety, and deprives him of his remedy by \u201c a bill of <em>quia timet, </em>the security is thereby discharged, <em>in Equity, </em>from the obligation of his contract.</p>\n<author id=\"b29-3\">Judge Cabell</author>\n<p id=\"ARGX\">delivered the following separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">It was decided in the case of <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>(8th <em>Term Rep. </em>168,) that a covenant never to sue one of two joint and several obligors, was not, at law, a discharge of the other obligor; even although that other be a security. If this decision be correct, of which I have no doubt, it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that the agreement for a temporary stay of execution against the principal in the case now before the Court, was not at law, a discharge of the security.\u2014\u2022 I am therefore of opinion to affirm the Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Whether the appellant be entitled to relief in equity, or not, is a question on which I forbear to express any opinion. The case when it goes before a Court of Chancery, may bear a different aspect, by the introduction of circumstances which the appellee knew were unnecessary to be exhibited to the Court of law; and I am not prepared to say that there is any rule in equity by which a temporary suspension, even for a day or an hour, of proceedings once commenced against a principal, will, in all cases and under all circumstances, be a discharge of the security. On this point, however, I wish to be understood as giving no opinion at present.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
