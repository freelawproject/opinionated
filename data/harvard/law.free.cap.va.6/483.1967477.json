They begun said survey about two and one half chains on tile <em>South </em>branch of <em>Potowmack, </em>about four miles below the mouth of the <em>North </em>fork, near to where fort <em>George </em>formerly stood, the first corner extended eleven poles up a run, between two hills, the second course crossed the point of a bill which was not passable; they measured back on the first course, into the bottom, to enable them to run the second course. The second course, as the surveyor then urn, was \u2022on the point of a hill, where there was no timber cut, at the third corner there was but little timber, the fourth corner no timber cut, the fifth corner cleared, the sixth corner no timber cut, at the seventh corner no timber cut, except a road along the river, the last course called for forty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>poles, but found only six, when we came to the river, which, if they had extended agreeably to the deed, would have carried them over the <em>South </em>branch to a pine hill. They then went down the different meanders of the river to the beginning. That they diligently examined the different corners, but found no corner tree nor side mark; that there was an allowance made of two and one half degrees variation. And further proved by <em>Job Welton, </em>that he was summoned by the Sheriff of the county to attend a survey on the lands in dispute, and that they began the first course of the survey about the middle of the <em>South </em>branch, where I fort <em>George </em>formerly stood; that they run the first course one hundred and six poles, about eleven rods of which was up a run between two hills, where the timber was chiefly cut; they then started on the second course, and run some distance, when they came to a steep bank, which they could not go down; they measured back on the first course into the bottom, to enable them to run the second course. The second course, as the surveyor then run, was on the point of a hill where there was no timber cut, at the third corner there was but little timber, the fourth corner no timber cut, the fifth corner cleared, the sixth corner no timber cut, at the seventh corner no timber cut, except a road along the river, the last course called for forty poles, but found only six, when we came to the river. They then took down the different meanders of the river, to the beginning. That they diligently examined th\u00e9 different corners, but found no corner tree nor side mark; that there was an allowance made of two degrees and an half in the variation, and that he was present when they run out the land in 1773, when no marked trees nor corners could he discovered. They also gave, in evidence the act of Assembly passed in the year 1736, intituled, an act for confirming and better securing the titles to lands in the <em>Northern Neck. </em>And they further proved, by <em>Moses Hutton, </em>that he, the said Hutton, has. been in this country fifty odd years; that he has always heard the <em>South </em>branch, the <em>South </em>fork and the <em>North </em>fork called as they now are; that the land in possession,of the tenants lies on the <em>South </em>side of the <em>South </em>branch, .and he believes about one mile below the <em>North </em>fork: And by <em>William Cunningham, </em>sen., that he has been on the <em>South </em>branch fifty-eight years; that <em>Solomon Hedges </em>lived on the land in dispute fifty-five years ago; that the father of the <em>Shobes, </em>the present tenants, was in possession of the said land about fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>years ago, and that the tenants had lived there ever since, but the said witness knows of no title that they had. Thesaid land lies a mile or a mile and a half below the <em>North </em>fork, and on the <em>South </em>side of the <em>South </em>branch. That the <em>South </em>branch, the <em>South </em>fork and the <em>North </em>fork have been understood as such during the whole time he lived in this country. To which evidence, the demandant\u2019s counsel demurred as insufficient in law, to support the right of the tenants to the lands in contest, and produced in support of their rights, a copy of a patent duly attested as the law directs, from <em>George </em>the second, late King of <em>Great </em>Britain, in the words and figures following: <em>George </em>the second, &amp;c., and the act of Assembly passed in the year 1748, entitled, an act for confirming the grants made bv his Majesty within the bounds of the <em>Northern Neck, </em>as they are now established; and also, a copy of the last will and testament of <em>Robert Green, </em>deceased, authenticated under the seal of the county of <em>Orange, </em>where the same was admitted to record in the words and figures following, to wit: In the name, &amp;e.

To the reception of which demurrer the tenants, by their counsel, objected, for the following reasons: because the demurrer contained as well the evidence demurred to by the demandants, as the evidence exhibited <em>by </em>the demandants; and that the facts which that evidence relates, contained matter proper for the consideration of the jury: which objection was sustained by the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">Verdict and judgment for the tenants; upon which the demandant appealed to the District Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">The District Court was of opinion, that the, judgment was erroneous, in this, <em>u </em>that the Court below ought not to have admitted the evidence stated on the pari of the tenants, as mentioned in the demandant\u2019s bill of exceptions, to have gone as evidence; to the jury; and in not rsceiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ing the demurrer of the said demandant\u201d That Court, therefore, reversed the judgment, and thereupon the tenants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-8\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-9\">This case exactly <em>resembles </em>that of <em>Hyers </em>v. <em>Green, </em>(ante, 555,) except, that here is a bill of exceptions to the testimony proving the <em>non tenure, </em>arid not a demurrer only, as was the case there. But, that circumstance will not make a material difference; because, if the <em>non tenure </em>could not have been given in evidence, in that case, the Court could not have decided for the tenants, upon evidence introduced for tire purpose of proving the <em>non tenure. ' </em>Besides, it may be a question, whether the demandant, by offering to demur in this case, ought not to he considered as thereby consenting to waive his bill of ex ceptions. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-10\"><em>Williams, </em>contra.,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-11\">Contended, 1. That <em>non tenure </em>could not be given it.i evidence at common law. <em>2. </em>That the act of Assembly had not altered the common law, in this respect. 3. That, if <em>non tenure </em>could be given in evidence, the judgment ought to be the same as the judgment on <em>non tenure </em>at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-12\">Upon the first point: The <em>mise </em>is joined upon the mere right; the pleadings are in that manner; and the party cannot alledge in evidence what would go to falsify his own pleadings. When, therefore, the defendant pleads <em>to the </em>mere right in the land, he insists upon his title only; and, therefore, renders it unnecessary for the other side to prove the identity. If, then, he is suffered to give evidence of <em>non tenure </em>on the trial, he will take bis adversary by surprise, as the latter will not come prepared to meet the objection. Besides, <em>non tenure </em>is a plea in abatement; and, therefore, ought to be plead, or it cannot be taken advantake of afterwards. 5 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 426, <em>Gwil. </em>ed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-13\">Upon the second point: The act of Assembly does not alter the rules of the common law, upon this subject. For, that only furnishes a shorter mode of joining the <em>mise </em>upon the mere right, but does not alter the rules of proceeding, prior to the <em>mise </em>being joined. For, the act of 1786, <em>R. C. </em>36, [c. 59, 12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>345,] ought to be read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>rt'\u00edth that of 1792, <em>R, C. </em>118, \u00a7 2S: which expressly treats <em>\u25a0aon tenure </em>as a plea in abatement, and supposes that it will be Insisted on, before the <em>mise </em>is joined. According to which reading, the act will stand thus: If the tenant shall not plead <em>non tenure, join-tenancy, or several tenancy in abatement, </em>he may plead in this form, or to this effect, &amp;e., as in the act of 1786. Another argument on this point is, that, at common law, the <em>mise </em>was not joined upon collateral points, such as <em>non tenure, \u00a7\u2022\u20ac., </em>but they were tried by a common jury; and, therefore, as the act only speaks of the <em>mise, </em>it follows, that these collateral matters were not designed to be included.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-4\">Upon the third point: If <em>non tenure </em>could be given in evidence, still the judgment of the County Court is wrong. For, it ought to be according to the judgment at common law; which was not a judgment in bar: It acquitted the tenants indeed, but the demandant recovered the lands. <em>Co. Litt. 362, </em>363; 1 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 21. <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.] Therefore, \u2022 the judgment, in the present ease, which goes in bar of the demandant\u2019s claim, is clearly wrong, and ought to he* reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-7\">The demurrer does not waive the bill of exceptions, as the counsel on the other side supposes: For, if they he repugnant, it would only prove, that the demurrer ought not to be received, but not that the bill of exceptions should be relinquished.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-9\">\n<em>Call</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-10\"><em>Non tenure </em>may be given in evidence, since the act ox 1786, although the <em>mise </em>is joined upon the mere right. For, the act is positive, that <em>any matter may be given in evidence which might have been specially pleaded.: </em>And as <em>non tenure </em>clearly might have been specially pleaded before the act, it follows, necessarily, that it may be given in evidence since. This is the more necessary, because, in practice as well as according to the principles of law, the defendant is now obliged to plead in the form prescribed by the act of Assembly: For, I am informed, that one of the District Courts refused to permit the de fendant to plead a common law plea: A refusal warranted by principles of law, and the rules for construing statutes: By which, the word <em>may </em>is understood to be imperative, and synonymous with <em>shall. </em>6 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. <em>379, [Gwil </em>ed.] Of course, there is no choice left to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>dani, but he is obliged to plead the plea, which is prescribe&lt;j }3y t]3e act. But, it would be preposterous to oblige him to pass by a plea, which would defend him, and to put in another, which will not, without allowing him to give the matter of the first in evidence. This would be an act of injustice, which ought not to be imputed to the Legislature, when an obvious construction will avoid it. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHR\">There are other considerations, which render what we contend for, peculiarly proper; namely, the object of the act, and the state of the practice in this country. The <em>object of </em>the act was, clearly, to simplify the pleadings in this action, and to rid it of all its entanglements and difficulties, by permitting the parties to try their claims, without the dangers, to which the common law pleadings were exposed. The object, therefore, ought to be promoted, in the construction of a remedial statute. And this is rendered peculiarly necessary, when the state of the practice is considered. For, the gentlemen, who practice in the Inferior Courts, are constantly riding about from Court to Court, and are generally obliged to plead upon the spur of the occasion, without an opportunity of consulting their books, or reflecting on the nature of the case. In this situation, they are forced to make use of the first form which presents itself; and none, in such a dangerous action as this is, at common law, would so obviously occur, as the form in the act of Assembly: Especially, as it must often times be impossible for the client himself to say, whether the bounds, described in the count, correspond with those of his own land. Considerations of this kind ought to have weight; and, accordingly, in the case of <em>Downman </em>v. <em>Downman\u2019s ex\u2019rs. </em>1 Wash. 26, the state of the practice, in this country, was one reason given, by the Court for the opinion, that a plea of tender, if right in form, might be offered, after an office judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-7\">But, there is another circumstance which renders it highly important, that our construction of the act should be adopted; namely, that, at common law, the defendant had aright to demand a <em>view, </em>before he plead; and then he was at liberty to plead <em>non tenure </em>of the lands in the count, or of those put in <em>view, </em>at his election. <em>Booth </em>on Real Actions, 30; 15 <em>Vin. </em>Abr. 591-2. But, as by the act of 1748, this right to demand <em>a. view </em>is taken away, the tenant has no opportunity of knowing the lands, which are specifically demanded, until he comes upon the trial; and therefore, unless he may then object <em>non tenure, </em>and shew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that the lands, which the demandant pursues, are different from those he describes in his count, and to which latter the defendant is really entitled, he must lose his own lands; and the demandant, instead of recovering the lands he really sued for, will have judgment for those which did not belong to him, merely from a slip in the pleadings. Thus, if the demandant has title to a piece of land, which in fact is claimed by C., but which he supposes to be in the seisin of B., and, therefore, brings suit against B. for it; but by mistake in setting forth the boundaries, he describes the land which really belongs to B., and the latter, supposing that to be the subject of the suit, puts in the plea prescribed by the act: Ifere, although, upon the trial, it clearly appears, that the land sued for, is really that which C. claims, and not that belonging to B., yet the latter will not be allowed to show this fact, but must submit toa judgment although he does not hold the lands demanded: A consequence' which would not have followed, if he could have demanded <em>a view; </em>because he might'then have plead, that he did not hold the land put in <em>view, </em>and thus abated the writ. But surely, if the law has <em>taken </em>away the <em>view, for </em>the benefit of the demandant, so as to avoid delay, it ought not to deprive the tenant, of the benefit of the same matter in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">There is perhaps another ground, upon which <em>this right </em>may be maintained. A well known distinction exists between writs, which are abateable merely, and writs which <em>de facto </em>abate. In the first case, the matter must be plead, hut <em>not in the </em>other. An instance of the latter kind is this; if one brings a suit in the name of a dead man or of a fictitious person, here, although the .defendant may, by mistake, happen to plead in chief, yet when the fact is discovered, the proceedings will be slopped, and the suit abated. There is the same reason for abating the suit, where it is found, that the plaintiff sues for different lands, than those in the possession of the defendant. For, it would be absurd, to permit the plaintiff to recover, against the defendant, lands, which the latter does not hold; and, therefore, could not render to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">These principles must have regulated the decision in <em>Hyers </em>v. <em>Green; </em>because it was impossible to have decided for the tenants in that case, without over-ruling the exception in this. And in <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>1 Call, 484, the Court must have been under the influence of similar reasoning. For, there the exception was, that the bounda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ries of the land were not set forth in the count; and the answer was, that it was too late to make an objection upon that ground at the trial. <em>\u201c </em>For, the tenant having gone to issue on the count, he had taken on himself the knowledge of the lands demanded:\u201d Which is the same objection in other words, as that taken in the present case: for, the objection, here, is no more than that the defendant, by pleading in chief, undertook to know the lands; and that was the very argument made use of there. Of course, as it did not prevail there, no more ought it here: Especially, as the Court, in giving judgment there, say, that the jury had not found the boundaries; which admits,- that there may be a specification of the lands, upon the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-8\">The demandant receives no prejudice from our construction; because, the judgment in this case will not bar his recovery of his own lands, if he has title, against the person who actually has possession of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-9\">The judgment in <em>non tenure, </em>is not such as the counsel supposes. For, if <em>non tenure </em>be a mere plea in abatement, yet, as a plea in abatement, it vacates and destroys the writ; and, therefore, the demandant cannot have judgment: Because, the writ is the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. But, if there be no writ, there can be no recovery; and, after a writ is abated, it is the same thing, as if'there never had been one at all; and both parties are out of Court. Therefore, <em>Booth, </em>in his book on <em>Real Actions, </em>says, p. 29, that \u201cif the tenant do not hold any part of the land, <em>i. e. </em>be not tenant of the freehold, the writ shall abate; because, as <em>Bracton </em>says, he cannot lose that which he has not; and, therefore, the writ shall fall:\u201d Which proves clearly, that no judgment is to be rendered for the demandant, on such a plea. Nor do the authorities, cited on the other side, prove it. For, the passages quoted from <em>Littleton, </em>\u00a7 691, 692,- only state what will be the consequences of the demandant\u2019s entering on the lands, after the judgment against him on the plea, and not that any judgment at all shall be rendered for him: Which is the very exposition given of them by Lord Coke; who says, <em>Fol. </em>363, (a): <em>\u201c Albeit, </em>in this case, and in the case before, the entry of the demandant is his own act, and the demandant hath <em>no express judgment </em>to recover, yet he shall be remitted:\u201d Which clearly repels the idea, suggested on the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-11\">It is unnecessary to say any thing as to the merits; because they are admitted to be the same with those in <em>Hy</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>ers </em>v. <em>Green; </em>and, consequently, in favor of the appellants; so that the case rests merely on the technical exceptiorn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-4\">The offer to demur is a waiver of the bill of exceptions; because they are repugnant. For, by demurring, the party admits the evidence; but, denies the inference of law. Therefore, to accept and demur, too, involves a contradiction; and, consequently, the one must be considered as a waiver of the other; or else the Court will permit the party to take contradictory steps.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-7\">The point of <em>non tenure </em>was not decided in <em>Hyers </em>v. <em>Green.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-15\">[* See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Liter </em>et al. 8 Cranch, 229, 248.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-14\">[* 1 H. &amp; M. 61.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-9\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AvI\">I understood the decision in <em>Hyers </em>v.

The word demurrer, in the act of 1786, shews, that the tenant is not obliged to join the <em>mise </em>upon the mere right, and, consequently, that the word <em>may </em>is not imperative, as those on the other side suppose. Nor do the cases, cited from 6 <em>Bac., </em>prove it; for, they relate to the acts of public officers. The argument, drawn from the doctrine of views, is plausible, at first sight, but it is founded on a mistake of the subject; for, that related to the title papers. Nor does the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>apply; because, it is necessary that the count should describe the bounds; so that the Sheriff may know what lands to deliver; and that the land-marks should be perpetuated. The act of 1786 only relates to pleas in bar; like pleading the general issue, with leave to give the special matter in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The demurrer is no waiver of the bill of exceptions. For, the exception is to the admissibility; but, the demurrer denies its force, when admitted.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Anb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Randolph, </em>in reply, <em>\u00c1 1</em></attorneys>\n<p id=\"Ayr0\">If the tenants are entitled to the lands they hold, they ought not to lose them by a slip in pleading; yet, such would be the consequence of the doctrine contended for, on the other side. But, fortunately, the law does not warrant the doctrine. The act of 1786 is express, that all matters of defence, of whatever description they be, may be given in evidence; and, consequently, <em>non tenure: </em>Which is agreeable to the doctrine of the common law; for, at common law, any thing but collateral warranty may be given in evidence. The tenants are obliged to plead the plea prescribed in the act; which is imperative, as has been rightly stated. This is proved by the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Fogg; </em>for, the judgment there was reversed, merely because the bounds were not inserted in the count, agreeable to the directions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiIS\">ROANE, Judge. This is a writ of right, for 1,120 acres of land on the <em>South </em>branch of <em>Botowmack. </em>The count and plea are both conformable to the act of 1786, [c. 59, 12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>345, c. 118, <em>R. C. </em>ed. 1819,] and both describe the tract, as comprehended within the same boundaries. At the trial of the cause, two exceptions were taken by the demandants: 1. To the admission of testimony going to shew the non-identity of the land possessed by the tenants, with relation to that described in the count and plea. 2. To the decision of the Court refusing to compel the tenants to join in a demurrer tendered by the demandants. In support of this last decision, two grounds were stated by the tenant\u2019s counsel: 1. That the demurrant had also inserted, in his demurrer, his own testimony. 2. That the facts, to which the evidence related, contained matter proper for the consideration of the jury. The judgment of the County Court was reversed by the judgment of the District Court, \u201cfor that,\u201d as they allodge, \u201c the Court below ought not to have admitted the evidence stated on the part of the tenants, as mentioned in the demurrant\u2019s bill of exceptions, to have gone as evidence to the jury; and in not receiving the demurrer to evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">The rectitude of this opinion of the District'Court, is now to be discussed; and I will first consider the case, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the second bill of exceptions, relative to the demurrer to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">As to the first objection stated by the tenants, to the reception of the demurrer, I shall only say, that in the case of <em>Hyers </em>v. Green, this Court were of opinion, on consideration of the case of <em>Hoyle </em>v. <em>Young, </em>1 Wash. 150, and other authorities, that the plaintiff ought, especially in a writ of right, also to set out his own evidence; and, in that case, justified the rejection of the demurrer, on the ground, that the demurrant had not stated a <em>title </em>to recover, in respect of <em>his own </em>identity. This objection does not hold in the present case; for, the identity of the demandant is fully manifested. I am not certain, whether considered the ground of the Court, in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Hyers, </em>the second objection, although the demurrers, in the two cases, are, in that respect, substantially alike. But, I take the rule to be, that, although a Court- ought to award a joinder in demurrer, where the evidence demurred to is in writing; or, being <em>parol, </em>is explicit, and will not admit of variance, yet that, where the parol testimony is loose, indeterminate, and circumstantial, the party offering it, shall not be compelled to join in demurrer, unless the party demurring will distinctly admit every fact and conclusion, which such evidence or circumstances may conduce to prove. In support of this distinction, I beg leave to refer to 5 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 746, [ <em>Gwil. </em>ed.] and the authorities there cited;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and to. say that the evidence in question, in . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>this case, respecting the boundaries of the land, and the understanding of the country, relative to the description of the river, is entirely of this latter description, being loose and circumstantial. The demurrer to evidence, therefore, may be thrown out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The only remaining point to be considered, arises out of the first bill of exceptions; and is simply, whether, upon the <em>mise </em>being joined according to the form prescribed by the act of Assembly, evidence, going to shew a <em>non tenure </em>of the lands stated in the pleadings, be admissible ?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The <em>act of 1786, </em>concerning writs of right, prescribes the manner in which demandants <em>shall </em>count. It also prescribes a general mode in which the tenant may plead. I think it is not only inferrible, from the various use of the words <em>shall </em>and <em>may, </em>hut from the actual existence, at that time, of the act of <em>22 Geo. 2, </em>ch. 1, [ <em>Oct. </em>1748, \u00a721, 5 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>416,] (since re-enacted,) authorising a plea of <em>non tenure </em>in abatement, that the general plea, prescribed by the act of 1786, is concurrent, and not exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"AGjL\">Nor will the inconveniences result, which the appellee\u2019s counsel apprehended; and which he stated would arise, from the different judgments, prescribed by the common law, in the case of <em>non tenure </em>being pleaded, and the <em>mise </em>being joined. If <em>non tenure </em>be now pleaded, the Court will give such judgment thereupon as the common law requires: But, if it be given in evidence, and the jury find a special verdict, affirming such evidence, the Court will give a similar judgment. If, however, such evidence be given, and yet a general verdict be rendered upon the right, such verdict is a negative of that evidence; and decides the right: In which case, a judgment, corresponding with the verdict, ought to be rendered. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">For these reasons, I think the judgment of the County Court was correct; and that the judgment of the District Court, reversing that judgment, ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">FLEMING, Judge. Thi\u00e1 is an appeal from a judgment of the District Court, reversing a judgment of the County Court, rendered in favor of the appellants in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Court.; and the reasons given by the District Court, are: 1. That the County Court permitted evidence to be given to the jury, that the tenants were not in possession of the lands demanded, when the <em>mise </em>had been joined, between the parties, upon the mere right. <em>2. </em>That the County Court did not compel the tenants to join in the demurrer to the evidence, which was tendered by the demandant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">As to the first: The Legislature of this country, in order to simplify the pleadings, expedite the trials, and prevent unnecessary delays in writs of right, have taken away the <em>views </em>and other delatories, and obliged the tenant to plead the general issue, and put himself upon the assize; allowing him to give any matter in evidence at the trial of the cause, which might have been specially pleaded. This latter provision appears to have been made; in order to reserve to him the benefits to which he would have been entitled by the common law proceedings; and, therefore, he ought not to be deprived of them by arguments drawn from the common law, before the mode of proceeding was changed by the act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">But, it is objected by the counsel for the appellants, that the act of Assembly does not oblige the tenant to put himself upon the assize; for, by using the word may, they leave it optional in him, to put in the plea prescribed by the act, or to plead any matter specially, according to the course of the common law. Such a construction, however, would render the act a dead letter; for, the tenant might, at common law, have joined the <em>mise </em>upon the mere right, and put himself upon the assize, without the aid of a statute, to enable him to do it. This shews that a change in the proceedings was contemplated; and that the word <em>may </em>was intended to be compulsory.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In other words, it was not intended, that it should be left to the tenant\u2019s option, what he would plead; but, the meaning was, that he should be obliged to use the plea prescribed by the act However, in order to prevent his sustaining any prejudice thereby, he is allowed to give any matter <em>in </em>evidence which he might have specially pleaded. By this means, the proceedings are simplified, and delays prevented, without any injury to the party: Which was the great desideratum, and what the statute was designed to effect. Consequently, it would be thwarting the will of the Le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>gislature, and defeating the end of the act of Assembly, if we were (-0 throw the party back again upon the technical rules of the common law; which the statute was made to <em>correct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">I am therefore clearly of opinion, that the County Court very properly permitted the evidence of <em>non tenure </em>to be .given to the jury; and consequently that the opinion of the District Court upon that point, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AcM\">With respect to the second point relative to the demurrer to the evidence: After the County Court had permitted the evidence to go to the jury, the cause rested on a single point; namely, whether the land in possession of the tenants was the same, with that claimed by the demandant in his count? This was a mere fact, proper for the consideration of the jury upon the evidence; and therefore, I think the County Court very properly left it to their, decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The result is, that I am of opinion, the judgment of the District Court was erroneous upon both grounds; and therefore, th\u00e1t it ought to be reversed, and the judgment of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ANSi\">LYONS, Judge. The demurrer, after stating the titles and claims of all the parties, reduces the question to a single fact; that is to say, whether the land claimed by the demandant, and in possession of the tenants, is within the bounds of the patent granted to <em>Robert Green, </em>in the year 1746, for 1120 acres, in the county of <em>Augusta? </em>Or in other words, whether it is the same land which was surveyed for, and granted to <em>Robert Green </em>by that patent ? This was a simple question of fact; which a jury alone could, and ought to have determined. Therefore, I think, the County Court, very properly left it to their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">But 'it is objected, that the tenants, not having plead <em>non tenure </em>in abatement, were precluded from giving it in evidence, or in any manner questioning the identity of the land. Suppose that position were to be granted, could the demandant recover without shewing some title ? After offering in his count, proof of his right, has he produced it, or shewn any title to the land which he has surveyed in possession of the tenants ? That land lies on the South side of the <em>South </em>fork of the <em>South </em>branch; and not on the South side of the <em>North </em>fork, as his patent calls for, and states the land he claims to lie. Then is it just, or can it be law, that after an issue is joined on the mere right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that the claimant shall recover land to which he shews no right, merely because the tenant cannot produce a patent for it! Surely, possession in such a case gives the best right; and the demandant ought not to be allowed to disturb it, without shewing a complete title in himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Suppose the tenants had produced a prior patent for lands lying in the county of <em>Augusta, </em>and insisted that the lands claimed were within the bounds of their patent, must <em>not the jury </em>have enquired into the bounds of both patents, and determined whether the lands were included in either? And, if not included in either, what must have been their verdict ? Could they have found for the demandant, who had no better title than the tenants ? Surely not, for he could have no claim to a verdict, without shewing a title. But if the tenants may controvert the boundaries, where different patents are produced, without pleading <em>non tenure, </em>I see no reason why they may not do it in every other case. The difficulty arises on account of the judgment to be entered in such cases, as it is a bar to the demandant to sue the tenant again. This might have been provided for by the Legislature, when they were altering the mode of proceeding; but having omitted to do so, the legal consequences must take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">If, however, the tenant does not chuse to enter into the controversy, respecting the title or bounds, on the general issue, he may still plead <em>non tenure </em>in abatement, as the act does not forbid it. All the difference is, that a different judgment will be entered for the tenant in that case, if found for him, than would be entered on a joinder of the <em>mise; </em>and that the demandant may take issue on the <em>non tenure, </em>or discontinue his suit as he sees proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed; and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">[* And see <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>1 Munf. 22; <em>Young </em>et al. v. <em>Black, 7 </em>Cranch, 565; 568; <em>Duerhagen </em>v. <em>The U.

Those facts were to be ascertained by the Court; and, in this respect, the Court might err in opinion; and, if so, and the party refused to make the admission, he lost the benefit of his demurrer; or, if he made the admission on record, it bound him irrevocably. In the latter case, the error of the Court could never he corrected; and, in the former, not without a protracted litigation, attended with great delay and expense, to wits by bill of exceptions and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">To avoid this inconvenience, the modem practice is, especially in <em>Vir* ginia9 </em>where it has been sanctioned by repeated decisions of this Court, to allow either party to demur, unless the case he clearly against the party-offering the demurrer, or the Court should doubt what facts should reasonably be inferred, from the evidence demurred to; in which case, the jury is the most fit tribunal to decide; to put all the evidence, on both sides, into the demurrer, and then to consider the demurrer, as if the demur-rant had admitted all that could reasonably be inferred by a jury, from the evidence given by the other party, and waiving all the evidence on his part, which contradicts that offer-</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ed by the other party 5 or the credit of which is impeached; and all inferences from his own evidence, which do not necessarily flow from it.
