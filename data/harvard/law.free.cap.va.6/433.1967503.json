For, the count is for money had and received, and there is no testimony tending to shew, that any money was received by the defendants: Whose promise, for the debt of their testator, would not bind, unless it had been reduced into writing, according to the directions of the act of Assembly, concerning frauds and perjuries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAG2\">But, the plaintiff ought not to have been permitted to recover on this declaration; because, it was too general, and gave no notice to the defendant of the nature of the dispute. <em>[Overton </em>et ux. v. <em>Hudson, ex\u2019r.] 2 </em>Wash. 172.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgW\">Upon these grounds, the Court below would have done right, in instructing the jury, that they should find for the defendants; for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim being supported by records, it was the province of the Court, and not of the jury to decide upon them. For, wherever matter of law, or the construction of written testimony occurs, it belongs to the Court to consider it. <em>[Macbeath </em>v. Haldimand,] 1 T.

All which express^ state, that the Court cannot instruct the jury, to find \u00e1 verdict for one of the parties. Which is consistent with the decision in <em>Calvert </em>v. <em>Boiodoin; </em>for, in that case, the Court below affirmed to the jury, that the evidence was sufficient to maintain the action; and, this Court reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">Besides, the Court has often decided, that a bill of exceptions cannot be -considered as a demurrer to evidence; and, the argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel only amounts to an attempt of that kind: For, if his'objeetions were well founded, they ought to have been brought on, by demurrer to evidence, and not by a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-8\">But, there is no ground for the objections; because, the improvements made by the plaintiff, were allowed the executors of Lord <em>Fairfax </em>in the account, between them and the <em>Hites; </em>and, therefore, it was so much money received by them to the plaintiff\u2019s use. As to. the exception relative to the issue, it is, at most, but a mere misjoinder.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-9\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-10\">In <em>Calvert </em>v. <em>Bowdoin, </em>the Court not only declared, that the Court below was wroiig, in affirming to the jury, that the evidence was sufficient, but they went on to non-suit the plaintiff; and, therefore, decided on the competency of the evidence: Which being written, in that case, as well as in this, that case proves, that the Court, and not the jury, should decide the matter of law. In that respect, the present case differs from those <em>relied on, </em>upon the other side. In those, the evidence was parol; but, in this; there was a construction of papers. The declaration, was too general, and gave no notice to the defendants. Besides, it should have been for money laid out and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pended, and not for money had and received to the plaintiff\u2019s use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\">[* This was an action of assumpsit for money had and received and on an account stated, brought by <em>Boiv</em>doin, surviving partner of <em>Phripp &amp; Bowdoin </em>against <em>Calvert, </em>in the <em>Bo^ rough </em>Court of Norfolk.
