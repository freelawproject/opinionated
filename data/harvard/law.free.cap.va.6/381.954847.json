The first was an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>The first count set out a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>mission of the differences between the parties in relation to a certain <em>contract; </em>and a parol award in favour of the plaintiffs. There was another count for money had and received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-13\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and upon the trial he demurred to the evidence, and the Court required the plaintiffs to join in the demurrer. The jury thereupon found a verdict for the plaintiffs for 1225 dollars, with interest from the 14th of March 1836, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the demurrer. And the Court gave a judgment upon the demurrer for the defendant. The evidence is fully stated in the opinion of Judge <em>Daniel.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-14\">The second suit was upon an arbitration bond executed by the plaintiffs and the defendant in the penalty of 3000 dollars, binding them to abide by the award of certain arbitrators therein named, in relation to a certain contract by parol entered into by the said parties, whereby <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>agreed, for a certain consideration to be paid to them by Courtney, to take upon themselves certain contracts which the said <em>Courtney </em>had entered into for the purchase of certain crops of corn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-15\">It appears that the arbitrators proceeded regularly to hear the case, and made an award in the following terms: <em>\u201c We, </em>the arbitrators called on the case of <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>and <em>William P. Courtney, </em>decide that <em>Courtney </em>shall refund to <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart, </em>the sum the said <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>paid for <em>Mr. Campbell's </em>corn.\u201d The only evidence relied on to shew how much <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>had paid to <em>Courtney </em>on account of <em>Campbell's </em>corn, was a receipt dated 1836, March 4th, by which <em>Courtney </em>acknowledged the receipt from them of 1225 dollars, on account of <em>Mr. Hugh Campbell's </em>corn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-16\">The declaration set out the bond and the award, and averred that the plaintiffs had paid to the defendant for <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>corn, the sum of 1225 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>On the trial the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, which the defendant moved the Court to set aside, as being contrary to the evidence; but the Court refused to set aside the verdict, and rendered a judgment thereon. Whereupon the defendant excepted, and spread the facts as they are before stated upon the record; and applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment, which was awarded. Thereupon <em>Cauthorn (Hart </em>being then dead) applied for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment in the first case, which was also awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-6\">Patton, for <em>Cauthorn.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-7\"><em>Daniel </em>and <em>Lyons, </em>for <em>Courtney.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b403-8\">Daniel, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqI8\">The award made by the arbitrators, does not in express and certain terms, fix the sum of money to be paid by <em>Courtney </em>to <em>Cauthorn ; </em>nor does it, by reference or otherwise, afford the means by which the sum intended to be awarded can, with certainty, be ascertained. In some cases it is held averments in pleading may be admitted to support awards which have the appearance of being uncertain. Thus, whenever, from the nature of the thing, the award may be ascertained by a reference to something else, then an averment will help it; as if it be \u201c to pay the money expended in a certain suit,\u201d an averment \u201c that so much was expended,\u201d will support it. Kyd on Awards 205. Here, however, there is nothing in the context of the award, nothing in the nature of the thing awarded, no reference to any thing connected with it, by which to fix the sum intended to be awarded; and I do not see how the objection on the score of uncertainty could be met or obviated by any averment in pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">When the submission is by bond, and the award is for the payment of money, the party prevailing may enforce the award, either by an action of debt on the award itself, or by an action of debt on the bond of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>submission. Kyd 280. In either case, however, it is necessary to the maintenance of the action that he should exhibit an award which of itself, or by manifest reference to something else, ascertains and awards a sum certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Where the arbitrators have proceeded to act upon the matters submitted to them, and have made an award which is void for uncertainty, the parties litigant may assert their demands in any mode or form of action which could have been maintained before they entered into the bond of submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">An agreement to arbitrate, (whether existing only in parol or evidenced by bond,) under which the arbitrators have not proceeded to act, cannot be pleaded in bar of an action brought on the original cause of action. Kyd 16. Much less can such an agreement exclude the jurisdiction of the Court, where the arbitrators, in pursuance of the submission of the parties, have made an effort to determine the controversy, which has proved abortive because of incurable uncertainty in the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">The bond of submission, and the defective award under it, formed, then, in the first of these cases, no objection to a suit on the original cause of action. The only question remaining to be considered is, whether there appears in the evidence set forth on the demurrer, enough to support the issue joined by the plaintiff, under any one of the counts in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">The evidence consists of the bond of submission, the award, a receipt, and the testimony of a single witness. The condition of the bond recites that differences had arisen between the said <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>and the said <em>William P. Courtney, </em>as to a certain contract by parol entered into by the said parties, whereby the said <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>agreed for a certain consideration, to be paid them by said <em>Courtney, </em>to take upon themselves certain contracts which the said <em>Courtney </em>had entered into, for the purchase of certain crops of corn, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the parties had mutually agreed to submit all matters between them touching the premises, to the award of the persons therein named. The award, which is very brief, is in these words : \u201c We the arbitrators called on in the case of <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>and <em>William P. </em>Courtney, decide that <em>Courtney </em>shall refund to <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>the sum the said <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>paid for <em>Mr. Campbell\u2019s </em>com.\u201d The receipt is as follows: \u201c 1836, March 14th, received of <em>Messrs. Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>twelve hundred and twenty-five dollars on account of <em>Mr. Hugh Campbell\u2019s </em>corn. <em>William P. Courtney.\" </em>The only witness examined, states in his deposition, in answer to questions propounded to him by the plaintiffs, that in June 1836, at the place where the arbitration was held, and shortly after the award had been made, he had some conversation with one of the plaintiffs, <em>Hart; </em>that \u201che asked <em>Hart </em>how the matter stood between him and <em>William P. </em>Courtney, that is, how the referees had decided concerning the corn contract between him and <em>Mr. Courtney. Mr. Hart </em>said that the referees had given it in their favour.\u201d <em>Hart </em>then called <em>Mr. Courtney to </em>him, and demanded of him the amount the referees had given in their favour concerning the corn, or to give his bond for the <em>amount; </em>upon which <em>Courtney </em>said, \u201cthat the decision of the referees was just as good as his bond, and he would settle with him or them agreeable to what the referees had decided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">It is true that the witness, in answer to a question propounded by the defendant, states that he understood from the conversation, that the defendant \u201csupposed himself bound by the award, supposing it to be legal.\u201d The language of the defendant, however, and not the interpretation of it by the witness, is the evidence to which a Court and jury would look as proof in the cause. Prom the foregoing evidence, would not a jury have been well justified in inferring that the twelve hundred and twenty-five dollars mentioned in the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ceipt, was so much money advanced by <em>Cauthorn &amp; Hart </em>to <em>Courtney, </em>in pursuance of the contract recited in the condition of the bond of submission; and that the promise of <em>Courtney </em>had a direct reference to this sum\u00a1 an(j involved an admission on his part, that he had not complied with the understanding upon which the money had been advanced ? I think they would. If so, we have a promise by the defendant to pay a specific sum of money received by him upon a consideration which had failed; and under the count for money had and received, without expressing any opinion upon the issue under any other count, there was ample evidence to maintain the issue joined by the plaintiffs on the demurrer to the evidence. From these views, it would follow that the plaintiffs ought to have prevailed in their action on the case in <em>assumpsit, </em>and not in their suit on the bond of submission. The Court below, doubtless regarding the award as sufficiently certain, has given judgment for the plaintiffs in their suit on the bond, and against them in their action in <em>assumpsit </em>on the original cause of action. I think that the judgments in both cases ought to be reversed, with costs to the appellants in each case respectively, and that judgment should be rendered for the plaintiffs in the first case, and for the defendant in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The other Judges concurred. Judgment in both cases reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
