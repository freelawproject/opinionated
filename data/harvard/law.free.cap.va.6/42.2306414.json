The declaration counted on a bailment. <em>Allen </em>appeared, and pleaded <em>non detinet; </em>and after issue joined, pending the action, <em>Allen </em>died. Whereupon, the plaintiff sued out a <em>scire facias </em>against <em>Allen's </em>executor, reciting the action, the issue joined in <em>Allen's </em>lifetime, and his death pending the action in that stage, and requiring the executor to shew cause, if any he could, why the action should not be proceeded in to final judgment, according to the statute in such case made and provided.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The <em>scire facias </em>did not allege or suggest, that the goods had come to the possession of the executor, nor was there any declaration filed upon the <em>scire facias. </em>The <em>scire facias </em>having been served on the executor, he appeared, and the cause was once continued upon his motion. Without any new pleadings on either side, a jury was impannelled to try <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the issue joined (namely, the issue joined on the plea of <em>non detinet </em>put in by <em>Allen </em>in his lifetime, for there was none other), and the jury found that the defendant (that is, the executor of <em>Allen) </em>did detain the goods in the declaration mentioned, of the value of 300 dollars, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages for the detention to 135 dollars. Whereupon the court gave judgment, that the plaintiff should recover against <em>the defendant </em>the goods of the value of 300 dollars, if to be had, but if not, then the value thereof aforesaid, with his damages assessed as aforesaid, and his costs &amp;c. And it was noted, that the parties agreed that the jury might find a general verdict as to the value of the tools, and waved all objection as to the form of the verdict. <em>Allen's </em>executor applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment ; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-4\"><em>Allison, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-5\"><em>Claiborne, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\"> See 1 Rev.

Its object is to recover the identical property, which cannot be had from him who has it not. Hence the decision, that it will not lie against .the executor of a bailee who has destroyed or converted the chattel; Bull. Ni. Pri. 50. and that where there are three executors, one of whom only has the property in possession, it will lie against him only. In short, it is, an action given in respect to the supposed possession of the defendant, and therefore will not lie where he has never had it. In every aspect, in which we can look at the action, this result is apparent. For, taking the doctrine of <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>1 Wash. 308. as undeniable,\u2014 that <em>detinue </em>will lie against a party who has once had the possession, though he parted with it before the ema<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>nation of the writ, because he cannot deprive the owner an acti\u00b0n which he once had; yet this is because he may be distrained by his goods and lands, until he regains the chattel and delivers it over in obedience to the exigency of the writ. Such a process may, indeed, be appropriate against one who, having once had the possession, has fraudulently eloigned it before action brought; but it would be unreasonable that the lands and goods of the executor himself, who never had possession, should be distrained for the omission to surrender what he had not; and it would be most mischievous, if the whole estate of the testator in the hands of the executor, should be sequestered, to the prejudice of all the creditors, and without benefit to the plaintiff in <em>detinue; </em>since the issues and profits cannot be appropriated to him, but must go to the commonwealth. But where the executor himself has the possession, the judgment is against him for the property, and the process of <em>distringas </em>properly issues against him, not against the testator\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">On the first suggestion of the question, I was somewhat doubtful, whether the action of <em>detinue </em>(in which the testator might have waged his law, 3 Blacks. Comm. 152. 345.) would lie against an executor upon the detention of his testator. It seems, however, unquestionable that it does; and the declaration charges the finding or bailment and detention by the testator, and the subsequent possession and detention by the executor; and this last, as we have seen, is altogether essential. See Rastall\u2019s Entries 210. 7 Wentw. 647. 648. But still it does not lie unless the executor has possession. 1 Wms. Saund. 216. note 1. Bro. Abr. Detinue. 19. 8 Vin. Abr. Detinue. D. pl. 1.4. D. 5. pl. 19. B. 2. pl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">If then the action lies against the executor, it is susceptible of being revived under our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 38. But it is obvious, that the <em>scire facias </em>to revive must set forth, by way of suggestion at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>least, the material allegation, that the property had come to the hands of the executor since the testator\u2019s death-For otherwise, it does not appear that the action would have lain against the executor; and of course, it does not appear that <em>it was </em>susceptible of being revived against him. Where that is charged, the executor may plead <em>non detinet, </em>and if found for him the action is <em>barred; </em>but if found against him, the judgment must be for the thing, or its alternative value, against him personally, and for damages from the date of the detention by the testator, to the time of the verdict, to be recovered <em>de honis testatoris. </em>For though the profits since the testator\u2019s death have been received by the executor, yet by pursuing the original action, instead of commencing a new one against the executor for his detention alone, the plaintiff shews his election to consider him as taking the profits <em>qua </em>executor, and he must take his judgment accordingly. If, indeed, he prefers, I have no doubt he may sue the executor in <em>detinue, </em>and recover damages for <em>his </em>detention, out of his own proper goods; since it is his own fault that he has detained the property of another, and it is no justification for his doing so, that he found the property among his testator\u2019s <em>effects, and held it only as </em>executor. So too, if the property never came to the executor\u2019s hands, the owner is not without his remedy, but may have it either by action of <em>trover, </em>if it was converted by the testator, or by action for money had and received if he had received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Such, I apprehend, are the principles applicable to this matter. In this case, those principles are disregarded, and the errors are gross and palpable. There is but one issue, and that is upon the detention of the testator. To that issue the jury has not responded at all, but has found that the executor detained; which it was not sworn to try, which was not in issue, and which indeed was not even charged any where in the pleadings. Upon this verdict, too, there is a judgment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>damages against the executor <em>de bonis propriis, </em>though ^ is fairly presumable, that a part of them accrued during his testator\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"AZG\">. I am of opinion, that the judgment should be reversed, and the verdict, and all the proceedings up to the <em>scire facias, </em>set aside. That <em>scire facias, </em>being irreguiar and defective, may then either be quashed on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, and a new <em>scire facias </em>awarded; or he may file a declaration on the <em>scire facias, </em>containing the necessary suggestions; and if he fails to do either, this <em>scire facias </em>will be open to the demurrer of the defendant. And thus, in one or the other way, the case will be properly prepared for a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The other judges concurred. Judgment reversed &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
