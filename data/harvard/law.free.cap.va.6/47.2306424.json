And then the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel moved the court to set aside the verdict, and direct a. new trial, 1. because the verdict was contrary to the evidence, and 2. because of the supposed misdirection of the court, in its instruction to the jury. The court overruled this motion, and gave judgment for the defendants upon the verdict; from which the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AA0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Allison </em>and <em>Macfarland, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APN\">argued, !\u2022 that the obvious purpose of the letter of attorney given by <em>W. Sr E. Townes </em>to <em>James Townes, </em>was to ena- . . . ,. ~ , . ble him to raise money on their credit, tor his own accommodation, not exceeding 3000 dollars. It did not confine his authority to the making of a single note for that amount, and the renewal of that note; but authorized him to make any number of notes, provided they should not exceed, in the aggregate, 3000 dollars at any one time, and to make other notes for renewal of such notes, whatever number of them he should make. The authority conferred by the letter of attorney, was' unlimited in respect of time, or number of <em>notes, but only </em>limited as to the amount in the <em>aggregate; </em>and the limitation, that the amount should not exceed 3000 dollars \u201c at any one time,\u201d plainly evinced, that several notes might be made at several times. When the attorney made the note in question, negotiable' at bank, for the purpose of being negotiated there, and delivered it to the plaintiffs in ord\u00e9r that they might get it so negotiated, he acted within his authority; since it distinctly appeared, that the contents of this note, with those of others which had been discounted at bank, did not exceed, at the time, the sum of 3000 dollars. <em>Nor </em>was the authority less strictly complied with, if the note was made for the purpose of being negotiated at bank, and did not transcend the authority as to the amount, because the note was not actually discounted at bank; for, until the note was made and perfected by delivery, it could not have be\u00e9n negotiated at bank, nor could it have been known whether the bank would negotiate it or not. It could malee no difference, whether the attorney made a note, to be by himself offered for discount at the bank, to raise money for his own use, or made and delivered a note to another, in order that he might get it negotiated at bank, for the use and benefit of the attorney; for it was, in fact, applied to his use. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>liad a right to vary the form of the transaction, provided he kept substantially within his authority: he might have made this note, got it discounted at bank in &amp; . own name and for his own ase, and then immediately paid the money to <em>Hortons Sf Hutton; </em>and he meant to do exactly the same thing, in effect, when he gave the note to them, that they might get it discounted, to pay the debt he had contracted to them. The note was a valid security in their hands, the moment it was delivered to them; and as it could not be rendered more valid by being negotiated at bank, so neither could it be invalidated by the refusal of the bank to discount it. 2. Adverting to the facts proved by the attorney, that while the note was in the hands of the plaintiffs, be informed the defendants of the circumstances under which it was made, and by whom it was held, and they did not then object or complain that he had exceeded his authority, and that they afterwards procured from another person certain assurances to protect them from his acts under the letter of attorney, and the note in question was provided for,\u2014they contended, that this amounted to a ratification of the act of the attorney in making the note; and the court ought so to have instructed the jury. For a principal, informed of an act of an agent done under colour of his authority, must express his dissatisfaction within a reasonable time; the law inferred acquiescence and confirmation from his silence. <em>Cairnes &amp; Lord </em>v. <em>Bleecker, </em>12 Johns. 300. <em>Odiorne </em>v. <em>Maxcy, </em>13 Mass. Rep. 178. Here, the principals ratified the act, first, by acquiescing, after full knowledge of the circumstances ; and secondly, by negotiating with the attorney and procuring indemnity. And if this conduct was not, in law, tantamount to acquiescence and confirmation, the jury ought to have inferred from the facts proved, a complete ratification by the principals of the act of the attorney; and the court ought to have set aside the verdict as contrary to evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQ1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Spooner, </em>for the appellees, <em>1 </em>r</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1xQ\">complained of error com-r <em>. </em>. mitted against <em>them; </em>namely, in the judgment of the court sustaining the demurrer to the defendants\u2019 plea in ...... , , , <em>Z. </em>abatement to the jurisdiction. And then proceeding to examine the letter of attorney, he premised, that it conferred a special authority, which must be strictly pursued. It authorized the attorney to sign the defendants\u2019 names to any negotiable <em>note </em>or <em>paper, </em>not <em>notes </em>or <em>papers, </em>to the amout of 3000 dollars, for the purpose of getting the same discounted at bank, and to sign their names to any note, for the renewal of <em>such note, </em>not <em>notes: </em>it authorized him to bind them by a single note, and by subsequent notes for its renewal only: it authorized him to use the credit of their names to get an accommodation, to a limited amount, at <em>hanlc, </em>not to bind them for debts he should contract to <em>individuals. </em>The attorney did indorse their names on a negotiable note for the whole sum of 3000 dollars at once, and get it discounted at bank, and then indorsed their names on other notes for the renewal of that note; and in so doing, he fully executed and exhausted his power. The letter of attorney was then <em>functus oficio; </em>the attorney had no authority to make or indorse any new note, and get it discounted at <em>lanlc; </em>much less to malee a new note, and pass it to <em>individuals, </em>to be binding on his principals, whether discounted at bank or not. He cited <em>Fenn </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>3 T. R. 757. 4 T. R. 177. <em>Attwood </em>v. <em>Mun</em>nings, 7 Barn. &amp; Cres. 278. <em>Withington </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>5 Bing. 492. 14 Eng. C. L. R. 42. 15 Id. 492. 501. to shew the difference between general and special powers confided to agents. As to the circumstances relied on, as a confirmation of the act of the attorney in making the note in question, he said, nothing could be more vague than the evidence on that point. The date of the conversation was not given; it might have been after the note was protested, nay, after this action was brought, when the silence of the defendants could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>possibly bo mistaken for acquiescence. Neither did it ... . appear, that these circumstances were ever commumcated to the holders of the note, so as to induce them _ P to forego any measures lor securing the debt due them, from, the real debtor who contracted it. The court proporly left it to the jury as a question of inference of fact, from the facts in proof, and the jury Jbund that there was no confirmation. The indemnity which the defendants are said to have obtained, was a mere measure of precaution, and one that could never be of any avail, unless it should be adjudged, that the letter of attorney authorized the agent to bind them by this note.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b64-5\"> The statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. <em>\u00a7 </em>33. p. 496. provides, that \u201c no plea in abatement shall be admitted or received, unless the party offering the same <em>shall prove the truth thereof </em>by oath or affirmation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\"> There was a remarkable incongruity in the dates of the letter of attorney, and of <em>the </em>promissory note alleged to have been made by virtue of its authority, as those documents were copied in the record. The letter of attorney bore date the 24th November 1829. The promissory note made by the attorney, bore date more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>two years previous; namely, the 5th October 1827. But the counsel for both parties agreed, that this was a mistake made in copying the papers in the record, and that in truth, the letter of attorney was executed before the note was <em>made; </em>and wished the court to decide the cause as if there was no such incongruity in the dates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-9\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVT\">I think it very clear, that the letter of attorney conferred no other authority than that of subscribing the names of the defendants, either as makers or indorsers, to any negotiable note or paper, for the purpose of getting the same discounted at either of the banks specified in the letter, and when the same note or paper should come to maturity, of renewing the same <em>to ties quoties, </em>so that the defendants were not to be bound at any one and the same time for a greater sum than 3000 dollars. The power to have the note or paper discounted at either of the banks, repudiates the idea of having notes negotiated at all of the banks, or at more than one bank at the same time, whilst the renew-ability of the note, manifests the intention of the principals to be, that the accommodation was to be granted to the attorney by a bank, and not by individuals. To allow the attorney to make purchases from individuals, would place his conduct beyond the control of the principals, and thereby endanger their safety. The construction given to the power by the circuit court, seems to me to have been perfectly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Another question has been supposed to arise as to the subsequent ratification of the agent\u2019s act by the principal, and whether the court erred in not granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>plaintiffs a new trial. The court left it to the jury to decide, from the evidence, whether the defendants, after they were apprised that' the note in controversy was . <em>11 </em>, \u2022 made for the purpose of paying, or securing the pay-menh for groceries purchased by <em>James Townes </em>from the plaintiffs, ratified the contract ? No objection has been made to this course: the jury found that there was no subsequent ratification; and then the plaintiffs moved for a new trial, which the court refused. Was there error in this ? The bill of exceptions exhibits a summary of the evidence. It states, that the said <em>James Townes </em>the attorney, at a later period, and whilst the note was in possession of the plaintiffs, informed the defendants of the circumstances under which it was made, and by whom it was held; that the defendants made no objection, and did not complain that the attorney had exceeded his authority; that the defendants afterwards procured <em>Joseph Townes </em>to make certain assurances to protect them from the acts done by <em>James </em>under the letter of attorney, and that the note was so provided for. There was no evidence of any assent given, or any actual ratification of the act of the attorney, by the principals-, but the ratification is inferred from their silence. That is too equivocal a circumstance from which to form such a conclusion; and the subsequent conduct of the defendants in standing a suit, shews that they did not understand their failure to object as an actual ratification. The defendants, it is stated, afterwards procured <em>Joseph Townes </em>to make certain assurances. What those assurances were, is not stated; but whatever they might have been, they were only intended to protect the defendants themselves from the acts of their attorney. Then it is said, \u201c the note was so provided for.\u201d How was it provided for ? This does not appear. It would be a strained inference to say, that it was provided for by the defendants acknowledging that they were bound for its payment, or would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>pay it. If such ha.d been the fact, it would have been . ' . T . . . . easy <em>to </em>have so stated it. I am oi opinion, that the evidence set out in the bill of exceptions is too vague . . , , and unsatisfactory to authorize the court to say that the jury erred in the verdict which it rendered. I am therefore for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<author id=\"b73-9\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Azy\">I a,m of opinion, that the construction given by the circuit court, of the power of attorney, was clearly the true one. It certainly did not authorize <em>James Townes </em>to make the note in question, in the name of the defendants, to pay or secure the payment for groceries purchased by him of the plaintiffs. Indeed, I incline to think, that it authorized the drawing but one original note for 3000 dollars, and the renewing that note from time to time, suffering it at no time to rise above the sum of 3000 dollars: and this note of 3000 dollars, having been drawn and discounted, I think the power was <em>functus </em>oficio, so far as related to drawing original notes <em>under it. I </em>think the instruction of the judge, leaving to the jury the fact of subsequent ratification, was also proper; and that the new trial was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Cabell and Bkooke, <em>J, </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b73-11\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AqN\">I am of opinion, that the judgment is right upon the merits. But the appellees\u2019 counsel, fearing the result of the argument as to the construction of the letter of attorney, complained of error in the judgment of the court on the demurrer to the defendants\u2019 plea in abatement to the jurisdiction. If judgment should, have been given for the defendants on the demurrer to that plea, it could only have been a judgment in abatement, instead of a judgment in bar of the demand, so that this judgment would, in that aspect, be reversed, and the appellant would have his costs. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>am of opinion, however, that the plea in abatement was bad, and was properly overruled. The utmost strictness is required in these pleas, and a general demurrer to one of them, has all the effect of a special demurrer. Now, this plea is vicious, 1. because it was pleaded by attorney, instead of in person; 1 Chitt. Plead. 412. 2 Wms. Saund. 209. b. c. 2ndly, Because it ought to conclude with a prayer <em>si curia cognoscere velit, </em>or <em>respondere non debet, </em>and not <em>quod billa cassetur; </em>1 Chitt. Plead. 427. 450. 2 Wms. Saund. 209. d. 3rdly, I <em>incline </em>to think it defective in not giving the plaintiff a better writ, by shewing the defendants\u2019 residence, though it is generally true, that in a plea to the jurisdiction of courts of limited jurisdiction, it is only necessary to shew that they ought not to taire cognizance of the cause. 6 East. 600. For it may be, that the defendants\u2019 residence may be unknown to the plaintiff, who should not be turned out of court without the necessary information to enable him to commence his action effectually. Upon the whole, I am satisfied the plea was properly overruled, and a <em>respondeas ouster </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">The merits of the case depends upon the construction of the power of attorney; and upon the questions, 1. whether the agent transcended his authority? and 2. whether there has been any subsequent confirmation of the unauthorized act? I concur in the position taken at the bar, that powers of attorney, of this description at least, ought to be construed strictly. It was not a power for the benefit of the maker, but an authority given to the attorney, to draw and subscribe a note for his own accommodation and advantage. Whoever dealt with him under that power, must have been conscious, that he could not bind his principal beyond the express letter of his instructions. It would be strange, indeed, if it were otherwise; if the engagement of one to lend his name and credit to another in a specified manner, or to a specified extent, should be enlarged to embrace en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>gagements of a different character, upon the pretence 00 ini that they were not more onerous or more hazardous than those which were authorized. That is a matter of which the principal alone had a right to judge. Neither the attorney nor the plaintiffs in this case, have a right to say, that the contract made with them, does not expose the principals to more hazard than the execution of a note according to the express terms of the power. Nor has this court the power to make, or to sustain, a contract for the party, which he did not authorize. The question then is, whether this note is within the authority given to the attorney? The power given is, to subscribe the principals\u2019 names to a negotiable note, for the purpose of getting it discounted at one of several banks which are specified. The note executed was for the amount of a bill for groceries; it was payable to <em>Rutland, </em>and indorsed by the plaintiffs, that they might get it discounted at the <em>U. S. Bank </em>at <em>Fayetteville, </em>where it was made negotiable and payable, but where it never was discounted. The authority was to execute a note for the purpose of raising money; the note executed was not of purpose to raise money for the agent <em>James Townes, </em>but to pay a debt contracted at that time with the plaintiffs <em>for </em>groceries, with an agreement that if it could not be discounted, the plaintiffs were to hold the note as their own property, and as a note binding on the defendants, according to the usual effect of such notes. Thus, the defendants, who had only authorized themselves to be made debtors to one of the banks, are made debtors to an individual. Here, it must be confessed, is a clear and obvious difference in form, between the authority given and the contract made, l's there no difference in substance? Very great, 1 apprehend. Had the note been discounted by either of the specified banks, a renewal might reasonably have been expected at the expiration of the note. The power itself shews, that these renewals were contemplated : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the principals, may, very fairly, have calculated upon them, and may thus have anticipated a long credit for the amount for which they became responsible. But by this note, as it was not discounted, they would become bound to pay, at the end of ninety days, the amount of the note. And upon the like principle, the whole 3000 dollars might have been thrown upon them at the end of sixty days, if the agent had borrowed money, or paid debts to that amount, due to an individual. There was, therefore, much reason for specifying, that the names of the principals should be used in raising money by discount at the banks, from which, after a credit once given, a renewed credit might have been reasonably expected; whereas a note executed to an individual, must have been paid at maturity. If an authority to draw at six months, is violated by a draft at sixty days, it may with equal propriety be affirmed, that an authority to get a note discounted on accommodation at bank, is violated by obtaining a loan from, or giving a note to, an individual for goods purchased of him. Without, therefore, considering whether after having once borrowed the 3000 dollars and repaid it in part, the agent had a right again to enlarge the debt (which, to say the least, I think very <em>doubtful) I </em>am very clearly of opinion, that the note, in this case, was not within the scope of the authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">We come next to inquire as to the confirmation of the agent\u2019s act by the subsequent conduct of the defendants. The judge, very properly, left this matter to the jury, but as all the evidence in the cause is certified, and a new trial was moved for, it still recurs for examination. It is certainly true, as contended at the bar, that the subsequent assent of the principal will ratify even an unauthorized act of an agent, and that acquiescence, after notice, may be evidence of that assent. See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>6 Mod. 36. and the other cases cited 4 Bac. Abr. Master and Servant. K. p. 586. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>And this is particularly true, where a loss may accrue from a delay on the part of the principal to disavow the agency; or where the transaction may turn out a profit ,. . <em>J -, </em>. . , r.. or loss, according to circumstances, and it is therefore unreasonable in the principal, by delaying his election to be bound or discharged, to secure to himself the profit, or avoid the loss, according to the event. <em>Prince </em>v. Clark, 1 Barn. &amp; Cress. 186. 8 Eng. C. L. R. 54. In this case, however, there was nothing of the kind. The transaction was one from which the defendants could derive no profit. Loss was inevitable if they were bound; and as there was no necessity, for the safety of the plaintiffs, to communicate their dissent to the act, I do not think their silence, or their seeking indemnity against possible liability (and that too from a third person), ought to have been considered as such conclusive evidence of their assent, as to justify the court in setting aside the verdict as contrary to evidence. The judgment therefore should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
