The <em>second </em>count alleged, that the plaintiff bargained with the defendant to purchase the negro boy of him, whom the defendant represented to be his absolute slave, for the price of 300 dollars, and the defendant by so representing the negro boy to be his absolute slave, sold him to the plaintiff for 300 dollars, which the plaintiff paid the defendant; whereas, in truth, the negro boy, at the time of the defendant\u2019s sale thereof to the plaintiff, was not the absolute ' slave of the defendant, but was entitled to his freedom when he should attain to a certain age (without alleging that the defend ant\u2019s representation was false or fraudulent); by means whereof the defendant did great damage to the plaintiff, and the negro boy became of no use and value to him, and he was in the end deprived of all property in him, and put to great expense in maintaining him, and also by reason of his claim and right to freedom.

Dear sir, In pursuance of my promise to <em>W. </em>when I saw him, I wrote to the clerk of <em>Rockingham, </em>county court, and obtained a copy of the deed of emancipation, by virtue of which <em>Ed</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>mond </em>claims his freedom, but did not receive it in time t0 write to you as early as was expected. I find by the copy which I have received, that a boy by the name of <em>Edmond </em>was emancipated by <em>James Smith, to take </em>effect in March 1823; which I suppose to be the boy sold to you. As to any defect in the title, at the time I sold to you, or until I was informed by your son, I had no knowledge. However, I wish to do what is just and right in the business, and upon amicable terms. Upon the most mature reflection which I can bestow upon the subject, I have come to the conclusion, that the purchase money is all that is fairly and justly due; or that you will be entitled to the purchase money with interest, allowing me a reasonable hire for the boy. The latter proposition I conceive to be the most advantageous to me, yet I am willing to agree to either; and, should it meet your approbation, will pay the amount in the course of this fall, so soon as I make sale of my cattle. I should be glad to hear from you, and know your determination, as soon as convenient. I shall be very much from home until the middle of'September.\u201d (Signed) <em>\u201cJ. Brown </em>junior.\"\u20142. \u201cWarm Springs, October 30. 1823. Sir, On my return home a few days ago, your letter of-was handed to me, directed to my father and myself, relative to the boy <em>Edmond; </em>and I had previous to my setting out to the chancery court, prepared a letter for you, intended to be put in the mail at this place, in which I had fully stated my views on the subject of difference between your father and us. I hastily drop you a few lines, to inform you, that either of the gentlemen proposed in your letter, are entirely satisfactory to me. <em>Mr. Peyton </em>and <em>Mr. Crawford </em>will be at our November- court, at which time and place the business can be adjusted; it will not suit me to meet you or them at <em>Staunton.\" </em>(Signed) <em>u J. Brown junior.\" </em>The defendant objected to the reading of these letters as evidence to the jury, because the parties were at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>in treaty for a compromise, no suit having been then brought, as was apparent on the face of the letters, and the letters contained propositions for a compromise which had proved ineffectual. But the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence; to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-4\">II. The <em>second </em>bill of exceptions stated, that the plaintiff offered in evidence, the record of a suit in <em>forma pauperis, </em>brought by a, negro boy, <em>'Edmond, </em>against the plaintiff, to recover his freedom, in the county court of <em>Rockingham ; </em>to which action the plaintiff appeared, and pleaded; and the result was, that <em>Edmond </em>was found by the jury, and adjudged by the court, to be free. This judgment was rendered in October 1824. It was admitted, that the plaintiff resided in <em>Rockbridge, </em>not in <em>Rockingham </em>where the pauper suit was brought; that the negro boy absconded from the plaintiff\u2019s service in <em>Rockbridge, </em>and went to <em>Rockingham, </em>the place of his birth, where the deed of emancipation containing the evidence of his title to freedom was recorded, and where the witnesses who could prove his identity resided; that being at large in <em>Rockingham, </em>he asked and obtained leave of the county court of that county, to bring suit there for his freedom; and that the plaintiff voluntarily entered his appearance as defendant in that suit, and submitted to the jurisdiction of that court. The plaintiff rolled on the first of the defendant\u2019s letters set out in the first bill of exceptions, to prove that he had notice of the pauper suit, while it was pending, though the suit was brought after the date of the letters. The defendant objected to the admission of the record of the pauper suit as evidence in this action; but the court overruled the objection; to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">III. The <em>third </em>bill of exceptions stated, that it appeared, that a bill of sale of the negro boy in question to the plaintiff, was executed by the defendant <em>J. Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>junior </em>and <em>J. Brown senior, </em>and sealed by them, containing a warranty of the title of the boy as an absolute slave. And there being this sealed contract of the sale of the negro boy to the plaintiff, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff could not maintain this action; that he could not maintain it on the first count in the declaration, because the written contract varied from the contract therein set forth; that he could not maintain it on the second count, because the parol contract therein set forth, was merged in the written sealed contract of sale; and that the second count was faulty, and ought to be wholly disregarded,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> because the buyer of a slave, whatever may be the defects of the property or the title, could only recover from the vendor upon a warranty, or upon the ground of fraud, and the second count alleged neither. But, the bill of sale having been offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and excluded by the court at the defendant\u2019s instance, the court refused to give the instructions prayed; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-4\">IY. The defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that if it should find for the plaintiff, upon the <em>second </em>count in the declaration, the proper measure of damages would be the purchase money of the slave with interest, not the value at the time the slave recovered his <em>freedom; </em>which instruction the court refused to give, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant on the <em>first </em>count of the declaration, and for the plaintiff on the <em>second </em>count, and assessed his damages to <em>565 </em>dollars; for which the court gave the plaintiff judgment. The defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant. <em>\u00b0</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AfDz\">T ,. . \u201e <em>Johnson, </em>tor the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> The statute 1 Rev.

The action brought was an action in <em>case. </em>The <em>first </em>count was on the deceit in the sale; the <em>second </em>count was obviously intended <em>to </em>be on the warranty of title. The parol contract of the sale, was clearly merged in the contract under seal, if the sale charged in the <em>second </em>count was the same with that evidenced by the bill of sale. Although the bill <em>of exceptions is </em>badly drawn, yet I think it appears, clearly enough, that the subject of sale was the same. The plaintiff had offered the bill of sale in evidence to support his action; thereby affirming, that although the bill of sale conveying the negro boy to the plaintiff, was executed by two persons, namely <em>J. Brown junior, </em>and <em>J. Brown senior, </em>yet it evidenced the same contract set forth by him in his declaration. The defendant properly objected to its going in evidence to the jury, to support the action on the case, and the court properly rejected it; but the deed being before the court, <em>the defendant </em>then said to the court, that as the plaintiff held his covenant, whereby he bound himself (with another) to defend the title to the slave which he had sold him, this action on the case cannot be supported; and therefore, he moved the court so to decide. This is the substance of the bill of exceptions; and as it is clear that an action of covenant ought to have been brought, I am of opinion, that the judgment is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">I am also of opinion, that the <em>second </em>count is a faulty one, and that the court erred in not instructing the jury to disregard it. Although in an action on a warranty of title to a chattel, it is sufficient proof of the warranty, that the vendor affirmed it to be his, and the action lies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>on such affirmation, 3 Stark. Law Ev. part 4. p. 1661. <em>Medina </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>1 Salk. 210. yet if the plaintiff does not choose to resort to the appropriate remedy for breach of <em>contract, </em>but sues as for a <em>tort, </em>his count must conform to the nature of the action. Here, the <em>first </em>count is in <em>case </em>for a deceit: the <em>second </em>is certainly not in <em>assumpsit, </em>but in <em>case </em>on the warranty, and in that view is defective. It should have charged, that the defendant, by falsely and fraudulently warranting the slave to be his absolute property, sold him to the plaintiff. The <em>wrong </em>consists in the <em>false </em>warranty; which, therefore, is of the very essence of the charge. 1 Chitt. Plead. 139. 2 Id. 276. <em>Stuart </em>v. Wilkins, 1 Doug. 18. 21. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>2 East 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On the question, whether the letters set forth in the first bill of exception were admissible, though I have some doubt, the strong inclination of my mind is, that' they are legal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">But I am for reversing the judgment, for the errors I have mentioned. And as the verdict is for the defendant on the good count, and as the <em>second </em>count ought to have been disregarded as defective, a judgment should now be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b462-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AWZG\">The appellee sued the appellant <em>in case, </em>for selling him a negro boy as a slave for life, who was only bound to servitude for a limited term. The <em>first </em>count in the declaration, is for fraud and deceit in the representation and sale, averring the <em>scienter ; </em>the <em>second, </em>for selling the negro boy as an absolute slave, and so representing him, when in truth he had only a limited time to serve, without a further charge of deceit. The points for our consideration, arose from motions to the court, at the trial, for instructions to the jury, and for excluding evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The plaintiff offered to the jury two letters, writt\u00e9n by the defendant, who objected to their going to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>jury, because they were written with a view to a compromise, and that failing, they could not be used to the prejudice of the parly; but the court admitted the letters. As this is a point of some interest in the doctrine of evidence, I have looked a little into the books with respect to it. In <em>Buller\u2019s </em>Ni. Pri. 236. it is said\u2014An admission of a debt, if satisfactorily proved, is the strongest evidence. But an offer to pay money by way of compromise, is not evidence of a debt. The reasons often assigned for it by lord <em>Mansfield </em>were, that it must be permitted to men \u201c to buy their peace,\u201d without prejudice to them if the offer did not succeed; and such offers are made to stop litigation, without regard to the question whether any thing, or what is due. If.the terms <em>huy their peace </em>are attended to, they will resolve all doubts on this head of evidence: But for an example, I will add one case. If A. sue B. for <em>\u00a3 </em>100. and B. offer to pay him <em>\u00a3 </em>20. it will not be received in evidence ; for this neither admits nor ascertains any debt, and is no more than saying he would give \u00bf\u00a320. to get rid of the action. But if an account consists of ten articles, and B. admits that a particular one is due, it is good evidence for so much. This is a clear and concise view of the point, separating an offer to make a sacrifice or concession for the sake of peace, from the admission of a fact, though made under the same circumstances. Several cases establish the same distinction. Thus, in <em>Waldridge </em>v. <em>Kennison, </em>1 Esp. Ca. 143. the only evidence to prove the handwriting of a defendant to a bill of exchange, was his admission made, in the course of a treaty for a compromise; and <em>Garrow </em>objected to it as evidence on that <em>ground; </em>but lord <em>Kenyon, </em>while he fully admitted the rule, said, that it did not extend to a distinct fact like this. So, in <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>3 Esp. Ca. 113. lord <em>Kenyon, </em>on the same point, said, \u201c I have often given my opinion on this subject. Evidence of concessions made for the purpose of set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tling matters in dispute, I shall never admit; but <em>facts </em>admitted <em>before </em>arbitrators (as this case was), I always will.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Austen, 2 </em>Dowl. &amp; Ryl. 358. 16 Eng. C. L. R. 94. <em>assumpsit </em>for goods sold and delivered, and the general issue pleaded with notice of set-off; the plaintiff having proved a <em>prima facie </em>case of demand on the defendant for goods sold to him to the amount of <em>\u00a3 </em>630. a clerk of defendant\u2019s attorney was called for the purpose of shewing, that in an interview between the clerk and the plaintiff the latter had said, \u201c he was so anxious to get out of law, that he would refer the question in dispute to the witness as an arbitrator,\u201d and this being declined, added, \u201c he had received <em>\u00a3 </em>800. on \u2022the defendant\u2019s account, which he meantto set off against some bad debts owing to him from some other persons but as the witness admitted, that he was desired to communicate to the defendant what the plaintiff had said on this occasion, for the purpose of inducing the defendant to agree to a compromise, it was objected for the plaintiff, that the evidence could not be received, and the judge at <em>nisi prius </em>rejected it. A rule was obtained to shew cause why a new trial should not be granted, on the ground that the evidence had been improperly rejected ; and the court was unanimous in granting the new trial. <em>Bayley, </em>J. said, \u201c It appears to me, that the evidence rejected was not of that nature, which would bring it within the rule on which the objection is founded. The conversation does not seem to have originated in any desire to compromise the dispute between the parties. The essence of an offer to compromise, is, that the party making that offer, is willing to submit to a sacrifice, and to make a concession; but I see no sign of any such inclination expressed, by the plaintiff <em>in </em>the conversation in question.\u201d <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Small, 1 </em>Mood. &amp; Malk. 444. <em>22 </em>Eng. C. L. R. 355. <em>assumpsit </em>on a charter party: there was some difficulty in fixing defendants with the contract; but it appeared, that after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>action was brought, a specific sum had been offered; and evidence was given on the part of the plaintiffs, that a friend of theirs, in consequence, went to the dofendants and advised them to increase their offer, and that defendants refused to do so, saying \u201c we shall lose enough by the charter-party as it is.\u201d The witness stated that nothing had been said about this communication being without prejudice. The attorney general objected, that the evidence was inadmissible, because, from the very nature of the transaction, it appears to have been a negotiation for a compromise. Lord <em>Tenter den </em>however admitted it, and said, \u201che thought it good <em>prima facie </em>evidence of liability. It is not said to be without prejudice, and an offer to compromise may be very well made, without any restriction as to confidence.\u201d There are some american authorities to the same effect. In the <em>Harford Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Granger, </em>4 Conn. Rep. 148. <em>Homer, </em>C. J. delivering the opinion of the court, says,\u2014\u201c The law on this subject has been often misconceived; and it is time that it should be finally established. It is never the intendment of the law to shut out the truth, but to repel any inference which may arise from a proposition made, not with a design to admit the existence of a fact, but merely to buy one\u2019s peace. If an admission however is made, because it is a fact, the evidence to prove it is competent, whatever motive may have prompted the declaration. If A. offer to B. <em>\u00a3 10. </em>in satisfaction of his claim of <em>\u00a3 </em>100. merely to prevent a suit or purchase tranquillity, this implies no admission that any sum is due, and therefore testimony to prove the fact, must be rejected, because it evinces nothing concerning the merits of the controversy. But if A. admits a particular item in an account, or any other fact, meaning to make the admission as being true, this is good evidence, although the object of the conversation was to compromise an existing controversy.\u201d In <em>Fuller v. Hampton, 5 </em>Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Rep. 426. the same law is laid down. In <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>2 Pick. Rep. 290. <em>Parker, </em>C. J. delivering the opinion 0f the court, says, \u201c It does not appear from the authorities,.that where parties are treating about a compromise, admissions of particular facts are not to be received in evidence. The general proposition stated in the books is, that an offer to pay money, by way of compromise, to get rid of an action, is not evidence of a debt. If the object be to buy peace, it is plain, such an offer carries with <em>it </em>no evidence of the justice of the demand; and it would have a tendency to prevent amicable adjustments if such offers were to be used against the party making them. But the admission of particular items of account, or the confession of particular facts, independent of an offer to pay, does not bear the same character.\u201d In <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>Sweetser, </em>4 Pick. Rep. 376. the rule is laid down with the same force and clearness, by the same chief justice. In our own court, this doctrine has been very little canvassed. I find but two cases where it is touched, <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>1 Call 18. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Price, </em>5 Munf. 507. 538. and there, the general rule is simply announced, without laying down its extent or modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"ATE\">Then, look at the letter of the 6th August 1823\u2014for no question can arise except on that letter; the second letter contains neither proposition, concession nor admission. To my apprehension, that letter does not come within the rule of'exclusion, according to the authorities cited. There was no treaty for a compromise on foot; the letter asked for none ;' proposed no meeting, no arbitrators ; offered no purchase of peace. <em>Butter </em>says, if the terms \u201c buy their peace\u201d be attended to, they will resolve all doubts on this head of evidence; and <em>Bayleij, </em>J. says, that \u201cthe essence of an oiler to compromise, is, that the party making it, is willing to submit to a sacrifice, and to make a concession.\u201d There is no such thing in this letter. The spirit it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>breathes is wholly different. <em>Brown, </em>having satisfied himself by an inspection of the deed, that the boy <em>Edmond </em>was in all probability the boy therein set free, avers his ignorance o\u00ed\u2019 that fact when he sold him, and his wish to do what is just and right, on amicable terms ; and proceeds to give his view of that subject. He thinks that the purchase money is all that is justly due, or interest on it and hires to him,\u2014and either of these, he is willing to agree to. Is there any sacrifice offered here ? any concession ? any thing to buy peace ? Nothing like it; he is willing to do what is just and right, and this he offers; he contemplates no arbitration, no third persons to settle the controversy; for, after stating that he is <em>willing </em>to pay the purchase money alone, or with interest, he being allowed hires, and will pay in the fall, if either alternative meets the vendee\u2019s approbation, he asks to hear his <em>determination </em>as soon as convenient. I do not think then that this letter was either written upon a pending treaty for a compromise, or was meant to propose a compromise, or to state terms to which the writer would submit, or sacrifices or concessions which he was willing to make, \u201cto buy his peace.\u201d But if this were the case, we have seen still, that the distinct facts stated would be evidence. Thus, the writer states as facts that he had seen the deed of emancipation <em>\u2022, </em>that he had sold the boy to the vendee as a slave; his belief that he was entitled to freedom, and his utter ignorance of these things when he sold. Surely, these admissions, according to all the cases, may go to the jury. The rest of the letter is mere opinion, as to the terms on which the matter should be adjusted. I think then that the circuit court was right in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">As to the other points, I will say but a word. I think the <em>Rockingham </em>record was admissible ; and that is all the circuit court decided. I do not think the court wrong in refusing the third instruction, when we look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>at the manner in which it was asked. Nor do I think it erred in refusing to instrust the jury, that the purchase money with interest was the true measure of recovery on the <em>second </em>count. But I think it did err, in refusing to instruct the jury to disregard the <em>second </em>count as faulty. I am, therefore, for reversing the judgment; and as the verdict upon the only good count, is for the defendant, we ought to enter judgment for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b468-5\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aui\">The verdict is for the plaintiff on the bad count, and for the defendant on the good count. Therefore, judgment should have been given for the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b468-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AAl\">I am of opinion, upon mature reflection, that the letter first mentioned in the first bil\u00ed of exceptions, was not admissible evidence. It is obvious, that it was introduced merely to establish the promise to pay, from which an admission of liability was to be inferred. There is no other admission in the letter. It states, that <em>Brown </em>had received the deed of emancipation, by virtue of which <em>Edmond </em>claimed his freedom, and that it contained a clause of emancipation of a boy, which he <em>supposed </em>to be the boy sold. It disavows a knowledge of the boy\u2019s right to freedom at the time of sale, and sets forth two principles, on one or other of which the matter should be adjusted. There is not one word of this, from which the plaintiff could have drawn any admission or inference : the fact of emancipation depended upon the <em>deed, </em>and was established by the suit <em>in forma </em>pauperis: the identity of the boy is not admitted, though the writer <em>supposes </em>him to <em>be </em>the same, and the terms of liability rest upon legal principles, and not on the party\u2019s admission. The letters, then, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>only have been introduced to prove this offer to pay, as an admission of liability. They contain no acknowledgment of any one fact, and are not therefore within the authorities. It is said, indeed, that they were proof of notice to the defendant, and they were relied on for that purpose, in order to give conclusiveness to the record of the judgment in the suit for freedom: but this cannot be; for they are dated near twelve months before the first proceedings in that sttit, and they do not indicate that <em>Brown </em>had received any intimation where <em>Shields </em>would be sued, a,nd in point of fact he was sued in a county distant from his residence. Not contesting, then, the principles or authorities quoted and relied on by my brother <em>Carr, </em>I differ from him as to their applicability to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">Let us then see, whether this letter was proper evidence to prove a promise of payment, with a view to establish an admission of liability. The law is very clear, that an offer to pay money, by way of compromise to get rid of an action, is not evidence. 1 Call 23. 5 Munf. 538. 1 Phil. Law Ev. 83.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An admission made for the purpose of buying peace, is not evidence, since the offer may have resulted not from a consciousness of the truth of the claim, but from a desire to avoid litigation; and therefore, where it appears to be probable, that such was the motive, the evidence is not admissible. 2 Stark. Law Ev. part 4. p. 38. Now, in this case, it is evident, that <em>Brown </em>contemplated a demand on him by <em>Shields. </em>He must also have been conscious, that he might be made responsible for the boy <em>Edmond, </em>though he had been ignorant of his right to freedom, and though he had not expressly warranted him (for we cannot look to the covenant to warrant, it being out of the case;) yet it was possible he might get clear. For if he had known of <em>Edmond's </em>right to freedom, and had not warranted him, and if <em>Shields </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>should not have proof that he represented him to be a slave for life, he would get clear'. If, however, he was made liable, he might, for aught he knew, be made liable for principal and interest, without an allowance of the hires as a set-off; or he might be made liable for an increased value of the slave. This is the point,\u2014 this is the very object,\u2014of his letter. Whether he be liable or not, he is willing to acknowledge himself so, provided he can get clear of interest, or can be allowed hires. The promise to pay was thus distinctly made with a view to the proposition, that <em>Shields </em>should receive principal without interest, or set off hires against the interest. The proposition was not accepted. Why ? Because <em>Shields </em>chose to go <em>for </em>the whole, <em>to </em>which, by the way, he has no just title, for <em>Brown\u2019\u2019s </em>proposal seems to me both fair and legal. <em>Shields, </em>then, having rejected the proposal, cannot avail himself of it as evidence. It was no evidence, that <em>Brown </em>knew he was liable, for though he might, in his conscience, have been satisfied that he was not liable, he probably knew so well the uncertainty of litigation, as to give up the chance of getting complete justice, for the certainty of diminishing the inordinate demands that might be set up against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">As to the other bills of exceptions, I shall say little. The record from <em>Rockingham </em>was, I think, admissible evidence of the fact of the recovery of freedom by the slave; and it would have been evidence also of his title to freedom, if accompanied by proof that <em>Brown </em>had notice of the pendency of the action, so as to have been able to come in and defend it. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Britts, </em>3 Camp. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As to the third bill of exceptions, if it had been distinctly shewn, that the covenant to warrant set forth therein, was entered into upon the sale of the slave, I should have had no doubt, that an action could not have been maintained on an implied warranty; nor do I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>it would have lain for a deceit,-\u2014for where there is a warranty, the vendor relies upon the warranty, and is not deceived by the representation, upon which it is obvious he does not rely. Moreover, here was a warranty by two, who contracted to be jointly charged for failure of title. The action of deceit against one, not only puts the burden on his shoulders alone, but places it there irrevocably; ibr if he be a tortfeasor, he cannot have contribution from the other. I have no doubt, therefore, that the action should have been on the covenant; but the bill of exceptions is so inartificially drawn, that we cannot say the court erred in refusing the instruction asked for, in relation to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">It did err, however, in refusing to direct the jury to <em>disregard </em>the faulty count. The first count being in <em>tort, </em>we must take the second to be in <em>tort </em>also, unless it is plainly in <em>assumpsit; </em>otherwise, we should make the whole declaration bad by a misjoinder of counts. 1 Chitt. Plead. 196-199. But this count has no trace of <em>assumpsit </em>about it. There is no <em>assumpsit </em>or promise laid, and it corresponds not at all with the form of declaring in <em>assumpsit </em>upon a representation; <em>2 </em>Id. 139. And as a count for <em>deceit, </em>it is clearly defective, since there is no fraud charged. A representation, without <em>a scienter, </em>with an allegation \u201cthat in truth the slave was entitled to freedom,\u201d though it might have been the foundation of an <em>assumpsit, </em>if laid, certainly does not prove a <em>deceit. </em>The count then was bad; a,nd the court having refused the instruction, and the verdict having been founded on this count, it must be set aside. I have no doubt the scheme of the declaration was, to declare in one count upon the fraud, but lest they should fail in proof of that, to have another count not charging a fraud. The result has proved, that the fraud could not be established, for the jury have found upon this count, and refused to find on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"AOBO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>As to the last bill of exceptions, the court was right in refusing the instruction. I shall not attempt to lay down a rule as to the measure of damages in actions upon warranties of personalty. It is a subject of much difficulty, and it is better that its principles should be settled in detail, as cases present themselves; Suffice it to say, that the purchase money at the time of the sale, with interest, was not in this case necessarily the measure of damages. The defendant was certainly entitled to a set-off of hires against interest, if the value at the time of the sale with interest was adopted by the jury as the measure. But, in truth, in these cases, there can, I think, be no general rule laid down. To give the purchase money with interest for a slave of great value at the time of the sale, who by disease or accident has become worthless before eviction, would be injustice to the vendor; and the same measure might be unjust to the buyer, who has purchased a slave when a child, for a small sum, and has lost him after having made him a valuable mechanic. I shall not, therefore, attempt to lay down any rule, as the case does not demand it, and as it will be found, most probably, that every case of the kind will depend upon its own particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Upon the whole, therefore, it is clear that judgment ought not to have been rendered for the plaintiff, and it must therefore be reversed. What is then to be done ? The jury having expressly found for the defendant upon the only <em>good count, </em>and no error appearing to the prejudice of the plaintiff, the judgment must be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Judgment reversed, and judgment entered for appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ANDD\">New York edition of <em>1820.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
