The first statement ought to have been preferred, for the reasons given by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-10\">The plaintiff' was not bound to go into a Court of law, in the first place; for Equity has concarrent jurisdiction in the administratiOn of legal assets. The origin of this jurisdiction is not material, if it be established by precedents;.-but it's origin will show that the creditor is let into the Court of Chaiwery in the first instance. The practice, originally, was to file a Bill for discover~j only, of assets; but,, as that could not be had without an acconnt, the Court proceeded to direct the account; and, (to prevent multiplicity of suits,) went on to make a complete decree, giving the party his debt likewise. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> So firmly settled is this jurisdictioii, that, when once a decree quod computet is made, the Court will not permit a creditor to proceed at law.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-12\">Wirt contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbB-\">A simple action of debt on a Bond cannot be brought in equity. There is no averment in ~his Bill, of any~ deficiency of assets, or difilculty of getting at them. No proof is adduced, of any of the plaintiff's claims, except the bond. The cause was heard on bill and answer only, without replication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-13\">HaV in reply. Upon exarninhlig the authorities, t~he Court will find they fully support my position. The ju.risdiction of Courts of Equity has generally been oh-. tamed by ns~irpation 111)011 the Courts of law. The case of Dower is an example. The Court of law can in that case give rclief-yet it is given in Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In this case, the other claims in the Bill, (exclusive of the bond debt,) being proper for equitable jurisdiction, will draw to them the jurisdiction as to the bond debt also.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b44-14\"> Jesus College v.
