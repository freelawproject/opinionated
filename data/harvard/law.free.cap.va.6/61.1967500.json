This was not a remainder in the mother, after the previous estate tail to the daughter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">- A contrary construction would not have consisted with the general intention of the testator, but would have entirely disappointed it in several events which might be named. Thus, if the wife had had twins, they would \u25a0 have been disinherited: for, there is no provision for such a case; and, therefore, the previous estates being all removed, the wife would have taken immediately. So, if a son had been born, had married and died under age leaving issue, that issue would not have taken, but the wife; as in that case, there is no provision for the son\u2019s issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Besides, if the child had proved a son, the wife would not have had a fee, in the event of his attaining 21, and then dying without issue; for the remainder is only limited on the estate of the daughter, and not on that of the son.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">Again, the wife, according to that construction, was not entitled to the personal estate, for it was a limitation after failure of issue in the daughter; who, consequently, took the whole interest, which on the marriage vested in the husband. But, if the child had proved a son, she would not have been entitled thereto, because no provision is made for her as to the personal estate in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">Lastly, it is wholly improbable, that the testator would have given his wife, after her death, a remote interest of this kind, in preference to his child, whom he had all along preferred, in disposing of the immediate interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-8\">2. That it was an executory devise to the wife, to take effect on the child\u2019s being born dead, which event not having happened, the reversion in fee descended on the daughter, as heir at law to the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\">The word <em>die, </em>in the concluding part of the devise, is to be set in opposition to the first word <em>lives, </em>in the beginning of it: For, the word <em>lives </em>is twice repeated in the beginning, and should be taken in two different senses, or else some of the words must be rejected; contrary to the known rule of construction, that effect is to be given to every word, if possible. Therefore, in the beginning, the first word, <em>lives, </em>is to be taken in the sense of <em>born ulive; </em>and the second, in the sense. of <em>coni inning to live till </em>twenty-one, in the ease of a son, or till 21 or marriage, in the case of a daughter; and it is to the first of these senses, that is to say, <em>born alive, </em>that the word <em>die, </em>in the conclusion of the devise, is to be set in opposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-10\">The testator, therefore, had three contingencies in view at the time of making his will, that is to say: 1. The birth of a living child. 2. Its arriving to the age of maturity. 3. The death of that child before its birth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-11\">With the two first of these contingencies in mind, he considered how he should dispose of the estate, first, in case the child should be born alive, and prove to be a son; secondly, in case it should be born alive, and prove to be a daughter; in both cases predicating the disposition upon its being born alive. His reasoning was thus: if my child should be born alive, and should prove to be a son, then I give my estate this way; but, if it should be born alive, and should prove to be a daughter, then I give it that way; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>making the limitation, in both instances, to depend on the first word <em>lives, </em>in the commencement of the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-3\">But, having provided for all the cases, should the child be born alive, he next determines what should be done with his estate, in case t.he child should die before its birth. In this case, having no dearer object to provide for, he gives the whole estate to his wife. So that, according to this construction, all the leading contingencies which he had in view are provided for, and the interest of his family preserved, with a prudent regard to events.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-4\">This mode of considering the subject is the most obvious, and results necessarily from the intention of the testator; who, in the last limitation,was not contemplating the failure of the issue of his daughter, but of himself; and was providing for the latter event only. But the interpretation receives additional force, from the manner of the expression: For, the words used are unapt, and not so obvious as many others, for disposing of the remainder; so that they appear to. have been anxiously used in order to distinguish it from a limitation, on the daughter\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\">Consequently, in the events which have happened, the wife took nothing in the lands, after her daughter\u2019s death without issue; because she was only to take the fee in case the child died before its birth; and, therefore, her only interest was an estate for life by implication, although, as before mentioned, if the child had died under 21, and before marriage, she would have taken the fee, upon the rule in executory devises, that where the prior estates are removed, the devisee takes presently; because the events on which the remainder was limited would, in that case, never have commenced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">This construction is preferable to the other, because it avoids the inconveniencies which have been enumerated; for, if a child was born, and lived to the prescribed period, it was provided for, and a comfortable disposition made for <em>the </em>mother also: If a son had been born, had married, had issue, and died under 21, he would have taken. So in the case of twins: And, if no child at all had been born, the wife would have taken the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-7\">In short, by this construction the testator is not made to violate nature, and act inconsistently with himself, in giving away, the remainder from the issue of his blood, for whom in every other instance he shews a preference, in order to bestow it upon strangers: For, to strangers it must probably have gone, as the daughter was not to take until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the mother\u2019s death, and therefore it was most likely that the ultimate limitation would be enjoyed by the mother\u2019s representative, and not by the mother herself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-4\">3. That if the last construction bo rejected, then the word <em>die </em>in the conclusion of the devise is to be contrasted with the words <em>shall live till she attains of laioful age or married,, </em>in the clause immediately preceding; and then it will be a contingent remainder to the wife, if the daughter should die unmarried before 21: which contingency never having happened, the remainder never vested, and therefore descended on the heir at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">Contended, that it was a devise to the wife for life by implication, remainder to the daughter in tail, remainder to the wife in fee. The word <em>die </em>is to be understood as <em>a dying without issue, </em>which words the Court will supply, in order to effectuate the general intention of the testator. This is the interpretation which a plain man would put upon the case, and the meaning put upon the words by the appellant\u2019s counsel is artificial altogether. That the Court may supply the words <em>without issue, </em>is proved by many of the <em>English </em>cases. <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>Cro. Car. 185; <em>[Hewet </em>v. Ireland,] 1 P. Wms. 427; <em>[Kentish </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>Ib.] 234; [ <em>Targus </em>v. Puget,] 2 Ves. <em>sen. </em>194; 8 <em>Mod. </em>59. But supply those words, and then it is but the common case of a plain vested remainder after the death of tenant in tail without issue. As to the inconveniencies mentioned, from supposed cases which might have happened, they never were contemplated by the testator, and therefore cannot be argued from. But the consequences which are contended for, would not have followed from those cases. Thus in the case of the twins, it would have been considered a <em>casus omissus, </em>and therefore the will would have been rejected in favor of <em>them. So </em>in the case of a son being born, marrying, and dying under the age of 21, leaving issue; for, the issue would have taken on the same ground. But in fact, the son would have taken an immediate estate upon his birth; for, the contingency of his arriving to the age of 21 only applies to the privileges 'which he was then to have out of the estate. <em>[Goodtitle </em>d. <em>Hayward </em>v. Whitby,] 1 Burr. 228; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Westcomb, </em>Prec. Ch. 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The argument drawn from the personal estate, has no influence; for, at most, it only proves the testator to have attempted to create a perpetuity. But a difference of construction may be applied to the words as relative to the real and personal estate. <em>Forth </em>v. Chapman, 1 P. Wms. 663.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-3\">The construction contended for, on the other side, would go to establish, that there might be an executory devise after an estate tail, contrary to a known rule of law. Besides, the idea of leaving the fee to descend upon the heir at law, is repugnant to the intention of the testator; who, in the preamble to his will, professes a design to devise his whole estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-4\">But, if the construction of the will were against us, still the plaintiff could not recover, because the lease and release did not convey the estate; for, the wife was not examined as to the lease. Those conveyances; however, operate merely~on the possession; but here was none, and there is no privity between the re-lessor and re-lessee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">The length of time is a bar; for, the defendants and those under whom they claim have been in possession 70 years. <em>Sarah Hillard\u2019s </em>life-estate makes no difference; for she parted with it, before the year 1727. .

The case from 1 <em>Burr. </em>228, was a case upon the known doctrine of an exception out of the general devise, <em>Fearne </em>on Rem. 438; and, therefore, will not apply to the case under consideration: For the devise, in the present in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>stance, was not an exception, but an express condition; and, therefore, necessary to be performed, before the estates could arise. <em>Fcarne </em>on Rem. 438-9. The that there can be no executory devise after an estate tail, proves nothing; because, although that is true where the attempt is to create an executory devise, upon the preceding limitation in tail, yet we do not contend for this here; but that it arises upon an event independent of the estate tail, having no connection with it, and which may happen before it. In short, it is a mere alternative devise altogether.. If a child was born and lived till 21 in the case of a son, or of 21 or marriage in case of a daughter, then the estate tail was to arise; which is one alternative: But, if no child was born, then in that event, which is the other alternative, the executory devise to the mother was to take plaee. It is admitted, that the remarks relative to the personal estate are correct; but, then it is said, that ought not to prevent her taking the real estate. This, however, only proves what I contended for, that the construction goes to disappoint the will of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-8\">\u25a0 The lease and release was a sufficient conveyance; for, the recital of the lease in the release made both of them the wife\u2019s deed. Besides, the tenant was rightly in under the husband, and therefore the release operated to enlarge the estate; or, if thfe husband had no authority, then it was a discontinuance, and the release passed the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-9\">The .reversion was well conveyed by <em>Joseph, Selden </em>to <em>John; </em>for the bargain and sale passed it. 1 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 275; 2 Black. Com. 290; <em>Plowd. </em>154; and that another was in possession will make no difference, unless it had been adverse to the remainder-man himself. The passages from <em>Coke, </em>prove nothing to the contrary, as they only shew, that the remainder-man may consider himself as disseised, if he will; but they do not oblige him to enter. The opinions there stated were introduced merely for the sake of the assize of <em>novel disseisin; </em>and, therefore, it was expressly held, in <em>Doe, </em>ex dem. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Horde, </em>Cowp. 689, 703, that the remainder-man might elect to consider himself disseised or not. Besides, there could be no disseisin here, as the verdict states, that <em>Sarah Hillard </em>parted with her right to <em>Kirby, </em>and that he parted with his to <em>King; </em>so that <em>King </em>was lawfully in possession, and therefore could be no disseisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-12\">That a descent was cast makes no difference; for, that doctrine only applies against one having a right of entry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>which the remainder-man here had <em>not. </em>Therefore, the remainder, in the present case, was well conveyed; and the right is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AtZ\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-5\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aim\">This case depends, upon the construction of the will of <em>Joseph Achilly, </em>dated on the 11th of <em>March, 1699-1700. </em>And, before I go into this construction, I will mention two or three principles, which I hold to be incontestible,. and under the influence of which, I think that construction ought to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">1. Then, it is a rule, that, in construing a will, the intention of the testator should be collected from the whole instrument taken together; every expression should have its due weight; and, as is some where said, [in <em>Blamford </em>v. <em>Blamford, </em>3 Buls. 103, by Doddridge,] every string should give its proper sound.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\"><em>2. </em>It is also a rule, that the construction ought to be made as at the time of the death of the testator; and, ought not to be differed in consequence of a contingency, therein contemplated, (but the event of which, was unknown to the testator at <em>the </em>time,) having afterwards happened the one way or the other. This principle will take into the consideration of the present case th\u00a3 devise to the son, (although none was in fact born,) and the consequences resulting therefrom; which must be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\"><em>3. </em>That where the testator does not use proper technical words to express his meaning, the Court may supply them, <em>in order to effectuate the manifest intention of the testator; and, for such purpose only, </em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Under <em>the </em>influence of these principles, a difficulty arises, as to the words which are to be supplied after the words, <em>if the child should die, </em>in the ultimate devise to the wife; it being evident that some must be supplied, as a dying simply is not a contingent event, but naturally certain. The words, \u201c <em>without issue;\u201d </em>and, <em>\u201c under the age of twenty-one;\u201d </em>or, in the event of there being a daughter, <em>\u201c before marriage,\u201d </em>have all been assumed; and the question is, which of them shall be adopted ?</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In the devise to the son, if the words, <em>live to the age of twenty-one years, </em>lie considered as only extending to the time, when the privilege, as to the house and part of the land, is to commence, (notwithstanding the mother may he alive,) but not as a condition precedent to the vesting of his interest in the land on the death of the mother, the words in the same clause, \u201c <em>and after the decease of his mother then,\u201d </em>will have their full effect; whereas by a contrary construction, those words will have no effect, in case of the son being under age at the time of the death of the mother. For, notwithstanding her death, he could not have succeeded under that construction; because, not of the age of twenty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">But, it would be improper to construe a provision in his favor, predicated upon the event of his mother being alive at the time of his coming of age, to narrow a right given by the same clause to succeed to the whole land, upon the death of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The intention of the testator relative to both his son \" and daughter, (for the material words in both the devises are substantially alike as far as concerns the present question,) is to give a provision by way of support, when they respectively arrive to lawful age, or the daughter marries; but, he never could have meant, nor can we so expound the will, without rejecting some of his words as above, that their interest in the lands, after the death of the mother, should be postponed to the same period; and, in the event of their not attaining to lawful age, be lost. This, in the case of the son, would be to pretermit his children, if he died under the age leaving any, in favor of the heirs of the testator\u2019s wife, (perhaps by another husband;) which it is presumed the testator cannot be supposed to have intended: Especially as the wife, on my construction, has a present interest for life in the whole land and a remainder in fee expectant upon the extinction of the testator\u2019s lineal descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Besides, I hold it to be a circumstance of some weight, in ascertaining the testator\u2019s intention, that my construction of it conforms to a very usual mode of settlement, limiting an estate for life, remainder in tail, remainder in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">With respect to the operation of conditional words, by way of condition, precedent or otherwise, it is not necessary to go into that doctrine; as, in this case, the intention of the testator restricts the conditional words to the privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>leges contemplated, and does not extend them to affect the right to the land, on the death of the mother: But, if so, then upon the birth of the daughter, she had a vested remainder in tail, remainder in fee to the wife; and, upon the death of the daughter, without issue, the wife, and the defendant claiming under her, became entitled to the land in question. Therefore, I think, the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">CARRINGTON, Judge. In the construction of wills, the testator\u2019s intention should be the rule of decision. By that standard, Courts should be governed, and the intention should\u2019 be pursued, as far as the rules of law will permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">To effect this object, the words of tlie will are in general to be attended to; but, it is sometimes necessary, in order to fulfil the manifest general intention of the testator, to supply such words, as from the general complexion of the will, compared with the situation of the testator, and of the legatees and objects of his bounty, are absolutely necessary to effectuate the purposes and dispositions intended by him.</p>\n<p id=\"A_0\">In doing this, too great latitude of construction on one hand, and too scrupulous a regard to the strict limits of legal rules on the other, are equally to he avoided, and a just medium observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In -the present case, the testator, a century ago, being possessed of an estate both real and personal, and probably without relations, but having a wife supposed to be pregnant, made his will; and, thereby, after reciting, that he means to dispose of all his temporal estate, manifests an intention to make provision for his wife, during life in the first place; next to preserve his estate to the heirs of his own body; and, failing those, to give the whole to his wife; who, next to his own issue, was the favorite object of his bounty.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Let us consider the mode by which he intended to effect this:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">First then, I am of opinion that the son, if one had been born, would have been entitled to a vested remainder in tail at his birth, to take effect, in possession, upon the death of his mother. But, he would, in the mean time, on his coming to the age of twenty-\u00f3ne, have had a right to the use of part of the lands, during the life-time of his mother. Any other construction would have disin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>herited the issue of the son; which never could have been intended, by the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">In like manner, I think the daughter, by the same rule of construction, .likewise took a vested estate tail at her birth, to take effect in possession, on the death of her mother. But, as she married and died without issue, a doubt arises as to the meaning of the testator by the words, <em>if the child die, fyc. </em>in the subsequent clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The question is, whether he meant a dying generally ? or, before the age of twenty-one, if a son, or marriage, if a daughter? or, as Mr. <em>Call </em>supposed, before the birth of the child ? or, lastly without heirs of the body ?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">He could not have meant the first, because he knew death was certain; nor the second, because the son\u2019s issue would have been disinherited, as before observed, if he had died before twenty-one; nor the third, because the general tenor of his will shews he contemplated the child\u2019s being born alive: Therefore, he must have meant the last.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">According to which idea, the true construction is, that the testator by the latter -words, <em>if the child should die, </em>referred to the preceding devise to the daughter in tail, and meant-to add the words, <em>ivithoui heirs of her body, </em>but inadvertently omitted them. Therefore, in order to fulfil his intention, and carry the dispositions, he was making, into effect, it is necessary to supply those words: And then, upon the death of the daughter without issue, the remainder in fee took effect in possession in the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Being of this opinion, it is unnecessary to trace the title of the plaintiff any further; or that of the defendant at all. For, the defendant being in possession, must remain so, until a better title is shewn. But, I will add, that the defendant and his ancestors having been so long in possession, I should be extremely unwilling to disturb it, unless compelled thereto by positive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">I am for affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">LYONS, Judge. Concurred that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">PENDLETON, President. We are all agreed, that death being certain and not contingent, the testator must be supposed to have meant some other event added to the death, which was really contingent, and which the Court in construction must supply; but'we differ about the extent of that supplement. I think he meant the contingency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the son\u2019s dying under twenty-one, without leaving issue, or a daughter\u2019s dying under that age, not having been married. My worthy brethren add a further contingency; namely, that of a general failure of issue of the children, which does not appear to me to have been contemplated by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">I would observe, that, in supplying words on such occasions, we are not at liberty to form guesses or conjectures of what we would have intended in such a case, but to supply the omitted words, as necessary from the complexion of the whole will, as is said by Ld. Mansfield, in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Shipphard, </em>Dough 75. On this view, I have formed my opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">As there was no son, but a daughter only, I disregard the clause for that event, as a supposed case which never happened; although, there is no material difference, except that the devise to the son is upon condition, that he attain the age of twenty-one, and that to the daughter, of her attaining that age, or being married.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The case of a son was mentioned, for the sake of observing, that if the limitation to the wife was upon the son\u2019s attaining <em>21, </em>and he had died under age,-leaving issue, they would <em>be </em>disinherited, contrary no doubt to his apparent intention. I answer, that if that case had happened, from the plain intention to provide for the issue, I would have interposed the words in the limitation to the wife, <em>if my son die under 21, without leaving issue; </em>confining it to the event at that period, and not extending it-to a general failure of issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">But, however necessary this might be, in the case of the son, it could not be so in the case of a daughter, who could not have issue before her marriage, which was a performance of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">\u25a0 That the daughter\u2019s attaining full age, or her marriage, was a condition precedent to the vesting of any estate in her, appears to me evident; since, although, the cases shew, that the words <em>when </em>and <em>as </em>may be,applied to the time of possession, and not to the vesting, I believe it never was, nor can be doubted, but that the word <em>if </em>must make such condition.'</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Upon the will in the case before us, the condition applies to the whole; as well the remainder in tail after the death of the wife, as the moiety of the personal estate she was to have on marriage or coming of age, being coupled together by the word <em>and. </em>Thus, making both to depend on the same condition, though to come in possession at different periods. So, that the daughter on her coming of age, took a vested interest in half the personal estate in possession, and a vested remainder in tail in the real estate after the death of the wife. So far, the reversion in fee is undisposed of; and, if the will had stopped there, would unquestionably have descended to the daughter. We come then to the enquiry, whether that reversion is disposed of to the wife in the next clause. That a man may devise to A. for life, remainder to B. in tail, remainder to A. in fee, is not questioned; but the true question is, whether this testator designed to make such a disposition?</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">That, he intended his wife should have his whole estate, in case a child should be born, and die under age and unmarried, is apparent; for, this might be beneficial to her, whom he preferred to any other, having no collateral relations of his own: But, that he looked forward to the remote possibility of a failure of issue, at any time after, is what I cannot discover a hint of in this will; and, therefore, although he might have made such a limitation, and if he had done so, the Court could not have controled it, the.case is quite altered, when we are to supply words, supposed, from apparent intention, to have been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">I can easily conceive, that, although he meant to provide for the case of his children dying in their infancy, when they could not make any disposition of their estates, yet when they came of age, and had families of their own, they should take the estate in tail, with the remainder in fee, subject to all the legal consequences of such an interest; that is to say, they could not alien in prejudice of their issue, unless by a legal mode the estate tail was defeated, but might do so if their issue failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As death is naturally opposed to life, there was great force in Mr. <em>Call\u2019s </em>observation, that the testator used the word <em>die </em>in opposition to <em>living; </em>that is, if the child die before the time I have required it should live to be entitled to my estate, then I give it to my wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">My interpretation will make the two Glauses consistent, but the other will produce inconsistency. ' For, the half of the personal estate is given to the daughter absolutely, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to her and the heirs of her body; but the limitation over the wife comprehends the whole personal estate with the lands, and if he meant the limitation to be on a general failure of issue, it would have contradicted the devise of the personal estate. If he had expressly so limited it, then it would have either been good as to the land, and void as to the personals, or good as to both by applying them to each in different meanings. But, let it still be remembered, that w\u00e9 are supplying words for him, and. should not make him contradict himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">A question was asked, could the testator mean if his daughter died the day after marriage, that his wife should not have the estate? I answer,' he has fixed her marriage for vesting the estate in her, without hinting a difference in her interest, whether she lived'a day or an hundred . years. But, I think I am warranted by the will, <em>in </em>saying, that, if the testator had been asked, whether, if his child had issue, and that issue failed a thousand years after, the estate should .go to the heirs of his wife, (the consequence of the limitation on a general failure of issue,) or to those claiming under his child or issue? He would have answered, that he cared nothing about it.</p>\n<p id=\"AnL\">Upon the whole, the- only supplement, which I think myself at liberty to make, will leave the clause to read thus; <em>\u201c </em>Item. It is my further will and pleasure, that if the child, wherewith my wife now goes withal, die (if a male before he attains the age of twenty-one or have issue, or, if a female before she shall attain that age or be married,) then I give and bequeath to my said dear and loving wife <em>Mary Jlchilly </em>and her heirs, <em>all </em>my lands, houses, negroes, stocks, goods and chattels and debts due:\u201d Making it an executory devise of the fee to the wife, upon the contingency of the son\u2019s dying without issue, under age, or a daughter dying under age unmarried, which I conscientiously believe was his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">However, as the other Judges are of a contrary opinion, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\">[* <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Sadler's heirs, </em>1 Munf. 537.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AUQ\">[\u2020 See <em>Lynch et ux. v.
