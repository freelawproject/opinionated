She therefore prayed relief against the effect of the general warranty; a foreclosure of the mortgage; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\"><em>Jacob Bumgardner </em>answered, as defendant in his own right. He denied notice of the contract for a special warranty, and of any fraudulent alteration of the deed in that respect. He and <em>Isaac Hayes </em>bought of <em>Flack </em>all the land sold him by the plaintiff, not doubting but <em>Flack </em>had a good title, and a general warranty from the plaintiff. At the time of that purchase, he had not heard of the claim of <em>Walker </em>and Company; though he had heard of a claim set up by one <em>Wilkinson, </em>noted for claiming lands he had no title to. He was told by <em>Claudius Buster, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s title was good, and that, otherwise, she would not have warranted the land. The respondent had never seen the plaintiff\u2019s deeds to <em>Flack. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s son came twice for instalments of the purchase money due from Flack:\u2014before he came the second time, this respondent had got notice of the claim of <em>Walker </em>and Company, and therefore refused to pay any more money. Young <em>Mlm, </em>at first, doubted, but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>afterwards satisfied, that his mother had given a general warranty. The plaintiff herself came afterwards, and, without suggesting fraud or mistake as to the warranty, being satisfied that <em>Walker </em>and Company had title to 330 acres of the land, appeared only anxious to have the amount of deduction fixed. The parties submitted it to arbitrators, who made an award, satisfactory to this defendant, but not to the plaintiff or to <em>James </em>Hayes;\u2014he therefore was willing not to insist on that award. This defendant and <em>Isaac Hayes </em>sold to <em>James Ilayes </em>so much of the land as was uot claimed by <em>Walker </em>and Company, and retained only the part comprised in that claim. He admitted the mortgage, and that the land was bound by it, but claimed a deduction for so much as <em>Walker </em>and Company claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\"><em>James Hayes </em>answered also in his own right; stating that ho bought a part of the land, but had not then heard of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>claim; (though he had heard of that of <em>Wilkinson;') </em>and had no notice of any contract between the plaintiff and <em>Flack </em>concerning a special warranty, or of any alteration in the deed she made. He confessed notice of the mortgage, but had never seen the contract or deed from the plaintiff to <em>Flack. </em>He had had a survey made, and found that <em>Walker\u2019s </em>claim would take off two hundred acres of the land he bought, and <em>that </em>by far the most valuable part. He therefore insisted on a deduction from the sum claimed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\"><em>Claudius Busier </em>administrator of <em>Isaac Hayes, </em>in his answer, said that he drew the agreement between the plaintiff and <em>Flack; </em>that a claim of <em>John Wilkinson </em>to a part of the land, was talked of at the time:\u2014the plaintiff believed that <em>Wilkinson </em>had no right; hut, choosing to avoid trouble, would only agree to give a <em>special </em>warranty; and it was so stated in the written agreement. This respondent knew not that the Deed was made with <em>general </em>warranty, \u2019till he was <em>told by Flack, </em>that the plaintiff had said that, as she herself had a general warranty, she would give him such an one; and that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>^ so* ^a&lt;^ no^ agreement; had never had the deed in his possession; and knew not what had become of the original.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_5d\">To these Answers, there was a general Replication; whereupon, Commissions were awarded, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">The heirs of <em>Flack, </em>in their Answer, disclaimed all knowledge on the subject. There was no regular proceeding against the heirs of <em>Isaac Hayes.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">From the exhibits, it appeared, that Mrs. <em>Mien\u2019s </em>deeds as Executrix of <em>Robert Mien </em>deceased, to <em>Flack, </em>contained a clause of <em>general </em>warranty: but the original agreement between them was not shewn. Copies were exhibited, of a survey made for <em>John Wilkinson, </em>of 800 acres, and of a Patent for the same land to <em>Thomas Walker, </em>dated June 12th 1772. The Deeds from <em>Flack </em>to <em>Bumgardner </em>and <em>Hayes, </em>were <em>with warranty against all claims but Mien\u2019s mortgage.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\">The depositions proved, that Mrs. <em>Mien </em>and <em>Flack </em>both knew of <em>Wilkinson\u2019s </em>claim before her sale to him; that, by the original contract between them, she was to give only a <em>special </em>warranty for the 400 acre tract; and that <em>Wilkinson\u2019s </em>claim and <em>Walker\u2019s </em>were one and the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHe\">The Chancellor directed an account of the sum due the plaintiff on her mortgage; of the purchase-money due from <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Bumgardner </em>to <em>Flack; </em>and of the value of the lands included in <em>Walker\u2019s </em>claim. The Commissioner returned a survey, shewing that 206 acres in all were covered by that claim; estimated at 963 dollars; of which, 119 acres where held by <em>Bumgardner, </em>and 194 acres by <em>James Hayes. </em>He reported that <em>that part </em>of the purchase-money, due from <em>Bumgardner </em>and <em>Isaac Hayes </em>to <em>flack, which they agreed to pay the plaintiff, </em>was still in their hands;\u2014payment of the residue being acknowledged by <em>flack\u2019s </em>executors; and that 914k, principal and interest, were due on the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-11\">April 4th 1812. Chanceller Brown decreed, that the plaintiff should be relieved from the effect of the <em>general </em>warranty; and that the same should be regarded as only special; and that, unless the defendants paid her the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>balance due on the mortgage before the 1st of October ensuing, the land should be sold by Commissioners to satisfy the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaS\">The Commissioners reported, that they had sold the land accordingly, and <em>Bumgardner </em>purchased it for \u00a72840; charges of sale, <em>$67 </em>30; nett proceeds <em>$2772 </em>70; which sum was paid to the plaintiff\u2019s agent, as of date of sale, November 30th 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">The Chancellor confirmed the sale; and directed the Commissioners to convey the land to <em>Bumgardner: </em>and, it appearing from the said report, that the proceeds of sale were insufficient to discharge the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the Chancellor, being satisfied that, by the agreement between <em>Flack, Bumgardner </em>and <em>Isaac </em>Hayes, of Dec. 26th 1800, the latter were bound to pay the plaintiff at least 700Z., which, if punctually paid, would have extinguished the whole of her claim, therefore decreed, that the defendants <em>Bumgardner </em>and <em>Buster, </em>(the latter out of the assets of his intestate,) pay unto the plaintiff the balance due, after deducting therefrom the sum of $2772 70, the nett proceeds of the sale aforesaid, to be considered as a payment on the 30th day of November 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">From this decree, <em>Bumgardner </em>and <em>Buster </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-9\">The cause was argued before a Special Court of Appeals, by <em>Leigh </em>for the Appellants, and <em>Wickham </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-10\"><em>On the part of the appellants, </em>it was contended that, whatever equity the plaintiff might have had, as against her vendee <em>Flack, </em>to be regarded as only a <em>special </em>warrantor, and to be relieved from the effect of her general warranty, she was entitled to no such relief against the defendants, who purchased without notice of that equity: <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that, consequently, the defendants were entitled to a deduction for the land covered by <em>Walker\u2019s </em>better title, which the plaintiff did not, and could not, convey a good title: and that, after the plaintiff, over and above the instalments of the purchase money she had already received, had also received the proceeds of the sale of every foot of the land, it was highly unjust to make innocent pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>chasers, ignorant of <em>Flack\u2019s </em>secret contract with her, and misled by her own deed to him, <em>personally </em>responsible to fulfil <em>Flack\u2019s </em>contract to the uttermost farthing. <em>Flack a\\onR </em>was so responsible, in the event of inadequacy in the mortgage:\u2014his representatives were before the Court, and should have been decreed against.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY_\"><em>On the other side, </em>it was said that this was not a case of a mere equitable title set up against purchasers without notice; for Mrs. <em>Allen, </em>being a <em>mortgagee, </em>ivas a holder of the <em>legal </em>title. Her equity, too, was preferable to their\u2019s. It is perfectly clear that the Deed\u2019s being with general warranty proceeded from a mistake in the scrivener who drew it. <em>Flack </em>himself, long afterwards, acknowledged that he did not know it, but supposed the Deed to have been with special warranty: he therefore could not have misled <em>Bumgardner </em>and <em>Hayes </em>by telling them that it was with general warranty. It is incontrovertible that they did not buy on the faith of the general warranty from Mrs. <em>Allen </em>to <em>Flack, </em>but relied on <em>Flack\u2019s </em>warranty to themselves. <em>Bumgardner </em>says he never <em>examined </em>the Deed; <em>Hayes, </em>that he never saw it. The Recital in the Deed was, that she sold the land not as her own, but as a trustee, under a power given by the- Will of her husband. A general warranty was therefore not to be expected. They knew too that she was about to leave the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5\">Their agreement with <em>Flack </em>to pay to <em>her </em>the purchase money, bound them to make good the balance unsatisfied by the sale under the mortgage. There wras a privity between them and her; for they agreed to stand in <em>Flack\u2019s </em>shoes; to pay her the money for him; and they <em>paid part </em>in conformity with that agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-6\">The only defect in the Decree is, it\u2019s failing to give the plaintiff relief, (in default of <em>Bumgardner scad:Hayes,') against Flack\u2019s representatives.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AsJ\">\n<em> Sugden 476; 2 Fonb. Bk. 2. c. 6. \u00a7 2.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-7\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"ATEf\">delivered the Court\u2019s opinion as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The Court is of opinion that, notwithstanding the <em>general </em>warranty contained in the deed of Oct. 5th, 1798, from the appellee to <em>James Flack, </em>it is fully established by the testimony, that that stipulation was contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>real agreement between the parties. By that agreement, the 400 acre tract conveyed thereby was only to be conveyed under a <em>special </em>warranty. Notwithstanding, therefore, the claim of <em>Walker, </em>mentioned in the procecdings, to a part of the said land, the said <em>Flack </em>and his representatives were hound to pay the full consideration therefor, mentioned in the said Deed. The opinion of the Court further is, that, towards effecting this payment, the <em>lands mortgaged </em>by the said <em>Flack </em>to the appellee, w'ere liable, <em>into whose soever hands they might </em>come; and, in case of a deficiency, that the balance w'as to be made good out of the <em>proper estate of the said Flack. </em>This is the extent of the appellee\u2019s claim in this particular; and she has nothing to do with the subsequent contract between <em>Flack </em>and the appellants, except in so far as they <em>may </em>have bound themselves <em>absolutely </em>to pay a sum to her on account of <em>Flack', </em>in which case, to avoid circuity, the Decree would be rendered against them, <em>pro tanto, </em>in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">The Court can not view the contract between <em>Flack </em>and <em>Bumgardner </em>and <em>[fayes, </em>which is thus brought <em>collaterally </em>before them, as importing any such <em>absolute </em>agreement on the part of the latter. We can not see that there is any essential difference, in principle, between agreeing to pay the vendor himself, and contracting to pay bis creditor; and, if Mrs. <em>Mien </em>were out of the question, it would be the common case of a general warranty of a tract of land, as to which there is a real outstanding title. Nor can we see that the appellee\u2019s case should he differed, and her rights extended, by virtue of the alienation of <em>Flack, </em>beyond what they would have been if no such alienation had been made. In that case, her remedy would be limited to the proceeds of the mortgaged estate, and to the balance to he recovered from him or his estate as aforesaid, in exclusion of others. However, therefore, the case may be, as between the representatives of <em>Flack </em>and the appellants, and in relation to this claim by <em>Walker, </em>the appellants have done nothing in this transaction to subject <em>themselves </em>to the claim of the appellee:\u2014they only agreed that a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the money stipulated to be paid to <em>Flack, </em>should be paid to <em>her, </em>his creditor; but <em>that </em>agreement was subject to the same limitations and exceptions, as if it had been contracted to be paid to himself) <em>it excludes the reported value of the land claimed by Walker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">This view of the subject exclude's the enquiry whether the appellants had notice, or not, of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>claim, when they purchased from <em>Flack. </em>We are inclined to think they had not; hut this is immaterial as to the appellee. The ground of holding a purchaser bound, who has notice of an out-standing title in another, is that he acts with a corrupt conscience in purchasing what in equity he knows belongs to another. In relation to <em>Walker, </em>(who has also the <em>legal </em>title,) this principle would be infringed, on this hypothesis; but it is otherwise as to the <em>appellee. She </em>has no land which is thus brought in question; and the appellants are only liable to <em>her, if, and so far as, </em>they are brought <em>in, </em>collaterally, <em>by the agreement between them and Flack. Flack\u2019s </em>executors have not answered as to the state of his assets. It may be that his estate is entirely competent to pay the balance due to the appellee, after the sum of $963, (the reported value of the land claimed by Walker,) and the other payments, are deducted. The decree is therefore erroneous, not only in subjecting the appellants to pay the said sum of $963, but also in omitting to decree against <em>Flack\u2019s </em>representatives, (including eventually his heirs,) the balance which is due to the appellee as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Court is further of opinion, that the appellee has the less reason to complain of this construction of the appellant\u2019s contract with <em>Flack, </em>because the general warranty, contained in her deed as aforesaid, might have tended to mislead <em>them </em>as to the reality of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>claim, and which might, therefore, have produced even a more unqualified stipulation in this particular, than is found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On these grounds, the Decree is to he reversed with costs, so far as it conflicts with the principles now declared, and affirmed as to the residue; and the cause is remanded, to have that decree reformed, and the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>finally proceeded in pursuant to tlie principles of this Decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
