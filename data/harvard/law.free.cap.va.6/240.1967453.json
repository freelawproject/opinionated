The Commonwealth.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b260-9\">[Wednesday, <em>April </em>30th, 1800.]</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ArB\">Quzres\u2014Whether an inquisition finding an escheat for want of heirs, should not say in express words, that the deceased <em>died without heirs?</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-12\">An <em>amicus curias </em>cannot move to quash an inquisition of escheat, unless he either has an interest himself, or represents somebody who has.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-13\">An <em>amicus curise </em>cannot appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">This was an inquisition of <em>escheat, for the want of heirs, </em>dated 26th <em>July, 1796. </em>It finds that <em>Thomas Jackson, </em>was, in his life-time seised of the premises, and that he died in 17 , without will, ec Or in any otherwise disposing of the said land, and that no person hath ever since claimed the said land either as a lineal or collateral heir to the said <em>Thomas Jackson, </em>deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-16\">In <em>JLpril, </em>1798, <em>Dunlop </em>as <em>amicus curise, </em>moved the District Court to quash the inquisition, which they refused: <em>the Court not having jurisdiction thereof. </em>Whereupon he filed a bill of exceptions, which stated the inquisition, and motion to quash it; because the Clerk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Court had issued no certificate to the <em>Escheator </em>respecting the said inquest; but that the motion was opposed: 1. Because the inquisition had been duly returned into the Clerk\u2019s office, and had remained there ever since, without any person having traversed it, or put in or shewn any <em>monstrans de droit, </em>or petition of right, within six months next <em>after the </em>time of finding the said inquest. <em>2. </em>Because the Court had no jurisdiction of the cause, unless brought before them by a traverse of office, <em>monstrans de droit, </em>or petition of right: And that the Court being divided, the motion was over-ruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\"><em>Dunlop, </em>appealed from the judgment of the District Court to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-5\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">The inquisition having omitted to state that the decedent <em>died withoitl heirs, </em>is clearly bad; and an <em>amicus curim </em>might suggest it to the Court, in order that it might be quashed and a new one taken, so as to prevent its being set aside at a future day, and purchasers under the Commonwealth, from being injured. The lapse of time made no difference, as no certificate had been granted by the Clerk, and, therefore, it was in the nature of a matter still depending before the Court, who had a right to control the granting of the certificate prior to its emanation. Besides, it never could have been the intention of the Legislature to bar the claim of men who were not informed of their rights. Else a man, who happened to be out of the State on the day of taking the inquisition, and who did not return until a few days after six months, would be precluded from asserting his claim, although he had no opportunity of being informed of it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-7\"><em>Nicholas, </em>Attorney General, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\">The inquisition finds facts tantamount to dying without heirs; for it states, that the lands escheated, and no set form of words is necessary. But, the six months having elapsed is decisive; for, the act expressly precludes all objections afterwards. \u2022 Nor is it material that no certificate had issued; because that was the omission of the Clerk, which ought not to prejudice the Commonwealth. However, at any rate, an <em>amicus curiae </em>could not move the exception, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>as he had no interest in the question himself, nor made a suggestion on behalf of any person who was before the Court and concerned in interest. Much less could he appeal; because he sustained no injury, and, therefore, could not be aggrieved by the Court\u2019s not hearkening to his advice, or deciding against his opinion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-6\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">There i\u00e1 nothing tantamount to dying without heirs found, (even if that were sufficient, which it is not;) for, the inference drawn by the jury was not warranted by the facts which they had previously stated. Any person may give an appeal bond; and the Court will presume that the <em>amicus curiae </em>either had an interest himself or represented somebody who had.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Auq\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AxL\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the appeal should be dismissed; because it had been improperly granted; and that the <em>amicus curiae </em>could not move to quash an inquisition, when it did not appear that he had any interest himself, or represented any person who had.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
