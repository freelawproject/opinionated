Before this deed of trust was acted on, <em>M\u2019Daniel </em>died, and administration of his estate was granted to <em>Abner Whitton. Cook, </em>in execution of the trust, sold seven of the mortgaged slaves, three of them females, to <em>William Whit-ton, </em>the father of <em>Abner, </em>for 4420 dollars, and made him a bill of sale for them. <em>William Whitton, </em>in order to enable him to pay this money to <em>Cook, </em>the trustee, borrowed divers sums of money of divers persons, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>among others, he borrowed of his son <em>Abner Whitton, </em>the administrator of the <em>mortgagor M\u2019Daniel, </em>the sum of 960 dollars, which, as <em>William Terry </em>knew, belonged . . \u00bb/ o to <em>M\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>estate, being the amount of a debt which had as his administrator collected, and which he credited to the estate in his account of administration. The widow of <em>M\u2019Daniel </em>the mortgagor, was a daughter of <em>William Whitton </em>and sister of <em>Aimer; </em>and <em>William\u2019s </em>purpose, in purchasing the seven slaves at the trustee\u2019s sale, was to make some provision for the support of his daughter, <em>Mrs. M\u2019Daniel, </em>and accordingly, after his purchase of them, he put them into the hands first of <em>Sherrard, </em>then of <em>Jesse, </em>and last of <em>Jeremiah Whitton, </em>to apply the profits to the support of <em>Mrs. M\u2019Daniel, </em>and to account to him for any surplus.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b205-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>1835. <em>March.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>William Terry </em>having recovered a judgment against <em>Abner Whitton </em>administrator of <em>M\u2019Daniel, </em>to be levied <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>sued out a <em>fieri' facias, </em>and caused it to be levied by the sheriff on one of the seven slaves which had been purchased by <em>William Whitton </em>at <em>Coolc </em>the trustee\u2019s sale. Whereupon <em>William Whitton </em>exhibited his bill against <em>Terry </em>and the sheriff, in the county court of <em>Bedford, </em>setting forth his title to the slave taken i'n execution, and praying an injunction to restrain the sheriff from proceeding to malee sale thereof under the execution. The injunction was awarded. <em>Terry, </em>in his answer, alleged, that the purchase made by <em>William Terry, </em>at the trustee\u2019s sale, was made with money of <em>Alexander M\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>estate, lent and advanced to him for the purpose, by <em>Abner Whitton, </em>the administrator, who ought either to have applied that money to the payment of his intestate\u2019s debts, or to the redemption of the mortgaged slaves, and in that case to have held the property as assets of his intestate\u2019s estate, subject to the claims of his intestate\u2019s <em>creditors; </em>and therefore, <em>William Terry\u2019s </em>purchase of the slaves at the trustee\u2019s sale, was fraudulent and void as against the creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of <em>M\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>estate.

If he dissolved the injunction, on the ground that the plaintiff had a remedy by action at law, and so the case was not a proper one for relief in equity, the recent decisions of this court had fully sustained the jurisdiction of a court of chancery to relieve in such a case. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>3 Rand. 170. <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>6 Rand. 194. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>Id. 506. If the ground of the decree was, that the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of the slaves at the trustee\u2019s sale was not accompanied and followed by delivery of possession to him, that doctrine had no relation to a case like this. <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson, 2 </em>Bos. &amp; Pull. 59. In fact, the possession did accompany and follow the sale. Then, supposing the ground of the decree to have been, that the plaintiff borrowed of <em>M\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>administrator, a part of the money which he paid for the slaves by him purchased at the trustee\u2019s sale, and that this circumstance rendered the whole purchase fraudulent in fact or in law, as against any creditor of <em>M\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>estate; that circumstance, he insisted, evinced nothing fraudulent in the transaction, or any wise unfair. An administrator collecting money due to his intestate\u2019s estate, giving the estate credit for it, and duly accounting to the creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>for the money so collected, might make any use he pleased, of the specific money collected. In the present case\u2019 adinirL\u00cdstra.tor fairly charged himself 'vfith the 920 dollars he had collected, in his administration account, and made himself and his sureties responsible for it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alm\">admitted, that the decree could not be supported on either of the two first grounds suggested by <em>Leigh: but he </em>insisted, that the transaction was fraudulent as against <em>M\u2019Daniel's </em>'creditors. The slave in question had been mortgaged by <em>M\u2019 Daniel, </em>in his lifetime; the equity of redemption was in him, and subject to the claims of his creditors in general, who might have levied an execution on the <em>property; Bowyer </em>v. <em>Creigh, </em>3 Rand. 25. The administrator of <em>M\u2019Daniel, </em>instead of applying the money of his intestate\u2019s estate, either directly to the satisfaction of his debts, or to the redemption of the mortgaged property, \"which was liable for his intestate\u2019s debts, suffered the mortgaged property to be sold, and lent his intestate\u2019s-money to his father, that he might purchase it at the trustee\u2019s sale, for the benefit of his sister. This was a diversion of .the assets from the purpose to which the law required him <em>to </em>apply them, obviously injurious to the creditors of the <em>estate; </em>and as the borrower knew this, he was party to the injury done them. In effect, the debtor\u2019s money was applied to the purchase of the debtor\u2019s property, for the benefit of the debtor\u2019s widow, and thus withdrawn from its proper purpose, the satisfaction of the debtor\u2019s creditors. The transaction was a fraud upon them; it was, at the least, suspicious; and no party to such a transaction could be entitled to the aid of a court of equity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-5\">Care, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASu\">I can see no good ground for dissolving the injunction. The appellee\u2019s counsel placed it solely on the ground of fraud, because the slaves were bought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in part with money borrowed from the administrator. But how was the estate or the creditors of it injured by this ? The intestate <em>M\u2019Daniel </em>had made a mortgage of his slaves in his lifetime: this is admitted to have been fair. The sale under it by the trustee, was also regular, and the slaves sold, I should think, very well; seven for 4420 dollars; averaging 631 dollars, though three of the seven were women. The estate then lost nothing by the sale. Did it lose by the loan of the money ? Not that I can see. The administrator certainly had that power. The estate was credited for the money in account with him; it had the same fund to pay the debts, and that fund at interest. According to the <em>average </em>of the sales, the 920 dollars would not have bought more than one slave and a half; the others were clearly bought with the money of <em>William Whitton. </em>How, then, could this vitiate the whole case ? If this had not been the father who bought, and the brother of the intestate\u2019s widow who was administrator, the idea of fraud would never have entered into the imagination of any body: and yet these facts do not constitute fraud, though in a doubtful and suspicious transaction, they would be circumstances of weight. There is not a doubt that the father bought for the benefit of his child. Who can blame him, if, in saving her from want, he practised no wrong upon any body, but gave a fair and full price for the slaves r We see that he borrowed money from others, and no doubt has repaid them. I think the decree should be reversed, and the injunction reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Brockehbrough and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b209-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ane\">I am clearly of opinion, that the dissolution of the injunction is not to be sustained, upon any principle whatever. I concur with the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the doctrine of fraud <em>per se </em>has no application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to the case, and that there is no difficulty on the question of jurisdiction. I am further of opinion, that there is no fraud or improper conduct on the part of the appellant\u2019s intestate, which ought to exclude him from relief, or subject his property to the execution of the creditors of <em>M\u2019 Daniel, </em>or convert his purchase into a trust for their benefit. Although a confederacy between the administrator of <em>M\u2019Daniel </em>and <em>William Whitton, </em>for the purchase, with <em>JM\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>money, of the incumbered slaves for the benefit of his estate, might have been fraudulent as to his creditors 3 yet a loan of the money of the estate by the administrator <em>bona fide, </em>to enable him to purchase them, for his own use and as his own property, or for the .use of his daughter, would not have been necessarily fraudulent; though if the estate was involved, such a loan would have been imprudent on the part of the administrator, and would'have subjected him to an action of <em>devastavit </em>by a creditor. By such loan, <em>William Whitton became, </em>debtor either to the administrator himself, or to the estate; and the administrator himself became at once chargeable with and liable for the amount, to the creditors of the estate. If the loan had not been made, the' creditor could only have reached the fund by action against the administrator. It was not competent to him to reach the.equity of redemption in these slaves, if they had remained unsold, it being now the settled law that such an interest cannot be reached by execution. The creditor thus has no pretence for complaint, that he has been injured by <em>William Whitton, </em>whatever reason he may have to complain of the administrator; and even as to him, there is no evidence, that at the time of the loan, he was aware of <em>Terry\u2019s </em>demand, which had not then been prosecuted to judgment and execution. The <em>money having been </em>borrowed by <em>Whitton </em>for his own use, it ceased to be, in his hands, the'money \u00f3f <em>M\u2019Daniel\u2019s </em>estate; and the purchase did not therefore cr\u00e9ate a resulting trust for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the benefit of that estate; but the property became absolutely his own, he being debtor to the administrator, or to the estate, to the amount of the loan. The very high price given for the slaves, and the fact that <em>Whit-ton, </em>a moneyed man, borrowed from other quarters also, and paid up the amount of his purchase, afford assurance of the fairness of the transaction; which is further confirmed by its being frankly avowed, and by the fact that the administrator charged himself with the amount of the money loaned. And as there was no fraud,\u2014as <em>Whitton </em>purchased the property, either with his own funds, or with moneys lent to him and which he was responsible to pay,\u2014the property was absolutely his, and was not subject to the execution of a creditor of <em>Daniel. </em>The injunction, therefore, ought not to have been dissolved in the present aspect of the case; and the decree should, therefore, be reversed, the injunction reinstated, and the cause further proceeded in to a final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Decree reversed, and injunction reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
