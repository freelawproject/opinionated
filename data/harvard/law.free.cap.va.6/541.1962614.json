Stone, </em>with <em>Jesse Hughes </em>his surety, was indebted to <em>John Ware, </em>by execution upon a forthcoming bond, in the sum of 23CL 13. 0J: <em>Ware </em>was indebted <em>to Charles Smith, </em>by bond for 351Z. payable February 10th, 1806. Under these , , ,. circumstances, <em>Ware </em>applied to <em>Slone, </em>with the oxeention (which was in Ms own hands,') and said ho would not deliver it to the Sheriff, provided <em>Stone </em>would allow <em>him fifteen per centum per annum, </em>upon the 230/. 13. 95, from the 9th of J anuary 1805, to the 10th of February 1806, and get his father <em>lle%ekiah Stone </em>to become prinoipal in a bond to <em>Charles Smith </em>for pavment of the *\u25a0 . <em>x \" </em>351/. on the last mentioned day; and that he <em>{Ware} </em>would pay the difference between the two debts. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>this proposal, <em>William I. Stone, </em>to prevent the levying of the execution, assented. <em>Ware, </em>being told that such agreement was <em>usurious, </em>drew up an account of the transaction, in which he charged interest at the rate of <em>six per Centum \u2022per annum </em>on the amount of the execution, and added thereto an item of <em>23l.ll. </em>8., <em>\u201cfor sundry services done and </em>settled(without saying what those services were; which sum amounted exactly to <em>nine per centum per annum </em>on the said amount;) producing, with 81\u00cd. 9. 2\u00a7. to be paid by himself to <em>William I. Stone, </em>a total of <em>3511. </em>for which the bond of <em>llezekiah Stone </em>was taken, payable on that day, with <em>William I. Stone, </em>the said <em>Ware, </em>and <em>George Holman </em>his sureties, to <em>Charles Smith, </em>who was altogether ignorant of the usury. On this bond, <em>Smith </em>obtained a judgment at law; whereupon, a Bill for an Injunction, and for general relief, was filed in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Richmond District, by <em>William I. Stone </em>and <em>He%ekiah Stone </em>against <em>Ware </em>and <em>Smith; </em>stating the foregoing facts, with their accompanying circumstances; and alledging that the complainant <em>Heaekiah Stone </em>took it for granted that <em>Ware </em>was to pay his son the real difference between the execution and the required bond, and knew nothing of the usury until after the judgment upon the bond was obtained against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-FM\"><em>Ware </em>answered; insisting that his aforesaid charge for services was not usurious; but submitting to account. This answer was adjudged insufficient; and he filed another, in which he said there had been much talk about 15 per cent., and the sums charged might have been ascertained by a computation at that rate; but that the said sum of <em>231. </em>11. 8 was allowed him for his services in riding about, at a very inclement season of the year, with great danger to his health, and exerting himself to have the arrangement in question concluded, for the relief of the complainant <em>William I. Stone, </em>who considered it very beneficial to him, and declared himself perfectly \u25a0satisfied with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJJl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Smith\u2019s </em>answer denied any knowledge of the Usury, and declared that the bond to him was fairly taken, for the price of a negro sold to <em>Ware.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0kP\">The facts stated in the Bill, <em>against Ware, </em>were supported by affidavits; but no objection appeared to <em>Smith\u2019s </em>conduct in any respect. It was proved that <em>Ware </em>paid to <em>William I Stone </em>the difference, amounting to 81k 9. 2J as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APvt\">Chancellor Tay.cok dissolved the Injunction, and afterwards dismissed the Bill altogether; \u201c being of opi- \u201c nion that however clear it may be that the defendant \u201c <em>John Ware </em>extorted usury from the plaintiffs in the \u201c transactions in the bill mentioned, yet their remedy <em>\u201c </em>was <em>at law, </em>and <em>not in equity; </em>since <em>no discovery </em>is \u201c sought by their Bill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApdB\">The case was brought before this Court by a Petition of appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aq41\"><em>Bouldin </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaE\">made four points on the subject of the Court\u2019s <em>jurisdiction; </em>1st, that <em>Hezekiah Stone </em>shewed sufficient cause for not defending the suit at law, in that he was ignorant of the fact:\u2014on him the transaction was a fraud; and a party\u2019s discovering a material fact <em>after judgment, </em>is good ground for relief in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOFW\">2d, The ordinary rule, that a party shall not apply to a Court of Equity for the relief he might have had at law, does not obtain in cases of <em>Usury. </em>The party oppressed by an Usurer is not <em>particeps criminis, </em>and therefore might, <em>always </em>by bill in Chancery, and <em>now </em>by action at law may, recover back the usurious interest, if:' paid:<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and this, even though the money were paid in obedience to a judgment or decree.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But the Statute against Usury gives the Court of Equity express jurisdiction, Which is not waived by failing to plead at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyTF\">Sd, In this case, the complainants had no remedy at law; the bond <em>to Smith </em>being for a <em>bona fide </em>debt due <em>Mm, </em>without thte least taint of Usury in it. The inducement, by which <em>Smith\u2019s </em>debtor obtained other persons to become bound for the debt, being unknown to him, could not avoid the <em>bond.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1pD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>4th, The defendant Ware, by his answer submitted to~ an accouiit, and can not afterwards object to the jnris diction of the Court. That account should be audited, allowing only legal demands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIga\">On the merits, the Usury is proven by the Answer of Ware himself. Admitting his own statement to be correct, the services charged were rendered, only in secur~ ing and collecting the debt on the execution, for his ownS beneflt:--the sum allowed was therefore clearly usurious.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5K\">Stanard contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIHq\">It being admitted on all hands that the bond to Smith was free from all taint of usury as to him; it follows that, whatever may have been the nature of the contract between Stone and Ware, o relief ought to be given against Smith.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> The Injunction was therefore properly dissolved, and Bill dismissed, as to Smith, who was causelessly made a party; and the case ought to be considered as if he had never been before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As70\">The testimony introduced to prove the Usury as to Ware, is by no means conclusive: but, let it be conceded that the contract was usurious; the question still arises, was Stone entitled to come before a~iy forum, at the time this suit was instituted Not a legal forum; because ho had paid nothing in pursuance of the coiitract:-hc had merely entered into an obligation, jointly with the other party to the usurious agreement, to pay money, and would be puzzled to frame an action that lie could successfully prosecute at law. The like objection holds to the suit in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoMW\">But, suppose the money had been paid, could the Court of Equity hold jurisdiction of this case? That jurisdiction is twofold-ist, under the Statute against Usury; and, ~d, under the general principles that regu~ late those Courts in the application of their powers.-The jurisdiction is not sustainable by virtue of the Sta. tate; 1st, because the Bill is not a Bill for discooerV; and, \u00a3dly, because the statutory remedy, according to the fair interpretation of the Statute, is to be used, only where there is some outstanding contract, or security, on usurious consideration, from the enforcement of w1ii~h <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Ike plaintiff seeks protection; and not to recover back from the defendant money paid to, or contracted to be paid for, him. Neither can such jurisdiction be sustained upon general principles. When the powers of Courts of .Equity are applied to usurious transactions, they are subject to the same limitations as in other cases. The first limitation is, that relief is not to be given where the plaintiff <em>seeks no discovery, </em>or can <em>prove </em>his case without any; which is the case at bar. The decision in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 <em>Munf. 407, </em>is not opposed to this rule; for that decision is based on the consideration that the usurious contract was one to oppose which the plaintiff in equity had no day in Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIkC\">Indeed, there are but three classes of cases where relief is or can be sought, in Equity, from an usurious contract or it\u2019s effects:\u20141st, where there is some outstanding obligation or security which the holder may enforce at law by suit, and which the plaintiff in Equity seeks to have surrendered:\u20142d, where the contract has been carried into effect, the usurious gain paid, and the plaintiff seeks to have it refunded:'\u20143d, where the contract is of such a nature that it may execute itself, or at least be executed without suit; so that the party charged by it lias no day in Court to shew it\u2019s usurious nature in avoidance of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD-h\">The first class falls properly under the Statute, and the Bill is a Bill of <em>discovery. </em>At all events, the case at bar does not belong to it. In the second class, the bill must also be a Bill of <em>discovery; </em>for the party who would <em>prove </em>his ease, would prove himself out of Court. The case at bar does not belong to it, because the money has not been paid, and because the plaintiffs do not rely on a discovery. The third class, though one in which it is not necessary that the Bill should be for a discovery, yet, obviously, does not comprehend the case now in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtN3\">Having considered the question of jurisdiction of the Court below, with respect to the <em>nature </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, I will bestow one moment on the question of the jurisdiction of <em>this </em>Court in relation to it\u2019s <em>amount</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A22\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Suppose the fact of Usury established; the \u00f6bjecti&amp;n~+ that the money has not been paid, out of the way; and the juristhction, as to the subject matter of the claim, clear; what is that claim? ~3l. 1 is. Sd. in it's amplest dimensions I This is all that has been stipulated ~o be paid for usury, or that has been paid, if Mr. Bouldin will have it so; all that the plaintiffs can now, or could in the Court below, pretend to claim, after having (as. before remarked,) in substance, confessed there, that they had no right to relief against the bond or judgment! This sum will not support the jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFuz\">Phe caiis~ was again argued, by the Court's direction; upon two questions; 1st, whether the contract was usuri~ otis; and ~dly, if so, whether there must he a forfeiture of the whole debt, or only of the usurious intereut.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad1k\">Bouldin. 1. The pretence in this case of cornpensa~ tion for services rendered and settled, is a mere s/4ft to evade the Stathte.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIt\">2. The p1ainti~'s are entitled to protection to the full amount of the bond to Smith, in which they were sure~ ties for Ware, who in reality was the principal obligor, although the name of He~ekiah Atone was first inserted and subscribed. By this simple contrivance, the Usurer has made the borrower paymaster of a debt of his. If it can not be defeated, the borrower is bound hand aiul foot, and without remedy. The que~tion before ~the Court is, who ought to pa~j the bond? I answer, the real debtor, who is Ware. Smith, I admit, is entitled to his money; but he ought to get it, not from Stone, but from Ware. The Court, since all the facts are before it, may fix th~ debt on the right person. The order of the signatures to ai~ obligation, though primafacie inducing a presumption that he whose name is first signed is the principal obligor, is not conclusive. It is only by the usurious arrangement, that this differs from the common case of a surety seeking to make his principal responsi. Me in the first place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYI\">The present case is stronger than that of Marks v. Morris. En that case, if a suit had been brought at law to recover the property, the Usury might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>pleaded:\u2014but here, by fraudulent trick and contrivance, defence at law was precluded, and no remedy left but in Equity; for <em>Stone </em>could not plead usury to the bond, which was fair and not usurious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIy\">The ground I have taken is substantially supported by tbe decision of this Court, in <em>West </em>v. <em>Belsches, 5 Munf. </em>194, that every man\u2019s proper debts ought to be -paid out of his own estate. In <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris </em>it was \u2022decided that a Court of Equity will frustrate every scheme by which the Usurer has prevented the plaintiff from taking advantage of the usury at law. The Court ought therefore to decree that <em>Ware alone </em>shall pay tho whole amount to <em>Smith </em>ihe obligee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq3l\"><em>Stanard. </em>Whether the contract now in question was usurious, or not, is a mixed question of law and fact. It appeared to me that the case of the plaintiifs was not made out in point of fact: hut let us suppose the facts ascertained, is it necessarily an usurious contract? I \u25a0contend it is mot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKd-\">Is it usurious for a party owing a debt payable at a \u2022distant day, to obtain, in consideration of present payment, a deduction to a greater amount than legal interest?<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> The substance of this contract was, that <em>Ware </em>gave a present claim, for payment of a demand upon him at a future time, with a particular rebate from that -inand. If <em>Stone </em>had gotten <em>Ware\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Smith, </em>lie might have sold it to <em>Ware, </em>at a large discount, for his execution against him; and such discount would not have been usurious. The case before the Court is the same in substance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGSy\">But if there has been Usury in this transaction, what is the measure of relief which the Court of Equity can give? The appellants call on the Court to <em>enforce a forfeiture o\u00ed </em>the whole debt! The province of a Court of Equity is not to <em>enforce </em>but to <em>relieve </em>against forfeitures, by mitigating the rigour of law. It\u2019s peculiar modes of investigating facts, for this mild and benignant purpose, are most salutary, but, in alliance with a power to enforce, instead of mitigating forfeitures, would be truly -formidable. From <em>Tothilt </em>to <em>Vesey </em>and <em>Beams, </em>there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>no example of that Court\u2019s granting relief, by directly or indirectly inflicting a forfeiture on the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADGA\">The rule in equity is, that the borrower is bound to repay the principal with legal interest, before he gets relief for the exc\u00e9fes; for he that seeks equity must alAvays do equity. Even ivhere the <em>defendant </em>has been guilty of fraud, by taking advantage of youth and inexperience, he shall yet have equity; and that is principal and lawful interest.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> The maxim, that he avIio hath done iniquity shall not have equity, applies only where he is <em>plaintiff.</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even Courts of law, wherever they have discretionary power to subject the party to terms, folloAV a similar rule. <footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> Where usury has been discovered, and the usurious securities destroyed, an express promise to pay the principal with legal interest, has nevertheless been supported.<footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdSX\">Mr. <em>Bouldin </em>contends that the measure of relief should he the amount of the bond from <em>Ware </em>to <em>Smith; </em>although he acknowledges that that bond was fair and conscientious. He wishes a Court of Equity to act as supplemental to a Court of law, to enforce a penalty which the Coui'tof law can not enforce; to make that usurious in equity, which is not usurious at laAv; on the ground <em>that </em>the party has so sheltered himself that the Court of law can not take hold of him! He says that the object is not to enforce a forfeiture in his client\u2019s favour; not to rob <em>Ware, </em>but merely to hold him fast, and compel another to rob him! <em>Smith, </em>it seems, is to be prohibited from recovering any thing from the complainants; but the whole liability for the debt is to fall upon <em>Warel </em>Is not this, to all intents and purposes, enforcing a forfeiture against him?</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdZq\">if there he usury in this case, to what- does it attach? Not to the debt to <em>Smith, </em>as Mr. <em>Bouldin </em>admits. The original fair contract is not infected by the subsequent usurious agreement:\u2014the latter alone is to be set aside.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> And that agreement applies only to the 23l. 11 8; a sum too small to give this Court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoe8\"><em>Bouldin </em>in reply. Arithmetical calculation supports the testimony that the sum allowed amounted <em>to fifteen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>per centum per annum; </em>and <em>Ware's </em>own answer admits the same thing. But Mr. <em>Stanard </em>says, this is not usury. It would require all his ingenuity to make this case resemble that of <em>Barclay v. Walmsley, </em>4 <em>East, 55. </em>It is the plain case of a debtor, hard pressed by a creditor, agreeing to pay, for the sake of forbearance, <em>nine pef cent, </em>in addition to the lawful interest, upon an arrangement that the payment should be made to a creditor of such creditor. The only object, of this Bill is to deprive the usurer of the advantage obtained by him, by which he deprived the borrower of the opportunity of making the defence at law. The principle is the same with that upon which the Court went in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris. </em>The Usurer there, by resorting to a deed of trust, gave the debtor no opportunity at law to plead the usury. So, here, <em>Ware </em>contrived to get <em>Stone </em>bound with him in a bond to <em>Smith, </em>and in such manner as to make <em>Stone </em>apparently the principal debtor; to which bond the plea of usury could not he put in. If <em>Ware </em>himself had not been one of the obligors in that bond, I should have had some difficulty; hut (as it is,) the. Court, to give complete effect to the Act of Assembly, may compel him to pay the debt to <em>Smith, </em>which is his own debt;\u2014may make him the principal obligor, which in fact he is. Otherwise, the Act might always be evaded by the contrivance of binding the borrower to pay the money to a creditor of the lender, instead of to the lender himself. Allow the usurious agreement <em>effect, </em>and my client is the principal debtor to <em>Smith; </em>otherwise not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6uA\">An Usurer is not to be let off more lightly on the ground that the usury is not acknowledged in his answer, but fixed upon him by <em>proof. </em>Under the principles of <em>Bosanquet </em>v. <em>Dashwood </em>referred to by Mr. Stanard, and all the other cases here and in England, the Court of Equity is always open to relieve against fraud, usury and extortion.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A2b\"> <em>Bosauquet </em>v. <em>Dashwood, Cases Temp.

In relation to the appellee <em>Ware, </em>however, the usurious arrangement being proved, the appellants are entitled to relief.
