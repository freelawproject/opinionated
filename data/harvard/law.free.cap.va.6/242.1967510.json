The conditions of which, after reciting the judgments appealed from, proceeded thus: \u201c Now, if the said <em>Walker Maury </em>shall effectually prosecute the said appeal, perform the judgment of the Ge-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>literal Court, and pay all costs and damages which shall be awarded by the said General Court, in case the judgment aforesaid shall be affirmed, then the above obligation to void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d The plaintiff assigned for breaches of the conditions, \u201cThat <em>Walker Maury </em>named in the said condition, did not effectually prosecute the appeal mentioned in the said condition according to the form and effect thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The defendant took <em>oyer </em>of the bond and condition; and plead, \u201c That the said <em>Walker Maury </em>departed this life before the trial of the appeal, for the effectual prosecution of which, this defendant is charged by the plaintiff\u2019s declaration to have bound himself, and the failure in the same, on the part of the said <em>Walker Maury, </em>is assigned as the breach of the condition of the writing obligatory in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration mentioned, whereby an abatement of the said appeal was adjudg\u00e9d by the Court, before whom the said appeal was depending on the fifth day of <em>May, </em>1790, at which time, and at all times since, no revival of the said appeal has been adjudged or effected: Wherefore, he. says that he ought not to be charged, &amp;c. All which he is ready to verify; wherefore he prays judgment, &amp;c.\u201d General demurrer thereto by the plaintiff; and joinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">The second bond, the pleadings, demurrer and joinder, are in all respects the same as the first, except that in the plea the words, \u201c and the failure in the same, on the part of the said <em>Walker Maury </em>is assigned as the breach of the condition of the writing obligatory in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration mentioned,\u201d are omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; and <em>Nelson </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-10\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-11\">It is generally true that the act of God excuses the performance of a condition; and, there is the same reason for it in this as in other cases; because, it was no more practicable for the obligor to have done the act in this than in any other case. If a bond be given to appear and defend a suit, and the defendant dies before the appearance day, the securities are discharged; and the reason is the same here, for the undertaking is personal, that he will prosecute the appeal, and not suffer a voluntary non-suit. The appellee should have sued a <em>scire facias, </em>to revive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the appeal, and not having done so, he waived the benefit security. For, in principle, it stands upon the ground, as an appeal not brought up in two terms; in which case the appellee, who might have brought it up and had damages, cannot afterwards prav them; because, said the Court, he has his advantages in not doing so, as the delay has prevented a <em>supc?'sedeas </em>or writ of error; and similar motives might have actuated the appellee in this case. If the appellee meant to insist on his security, it was his duty to have sued out a <em>scire facias; </em>because, the executor might not have known of the judgment. The case resembles that of bail in error, who are not liable if the principal dies before the decision in the Court of error. 5 <em>Vin. </em>Abr. 528; <em>Roll. </em>Rep. 329. The like principle was asserted in this Court in <em>Keel </em>v. <em>Herbert\u2019s ex\u2019rs. </em>1 Wash. 138: Which expressly decides, that the non-continuance of th\u00e9 suit after the death of one of the parties does not forfeit the bond. For, if so, the executors might have brought suit upon the bond in that case. The same idea is pursued by the Court in 12 <em>Mod. </em>380; where it is said, that nothing but an actual determination of the cause by the voluntary act of the party, or the j'udgment of the Court, will render the securities liable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-8\">Wickham, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-D\">The rule, that the act of God shall excuse the performance of the condition, only applies in those cases, where the executors cannot do the act which is stipulated for, as in th\u00e9 case of the bond for appearance; but, wherever the act may be performed by the executor, it'is necessary that he do it, or the bond is forfeited. Now, here the executor might have prosecuted the appeal; and having failed to do so, the condition of the bond is broken. The case of the appeal, which has not been brought up within two terms, does not apply; because, the appellee could have no such advantages here as in that case, inasmuch as the executors, if there was any error, might, notwithstanding the abatement, have obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>or writ of error. Nor was it necessary for the appellee to have sued a <em>scire facias </em>in order to have apprised them of the appeal, for the law does not admit them to have been ignorant of it. And, if the debtor had died insolvent, so. that no body would administer on his estate, then the appeal could not have been renewed. The case of <em>Keel </em>v. Her<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>beri\u2019s ex\u2019rs. </em>was decided without argument; but, in addition to that, the lirst <em>supersedeas </em>was not served, and so no hindrance to the execution. Two objections appear to have been taken in the case in <em>Roll, </em>one was decided against the security, and the other merely given up by the Court. The case in 12 <em>Mod. </em>does not apply; because, there, the suit died with the party, and could not be revived, in the name of the executors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-4\"><em>.Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">It was expressly decided in the case in <em>Roll, </em>that the death of the principal was a discharge of the security; but, the cause went off, upon the point of prior delay, which was disclosed by the plea. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b265-7\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ADa\">Delivered the resolution of the Court: That conditions of this kind, where the act was to be performed personally by one of the parties, were for the benefit of the obligors; who stood excused, when the act of God, or of the law, prevented the performance. <em>Laughter\u2019s </em>Case, 5 Co. 21. That it rested on the same footing as costs; which are not recoverable, where the party dies, and the suit abates, unless it be revived. That the party here, who was to perform, being dead, it was impossible, that the stipulated act could be done by him, which, therefore, excused the security. But, as the condition of the bond, also, .was, that he should pay the debt, in case the judgment should be affirmed, if an affirmance had taken place after the death of the principal, the securities would have been liable; and it was in the power of the appellee to have sued a <em>scire facias, </em>and obtained a judgment of affirmance, if there was no error: whereas, it was not in the power of the security to have done this; neither could he have compelled the executor to have sued a <em>scire facias, </em>and revived the appeal. That, consequently, as the appellee might have done it, and the security could not, it was more reasonable, that the appellee should suffer for the neglect, than that the security should; especially when it was considered, that if he had actually sued a <em>scire facias, </em>the judgment might, perhaps, have been reversed. So that, although the security was not in danger, if the cause had been brought to a hearing in the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Court, he might be rendered liable, in consequence of the neglect to obtain the <em>scire facias; </em>which never could be right. That the Court was therefore of opinion, that the judgment should be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant, upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
