Garland </em>bis agent, to prevent by Injunction the sale of certain siaves, devised to .the said trustees, which had been taken in execution to satisfy a Judgment, obtained by <em>Galt </em>as a creditor of <em>John C. Carter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\">The clause in the Will creating the trust, was as follows: \u201c Item, I give and bequeath unto my sons <em>Charles \u201c Carter </em>and <em>Edward Carter </em>all that part of my tract of <em>ii </em>land in the County of Amherst which lies on the East <em>\u201c </em>side of Piney Piver, whereon my son <em>John </em>lives, <em>toge- \u201c ther with the slaves and plantation utensils on the said \u201c land; </em>to have and to hold the said Land, Slaves, Stock \u00a3\u00a3 and Plantation Utensils, unto the said <em>Charles Carter \u201c </em>and <em>Edward Carter </em>and their heirs forever: In Trust, \u00a3\u00a3 nevertheless, to and for the following uses and purpos- <em>\u201c </em>es,* that is to say, for the purposes of supporting, with \u00a3\u00a3 the <em>profits </em>of said estate, my son <em>John Carter </em>and his \u00a3\u00a3 wife <em>Apphia Carter </em>and their children, during the life \u00a3\u00a3 of the said <em>John Carter </em>and <em>Apphia Carter </em>and the <em>\u201c </em>longest liver of them, and, after their deaths, in trust \u00a3\u00a3 to be equally divided among the children of the said \u25a0\u00a3\u00a3 <em>John </em>and Apphia, then living, and the legal descendants \u00a3\u00a3 of such as are dead, <em>per stirpes.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">The slaves taken in execution were a negro woman alledged by the Complainants to have been one o\u00ed the \u2022slaves on the plantation,, mentioned in the saidjjclause, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, and several children of .her\u2019s born since that time. It appeared that the trustees had never taken possession of the slaves so devised to them, but left them in the possession and under the control of <em>John C. Carter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">It was contended by <em>Galt </em>and <em>Garland, </em>that, under the Act of Assembly concerning estates holden in trust (Edit, of 1794, 1803 and\u201914, c. 90. s. 15,) the slaves in question, (if in fact the woman <em>Jenny </em>belonged to the, testator at the time of his death, and was comprehended in the devise,) were subject to the debts of <em>John C. Carter </em>the <em>cestmj que trust </em>If not, yet the <em>particular </em>debt, in this case, having been contracted for goods necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and proper for tlie support of the said <em>John C. Carter </em>and liis wife and children, the slaves were liable <em>in equity </em>to satisfy that debt; especially as <em>John C. Carter </em>was enabled, through the negligence of the trustees, to contract debts, upon the credit he obtained in consequence of having those slaves in possession and holding them as his own. But it was also allcdged, that <em>John C. Carter </em>had obtained a complete title to the same slaves, <em>by Jive yearn possession before the death of the </em>testator, who, therefore, had no right to devise them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\">A motion to dissolve the Injunction was overruled, and an order made, that an issue he tried, isto ascertain who <em>\u201c </em>ther the woman <em>Jenny </em>mentioned in the Bill and An* <em>iS </em>swers, was one of the slaves devised,\u201d as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">After this, the Court, by a decree pronounced upon a hill filed in behalf of <em>John C. Carter </em>and wife, and their children, against the plaintiffs in this cause, for the purpose of superseding them as Trustees and substituting another, and upon the answer of the present plaintiffs to that bill, vacated the powers of the said original trustees altogether, and appointed <em>Hill Carter </em>Trustee in their stead; whereupon they, together with the said <em>Hill Carter,moveA </em>the Court to admit him as plaintiff in this cause, and to dismiss them out of Court. They also moved the Court for leave to supersede and vacate the Injunction Bond given by one of the said plaintiffs, upon filing with the Clerk of the Court of Amherst County, in lieu of that bond, another injunction bond, with sufficient security: it being the object of the said <em>Hill Carter </em>to use the ev idence of the said plaintiffs on the trial of the issue before directed. The Court having heard the arguments of Counsel on both sides, decreed that, on the said <em>Hill Carter\u2019s </em>paying into Court the costs which had been incurred by the defendants, and on giving bond and security in Court, in the penalty of g200, conditioned for paying to the defendants all costs which might thereafter accrue to them, <em>he </em>should he admitted plaintiff in the Cause, in lieu of the present plaintiffs; and the issue directed as aforesaid, should he made up between <em>him </em>and the defendants; and also that, upon his giving a new In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>junction bond with sufficient security, and filing the same with the Clerk of the Court of Amherst County, the bond before filed should be vacated, and delivered up to the obligors to be cancelled. The question of compctency, should the present plaintiff\u00bb be introduced ns witnesses on the trial of the issue, was left open, and the defendants at liberty to offer any legal objection to their testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\">On the trial of the issue, before the Superior Court of Amherst County, the plaintiff offered the said original plaintiffs and trustees, as witnesses, to which the defendants objected, but the Court overruled the objection and admitted them; whereupon a Bill of exceptions was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">The defendants moved the Court to instruct the Jury, that, if they believed from the evidence that <em>John C Carter </em>was in peaceable and undisturbed possession of Hie slave Jenny for the space of five years previous to the death of <em>Edward Carter </em>deceased, they ought to fiad that the. said slave Jenny was not devised by the Will of said decedent; which instruction the Court refusing to give, the defendants filed a second bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">The Jury found that the negro woman Jenny, me ntioned in the issue joined, was one of the slaves devised in trust, as before mentioned; and, the verdict being certified, Chancellor Brown made the Injunction perpeiual; without prejudice to the right of the defendants to levy their execution on any property, belonging to the said <em>John C. Carter, </em>other than the property held by the plaintiff as Trustee as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">From this decree, the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-8\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">My first objection to the proceedings is founded on a defect in the devise itself, in which the description of the slaves is too uncertain to make it good against <em>creditors. </em>Their <em>names </em>should have been mentioned, that the creditors might know on which slaves to levy executions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-10\">Such a devise enabled <em>John C. Carter </em>to hold out false colours, to the deception of those who trusted him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-11\">2. After the Bill and Answers filed, the Court had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>right to <em>change </em>the plaintiffs. The suit should have been dismissed, and a new suit brought. H o now hill was filed hy <em>Hill Carter. </em>The Court therefore exceeded it\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzqI\">3. The trustees were not competent witnesses.-The whole question turns upon their negligence, in not interfering, but permitting <em>John C. Carter </em>to act as he pleased. They were liable to an action for gross and palpable brqacli of trust, if <em>Gall </em>recovered; and, therefore, were directly interested to defeat his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq66\">4. The terms of the issue were, perhaps, too narrow, in confining the enquiry to the question whether the slave Jenny was comprehended in the devise in trust. If the issue was not too narrow', the Judge ought to have admitted the evidence offered to shew <em>John C. Carter\u2019s </em>title independent of the Will.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiL\">5. Upon the merits or the case, appearing from the depositions filed, the ChaniceUor ought not to have made the Injunctton perpetual, hut should have dismissed the Bill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYP\">Ho Counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ac5q\"> Gay v. Moseley, 2 Munf. 543.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AYU\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"Aqbh\">pronounced the following opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AHEa\">The Court is unwilling, without necessity and on full argument on both sides, and deliberation, to decide a most important question made and occurring in this case; namely, whether the omission of the testator to describe the trust negroes hy name, or hy any other description than that <em>of being on a certain tract of land, </em>is such a circumstance of negligence or omission, as would, in favour of creditors, subject the said negroes to their claims. On the one hand, it would be easy, (as negroes have names,) to describe them by those names; thus affording a better criterion for the government of creditors than the one before us: it is also clear, that a description of this kind is well calculated to enable a fraudulent done# to cover more property than is actually conveyed under the description. On the other hand, it is questionable, whether a description which is entirely competent to convey the property to the donees, and is very usual, should be held incompetent so far as it respects creditors, on account of its tendency to let in frauds. The question is not without difficulty, and in its consequences, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>very important. We leave it' therefore open for future discussion and decision, when it shall hereafter <em>occur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In the case before us, the issue directed by the Chancellor, and actually tried, seems restricted, to the fact whether the slave <em>Jenny </em>was one of those on the plantation mentioned in the Will of <em>Edward Carter; </em>and, being thus restricted, the opinion of the Judge who tried that issue, and which rejected evidence tending to shew that <em>John C. Carter </em>had acquired a property in the slave by means Of a five years possession, was not erroneous. That enquiry was not submitted to the Jury by the <em>issue. </em>But, that fact being put in issue by the <em>answers', </em>and it being at least <em>doubtful </em>on the evidence; we are of opinion that the issue should have been extended to embrace that enquiry also; and, that there is error in the decree in not having made such extension; it being extremely clear that, if such possession did exist in <em>John C. Carter </em>for five years before his fathers death, it vested the property in him, as to his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The Court is also of opinion, that, admitting the power of the Court of Chancery to change the plaintiffs in this suit, for the purpose of making them competent witnesses, upon the terms stated in the proceedings, the Injunction bond, previously given in this case, should not have been decreed to be given up and cancelled, and another substituted in it\u2019s room, without <em>notice </em>duly given to the appellants of such intended substitution; in order that they might, if they pleased, shew cause against it; 'and that, for want of such notice, the said bond was irregularly ordered to be cancelled. The decree is therefore to be reversed, and the cause remanded, that the proceedings may he reformed in these particulars, and the cause proceeded in, to a final decree-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
