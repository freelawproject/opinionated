That, in a few days afterwards, the plaintiff enquired of <em>Hicks </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Campbell, </em>whether they had heard any more of the matter? That they answered they had \u25a0 not, and advised the plaintiff to apply to the defendants. That the plaintiff applied to <em>Buck </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2019 <em>Brander </em>accordingly, between the 1st and 16th of <em>November% </em>Told them that <em>Hicks fy </em>Campbell-were purchasing for him, and offered <em>2s. </em>That the defendants said, they had been authorised by <em>Mosely </em>to sell, in order to pay a debt due themselves; but he had desired them not to take 3s. until he advised with them: That they would write to him mentioning the plaintiff\u2019s offer, and in the mean time would enquire of the value. That the plaintiff told them, if <em>Mosely </em>would not take that price, to let him have the refusal, as he would give as much or more, than any other person, for it. That the defendants promised to do so; and one of them afterwards told the plaintiff that he had written, hut no answer had come to hand. That the plaintiff again offered <em>2s. </em>which that defendant said he believed was the price, and, -if <em>Mosely </em>would take it, the plaintiff should have the lands. That he would let the plaintiff know, when he 'heal\u2019d from him. That the plaintiff had, from \u2022the commencement, resolved to give 2s. <em>6d. </em>if he could not get the lands for less. That all this related to two surveys only, of 1000 acres each; for the plaintiff did not know that <em>Mosely </em>owned more. That the defendant Brander, afterwards, told the plaintiff, there were upwards of 2,600 acres, and that Anderson, the surveyor, had a claim for his fees, or for a proportion of the lands, and asked the plaintiff\u2019s opinion, which would be best. That the plaintiff advised him to pay the fees; and offered to advance the money, and take the whole lands at <em>2s. </em>deducting the fees. That the plaintiff continued to apply to the defendants to know if they had heard from <em>Mosely; </em>and was always told that they had not; although they had written him several times. That the plaintiff was hound by his offer, if the lands had fallen in value, and always kept the money ready. That he did not apprehend any unfair dealings in the defendants with whom he was intimate; but relied on their integrity; and never suspected that they wished to buy themselves. That the defendant <em>Buck, </em>at length told the plaintiff that he believed <em>Brander </em>had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>letter </em>from <em>Mosely, </em>who consented to take 2s.; but that there was some difficulty with respect to an overcharge, for the surveyor\u2019s fees. That the plaintiff answered, that cireumstanee should make no difference; for, he would look to the surveyor himself; and desired <em>Buck to tell Brander </em>so. That <em>Buck, </em>at going off, said, for the first time, that he believed <em>Brander </em>intended to keep the lands. That the plaintiff went to <em>Brander </em>and insisted on the contract; but <em>Brander </em>refused, saying all that he had pro-raised to the plaintiff was, that the plaintiff should have <em>the refusal; </em>and that <em>Kinkaid </em>had bargained for the land <em>for Buck 4' Brander; </em>who had written him to do so. That the plaintiff replied, that the defendant had always informed him, that he. had written to <em>Mosely, </em>which he admitted; but said, it was only a difference in names, and not in substance. That the plaintiff mentioned what <em>Buck </em>had said; l-elative to the overcharge for surveyor\u2019s fees; but <em>Brander </em>said <em>Buck </em>was mistaken; for only the legal fees were paid. That the plaintiff then offered <em>2s. 6d. </em>the price he first intended to go to, if <em>Mosely </em>had l'efused <em>2s. </em>But the defendants l'efused; upon which the plaintiff tendered the money for the said 2,000 acres at 2s. The bill, therefore, prays a conveyance of the 2,000 acres and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\"><em>Buck </em>and <em>Brander, </em>the defendants, plead the act of General Assembly, <em>[Nov. </em>30, 1785, c. 64, 12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>160,] to prevent frauds and perjuries, to the discovery'; and by answer they state: That they were interested in two concerns, one in <em>Manchester, </em>and the other in <em>Buckingham: </em>In which last, <em>Robert Kincaid </em>was a partner. That both were dissolved, previous to any of the transactions in the bill mentioned.' That <em>Brander </em>settled, the affairs of the <em>Manchester </em>business, and <em>Kinkaid </em>those of the <em>Buckingham </em>business. That <em>Mosely </em>owed the firm of <em>Kinkaid </em>&amp; <em>Co. 355l. 19s. 3d. </em>(on which judgment had been obtained;) and <em>Kinkaid &amp; Co. </em>were indebted to <em>Buck 4 Brander. </em>That <em>Mosely </em>told the defendants, he had 2,666 acres of land; but, expected 666 acres would go to pay the surveyor. <em>That he </em>had offered the balance of 2,000 acres to <em>Hicks 4 Campbell, </em>who .offered him <em>2s. per </em>acre; but, from their anxiety to purchase, he thought they would give more. That, he asked the defendants to apply to <em>.Bnderson </em>the surveyor, pay him his fees, and endeavor to sell the lands to the best advantage, or retain them to the use of <em>Buck 4 Brander; </em>in either case ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>diting his account with the amount of the sales: But added, at the same time, that if the defendants should sell the lands, lie hoped they would give <em>Hicks &amp;r Campbell </em>the refusal, as he had promised the same to them. That at this time, <em>Buck </em>was from home, and <em>Brander </em>wanted to consult; or the bargain might, perhaps, have been then made: But, as it was, <em>Brander </em>only said that he would endeavour to sell the lands for the best price that could be gotten, and would correspond with <em>Kinkaid </em>concerning them. That <em>Brander </em>conversed with several, but found none willing to give as much as <em>Hicks fy Campbell; </em>although he learnt from <em>Quarles </em>that the lands would rise in value. That, upon <em>Buck\u2019s </em>return, the defendants resolved to take the lands, and thereupon a correspondence was opened with <em>Kinkaid, </em>about them. That one part of the contract with <em>Mosely, </em>was, that he should have a further stay of execution, for the balance of the money. That, betwee\u2019n the time that the defendant was entrusted to sell, and the purchase of <em>Mosely, </em>the plaintiff frequently threw himself in the way of the defendants, and conversed about the lands; once at <em>Hicks fy Campbell\u2019s; </em>who followed the defendant <em>Brander </em>and said, if more was offered than they had offered, they would give as much as any man; and asked the refusal; which the defendant promised. That, from conversation with the plaintiff on the subject, the defendant found out, that giving a preference to <em>Hicks </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2019 <em>Campbell </em>and to the plaintiff was the same thing. Perhaps, at other times, the defendant might have promised the refusal to the plaintiff: Knows that under the impression, that <em>Hicks fy Campbell </em>and the plaintiff were all one, the defendant did make the promise of a refusal <em>to </em>him. That the defendant never offered the land to the plaintiff; but, having from the first determined to buy himself, he wished to avoid the plaintiff; who, he \u2018feared, might take some unfair advantage of him, with Mosely. Possibly the defendant might have mentioned <em>Mosely\u2019s </em>name to the plaintiff; but, <em>supposes, it was in </em>such a way, as to shew the correspondence was carried on, through the medium of <em>Kinkaid. </em>Admits the tender, after the plaintiff knew that the defendants intended to take the lands themselves. That the defendants did not pay the fees, on the first interview with <em>Jlnderson: </em>That the plaintiff advised him to pay them; and said, that he would advance the money, and take the whole, deducting the fees: To which the defendant made no reply. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the plaintiff once said to <em>Buck, </em>that he would give more, than o,9.. and) that he and <em>Hicks Campbell </em>were the same thing. That from the first application to the defendant <em>Buck, </em>the plaintiff was told the land was to be sold to pay a debt due to <em>Kinkaid 8? Co.; </em>that <em>Buck fy Brander </em>were to have the money; and, that he did not know that the' lands would be for sale, which might have induced a belief, that the defendants intended to take them. That the defendant <em>Buck </em>never made any contract with the plaintiff, or promised him the refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ape\">Amongst the exhibits filed in the cause, are, the agreement between <em>Mosely </em>and the defendants for the purchase of lands: an acknowledgment by <em>Hicks %\u2022 Campbell, </em>that they were treating for the benefit of the plaintiff: a letter from the defendant, <em>Brander, </em>to <em>Kinkaid, </em>(referred to in the answer,) mentioning that <em>Mosely </em>had authorised the defendants to sell. That, agreeable to his instructions, they had offered 2,000 acres for sale, giving, as he wished, a preference to <em>Hicks 8; Campbell, </em>who seemed steady, as to price, and offered no more than <em>2s. </em>That he afterwards applied to <em>Pickett, Fenwick, Quarles </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>but none of them would give as much as <em>Hicks Campbell. </em>That, finding the above price might be got any day, he wished <em>Kinkaid </em>to mention it to <em>Mosely, </em>and ask his concurrence in a sale. That it was probable, if <em>Buck </em>\u00bfr <em>Brander </em>could spare the money, they might take; and that he supposed a sale, to them, might be as agreeable, as to <em>Mosely. </em>That, if <em>Mosely </em>agreed to the sale, he might credit him for the same by <em>Buck Brander.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">Another letter from <em>Kinkaid </em>to <em>Brander; </em>informing him, that <em>Mosely </em>will let him have the lands; although he had hoped for, and expected something better. A third letter from <em>Brander </em>to <em>Kinkaid; </em>stating, that he, as well as <em>Mosely, </em>had once hoped to get more from <em>Hicks 8? Campbell, </em>from their anxiety to purchase of <em>Mosely, </em>or at all events to have a preference, from whom he should empower to sell the land; a promise, which they said they had obtained; and he believed that they had promised <em>Mosely, </em>if any body would give more, that they would eome up to it: but, he believed, it was only to gain their object, as they were the highest bidders in the market by a third: That it was not till after two applications to <em>Hicks 8,' Campbell, </em>(who were steady in the price of <em>2s.) </em>that he thought of taking the lands on account of <em>Buck 8,- Brander: </em>That, if <em>Mosely </em>was dissatisfied, he was at liberty to make the most of the lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The Court of Chancery was of opinion, that the act of Assembly, to prevent frauds and perjuries, was not plead-able by the defendants; but, that they were trustees for <em>Copland; </em>and ordered a conveyance, upon <em>payment </em>of the money, or a tender thereof. Prom which decree, <em>Buck 8/ Brander </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-3\">Warden, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-4\">The act of Assembly is express, that no suit can be maintained on a parol agreement; and, at law, no action would have lain. Courts of Equity have been extremely cautious not to depart from the principles of the statute which is a beneficial one, and ought to be adhered to. <em>[Montacute </em>v. Maxwell,] 1 P. Wms. 618; <em>[Hawkins </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>Ibid.] 770; <em>Pow. </em>on Contr. 281. But, our act of Assembly is more extensive in its operations than the act of Parliament in England. For, the recital of the preamble, in the <em>British </em>statute, seems to countenance the idea, that particular cases only were intended to be provided for; hut, our act was manifestly intended to include all cases of parol agreements not particularly excepted by the words of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-5\">Nor will the admission in the answer <em>help the </em>plaintiff\u2019s case; because the act of Assembly has been plead, and insisted on., 1 <em>Fonb. </em>Treat. Eq. 165, [180, <em>2d </em>Am. ed.] Besides, the answer does not admit any precise agreement; nor does the bill charge one, but merely a promise of refusal; and <em>Copland </em>had not agreed on any particular price, nor could have been, forced to give the best price in the market.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-6\"><em>Call </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">As the defendants have confessed the agreement in their answer, a performance may he decreed. <em>[Gunter </em>v. <em>Halsey,] </em>Ambl. 586; [per Ld. Mansfield, in <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Metiver,] </em>1 Wm. Black. 600; <em>[Lacon </em>v. <em>Mertins,] </em>3 Atk. 1. This rule has no exception, where there is an express confession \u25a0 of the contract. For, the distinction is, where the statute is plead, and the agreement denied, and where the statute is plead, and the agreement confessed. In the first case, you cannot resort to evidence to disprove the answer; but, in the other, you may hold the defendant to his confession. Because, there is no danger of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>either fraud or perjury, the two evils which the statute was intended to guard against. It is like a declaration at law, which need not state that the agreement was in writing, but it is sufficient to prove it on the trial; and, if the defendant confesses the action, judgment will be rendered against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArT\">The doctrine in 1 <em>Fonb. </em>Treat. Eq.' 165, \u00a3180, 2d <em>Am. </em>ed.] does not overthrow this reasoning. 1. Because that was but the solitary <em>dictum </em>of a single Judge, in a case where, it appears, the plea was over-ruled. 2. Because the ground he put it on, is not the true one; and never was assumed in any case before. For, a man, by omitting to plead a general statute, does not lose the benefit of it: which is proved by the cases at common law, where the defendant does not plead the statute, but takes exception at the trial. The rule on the act of limitations is no answer; for, that proceeds upon a different ground; namely, that there are exceptions in the statute, as infancy, coverture, and absence beyond seas; which the plaintiff ought to have an opportunity of shewing. So that the difference is, where the plaintiff has a right to be informed of the nature of the defence, and where he has not. But, as the statute of frauds contains no exceptions, the defendant is not bound to plead it; because, the plaintiff stands in no need of the information. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Hence, the reason, given in the <em>dictum, is </em>not only unfounded in principle, but is not the ground of any decision. 3. Because, Lord Thtjrlow does not adopt that reason, in the opinion which he afterwards delivered; which, if it had been considered as sound, he certainly would have done; because it would have relieved him from a great deal of nice-discussion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-5\">The cases, therefore, may all be resolved into Lord Thurmw\u2019s distinction. That the plaintiff shall not produce evidence <em>aliunde </em>to disprove the answer; but if the answer does confess the agreement, as the plaintiff has no occasion to resort to evidence, the defendant shall be held to his confession. [<em>Whitchurch </em>v. <em>Bevis.] 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 567.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-6\">Nor is it material that the plea in that case was ultimately allowed. For, the last decree did not decide against the ground taken in the first, but turned on quite distinct principles; namely, I. The difference between the contract stated in the bill, and that confessed in the answer. <em>2. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The original incompleteness of the contract; which was not definitive, but left a <em>locus penitentise: </em>Therefore, the Court, so far from over-ruling the doctrine, clearly admits that it will prevail; and consequently ought to be understood as having decided upon the circumstances of that particular case.' Of course, as the defendants have substantially admitted all the allegations of the bill in the present case, they are bound by their confession; and the more especially, as it is the case of a trust. <em>[Cottington </em>v. <em>Fletcher,] 2 </em>Atk. 155. For the rule is, that the statute never shall be interposed to cover and protect a fraud. 1 <em>Fonb. </em>Treat. Eq. 171, [186.] And, as the defendants were.the agents of both parties, and had, in effect, undertaken to procure the lands for the plaintiff, they will not he allowed to disappoint him, and take the purchase to themselves, under a pretence, that, as the agreement was not in writing, it cannot be carried into effect. [<em>Waller </em>v. <em>Hendon </em>et al.] <em>2 Eq. Ca. Abr. </em>50, <em>pl. 26. [Akins </em>et al. v. <em>Rowe,] </em>Mosely\u2019s Rep. 39.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-4\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">This is probably the first case on our statute, and the <em>English </em>decisions proceed upon false principles. The doctrine in effect, goes so far as to say, if a man is honest and tells the truth, he is gone; but, if he will be base enough to tell a falsehood, and deny the truth, he is safe. However, even upon the <em>English </em>cases, the plaintiff cannot succeed. For, the distinction is, where only the plea states the statute, and where the plea and answer both state it: <em>[Croyston </em>v. <em>Baynes,] </em>Prec. Ch. 208. But, in this case, the answer expressly insists upon the benefit of the statute; and, thei\u2019efore, it does not fall within the principles of those decisions. The case of <em>Whitchurch </em>v. <em>Bevis, 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 567, was ultimately decided upon the authority of <em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Bagnel, </em>in the House of Lords, 1 Bro. P. C. [345, <em>Toml. </em>ed.] which appears to have exploded the doctrine, that a confession in the answer would avoid the plea of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">But, be that as it may, the plaintiff, upon his own shewing, was not entitled to recover. For he does not state, (and much less, does the answer confess) any positive agreement. It was merely a promise of the refusal, and not an undertaking to procure the lands for the plaintiff. Therefore, he might decline taking them, when they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>offered. Indeed, the very promise of a refusal implies a right to reject the offer. But both parties must be bound or neither. <em>Cook v. Oxley, </em>3 T. R. 653. Which is consistent with the doctrine laid down by the Court, in the latter part of the case of <em>Whitchurch </em>v. <em>Bevis, </em>Bro. C. C. There was consequently no contract, which could be the foundation of an action; and therefore, the plaintiff was clearly not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-8\">But, the decree is erroneous upon another ground; namely, that <em>Mosely </em>was no party to the suit. Because he was essentially interested in the' question; and the'rule is, that all parties, having any interest in the matter to be decided, ought to be plaintiffs or defendants to the suit. <em>Harr. </em>Ch. Prac. 38, 41. Therefore, as <em>Buck </em>and <em>Brander </em>have not the legal title, but merely possession of the surveys, a decision between them and <em>Copland </em>may eventually affect the interest of <em>Mosely; </em>who ought consequently to have an opportunity of defending his own interests.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-9\">There is no pretext for saying that <em>Buck </em>and <em>Brander </em>were the agents of <em>Copland. </em>No evidence shews that they undertook to perform any thing for him; and they expressly deny that they were agents.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-10\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-11\">The. case of <em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Bagnel, </em>is probably inaccurately stated in the report of <em>Whitchurch </em>v. <em>Bevis; </em>which is the only account we have been able to procure of it, at this place. But, at any rate, that case affords nothing contrary to the doctrine we contend for. Because it appears, that there was no answer in the cause; and therefore there could have been no decision upon the point of confession, whatever the abridgment of the case may state. For, the Lords never give any reasons for their judgment; but content themselves with a silent vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-12\">The case of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>3 T. R. is a strange one; and seems contrary to an opinion in the year books. 5 <em>Vin. </em>Abr. 515. <em>pl. </em>10, 11. But, at any rate, it will not affect the present case, because here was an absolute agreement to take at two shillings; and <em>Copland </em>was positively hound for that sum. . Therefore, the refusal only applied to the case, of more than two shillings being offered by some other person; and it is to the latter event only, that the case of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Oxley, </em>will bear any application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>There was no necessity for making <em>Mostly </em>a party; because no conveyance of the lands from him to the defendants, was necessary; the assignment of the survey and papers was sufficient. So that the defendants are in possession of a title which they can make effectual, without any further act from <em>Mostly; </em>And that will enable us to proceed against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-4\">Cur. <em>adv. </em>milt.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">[* See <em>Givens </em>et ux. v. <em>Calder, </em>2 Desaus.

For, if we understand the nature of it, as stated in the bill, it is to obtain the transfer of a fraudulent contract, supposed to have been made by <em>Buck </em>and Brandtr, as trustees for Copland, with <em>Mostly; </em>without allowing the latter any satisfaction for the injury, or even making him a party to .the suit; although he was original owner of the land, and the person on whom the fraud was first and principally committed: Since it is charged, that <em>Buck </em>and <em>Brandtr </em>concealed from Mm, the offer by Mr. <em>Copland </em>of two shillings <em>per </em>aci\u2019e, and of more than any other person would give for the land. So that according to that statement, <em>Mosely </em>had a right to set aside the contract with <em>Buck </em>and Brandtr, and to have the land restored to him again: And as <em>Copland </em>had made no contract with him, he could derive no claim from the sale to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">But Mr. <em>Copland </em>insists, <em>that </em>he confided in <em>Buck S\u00a1 Brandtr </em>to make the purchase for him; <em>that, </em>by promising to write to <em>Mosely </em>on his behalf, they thereby became invested with a fiduciary character; and were converted into trustees for him, as well as for Mostly: <em>that, </em>acting as trustees for <em>Mostly, </em>they had promised him a refusal of the land, and, therefore, ought not to have purchased for themselves without his consent: <em>that, </em>such trusts are not within the statute of frauds, hut a Court of Equity will enforce an execution of them; and, therefore, <em>that </em>the plea in the present case will not avail the defendants, who being in possession of the lands and title papers, are noi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>entitled to hold them; but ought to convey them to him, an\u00bf not enjoy the benefit arising from their own misconduet.</p>\n<p id=\"A25S\">But how is the trust proved? <em>Stick \u00a7 Brander </em>deny it. They aver that they bad power from <em>Mosely </em>either to sell the lands or retain them to their own use, in part of the debt due to them; and that they only promised a refusal to <em>Copland, </em>in case they, should sell. They deny, that they ever wrote, or engaged to write to Mr. <em>Mosely, </em>for or on behalf of <em>Copland, </em>or made any other \u00a1promise, than a refusal, in case more than two shillings <em>per </em>acre should be offered; finally, they deny that they ever had any offer made to them by <em>Copland </em>or any other person, of more than two shillings <em>per </em>acre, until after the agreement was made with Mr. <em>Mosely, </em>for the purchase on their own account; although they admit that Mr. <em>Copland, </em>(who, according to his own statement, at last only tendered two shillings,) sometimes stated that he would give more, but \u201e did not say how much. In all which respects the answer is <em>not </em>contradicted, <em>or </em>disproved by <em>any testimony in </em>the cause; and, as it is reponsive to the bill, the facts as therein stated, must be taken to be true.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> So, that the trust is so far from being confessed, that it is positively denied, and the plaintiff produces no evidence to establish it. Of course the arguments bottomed on the trust all vanish; and the plaintiff had no foundation for relief upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"Akr\">But, if the trust was established, yet <em>Mosely, </em>who was so much, interested, and is said to have been injured by the transaction, ought to have been made a party. For, surely a Court of Equity would not decree all the benefit of the fraud, if one was committed, to the plaintiff only; and give him the whole gain arising from the misconduct of his own trustees. On the contrary, we suppose, that in such a case, a* Court of Equity would set aside the sale to <em>Buck \u00bf\u00a1- Brander; </em>and (as the promise to Mr. <em>Copland </em>was only of a refusal of the land, so that he might perhaps be allowed <em>to take it or not as he </em>pleased,) <em>direct a new </em>sale. By. which means <em>Copland </em>would have an opportunity of bidding for it, and by a fair public sale, justice would be done to <em>Mosely, </em>the party most injured in the business; and who was conscientiously entitled to the best price that could be gotten for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>But as no trust is proved, and no agreement in writing shewn, Mr. <em>Copland </em>has no equity; but was completely barred by the plea. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ^</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">^ The decree of the Court of Chancery, therefore, is to be reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">[* See <em>Ante, </em>1 vol. 224, <em>Maupin </em>v.
