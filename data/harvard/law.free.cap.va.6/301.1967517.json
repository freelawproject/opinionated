That besides the above balance, the plaintiff claims an account for 800 weight of coffee, part of the said cargo, kept by himself, and to be paid for in tobacco at the same rate. That the coffee was then worth 3,720?. paper currency. That, on the 18th of <em>April, </em>1781, <em>Holloway </em>transmitted to the plaintiff, then resident in <em>Baltimore </em>in <em>Maryland, </em>notes for 143 <em>hhds. </em>of tobacco, amounting, inclusive of warehouse expenses, to 118,926?. 18s. pretending that it was received from the purchasers of the consignment. That the whole of this tobacco, was shortly after, destroyed by the <em>British; </em>and the plaintiff believes a considerable part of it, being the tobacco of <em>Holloway </em>and not of the plaintiff, was fraudulently sent, when <em>Holloway </em>apprehended the <em>British </em>would destroy it. That in 1780, the plaintiff likewise consigned to <em>Holloway, </em>the schooner <em>Blossom, </em>with her cargo; the nett proceeds of which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>amounted to 33,461/. 16s. of which, the plaintiff has re\u2022ceived 33,171 dollars, continental money, leaving a balance due the plaintiff of 23,510/. 10s. payable in tobacco, at 70/. <em>per cwt. </em>The bill therefore prays an account, and payment of the balance; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">The answer admits the said sum of 7,726/. 2s. <em>Ad. paper currency, </em>on 21st <em>August, </em>1781, and that the same was payable in tobacco, at 70/. <em>per cwt. </em>It also admits the coffee to have been on hand, upon the 19th of <em>August, </em>1781; but refers to an account to shew how it was disposed of. Insists, that the tobacco notes remitted, were the property of the plaintiff, and not fraudulently sent; but that they were honestly remitted, the plaintiff having then actually sent for 100 <em>hhds.; </em>and, at that time, that there was little or no prospect, that the <em>British </em>would go to <em>Petersburg. </em>That the cargoes were sold at the customary credit of the place, as no directions to the contrary were given; and there are sundry outstanding debts, due from' the purchasers. That proper steps have been taken to collect the same; but several of the defendants have plead the act of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">The Court of Chancery referred the accounts to a commissioner; who allowed the plaintiff the charge for the coffee, and the other debits; but credited <em>Holloway </em>for the 143 <em>hhds. </em>of tobacco sent; and reported a balance of 28,929/. <em>9s. Id. </em>payable in tobacco, at 70/. <em>per cwt </em>amounting to 41,328 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, with interest on the whole balance, from the 1st of <em>September, </em>1781, until paid. The commissioner refused to make any allowance to the executors, for the outstanding debts, there being, as he alledged, no proof of proper steps taken to collect them; and <em>Holloway, </em>when he rendered his accounts, had not excepted them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-9\">The plaintiff excepted to the report, for having credited the 143 <em>hhds. </em>tobacco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-10\">The defendants also excepted to the report. 1. Because the outstanding debts were not allowed, as the proper steps to recover them, had been taken. 2. Because the estate could at most only have been liable for actual ascertained failures; and none such were shewn; on the contrary, in one instance, that of <em>Banister, </em>the whole dispute was, whether it should be paid in money, or the certificate given for it, by the public? for whose use, the \u2022commissioner, as executor of <em>Banister, </em>alledged it was bought. 3. Because the commissioner had debited the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>defendants with the coffee. 4. Because the commissioner liad turned a <em>debit </em>of 20 half Johannes, into paper ney, at 140 for one, and then re-charged it in tobacco, at 70/. <em>per nut. </em>5. Because interest was allowed from <em>Sept ember, </em>1781.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\">The Court of Chancery, disallowing the plaintiff\u2019s exception, established the credit to the defendant for the 140 <em>hhds. </em>tobacco; and declared its opinion, that the outstanding debts ought to be credited, if the proper steps were taken to recover them, and they would now give a power of attorney to the plaintiff to collect them. That the half Johannes ought to stand in money, and reserving the question of interest, re-committed the report to the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">The commissioner, in his second report, corrected the charge as to the half Johannes, stating it at 48/. specie; but, in other respects, he reported the balance, as in his former report. In his remarks, he stated: <em>That </em>the defendants had filed a list of the outstanding debts, with a power of attorney to the plaintiffs to collect them. <em>That, Holloway </em>died on the 19th of October, 1781; soon after which, an agent was appointed to manage the estate; and when he left <em>Petersburg, </em>another agent was appointed; both persons of known ability; and, therefore, that the defendants insisted, they had done all that was incumbent on them. <em>That, Banister\u2019s </em>debt was for a hogshead of rum bought for public use, and that the agent would not accept of the certificate. <em>That, </em>the defendants had produced a memorandum in the hand-writing of <em>Stewart, </em>who is now dead, but was a clerk to <em>Holloway, </em>in order to shew, that the coffee (with many other articles,) was sent into the country, out of the way of the enemy; and, as their testator died soon after, that they presume it was lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>Holloway\u2019s </em>letter, to <em>Cursen, </em>of <em>August </em>19th, 1781, says, he has about <em>80Olbs. </em>of coffee on hand, of which a bag is kept for the plaintiff according to instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-9\"><em>Stewart\u2019s </em>memorandum referred to in the report is headed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-10\"><em>A list of sundry goods, lodged with sundry persons belonging to </em>John Holloway, <em>deceased, </em>1781.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-11\">And it is an entry in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-12\">\u201c In the hands of <em>Baker </em>and <em>Bloio, </em>some sugar and coffee, at <em>Wine-Oak, </em>belonging to <em>Richard </em>Cursen, S.

Not the first; because the sales were chiefly made in 1781, and the debts from the situation of the country, could not be collected during his life-time, as he died in <em>October, </em>1781; and therefore, no blame attached on him: Not the second; because, if some little time'</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-15\">for the funeral, the qualifying of the executors, their making themselves acquainted with the testator\u2019s affairs,' and for the inclemency of the season, is allowed, it will be found, that they could not have been in a situation, to have commenced the collection, until the spring of 1782; by which time the six months act of limitations had barred the claims; and, therefore, no blame attaches on the executors either.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-16\">But the fault was in the plaintiff himself. For, the executors could not regularly have proceeded to collect, without authority from him; to whom the debts belonged, and who might have them collected or not as he thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>proper. Ho did not give this authority though, or cab for the debts. But he ought to have done one or the <em>other;et </em>and, therefore, if there has been any improper delay, it is imputable to himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-3\">The executors, however, used as much diligence as the nature of things would admit of. They appointed agents to manage the estate and collect the debts; which agents proceeded in the collection, as well as they could; and, if they failed in their attempts, it was the misfortune of the plaintiff, and not the fault of the executors, who did more than their duty required; and, therefore, instead of meeting with repi\u2019oacb, they have merited the thanks of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-4\">But it is, certainly, a proceeding of the first impression, to attempt to subject the executors to a loss of the debts, when the consignor appears to have taken no proper steps lo recover them. The principles of universal justice demand, that the debtor should have been first discussed; because, he might have made satisfaction; and then there would have been no ground, even in pretence, for complaint against the consignee or his executors; who could, at most, only be liable for culpable negligence. But the plaintiff does not venture to charge them with any; nor, indeed, could he; for he was, throughout 1781, willing that the balances should remain in the hands of the debtors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">It is no argument to say, that <em>Holloway </em>did not, in terms, object to bad debts, when he returned the accounts to the plaintiff; for that was unnecessary, because the law implied it. Besides, in his letter of the 19th of <em>dlugust, </em>1781, he says, he cannot make the accounts more accurate, owing to the confusion his books and papers were in, from, the situation of the country; which shews, he was merely making a general estimate, for the plaintiff\u2019s satisfaction, without meaning to descend to particulars. In such a state of things, an exception was not to be looked for by the \u25a0 one, nor thought of by the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">The coffee was clearly an improper charge against 'the estate; because, the memorandum of <em>Stewart </em>shews, that part was deposited with <em>Baker </em>and <em>Blow </em>to be sent to the plaintiff, who had written for it; and, that another part was deposited with <em>Wilson </em>in the country, to be put out of the reach of the enemy; and, that it was afterwards \u2022 sold to <em>Pride, </em>and not kept by <em>Holloway </em>for himself, as the bill supposes. The conduct of Holloway, therefore, was perfectly correct; and of burse nothing like miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>duet, with regard to it, can be imputed to him; but, this ar^c]^e stands involved in the common calamity of the times, which the plaintiff must bear, as he has nothing to object, with respect to it, in the conduct either of the consignee or his executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-4\">Nothing can be more untenable than the attempt to subject the estate to the payment of <em>Banister\u2019s </em>debt. For, it is not pretended to be lost, but the whole question was, whether a certificate, or money should be received. Of course, there is not the slightest colour for this charge. Because, if <em>Banister </em>bought the rum for the public, it is a debt due from the public; and, therefore, the plaintiff must receive payment in the mode, in which other creditors of the public are paid. At all events, it is a matter between the plaintiff and- the public, or the executors of <em>Banister, </em>and not between the plaintiff and the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC3\">The claim of interest on the part of the plaintiff cannot be supported. It is contrary to the whole course of mercantile proceedings, to demand interest upon an unliquidated balance, and a Court of Equity never allows it. On the contrary, interest, being entirely,'in the discretion of the Court, is never given, unless .the defendant, <em>ex sequo et bono, </em>ought to pay it; which cannot be affirmed of the defendants, in the present case; from whom it does not appear, that any demand was made, until several years after their testator\u2019s death.' But, what renders the claim for it, more exceptionable is, that the plaintiff had, late in 1781, consented, that the debts should remain in the hands of the debtors; of course it would be extremely unjust, to allow him interest upon money, which has never been collected, and which remained in the hands of those, who owed it, with his own consent. This too, from the moment the account of sales was returned, without allowing a reasonable time for the collection; although it is manifest, <em>from </em>the state of the country, as well as from other causes, that, notwithstanding the debtors might have continued able and willing to pay, no industry could have produced satisfaction, until long afterwards. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">Whether the mode, adopted by the decree, of settling the half Johannes be correct or not, is submitted to the Court. But, it appears unconscionable to say, that an advance of that kind should only stand at its nominal amount, when it must have been a favor, and the specie would have commanded a much greater price in exchange for the currency of the day.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-18\"> The above case was acc<em>id</em>entally omitted, in publishing the cases of the October Term 1799. It is therefore inserted now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>PER C</em>UR.</author>\n<p id=\"AgF\">The Court is of opinion, that the appellee, having consigned his goods to <em>Holloway, for sale, withoutet </em>particular instructions not to sell upon credit, the latter was at liberty to use his own discretion on the occasion;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in \u2022exercise of which, he appears to have acted fairly and prudently, so as to have met the approbation of his principal: And, therefore, the outstanding debts were the property, and at the risque of the appellee, and not chargeable to the factor or his representatives; unless, having undertaken the collection, they were guilty of such gross negligence as, in equity, ought to charge them: which cannot be imputed to the factor, who died so soon afterwards; nor to the appellants, who appear, from the facts stated in the Master\u2019s second report, to have used proper diligence in employing agents of ability and integrity to make the collection, and to have given probable reasons for its failure -And, therefore, the appellants are entitled, at present, to a credit for the' amount of the outstanding debts. That, as to the eight hundred pounds of colfee, the price of which is claimed by the appellee, there appears, at this time, no ground to charge the appellants for that article; since the statement made by <em>Stewart, </em>respecting it, to which the answer refers, is unsatisfactory for a decision either way; and, therefore, that the claim ought not now to be allowed. That the credit for the twenty half Joes paid <em>Walch, by , </em>order of the appellee in August, 1781, ought not to stand, as in the decree, to be re-paid now in specie, with interest; but, ought to be applied at its relative value at the time, towards the discharge of the paper debt. Specie, at that period, not being considered as a circulating medium, but a commodity at market, the value of which was to be settled by contract, or if none such, by the current value at that time, Independent of the legal scale; nor, in the present case, has the contract for tobacco, another commodity, any influence on the question. The Master, residing at <em>Petersburg, </em>is presumed to have been .well acquainted with the value, and in his first report to have stated the-credit accordingly, (having departed from the legal scale, and the contracts for tobacco;) and, therefore, that it ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>to stand as there stated, in paper; and that the other arti0jes 0f \u00bfgbit and credit ought to stand as stated in the last account. That the demand being for an account unliquiin which there were considerable articles in dispute, so that it was uncertain on which side the balance would be, no interest ought to be allowed on the balance. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The decree, therefore, is to be reversed, and the cause remanded to the High Court of Chancery, for, that Court to have the account between the parties reformed, and a decree entered according to the principles of this opinion, reserving to the appellee libertv to make a 'future claim for the outstanding debts, or any of them, on proper proof of the receipt thereof by the appellants, or of gross negligence in them in the collection; and as to the coflee, upon proper \u2022 proof to charge them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">[* See <em>Scott </em>et al. v. <em>Surman </em>et al.
