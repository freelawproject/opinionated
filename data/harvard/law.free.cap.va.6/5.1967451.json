(amongst other things,) in fee-simple, <em>all the lands which he held in the County of </em>King George <em>above </em>Poplar Swamp, <em>and which he had purchased of </em>Jeremiah Bronaugh. That notwithstanding this agreement by indenture of the same date, it was stipulated among other things, that in case the marriage took effect, the said <em>John Champe </em>and his heirs should convey to bis said son <em>John Champe, </em>jr. and his heirs, <em>all that part of the said </em>John Champe\u2019s <em>tract of land, whereon he then lived, lying above the eastern branch of the old mill run called </em>Lamb\u2019s <em>creek, and the land bought of </em>Bronaugh <em>thereto adjoining. </em>That there is a material variance, between the original agreement and the said indenture, in this, <em>\u201c </em>that the said <em>John Champe </em>held distinct tracts of land bought of <em>Jeremiah Bronaugh, </em>and lying above <em>Poplar Swamp, </em>in the county of <em>King George </em>aforesaid, and all of them except one called <em>the Farm, </em>containing by estimation acres of land adjoining to the said tract on which the said <em>John Champe </em>lived on the day of the date of the said indenture; and, by the aforesaid description of <em>Bronaugh\u2019s </em>land thereon, the said farm, although distant from the manor tract, only a quarter of a mile, and separated only by a small slip of land of <em>William Bronaugh, </em>is omitted.\u201d That <em>John Champe </em>the father, died, leaving <em>William Champe </em>his eldest son and heir at law, without having executed a deed agreeable to the original agreement, or even according to the said indenture, but after having devised an estate-tail only <em>in all the lands above </em>Poplar Swamp. That the said <em>John Champe, </em>jr. also departed this life in 1774, and by his last will, devised the whole of his estate real and personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>to the plaintiff <em>Anne </em>for life, with a remainder in tail ma^e in the Farm aforesaid to <em>John </em>Taliaferro:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH\">That the plaintiffs applied to the said <em>William Champe, </em>after the death of the said <em>John Champe, </em>for a deed; which he always refused, and died in 1784; having by his last will, devised the omitted tract called the <em>Farm </em>as aforesaid to <em>Caroline, Jane, Lucy, </em>and <em>Mary Fleming; </em>to whom the plaintiffs have likewise applied to execute a deed <em>according to the true intent and meaning of the said </em>Charles Carter <em>and </em>John Champe, <em>and the will of the said </em>John Champe, <em>junior; </em>but, that they also have refused, alledging that the said indenture cancelled all contracts preceding' it: Whereas the plaintiffs charge, <em>\u201c </em>that before the signing of the indenture aforesaid, the said <em>Charles Carter </em>objected to the expression <em>thereto adjoining, </em>as excluding the <em>Farm </em>aforesaid, and that he asked the said <em>John Champe </em>what he meant by <em>Bronaugh\u2019s </em>lands, who replied, <em>all the land in </em>King George <em>County above </em>Poplar Swamp, and that the said <em>Charles Carter </em>immediately and openly desired a certain <em>John Robinson </em>who was present at signing, to take notice of what then passed.\u201d The bill, therefore, prays a conveyance, according to the original agreement, and the will of the said <em>John Champe, </em>jr. that is to say, for, not only the tracts of <em>Bronaugh </em>in the said indenture mentioned, but for the <em>Farm </em>tract also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AG\">There is a second bill, which agrees in substance with the first, but states further, that the said <em>John Champe </em>the father, bought of <em>Bronaugh </em>three tracts of land, one of which actually adjoined to the tract on which the said <em>John Champe </em>lived, and the other two were only separated therefrom by a small slip of land, not more than four hundred yards wide. That the whole of the said three tracts only contained 439 acres, and were always considered as appendages belonging to and a part of the manor plantation of the said <em>John Champe, </em>the elder, and were never spoken of as distinct estates from the same. That an attorney was directed to draw the articles, agreeably to the original agreement, which being drawn and ready to be executed, on the day of the marriage, the said <em>Charles Carter </em>objected, as is mentioned in the first bill, to the words <em>thereunto adjoining; </em>and received the answer in the said first bill stated: Of which the company were desired to take notice. That, after the death of the . said <em>John Champe, </em>the elder, the said <em>John Champe, </em>jr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>took possession of the whole of the land bought of <em>Bronaugh, </em>which he quietly held until his death; comprising a period of seventeen years. That the said <em>William Champe </em>never was possessed of the said lands bought of <em>Bronaugh; </em>and, that his .claim was only founded on the <em>mistake, </em>in the letter of the marriage articles. That, therefore, either the explanation of the articles given in the bill should be admitted, or should be considered as a new and additional marriage agreement, which had been in part carried into execution, by the long possession of the said <em>John Champe, </em>jr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">The answer admits the purchase of the three tracts from <em>Bronaugh; </em>that one of them (to wit: that which is first mentioned in <em>Bronaugh\u2019s </em>deed,) joins the tract, on which the said <em>John Champe </em>resided, called <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek; but, that the other two tracts which adjoin each other, are separated from the first mentioned tract and from the nearest part of the old <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek tract, more than three quarters of a mile, and full three miles from the mansion-house, where the said <em>John Champe </em>dwelt. That he settled a quarter and negroes thereon, soon after the purchase and before the marriage articles. That from the time of settling the quarter, it was distinguished from the manor plantation by the name of <em>the Farm. </em>That the defendants do not admit any <em>mistake or ambiguity </em>in the marriage articles; but, the words <em>thereunto adjoining, </em>distinguish the tract first mentioned, in <em>Bronaugh\u2019s </em>deed as aforesaid, from the other two called <em>the </em>Farm\u201e That great inconveniences would result, from receiving parol evidence to explain a deed and extend its operation, contrary to what the plain words would warrant. That the defendants admit, that <em>John Champe, </em>jr. took possession of the Farm tract, which he held for sometime; but, how long they do not know, perhaps until his death; they presume, however, that this was owing to <em>William Champe\u2019s </em>being ignorant of his rights. That the defendants admit the devise by the said <em>William Champe </em>to themselves. To this answer, the plaintiffs replied generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">The deposition of <em>Chadwell, </em>states, that he was in the employ of <em>John Champe, </em>the elder; that the land on which the mansion-house stood, and that bought of <em>Bronaugh </em>on the south side of the run, were considered as the same plantation, overlooked by an overseer, who resided at the manor plantation; that the two tracts were only separated by a creek and run; and, that the run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>touches the Farm plantation; that <em>the Farm </em>is not more ^an three quarters of a mile from the <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek tract. That <em>William Champe </em>never claimed <em>the Farm </em>tract till a little before his death. The deposition of <em>Bruce </em>is to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKr\"><em>Jones </em>states, that he drew the articles. That the instructions were furnished by <em>John </em>Champe, and (to the best of the-deponent\u2019s recollection,) in his own hand-writing. That the said <em>Charles Carter, </em>called at his house for the articles, and when the deponent read them over, he objected <em>\u201c </em>to the description of <em>Bronaugh\u2019s </em>land, as adjoining to the <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek tract; saying, he apprehended the tract of land called <em>the Farm, </em>which was intended to be settled on Mr. <em>Champe </em>by his father, was not adjoining thereto, and would not be comprehended by the description.\u201d To which the deponent replied, that the deed was drawn agreeable to Col. <em>Champe\u2019s </em>memorandum, and if any doubt existed respecting <em>the Farm tract of </em>land, it should be mentioned to, and explained by Col. <em>Champe. Jordan </em>states, that all the lands on both sides <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek, were considered as one plantation, worked by the same hands, and overlooked by the same overseer. The deposition of <em>Robinson, </em>states, that he was called on to witness the marriage articles; that, <em>Charles Carter \u201c </em>objected to' some words; which he said, did not fully mention the lands promised. That the said <em>John Champe, </em>the elder, answered, that there was no occasion for an alteration; for, his meaning was to give his son his manor plantation and all his lands above <em>Poplar </em>Swamp, and also the lands he bought of <em>Jeremiah Bronaugh, </em>mentioned in the marriage settlement; and, also, all the negroes that . should be on the Farm plantation at the time of his death.\u201d That <em>John Champe, </em>jr. took possession after the death of his father and mother. That he never heard that <em>William Champe </em>ever claimed the disputed lands; and, that the Farm plantation is about the half of a mile from <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9\"><em>Chadioell\u2019s </em>second deposition is substantially the same as the first, but adds that <em>the Farm </em>is not more than 600 yards fi\u2019om <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek tract. That the land sold by <em>Wm. Champe </em>to his brother <em>John, </em>called <em>Grant\u2019s </em>land, lies near the middle of the <em>Farm </em>land. That the <em>Farm </em>land does not, in any part,.join the land reserved by Col. <em>John Champe, </em>for his son <em>William-, </em>but lies most convenient to the <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek tract given to <em>John Champe. </em>That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>without the Farm plantation and slaves, <em>John\u2019s </em>part would not be equal to <em>William\u2019s: </em>That it was never called <em>the Farm </em>till <em>Champe </em>bought it of <em>Bronaugh.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AST\">The deed from <em>Bronaugh </em>to Champe, is for three of land in <em>King </em>George, to wit: one of 153 acres bounded by <em>Rappahannock </em>river, <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek, and the main road. One other of 151 acres, bounded by the lands of Col. <em>William </em>Thornton, deceased, and <em>John Grant; </em>and the third of 135 acres, known by the name of the <em>Hill\u2019s: </em>tract, bounded by the lands of <em>William Rowley, John Grant </em>and <em>Daniel </em>Grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">The marriage articles are for <em>u </em>all that part of his, the said <em>John Champe\u2019s </em>tract of land, whereon he now lives, lying above the eastern branch of the old mill run, called <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>creek tract, and the land bought of Bronaugh, <em>thereunto adjoining; </em>together with all the negroes now on the said land, and their future increase, &amp;c. <em>\u201d .</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The deed from <em>William Champe, </em>to his brother <em>John Champe, </em>is for 93-1 acres, bounded by the lands of <em>Daniel Grant\u2019s </em>orphans, and side line of the said <em>John Champe; </em>thence to three saplins, joining the lands of said <em>John Champe; </em>thence to a small oak, joining still to the said <em>Champa\u2019s </em>land; thence, joining the land <em>o\u00ed Daniel Grant\u2019s </em>orphans, to the beginning.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-8\">Marshall, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">Two questions occur in this cause: 1. Whether parol evidence is admissible at all? 2. Whether, if admissible, the evidence produced is sufficient to maintain the relief sought by the bill?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">1. The cases on the first point are numerous. In some it is laid down as a clear principle, that parol evidence can in no case be received to contradict a deed; and that it can. only he received to rebut an equity. In others again it is admitted, that where there has been fraud, or a clear mistake, or a secret trust, there parol evidence may also be received to shew it. But, in all, it' has been received with great caution; and none of them has gone so far as the present. <em>Cheyney\u2019s </em>Case, 5 Co. 68, and <em>Altham\u2019s </em>Case, 8 Co. 155, are the oldest cases upon the subject, and fully prove the rule. But, amongst the modem cases, <em>[Finney v. </em>Finney,] 1 Wils, 34, is express. For, there was no attempt in that case to contradict the deed, and yet parol evidence was rejected. The case of <em>Meres </em>v. <em>Ansell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>3 Wils. 275, is precisely apposite and needs no comment, That of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Selwin, </em>Cas. Temp. Talb. 240, is very much to my purpos\u00e9. For, although that was the case of a will, the circumstances were much stronger than in our case; and yet the parol evidence was not permitted. The general doctrine is confirmedin <em>[Muybank v. Brooks,</em>] 1 Bro. C. C. 84; and upon a full review of all the cases, I conclude the rule to be fixed, that parol evidence shall not be received to contradict or vary the terms of a deed; unless it be in some of the instances which I have before mentioned. For example, in the case of a latent mortgage not inserted in the deed; but that case turns upon the fraud: So in the case of a secret trust, because that affects the conscience of the trustee; or lastly, in cases of oppression, imposition or mistake; which are circumstances necessarily to be shewn by parol evidence, or the relief could not be afforded. But, no case can be produced, which goes the length of deciding, that property not conveyed by the terms of the deed, can be comprehended therein by the aid of parol evidence, unless some of the ingredients, just mentioned, existed in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap\">2. But, if the testimony were admissible, that offered, is nevertheless, not competent to establish the claim of the plaintiffs. That of <em>Jones, </em>is only that he drew the articles according to <em>Champe\u2019s </em>instructions; which, so far from supporting the bill, goes to defeat it; because it affords a presumption, that the articles correspond with the views of the parties. The testimony of <em>Robinson </em>leaves the matter doubtful, and according to one way of considering his words, the declarations of <em>Champe </em>are consistent with the deed. The reference to the articles seems rather to confine his meaning to the lands therein expressed. At most, his testimony is uncertain; and, therefore, can never be a proper foundation for overturning a fixed rule of law. For, if evidence, liable to conjectures and doubt, be introduced into questions, relative to the construction of written instruments, then all the dangers of parol evidence, which the law has so anxiously endeavored to guard against, will be increased.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">The case of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 14, goes the full length, of deciding the principle we contend for in this. Tt proves dearly, that the circumstances of each case are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>to determine, whether parol evidence shall be received or not? The addition to the contract actually made by the evidence there, was as great as that which is desired here. The 3 Atk. 388, <em>[Joynes v. </em>Statham,] shews, that either fraud or mistake are proper grounds, for the introduction of this kind of testimony. All the cases upon the subject are brought together by <em>Powell, </em>in his book on devises; and from them it appears, that the Courts in <em>England </em>are relaxing from the former strictness of the rule, in oz\u2019der to attain the justice of the case. The case in <em>Wils. </em>is repugnant to that in <em>Pern, </em>cited by the Court in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell; </em>and the effect of the other cases cited by Mr. <em>Marshall, </em>is fully considered by the Court in that case, which may now be considered as having established the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-4\">Advert therefoz\u2019e to the circumstances. The counsel\u2019s draft was objected to by <em>Carter, </em>at the time when the articles were about to be signed; and <em>Champe, </em>instead of deifying that they were wrong, rather admits it, saying he zneant to give the whole tract; and, therefore, that it was unnecessazy to alter them. <em>Consequently, </em>if he did not mean to include the whole, his expression was a fraud; because it was calculated to delude those to whom it was addressed. Besides, the evidence is, that all these lands were considered as forming one entire tract; and, therefore, the expression was calculated to embrace them. But what strengthen^ this opinion is, that <em>William </em>suffered <em>John </em>to enjoy them unmolested: although as heir at law, he might have entered into and occupied them himself, had he not been \u2022conscious, that they were included in the articles. <em>Robin-sons </em>deposition is not liable to the interpretation, contended for, but expressly proves the objection of <em>Carter, </em>and the acknowledgment of Champe, as already mentioned.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">I admitted the principle in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>which only establishes the case of a latent mortgage; and the circumstances there were extremely flagrant. But that case proves nothing, in the present controversy; because, here it is said that other property than has actually passed, was meant to be conveyed by these articles, and parol evidence is offered in support of it. But the cases which I cited prove, that it cannot be done. That in <em>Wils. </em>was an attempt to prove that other property was included in the gi\u2019ant; but the attempt did not succeed. It is said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>circumstances here are important, because the lands were conveyed to old <em>Champe, </em>by one conveyance; and, therefore, that they were meant to be comprehended by the articles. But, although they were all included in one conveyance, still they were different tracts, for they were at a considerable distance asunder. It was asked, if the parties did not mean to include them all in the articles, why did <em>William </em>suffer <em>John </em>to occupy them ? and I, in my turn, ask, Why, if they did consider them as included, did <em>William </em>undertake to devise them? These circumstances prove nothing. At most, they only shew that at one time he misapprehended the articles, and at another, that he had informed himself upon them. I repeat again, that if parol evidence is admitted at all, it should be clear, distinct and pointed; but here, the testimony offered is equivocal and uncertain. It may be reconciled with the articles; for, if old <em>Champe </em>meant to include the whole, why did he particularize them by the words, <em>the lands purchased of </em>Bronaugh <em>in the settlement ? </em>It would have been enough if he said, the lands bought of <em>Bronaugh; </em>and it was not necessary to have added the other words. That addition seems to tie up the meaning, and confines it to the articles expressly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-4\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b32-5\">PENDLETON, President,</author>\n<p id=\"AKb\">delivered the resolution of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">This is a bill for a specific execution of a marriage agreement, in which we are permitted by reason and authority (notwithstanding the agreement was reduced to writing) to hear parol proof, of what was the real intention of the parties, the governing principle of the decree.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Col. <em>Champe </em>had acquired a large tract of land where he lived, and <em>Poplar </em>Swamp running through it, he had fixed upon that, as a proper line of division, between his two sons, <em>William </em>and <em>John. </em>By his will, in 1759, he devised to <em>William </em>all his lands in <em>King George, below, </em>and to <em>John </em>all <em>above Poplar </em>Swamp; clearly giving to the latter the Farm plantation in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>It is obvious that he did not mean to change this land provision for <em>John, </em>when he was about to marry, in 1762, by taking from him this small farm of 286 acres, convenient to <em>John, </em>but separated from <em>William\u2019s </em>land by <em>John\u2019s </em>whole tract. There was another difficulty occurred. If I do not mistake the position of the land purchased of <em>Bronaugh, </em>which (according to the depositions of <em>Chadwell </em>and <em>Bruce, </em>and the deed of <em>Bronaugh) </em>adjoined, it lay below <em>Poplar </em>Swamp, and under the will would have passed to <em>William. </em>To secure this to <em>John, </em>was the true reason why <em>Bronaugh\u2019s </em>name was mentioned at all; and although <em>Champe, </em>in his instructions, or the drafts-man in pursuing them, might embarrass the literal sense, the intention was, that <em>John </em>should have all the land above <em>Poplar </em>Swamp, comprehending <em>the Farm; </em>and should also have the tract below, purchased of <em>Bronaugh: </em>which makes <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>deposition perfectly intelligible. It was thus <em>Champe </em>explained it to <em>Carter, </em>who so understood it, and was satisfied. The same opinion was entertained by Mrs. <em>Champe, </em>who having a right, for life, to <em>John\u2019s </em>land, and.not to <em>William\u2019s, </em>possessed the Farm until her death, in 1767. How did <em>William </em>understand it? He suffered his mother to hold it as <em>John\u2019s; </em>he afterwards permitted <em>John </em>himself to possess it till his death, in 1774, and then let his devisees hold it till 1783, when he brought suit. But, a more direct proof of his opinion appears from his deed to his brother, in 1774, for 93f acres of land; which the father had purchased of <em>John-Grant, </em>after the marriage agreement, and which descended to <em>William </em>as heir; in the bounds of which, he calls the Farm <em>John\u2019s </em>land. Can it be imagined, that if he had considered the Farm (a small tract of 286 acres detached from his other land) as belonging to him, that he would not have preserved these adjoining 93 acres to increase it?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">It is urged, however, that he might be ignorant of his title. But is it reasonable to suppose, that he did not understand his rights as well in 1763, as in 1783? He was probably the eldest son, at his brother\u2019s wedding; where he heard the conversation between the two fathers, and it is most likely he had heard his father, at other times, speaking on the same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Upon the whole, the decree is a very just one; and is to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\">[* See <em>Gatewood </em>v. <em>Burrus, 3 </em>Call. 3 H. &amp; M. <em>399; Randall </em>v. <em>Willis, 5 </em>194, 198; <em>Tabb </em>et al. v. <em>Archer </em>et al.
