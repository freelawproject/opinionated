The jury found the following special verdict, \u201cWe of the jury find, that in <em>January, </em>1793, the plaintifF was possessed of the slaves in the declaration mentioned, as his own proper slaves. We also find, that on the 13th day of <em>January, </em>1793, the defendant intermarried with the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, after which time the plaintifF gave to his daughter, the wife of the defendant, the negroes in the declaration mentioned, to her <em>and the heit's of her body, </em>.and in case she died <em>without issue, </em>that is, <em>children of her body, </em>the said negroes <em>to return to the plaintiff. </em>Wo also find, that in less than twelve months, after the gift and intermarriage, the plaintiff\u2019s daughter departed this life <em>without issue. </em>We also find, that since the negroes in the declaration mentioned, came into the defendant\u2019s possession, they have increased one in number. We of the jury, find for the plaintiff, the negroes in the declaration mentioned, in case the law be for the plaintiff, if to be had, if not, one hundred and fifty pounds damages; if the law be for the defendant, we find for the defendant. \u201d The County Court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the slaves and damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">The defendant thereupon filed a bill of exceptions, stating, \u201cThat upon the Court\u2019s deciding the question of Jaw, the defendant, by his attorney, moved the Court to award a <em>venire facias de novo, </em>because he saith, that the verdict rendered by the jury in this case is so defective that a judgment ought not to be rendered thereupon, inasmuch as the jury hath not severed the value of the several negroes in the declaration and verdict mentioned, but was over-ruled by the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the County Court to the District Court; where the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>County Court was reversed with costs: And from the judgment of reversal, <em>Higgenbotham </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-9\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-10\">The obvious intention of the donor was, to give an estate determinable on the death of his daughter without any issue then alive; which is a reasonable period of time, and,. therefore the limitation is not too remote.. For, the jury expressly find that by issue he meant' children; which confines and ties up the preceding words, heirs of h'er body, to the time of her own death. But, under another point, of view, the limitation over is good; for the children were purchasers, and, therefore, the daughter\u2019s interest was merely an estate for life, which expired at her death without issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-11\">The joint assessment of the value of the slaves is not erroneous, <em>Jenk. Cent. 112; Lee\u2019s Cas. </em>283; 5 <em>Mod. </em>77, or if wrong, yet there being no certainty whether it applied to the damages for detention or the value, that part of the finding is nugatory; and, therefore, under the act of Assembly, the Court may award a writ of enquiry to assess the value.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-12\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-13\">Submitted the question, whether it had not been already settled both in <em>England, </em>and in this country, that the joint assessment of the value was erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-14\">And, as to the merits, it never has been doubted that such a limitation as this was too remote. All the cases, both in <em>England </em>and this country, establish it beyond all controversy. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 Wash. 74. Nor has it ever been decided, in any case, that if there be a limitation to one and the heirs or issue of his body, and if he die without issue, remainder over, that the remainder is good, unless there be some circumstance or expression to tie it up and abridge the generality of the first words. 2 <em>Fonbl. </em>Treat. Eq. 321, [2 <em>Am. </em>ed.] Neither will little circumstances or slight expressions be sufficient; but they must be such as afford a fair and clear demonstration. <em>[Bigge </em>v. <em>Bensley,] </em>1 Bro. C. C. 190. Children, is no more than issue, and issue than children. Particularly where no child was born at the time of the gift) and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>fore, the insertion of that word in the verdict is not material. Besides, this was the case' of a gift in the life-time, and, therefore, less latitude is to be allowed, than in the case of a will; which, being made <em>in </em>extremis, the Court makes some allowance for the testator\u2019s situation. Whereas, a disposition in the life-time of the donor, is taken to be made with more caution; because, the grantor might have had counsel if he. had chosen it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-4\">Randolph, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">I admit the rule as laid down by Mr. <em>Call, </em>that there must be something to confine the limitation to a reasonable period of time; but, I contend, that this is done in the present instance; for, the word <em>children, </em>does it; especially as that is a word of purchase, and particularly in a deed: so that the difference insisted on, is in our favour. The Court will the more readily adopt my construction, because the intention of the donor was reasonable. For, if his daughter had issue, he intended they should have the benefit of the estate; but if not, then, instead of its going to strangers, he intended it should return to his own family again. The case of <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>1 Call, 338, in this Court, contains reasoning expressly apposite to what I contend for. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\"><em>Call. </em>That case was determined on the authority of <em>Pinbury </em>v. <em>Elkin, </em>and other cases in <em>P. </em>Wms. But no one of these cases resembles the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-8\">Cur. <em>adv. vult.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\">[* See the note to that case.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b287-9\">ROANE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A7_\">The first question I shall consider in this cause, is, upon the.title to the slaves mentioned in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">This question depends upon the limitation over to <em>Hig~ genbotham, </em>as found by the special verdict. The clause on which the question depends, is as follows: \u201cThat on the 30th of <em>January, </em>1793, the defendant married the plaintiff\u2019s daughter; after which, the plaintiff gave her the negroes in question, to her and the heirs of her body; and in case she died without issue, that is, children of her body, the said negroes to return to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>It is a clear principle, that a limitation of personal estate, after an indefinite failure of issue, is void, as tending to a perpetuity; but, it is also a principle, that with respect to personal estate, the Courts incline to lay hold of any words which tend to restrict the generality of the words \u201cdying without issue,\u201d to mean \u201cdying without issue living at the death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Thus, a limitation to a person <em>in esse </em>for life, <em>after a </em>dying without issue, is good; because the contingency must happen, if at all, in the life-time of the remainder-man; and the limitation to him for life, restrains the generality of the words \u201cdying without issue.\u201d Otherwise, if the limitation had been to him in fee, or in tail; in that case, there would be no such restriction, and the limitation over would be void. My opinion upon the particular principle, formed on thorough investigation, was expressed in this Court in the case of <em>Pleasants </em>v. Pleasants, (see next case;) and that opinion I now wish to be understood <em>to </em>refer <em>to </em>and adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">There is a circumstance in this case, which appears to me to have this restrictive operation; that is to say, that the negroes are to return back to the plaintiff in the event of the daughters dying without children.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">It is here to be observed, that the limitation is to the plaintiff himself. It is not to his heirs or representatives,* and it cannot reasonably be inferred to have been the donor\u2019s intention that the negroes should revert to his representatives at a remote distance of time. This limitation then is similar to the limitation for life before spoken of; and restrains the generality of the words \u201c issue of her body,\u201d to an event within the period of a life in being.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Without resorting further to the standard of general principles for the decision of this point, there is a case from 1 P. Wms. 534, <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Sayer, </em>which seems decisive of <em>this case; where </em>C. <em>having two </em>nephews A. and B., devised his personal estate to them, and if either die without children, then to the survivor. Here dying without children was restrained to mean without children then living; because, the immediate limitation over was to the surviving devisee, as in the case at bar the immediate limitation over was to the surviving father; and the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>Prec. Ch. 528, is upon the same principle, and is perhaps still stronger, as the word issue is there restrained on the same reason with the word <em>children </em>in the case just mentioned from <em>Peere Williams.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">My opinion then, is, that the title of the slaves in question is in the present appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">But, the verdict of the jury is erroneous, in finding the value of the slaves aggregately, which was certainly meant to be done here under the word \u201c damages.\u201d Thejudgment of the County Court is therefore erroneous as to this point, and in not awarding a <em>venire facias de novo </em>to ascertain the separate value of the slaves. Consequently, I think that the judgment of the District Court reversing that of the County Court- <em>in toto </em>ought to be reversed, and the judgment agreeable to the ideas above-mentioned, entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">FLEMING and CARRINGTON, Judges. Of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">LYONS, Judge. The intention clearly was, that the slaves should return to the grantor in the event of the daughter\u2019s dying without leaving any children; which was a reasonable period, and if a Court of Equity had been called upon to execute the agreement, the conveyance would have been in that form. The intention was rational, and the limitation confined within proper limits. Therefore, there is no question upon the title. But, there ought to have been a new writ of enquiry in order to ascertain the values of the slaves. I think, therefore, that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed; and, that of the County Court affirmed as to the title, but reversed also as to the damages; and, that a new writ of enquiry should fee awarded to ascertain the values of the slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\"><em>PER C UR. </em>The Court Is of opinion, that the judgment of the District Court is erroneous. Therefore, it is to be reversed with costs; and this Court, proceeding to give such judgment as the said District Court ought to have given, is of opinion, that the judgment of the County Court is erroneous, in not awarding a writ of enquiry to ascertain the separate prices or values of the slaves in the declaration mentioned, the jury having found the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>all the slaves in a gross sum. Therefore, that judgment [s a]s0 to be reversed; and the suit is to be remanded to the County Court, for a writ of enquiry to be awarded, to ascertain the separate prices of the slaves; and after the execution of such writ of enquiry, for judgment to be entered for the appellant, for the slaves, or their respective prices. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-13\">[* See <em>Timberlake </em>et ux. v.
