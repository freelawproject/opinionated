A 13111 of review t~ a decree pronounced before the 11th of Feb. 1814, (see Acts of 1812, c. 12.~3,) could not b~ received after five years had elapsed from the date of such decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AH1\">2.Ttisnot necessary to plead the Act of Limi~ tations against a Bill of Review; for it ought to ap~ pear, in the Bill itself, that it is exhibited with~ in the time prescribed by law; or that the complainant is protected by some of the savings in the act; otherwise it ought not to be received.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AINq\">3. In sucI~ case, if the fact a11edg.~ ed to prevent the operation of the Act, be not true, it may be denied by the answer of the other party; and, on th~ ~iotf~ (if in bi~ favoui~) the bill of review should be rejected.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGqE\">IN these two cai~es, (which were argued together,) bills of review were filed by the appelbanis against 1hz appellees, in the Superior Court of Chancery for tin Staunton District, praying the reversal of decrees of thai Court, dated in April 1 807 and July 1809, for errors in law appearing (as the appellants ilisisted) on the record. The Bill of Review, in each case, was filed without oh taming the leave of the Court, and demurred to for that Cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A65k\">Chancellor Bnow~ dismissed the Bills, with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ajax\">En argument, by Leigh for the appel! ants, and Stamard and Wickham l~ir the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayb\">several points wore made and discussed, 011 1)0th sides, which need not here be mentioned; the only questions determined by this Courl being, 1st, whether the hills of review were offiwed in due time; aiid 2dlv, whether the length of time between the date of each decree and exhibition of the bill to review it, could be relied upon, not liwving been pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEl\">Leigh contended that the o1~jectioxi founded on the lapSe of time, was not admissible, without a plea. To prove this, he cited Prince v Heylin, 1 Atk. 494, as a case in which the doctrine is plainly laid clowii in the Chancellor's opinion, lJio' the decison of the point was not iiecessurrj in that case. Upon the reason of the thing. the Act of Limitations, whenever re1~ed iipoii as a defence, ought to be pleaded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Apa\">Stanard contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuCjl\">The Bills of Rwiew were barred by length of time.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Mr. Leigh has confounded the rule applying to pleading the Act of Limitations as a bar to original remedies, with the rule founded ou the presumption of abandonment of right fro~n lapse of time. Twenty years are a bar to a bill to redeem, exhibited by a mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>gagor out of possession; but this bar is never pleadel. There is no case of such a plea. So, also, as to bills of review, there is no example in the books of practice of a plea of lapse of time in bar to the receiving of such bill. We were obliged, by the foi'ins of proceeding, to plead, as ~ye did, the decree in bar; and this gave us every ad~ vantage we could obtain by pleading th~ act of Limit~ ations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZY\">Wickham on the same side. The limitation of time is a conclusive bar. to the bills of review, which in these eases were filed more than five years after the decrees were pronounced. As to the Writs of Error, the point of time affects the jurisdiction of the appellate Court, as much as does the su~m in controversy.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The plaintiff who wishes to get the Writ of Error, or Bill of Iteview. is bound to slu'.w that the Court has jurisdiction. Where the act of Limitations appears, on the face of the record, ~o be a bar, there is no necessity to plend it. There is no a~ithority deciding a plea to be requisite~ in such case. Was it ever heard of that tl~e act was pleaded to a Writ of Error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuS_\">Leigh in reply. - The doctrine is Laid down in 2 Bac. aBr. (Gw's. Edit.) p. 499, that the Act of' Limitations must be pleaded to a Writ of Error. rJ1J~0 reasoii assign ed is, that the other party may, by replication, bring case within some of the exceptions stated in the Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXOt\">The limitation on Bills of Review, in Engla~id, is only by a~aJogy to that on Writs of Error. The same, rule must therefore prevail in both cases as t\u00f8 the necessity of pleading the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9vT\">Stanard. In Smith v. Clay, Ambl. 645, there was no pleading in the cause; yet the Court rejected the Bill of Review, on the ground of length of time. The rule is, that t1ieplaiiit~ff'in~ reDiew ~nr~st skew himself entiled t~ file the Bill.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"ASY\"> Coop.

When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the limitation of Writs of Error and <em>Supersedeas </em>was reduced <em>by our </em>Act, to five years, (which was prior to die decree in question,) a correspondent variation was made as to the time, on the principle aforesaid, by which the limitation in bills of review was reduced to five years, and the savings in the said Act were also adopted. Thus the matter stood, at the date of the original decree, and until the year 1813, when the legislature reduced the time to three years by a positive provision. This provision only applies, however, to decrees posterior thereto, on the principle on which this Court went in the case of <em>Day </em>v. <em>Picket, </em>4 <em>Munf. </em>104; and the term of five years therefore applies to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AhPQ\">Five years being the limitation of bills of review in this case, it ought either to appear <em>from the bill, </em>that that term had not expired, or that the plaintiffs were protected by some of the savings of the Statute: and if. in such case, this fact should be untruly stated, the answer of the other party might deny it; and, on the proofs, (if in his favour,) the bill of review would be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"A82f\">In the cases before us, however, it does not appear <em>when </em>the bills of review were filed:\u2014the time in this particular is left blank. It is necessary that this defect be amended by <em>certiorari </em>or otherwise. If, on such amendment, it appears, that the term had expired, then the decree is right, but perhaps for a different reason:\u2014if, on the contrary, it shall appear that the term had not expired, it would be then for us to consider the cases on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"A7M\">It is submitted to the bar, what course to take for supplying this defect.</p>\n<author id=\"AAVz\"><em>=@ </em>Judge Brows</author>\n<p id=\"AHC\">(the Chancellor who pronounced the decree) happening to be present, informed the Court, (being requested by the Counsel on both sides,) that the bills of review were in fact exhibited after the five years had elapsed. The Court therefore, accepting this information as supplying the defect in the record, affirmed the Decrees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
