The subjects of controversy seem to have been involved in much doubt and difficulty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the case was pending before the arbitrators many years, during which the plaintiff died, namely, in 1824. The suit was revived in the name of <em>Lemuel Martin </em>his administra,tor, in 1826; and the interests of his estate were represented before the arbitrators, by the administrator, without any new rule of submission. At length, two of the arbitrators, <em>Jennings </em>and <em>Marr, </em>made an award, in general, terms, that the plaintiff should recover against the defendant 3028 dollars with interest on 1582 dollars from the 1st January 1828 till paid, and the costs. The award was dated the 18th June 1828, and was returned the day after to the court then in session, and the court proceeded immediately to enter judgment on the award, for <em>Lemuel Martin </em>administrator of <em>Francis, </em>the original plaintiff, against <em>Kelly, </em>for the amount awarded, to be levied, <em>de bonis testaloris. </em>To the entering of this judgment, <em>Kelly </em>made no opposition ,* and though he lived till January 1S29, he took no measures to contest the justice of the award and judgment thereon rendered. A. <em>fien facias </em>was sued out on the judgment, in <em>Kelly's </em>lifetime, to be levied <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>and was returned <em>nulla bona: </em>and <em>Kelly </em>dying soon afterwards, the creditor brought an action of debt on his bond for the due administration of his testator <em>Charles Martin's </em>estate, against <em>James Wheatley, </em>one of the sureties, and the only surviving obligor therein bound, to recover the money awarded and adjudged against <em>Kelly, </em>on the ground of a <em>devastavit </em>by him committed of his testator\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\"><em>Wheatley, </em>having taken administration <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Charles Martin's </em>estate, in that character and in his own right, exhibited a bill against <em>Lemuel Marlin </em>administrator of <em>Francis Martin, </em>in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>in which he impugned the award, and the judgment thereon rendered, on the following-grounds\u20141. That <em>Kelly </em>was prevented by ill health from attending before the arbitrators, during the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>part of the time that the controversy was pending be-7. . . 7. . . fore them, m consequence 01 which the interests of his testator\u2019s estate were not fully represented. 2. That <em>Scott, </em>one of the arbitrators, did not join in the award, and was not present at the final act of arbitration, though he had been joined with the other two in,the submission, in order to give such validity to the adjustment of the account, as would be satisfactory to the parties interested (meaning <em>Charles Martin's </em>legatees), and tend to prevent future controversy; that <em>Scott </em>acted with the other arbitrators at different times, but in the progress of the business, not deeming his attendance at all times necessary, he permitted them to proceed in his absence, with the understanding that after the examination of witnesses and the collection of the facts, the result of their labours should be submitted to him for his consideration and concurrence. 3. That the award was returned, and judgment immediately entered upon it by the court, on the last day of the term, in the absence of <em>Kelly </em>and of his counsel, without notice to either, of the return of the award; nor was <em>Kelly </em>apprised of the proceeding till after the term, so that he had no opportunity of tailing exceptions to the award, and the judgment thereon was obtained by surprize. 4. That <em>Kelly </em>was disabled by bad health, at the time the award was made and returned and the judgment entered thereon, from giving his personal attention to the business, and so continued ever after till bis <em>death; </em>which was the reason he took no measures to obtain relief against the award and judgment, in his lifetime. The bill then shewed, that <em>Charles Martin </em>was the father of <em>Francis Martin, </em>who, after receiving and enjoying a full share of his father\u2019s bounty, during his life and at his death, raised a claim against his estate after his death, founded on pretended accounts of long standing, and brought the action to recover it, in which the arbitration and award was <em>made; </em>and alleged many circumstances to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>shew, that the claim, and the award in favour of it, were unjust and inequitable. And on these grounds, without any allegation of partiality or unfairness in the conduct of the arbitrators, the bill prayed, that the award should be set aside; that the accounts between <em>Francis Martin </em>and his lather Charles, should be opened, examined, and fairly settled; and that, mean time, the administrator of <em>Francis </em>should be injoined from further proceeding in his action at law against <em>Wheatley, </em>as surety of <em>Kelly, </em>in his bond for the due administration of <em>Charles Marlin's </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-4\">The chancellor awarded the injunction, on the usual terms of giving an injunction bond &amp;c. and upon condition, moreover, that <em>Wheatley </em>should confess judgment in the action brought against him on the administration bond, for the amount of the judgment on the award against <em>Kelly </em>his principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\"><em>Lemuel Martin, </em>administrator of <em>Francis, </em>in his answer to the bill, said, he had no personal knowledge upon the subject to disclose, and no papers relating to it except his intestate\u2019s books, which he had told <em>Wheatley </em>he was at liberty to inspect; and he insisted on the award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">It appeared, from the parol evidence in the cause, consisting chiefly of the depositions of the arbitrators, 1. that there were a great many meetings of the arbitrators, which were adjourned from time to time at the instance of the parties: that notice of the meetings was always given to the parties; Kelly, though in ill health, frequently attended in person; he attended alter the death of <em>Francis Martin </em>the original plaintiff, a,nd after the arbitrator <em>Scott </em>ceased to attend ; and he was generally represented by counsel: and that the arbitrators received and considered all the evidence, that either party offered, giving them full time to collect their evidence. 2. That the arbitrator <em>Scott </em>attended sometimes, and assisted in noting down the evidence, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>afterwards desired the other arbitrators to proceed without him in taking notes of the evidence, saying that finally it might happen that he would unite in making the award, in which case he would found his judgment on the minutes of the evidence; but that it was never understood to be indispensably requisite that <em>Scott </em>should he present at the final act of arbitration, and should join in the <em>award; </em>and that when the award was about to be returned, <em>Scott </em>was informed of it, and so far from making any objection, or desiring to consider it, he said, that from his recollection of the evidence, he believed it was such an award as he would have signed. 3. That the award was returned to the court then in session, on the 19th June 1S28, and the court immediately proceeded to judgment on it, but the court did not adjourn for the term, till the 24th: that <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>counsel was apprised of the award made and returned, and was prein court at the time the judgment was entered upon it. 4. That though <em>Kelly </em>complained, that the court acted hastily and prematurely in proceeding to render judgment on the award, he declared that he would pursue the litigation no further.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">The notes of the parol evidence, and all the papers, which were before the arbitrators, <em>together with some </em>new evidence touching the justice of the award, were also filed; but neither the court below, nor this court, thought it proper to look into such evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\">Such being the state of the case on the original bill, <em>Wheatley </em>filed a supplemental bill, in which he shewed, that <em>Thomas Green, George Martin </em>and <em>Francis Martin </em>(the intestate of <em>Lemuel Martin, </em>the plaintiff at law), were joint sureties with him for <em>Kelly </em>in his bond for the due administration of <em>Charles Manin\u2019s </em>estate ,* and these his co-sureties being dead, he made their representatives, parties defendants, and demanded of them contribution of their equal portions of any debt with which <em>Kelly </em>should ultimately be found chargeable, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>a <em>devastavit </em>of <em>Charles Martin\u2019s </em>estate. And he alleged further, that <em>Kelly </em>had not settled his accounts of administration of <em>Charles Martin\u2019s </em>estate; and he made his executor a party defendant, and prayed an account of the administration, in order that if upon that account, he should be found debtor to the estate, his representative might be compelled to satisfy the claim of <em>Charles Martin\u2019s </em>administrator, when the amount of that claim should be adjusted and ascertained, in exoneration of the sureties in <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>administration bond. He then alleged, that he, <em>Wheatley, Gideon Brown </em>deceased (whose representative he also made party defendant), <em>George Martin </em>and <em>Brands Martin, </em>were entitled to the <em>residuum </em>of <em>Charles Martin\u2019s </em>estate; and that, he <em>Wheatley, George Martin </em>and <em>Brands Martin, </em>had each, severally, made purchases to a considerable amount at <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>sales of that testator\u2019s estate, which debts yet remained unpaid ; and he insisted, that the debt due from <em>Brands Martin </em>to <em>Kelly </em>as administrator of <em>Charles Martin, </em>should be set off against the claim which the representative of <em>Frauds </em>should establish against <em>Charles\u2019s </em>estate. And the bill prayed that accounts should be taken and settled, between the legatees of the <em>residuum </em>of <em>Charles Martin\u2019s </em>estate, and <em>Kelly </em>the administrator thereof, so as to ascertain the rights and liabilities of each and all of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">The parties defendants to the supplemental bill, having all been convented before the court, and the cause having been transferred to the circuit superiour court of <em>jFauquier, </em>that court, on the hearing, refused to set aside the award and judgment thereon, impugned in the original bill, but on the contrary confirmed the same; and it refused also to dissolve the injunction which had been awarded to <em>Wheatley. </em>But, finding sufficient proof of <em>devastavit </em>committed by <em>Kelly, </em>of his testator <em>Charles Martin\u2019s </em>estate, to an amount exceeding the balance due to <em>Francis Martin\u2019s </em>estate upon the award and judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ment, after deducting from the amount awarded' and adjudged, the sum due from <em>Francis Martin's </em>estate for \u2022 purchases by him made at <em>Kelly's </em>sales of <em>Charles Martin's </em>estate, which balance was ascertained to be 1525 dollars with interest from the 1st January 1828; the court, therefore, decreed, that <em>Kelly's </em>executor should pay <em>Francis Martin's </em>administrator that balance of 1525 dollars with interest &amp;c. out of the assets of <em>Kelly's </em>estate. And then the court directed all the accounts prayed in the supplemental bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-4\"><em>Wheatley, </em>complaining that the decree was erroneous in confirming the award, instead of setting it aside, applied to a judge of this court for an appeal, which was allowed. '</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-5\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Harrison </em>for the appellant, and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellee, <em>Lemuel Marlin, </em>administrator of <em>Francis Martin.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-6\">I. The four specific allegations impugning the award and judgment thereon, set forth in the original bill, were first examined, in three aspects : 1. whether those allegations were founded in fact? 2. whether, if true in fact, they would have been good ground to impugn the award and judgment at law, or either of them ? and 3. whether, supposing the award might have been set aside at law, or the judgment thereon reversed, for the reasons alleged in the bill, such reasons afforded good ground for relief in equity ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-7\">II. <em>Harrison </em>next entered into an examination of the evidence on which the arbitrators had made the award, and the additional evidence touching the justice of it, taken and filed in this cause, and contended, that the award was unjust and inequitable. But <em>Stanard </em>maintained, that the court could not properly even look into this matter, seeing that it was wholly extrinsic of the award, and that no partiality or unfairness was imputed to the arbitrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>III. There were two new points made by <em>Harrison </em>in the argument here, for the first time, and. earnestly debated: 1. Whether the death of <em>Francis Martin, </em>ahter the rule of court referring the cause to arbitration, and before the award was made, did not rescind and avoid the submission, and so put an end to the authority of the arbitrators to proceed further in the arbitration ? And to shew, that the death of the party had. that effect, he cited <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>1 Marsh. 366. and <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Johnson, 2 </em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 394. <em>Stanard </em>answered, that supposing this true, yet it only shewed error in the judgment on the award, for which it might have been superseded at law, but it was no ground for relief in equity. But, he said, the cases cited were not in point: lor there, the arbitrators proceeded without notice to the representative of the deceased party; whereas here, notice was given to the administrator of the deceased party, and the other party continued afterwards to attend before the arbitrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-7\"><em>2. Harrison </em>insisted, that considering that the parties really interested in the controversy, were the legatees of <em>Charles Martin, </em>and that they were all <em>sui juris, Kelly, </em>the administrator, had no right to submit the case to arbitration ; the interests of the legatees ought not to be <em>at </em>all affected by the award; and the court of equity ought, for this reason alone, to relieve them against the award and judgment, seeing that the legatees had no opportunity of contesting the award in the court of law, and no right to be heard there. <em>Stanard </em>answered, that the administrator had full power to submit the case to arbitration, and the award was binding, though if it was injurious to his testator\u2019s estate, he was accountable to the legatees to the extent of the injury done by it, as for a <em>devasta,vit; </em>Kyd on Awards, ch. <em>2. </em>p. 29.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Toll, on Ex\u2019ors 425.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\"> American edition.\u2014Philadelphia, 1808.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AF4\"> Gordon\u2019s Am.' edi.\u2014Philadelphia, 1824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AnQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AoG\">This award was made under a rule of court in a pending cause, and, therefore, was not within the statute concerning awards, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 114. p. 454. Consequently, there was no fixed time within which objectjons must fiave been taken to it, and for which it must have lain, before it could be entered as the judgment of the <em>court; </em>and there was no error in entering it as the judgment of the court, at the term to which it was returned. But if this had been erroneous, it was a legal error, palpable on the face of the proceedings, and an appellate court of law could have corrected it. Nor was there surprize in entering this award as the judgment of the court; for it is proved that both <em>Scott, </em>the arbitrator who did not join in the award, and <em>Kelly\u2019s </em>counsel, had notice of it; and the court sat five days after that on which the judgment was entered. The allegation, that it was airy part of the order, or the understanding of the parties, that the presence of <em>Mr. Scott </em>was indispensable to the making up of the award, is also clearly disproved. It is equally a rule of law and equity that the reasons for setting aside an award, must appear on the face of it, or there must be misbehaviour of the arbitrators, or. some palpable mistake. The cases to prove this are too numerous and familiar to require citation.. And nothing is considered to be apparent on the award, but what forms a part of it: no calculations, or any of the grounds of it, unless incorporated with it, or annexed to it, at the time of delivery, are to be regarded or received as reasons or grounds to avoid it. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Nicholson, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 67. In this case, there are no facts or circumstances, calculations or principles, incorporated in or annexed to the awardnothing to guide us on the subject. As to misbehaviour, it is not suggested in either of the bills; and if it had been alleged, it is wholly disproved by the facts, for I have never seen a case in which the' arbitrators seem to have been more entirely clear of par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tiality. Upon every ground, I think the decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b87-4\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ak\">It is competent to an executor or administrator to submit to arbitration, any controversy concerning the estate, whether the estate claims to be a debtor or creditor. This results, necessarily, from the full dominion which the law gives him over the assets, and the full discretion which it vests in him for the settlement and liquidation of all claims due to or from the estate. And although a mere submission to arbitration will not bind the executor or administrator, personally, to pay the sum awarded out of his own estate, yet the award is binding on him in his fiduciary character, and consequently on the assets of the estate which he represents : <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Henry, 5 </em>T. R. C. <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Rodgers, 5 </em>Wheat. 394. And, so far as relates to debtors and.creditors, parties to the award, it is binding on legatees and distributees, in the same manner, as if the adjustment and liquidation had been made by the executor or administrator, without an award, in virtue of the general powers belonging to his fiduciary character. If, indeed, injury has been done to legatees and distributees, by an award <em>giving too </em>much against the estate, or <em>too </em>little in its favour, that injury may be redressed; but it can be done only by charging it as a <em>devastavit </em>by the executor or administrator, on the settlement of his accounts. I allude to cases free from fraud j for we know that fraud will vitiate every transaction. In this case, no fraud is alleged or proved: there is no misbehaviour or partiality proved in the arbitrators ; and the award, on its face, is free from objection. The decree must be affirmed.\u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b87-11\">\u2022 Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0z\"><em>I </em>concur in affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"A-v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ApN\">I am of opinion, that if there was any error in the proceedings of the arbitrators in this case, in deciding the cause without the co-operation of <em>Mr. Scott, </em>that error might have been corrected in the court \u00a1\u00a1nuance of <em>Kelly the </em>administrator. The same remark applies equally to the objection, that the submission was revoked by the death of <em>Francis Martin, </em>or, if this objection should have been, taken by the court of law of its own mere motion, the error of omission should have been corrected by appeal. It is alleged, however, that <em>Kelly </em>was prevented from taking these objections before the court of law, by the return of the award without notice; and by the premature judgment of the court upon it. As to the fact, it is positively denied that the award was returned without notice <em>; </em>and the notice that it was about to be made up, is clearly proved. It was made up on the 18th, and returned on the 19th June, and the counsel of <em>Kelly </em>was attending court, when he was informed that the award was about to be made up. It is proved, too, that notice was given to <em>Mr. Scott </em>on the day the award was filed, that it would presently be filed; and <em>Mr. Scott </em>was informed of the character of it. The judgment was rendered in open <em>court; </em>and, according <em>to the </em>accustomed practice, I can have no doubt, the party, or his counsel, was called upon to say if there was any thing to be objected to the judgment before it was rendered. <em>Kelly </em>himself lived some time after the judgment, declared he would not carry the litigation farther, and suffered an execution to go out, and to be returned <em>no effects, </em>without applying for relief to a court of equity. All the other parties in interest excepting <em>Wheatley, seem also to </em>have <em>acquiesced; </em>and I am, therefore, of opinion, that the omission of <em>Kelly </em>to contest the award, was not the effect of surprize, but of a willingness to acquiesce in the decision which had terminated a long and unpleasant controversy. Under these circumstances, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>may safely be affirmed, that if <em>Kelly </em>were in being, he would not be received to set up, in equity, the defence against this recovery which is now advanced by <em>Wheatley. </em>The question then results, whether the plaintiff either in his character of surety for <em>Kelly, </em>as administra.tor <em>de lords non, </em>or as a legatee, could make this defence ? I hold that he cannot. In cither character, the award and the judgment thereupon is conclusive against the estate in favour of the creditor, unless a fraudulent collusion is charged and proved between him and the administrator. For an executor or administrator may lawfully submit to arbitration; and though he will be chargeable with a <em>devastavit </em>if the estate is thereby injured, yet the submission is valid; and if so, the award and judgment thereupon must be conclusive of the rights of the parties, unless It is alleged to have been obtained <em>per fraudem. </em>Moreover, if <em>Kelly, </em>who represented the estate at the date of these transactions, was concluded,\u2014if the estate in his hands was bound by the judgment,\u2014it cannot be conceived, that by bis death, the rights of the creditor were to ho impaired, and those of the estate enlarged. The rights of the parties cannot rest upon the accident of life or death. It were absurd to say, that the award and judgment were conclusive, <em>provided Kelly </em>lived, but that they were not so, in the event of his death, and the appointment of an administrator <em>de bonis non. </em>I am therefore of opinion, that the circuit court properly refused to set aside the award, and might with great propriety have dissolved the injunction. The decree against <em>Kelly's </em>administrator, in which that administrator has acquiesced, was the most favourable course that could have been taken for the plaintiff. And though it be indeed substantially against <em>Charles Marlin's </em>estate, yet, if upon the account that is directed, the persons concerned in the estate can shew fraud on the part of <em>Kelly, </em>or can even shew that the estate has sustained damage by the submission, <em>Kelly's </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>estate may be made to bear the loss. The bill, however, does not pretend to allege fraud on <em>Kelly's </em>part, and that must be charged, before proof of it can be admitted. Upon the whole, I concur in the opinion to afprm tpe decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
