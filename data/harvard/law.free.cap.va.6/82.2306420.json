At the trial, the plaintiffs demurred to the evidence adduced by the defendants to prove the payment of the debt, which was as follows: The plaintiff having given the bond in evidence, the defendants proved by a witness, that the defendant <em>Green </em>having sold a slave, and raised money enough from the sale to pay off the bond, put the money into the hands of the witness for the purpose; that the witness met with <em>Buckner, </em>and told him he had the money to pay off the bond; but <em>Buckner </em>declined to receive it, saying he owed the other defendant <em>Street </em>a larger amount, though he did not say, that the debt between him and <em>Street </em>had been settled. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dants refused to join in the demurrer to evidence; and the county court refused to compel them to do so. The jury found, a. verdict for the defendants, and the court gave them judgment. The plaintiff applied to the circuit court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed. The circuit court held, that the county court erred in not compelling the defendants to join in the demurrer to evidence, and therefore reversed the judgment. The cause being retained, by consent, in the circuit court, and the defendants then joining in <em>the </em>demurrer, the court held, that the law upon the demurrer was for the plaintiff, and proceeded to enter judgment for him, for the debt demanded in the declaration. And then, upon the petition of <em>Green </em>and <em>Street, </em>a judge of this court allowed a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-6\"><em>Harrison, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-7\"><em>R.

The evidence demurred to, was not plainly against the demurrant, and therefore does not come within the influence of the decisions of <em>Thweatt </em>v. <em>Finch, 1 </em>Wash. 217. <em>Wroe </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>Id. 357. and <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>5 Munf. 24. The evidence though parol, was not loose and indeterminate, but <em>explicit, </em>and admitted of no variance. It was therefore, within the rule laid down by judge <em>Roane, </em>in <em>Hyers </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>2 Call 574. I am of opinion, that the circuit court, in this case, very properly required the defendants to join in the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"Axp\">Let us then look into the demurrer, and see whether the evidence adduced by the defendants, admitting it all to be true, was sufficient to support the issue joined between the parties. That issue was whether the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>had been paid. The tender and refusal of money, is not sufficient proof of payment; 'but even in that, the proof was defective, for there was no legal tender. Nor was the reason assigned by <em>Buckner, </em>for refusing to receive the money, proof of an acknowledgment that he had been paid the debt. He said, that he was then indebted to the other defendant, <em>Street, </em>in a larger amount. The most that could be made of it was, that one of the defendants, <em>Street, </em>had a set-off if he chose so to consider it, against the debt, to a larger amount than the plaintiff\u2019s demand against the two obligors. That was not a sufficient proof of payment. A set-off is not a payment; and to authorize a set-off to be given in evidence under the plea of payment, it is necessary^ under our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 87. p. 510. that the defendant should file an account, stating distinctly the nature of his set-off, and the several items thereof. If this be not done, he is not entitled to prove his set-off. The evidence which was given, was, therefore, not sufficient to support the issue ha this case; which was, whether the debt was paid. Another objection is, that the set-off given in evidence, was of a debt due from the plaintiff to one of two joint and several obligors, which cannot be set off against the demand due from the two obligors. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Nekervis, </em>4 Rand. 359. <em>Ritchie &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>5 Munf. 396. Again; it was given in evidence that <em>Buckner </em>did not say that the debt between him and <em>Street </em>had been <em>settled, </em>nor was any settlement between them produced. It cannot be fairly inferred from <em>Buckner's </em>declaration, when he declined receiving the money, that he acknowledged, that a debt fixed and determined by an obligation, was paid off by an unsettled debt. I am of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b100-5\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A4\">I concur. The facts stated in the demurrer to evidence, do not amount to payment, nor are they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>such as to authorize a jury to dra,w the inference of payment. The mere fact, that the obligee, when told bv the witness that he was ready to pay him, refused to ^ ^ A <em>u </em>receive the money, saying that he owed <em>Street </em>more moncy, cannot assuredly amount to proof of actual pay-merit: it only evinced the intention of the obligee, at the moment, which he might change at will. It required a further proceeding to mate it operative; a proceeding, which, at the same time that it discharged the bond, would extinguish so much of the debt due from the obligee to <em>Street, </em>as the bond amounted to. Suppose <em>Street </em>had sued the obligee for his debt, the defendant, in that case, could not have supported the plea of payment by the same evidence here demurred to. Yet it was as much a payment of the one debt as the other. The bond remained still in the obligee\u2019s hands ; which would not have been the case, if any actual settlement had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>and Tucker, <em>P. </em>concurred. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
