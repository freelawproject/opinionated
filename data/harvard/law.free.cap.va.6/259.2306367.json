The bargain was dosed at three dollars per acre. The deponent understood. from <em>Rucker's </em>conversation, that he had inquired into <em>Cochran's </em>title; and he seemed to know all about the title, as well as the quantity, which he said was 184 acres. After the contract was written, <em>Rucker </em>took it, and seemed to read it to himself; and. then said it was all right, and executed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\">Many depositions taken by <em>Rucker, </em>proved that the value of the land was not more than three dollars per acre, and that the purchase money <em>Rucker </em>had agreed to pay, was nearly all that he was worth. <em>Rucker </em>asked one of the witnesses if he knew, whether he <em>Rucker </em>was scholar enough to transact his own business where much writing was required?

The articles imported, indeed, that <em>Lowther </em>agreed to sell and convey, according to a power of attorney <em>given </em>him by <em>Cochran; </em>but yet it was to sell and convey, generally; nothing was said in the articles about a special warranty. It appeared from <em>Lowther\u2019s </em>own shewing, that <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>letter of attorney was not before the parties, at the time of the contract ; it was in the hands of <em>Given; Rucker </em>never saw it. It was remarkable, that <em>Lowther </em>never reclaimed this instrument from Given, to exhibit it in this cause. He got a new letter of attorney from <em>Cochran, </em>suited to the contract which he alleged he had made with <em>Rucker: </em>this letter of attorney was without date; but that it was executed after the contract, appeared from the fact that it described the land as being 194 acres, instead of 184 acres as described in the contract; and <em>Lowther </em>stated in his answer, that the quantity was discovered to be 194 acres after the contract was made with <em>Rucker. </em>The original instrument in <em>Given\u2019s </em>hands, ought to have been produced. As to the parol evidence, the witnesses contradicted and discredited each other. The defendant <em>Lowther </em>swore, in his answer, and the witness <em>Lowther </em>deposed, that the articles were read over to <em>Rucker, </em>before they were executed. But the witness <em>Ferine, </em>present from the beginning to the end of the treaty, did not say the articles were read to <em>Rucker; </em>he said, that <em>Rucker </em>read them to himself. Besides, parol evidence was not admissible to explain, or add to, the terms of the written articles.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-3\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9sg\">said, that the difference between the evidence of the two witnesses, was exactly such as shewed there was no concert between them, and no procurement on the part of <em>Lowther; </em>and so tended to establish their veracity. The evidence of the two witnesses, was, in substance and effect, the same: they both proved, that <em>Rucker </em>bought <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>title, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>stipulated for a conveyance of that only. It was true, . <em>. . . J </em>, .., . . a vendor stipulating to make a conveyance ol land in general terms, without any mention of a special warranty, was bound to make a general warranty: but here, <em>Lowther </em>stipulated to sell and convey \u201c according to <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>letter of attorney to him:\u201d that letter of attorney thus referred to, constituted part of the agreement : and the parol evidence was admissible to shew, that the purchaser was informed, that the letter of attorney referred to, only authorized a conveyance of <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>title, with a special warranty, and intended to stipulate for such a conveyance. The parol evidence was certainly admissible, too, to repel the charges of fraud alleged in the bill, as the ground of relief; and it did repel them. There was no evidence to discredit the witnesses. <em>Lowther </em>was guilty of no fraud or deception in procuring the second letter of \u25a0 attorney from <em>Cochran: </em>he himself disclosed the facts in his answer, and stated that'the original letter of attorney was in <em>Given\u2019s </em>hands. He was never required to produce the original instrument. And if <em>Rucker </em>thought it important, he had exactly the same right that <em>Lowther </em>had, to require <em>Given </em>to produce it, or to take his deposition. The specific ground of relief set up in the bill, was, not that the terms of <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>letter of attorney were misrepresented, but that the purchase was in part made from <em>Lowther, </em>and he was to make the conveyance with warranty; that nothing was said about <em>Cochran, </em>or his power of attorney to <em>Lowther, </em>and the reference to it in the articles, was fraudulently inserted by <em>Lowther. </em>The imputed fraud was the point in issue between the parties ; and the charge of fraud was not only unsupported by proof, but was disproved.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b281-8\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aky\">This is a bill to rescind a contract for the sale and purchase of land, which has been carried into execution by the vendee taking possession and paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the purchase money, and to recover back the purchase money with interest. To justify a decree of this kind, there must be a pretty strong case; and that stated in the bill is quite strong enough. It charges, that <em>Lowther </em>represented the title to the land as unquestionable, and agreed to convey it to him with general warranty; but that, in drawing up the contract, he practised upon him a gross fraud, in stating that he acted under a power of attorney from Cochran, and would make such deed as that authorized, whereas he had never said one word to the plaintiff about this power, nor did the plaintiff \u2019(who is illiterate and unable to read writing) know, till after-wards, that there was such an expression in it, but expected to receive his deed from the vendor himself with general warranty. The bill further states, that the defendant ha\u00a7 tendered a deed with special warranty, under <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>power of attorney, which he had rejected ; that he had been sued for the land, and thought he was likely to lose it.' This, I repeat, is a strong case, and if tolerably made out, would call for a decree of rescission and refunding. Let us examine the proofs. We know that by the long established rule of equity, the answer, where responsive and positive, has the weight of two witnesses, or of one with <em>pregnant </em>circumstances: this is on the ground, that the plaintiff forces the defendant to answer, and that <em>his </em>answer, if against himself, would be conclusive. The answer before us, contradicts,\u2018positively and directly, every charge of fraud, or misrepresentation; and if the answer be true, this is certainly not a contract to be rescinded. The written contract has two subscribing witnesses. If any body could tell us truly, what the contract was, and whether truly set down in the written articles, it would seem that these are the men; persons to whom the parties themselves have given credit, by calling upon them to subscribe as witnesses. These witnesses disprove the allegations of the bill, and prove the truth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>answer. [Here the judge stated the evidence of <em>W. 'Lowther </em>and <em>Ferine.'] </em>I refer to this evidence, particularly, because these subscribing witnesses are the only persons who tell us one word about the agreement. No testimony has been taken to discredit them; and unless there be something in the matter or manner of their evidence shewing the contrary, we must take them for good men and true. It was said, that their stories did not agree; that they contradict one another. It does not seem to me that there is any conflict. Where witnesses have combined to tell a made up story, they generally agree to a word: but where two persons arc called to speak to a transaction of some standing, and each remembers for himself, we find, in nine cases out of ten, that there are differences between them; one recollects better than the other; a-particular incident strikes the mind of one, with more force than the other. But these natural variances, so far from weakening the evidence, are generally considered as stamping it with the seal of truth. It is evident too, that the witnesses here had not the same opportunities. <em>Ferine </em>was present at the beginning of the contract; <em>'Lowther, </em>only after it was made, and nearly reduced to writing. It was said also, that these are witnesses to a written agreement, which their testimony cannot be received to contradict or vary. This is very true; but it is equally so, that w'here the agreement is ambiguous, or charged to be falsely written, parol proof may be called in to shew what the parties meant, and whether the charge be true. Here, the bill charges that nothing was said in the contract about a power of attorney, or a special warranty, and that this was fraudulently introduced into the agreement. It is, surely, proper to call the subscribing witnesses to speak as to this; and this they clearly disprove. The agreement too, standing by itself, does not clearly import the kind of title to be conveyed. The vendor agrees to sell and convey according to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>power of attorney, made to him, by <em>Cochran. </em>Now, the witnesses prove the understanding as to this, that the vendor expressly refused to make a general warranty, as he had bought only <em>Cochran's </em>right, and <em>the </em>power of attorney enabled him to convey no more. A strong and ingenious argument was founded on the fact, that the power of attorney filed has-no date, and was not admitted to record till some time after the agreement, and moreover states the land to contain 194 acres, while the agreement states it at 184 acres, as well as ascertained by the parties; thus shewing, that the power was executed after the agreement, and after that was reduced'to certainty, which was uncertain at the date of the contract. This was, indeed, a clumsy trick, if it was intended to pass off this new power as in existence at the date of the agreement: but it is clear, that this was not so meant: for the answer refers to both powers, the first as left in the possession of <em>Given, </em>the second as of record in the county of <em>Harrison, </em>and prays that both; if they can be obtained, may be taken as part of the answer. Why the first power was not produced, we are not told. <em>Given, </em>if accessible at all, was equally so to both parties; and if the power of attorney was to make a general warranty, it would have availed the plaintiff much to shew it. But, in truth, he makes no such allegation: his point of reliance is, that by the contract, as really made, nothing was said about a power, but <em>Lowther </em>was himself to convey with general warranty. And this is disproved, 1. by the answer; 2. by the written agreement; and 3. by both the witnesses to it, who prove that it was correctly read, that the- power of attorney was expressly spoken of, and that <em>Lowther </em>refused to make any deed but as attorney, and with special warranty. To strengthen the ground of fraud and imposition, the plaintiff alleges, that he cannot read writing; but he has not proved it; on the contrary, the very manner in which he puts the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to the witness, seems to infer the contrary. He does not ask him, \u201cdo you know whether I can read writing?\u201d but, \u201cdo you know, whether I am scholar enough to transact my own business, where there are any writings required ?\u201d and the witness answers, that he does not think him a judge of writings of that kind, or of any other that would contain much. Now, this is quite a different thing from being unable to read. But suppose he had proved himself wholly illiterate, i f the witnesses to the agreement are not perjured (for there can be no mere mistake in the facts they state), he was fairly and fully informed of the nature of the title, and meant to purchase no more than <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>title. He said, he had seen Cochran, and knew all about the title. Again; he received a copy of the agreement, which he kept and has filed with his bill. If at the time the articles were executed, he knew nothing of the fact stated in the agreement, that <em>Lowther </em>sold under the power, can it be imagined that he had not discovered this before he paid the purchase money ? And if the agreement had really been for a deed with general warranty from <em>Lowther </em>himself, would he not, the moment he discovered this gross imposition, have stopped paying, and sought redress? From this view of the case, I am strongly inclined to think that the plaintiff bought only <em>Cochran\u2019s </em>right,\u2014that the deed offered him gives him what he contracted, for,\u2014and that the chancellor\u2019s decree is right.</p>\n<author id=\"b285-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKh\">It was admitted in the argument, and. rightly I think, that upon an agreement for the sale of lands, the vendor is to be considered as contracting for a general warranty, unless the contrary is expressly provided. If we confine ourselves, therefore, to the contract in this case, it is very clear, that a general warranty was contracted for, unless it could be shewn that the power of attorney referred to, confined the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>in fact to a special warranty of the title, and that it was either shewn to the appellant at the time of the contract, or its contents fairly and truly stated. This power of attorney, however, never has been produced. Its contents never have been proved, nor indeed has a foundation been laid for such proof, by shewing that it has been lost or mislaid. The appellee, however, introduced two witnesses to prove, that it was agreed between <em>Rucker </em>and himself, that he was only to make a deed with special warranty. But if the contract is to be interpreted as binding <em>Lowther </em>to a general warranty, this parol testimony is in direct conflict with the written article, and is therefore inadmissible. I am therefore of opinion, that the decree is erroneous in dissolving the injunction, <em>Lowther </em>having failed to comply with his contract, by procuring a deed with general warranty from <em>Cochran. </em>It is manifest, moreover, from the power of attorney executed by Cochran, since the contract, that <em>Lowther </em>cannot now, as attorney in fact, execute such a deed as <em>Rucker </em>is entitled to by the articles ; and the land having been recovered by superiour title, such a deed would, in truth, seem to be fruitless. What, then, should be done ? A rescission of the contract would seem to be indicated, as it cannot be specifically executed. But in that event <em>Rucker' </em>must have a decree for the purchase money. Against whom ? By the contract, he was to pay it to <em>Lowther </em>for <em>Cochran; </em>and although he says, he did not understand that he was contracting with <em>Lowther </em>only as <em>Cochran's </em>attorney, yet, as it was his own folly, not to read the instrument if he could, or not to demand that it should be read, and not to ask advice if he could not understand it, he must be held to its contents. It is proved, indeed, that the deed was read to him; and, moreover, it is not proved that he could not read it himself. He must, therefore, be considered as contracting with <em>Cochran, </em>his payments must be considered as hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ing been made to <em>Cochran, </em>and his recovery of the purchase money may, and indeed must, be against him, if <em>Lowthcr </em>has paid it over. But though <em>Cochran </em>was made a party by the bill, yet no process appears to have been served on him, and he is certainly not before the court. Upon this state of <em>the </em>case, I think the decree should be reversed, the injunction reinstated, and the cause sent back, with a view to bring <em>Cochran </em>before the court, in order to enable it to make a proper decree between all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The other judges concurred with the president. Decree reversed, injunction reinstated, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
