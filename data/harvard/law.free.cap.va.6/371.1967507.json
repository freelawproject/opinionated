The bill states, that <em>John Stephens, </em>in the spring of 1767, settled himself and family on <em>Cobun\u2019s Creek, </em>extending down the said creek below an <em>agreed </em>line, which was afterwards made by the said <em>John Stephens </em>and <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>so as to include 400 acres. That the said <em>John Stephens </em>built a house, and moved his family thither; clearing ten acres, and raising \u00e1 crop. That the said agreed line continued, as a boundary between <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Co-buns </em>until four years after, when <em>Stephens </em>died; during which time, <em>Stephens </em>lived on the land, and raised corn. That his widow lived on the said land five or six years afterwards, with his family; and then sold it to <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>who sold to <em>James Cobun, the </em>defendant. That the plaintiff was then an infant, left by his mother, and supported by the bounty of his friends. That he was still an infant, when the commissioners sat; and, having no property, had no money to assert his right against the defendant, who then had the land in possession. That one <em>Henry Stephens </em>did, indeed, inform the Board, that the land belonged to the plaintiff; but, being poor and ignorant, he was unable to support the claim against the defendant; who, apprised of it, brought forward the claim of <em>Workman; </em>who had tomahawked a few trees, as <em>Cobun </em>said, on the land, before said <em>Stephens </em>had settled there; By which means, the defendant obtained a certificate for the land. That <em>Workman </em>never had a residence in the country, except as a hunter; and, if he <em>marked any trees, </em>it was for convenience as a hunter. It therefore prays, that the defendant may convey; and that the plaintiff may have general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">The answer states, that <em>John Stephens </em>did <em>set down </em>on the land in the bill mentioned; and continued there, with his family, for sometime. That both were wrongful; as <em>Workman </em>had previously improved and occupied the land; on which he had done work, as chopping and heaping brush; and that he had made some progress in building a house or cabin. But, going to remove his family thither, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that said <em>Jb/m Stephens </em>intruded on the land, and held him out. That the agreement of <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>as to the <em>boundary line, </em>could not affect <em>Workman; </em>who was the true owner, <em>if any could be at that early period, before legal rights ivere obtained. </em>That <em>Jonathan Stephens </em>bought of <em>Cobun\u2019s </em>widow, and after-wards of <em>Workman. </em>That <em>John Stephens </em>knew of <em>Workman\u2019s </em>right, and offered 8/. for it. That matters lay thus, unfil the commissioners sat; when the defendant was cited before them, at the suit of the plaintiff, by <em>Henry Stephens. </em>That the claim was fully heard, and decided for the defendant, Denies any fraudulent application for the certificate, or that he bought of <em>Workman, </em>with a view to defraud the plaintiff. Says, that the defendant was threatened, by <em>Lewis Rogers, </em>with a suit founded on <em>Workman\u2019s </em>right; and, therefore, he bought it for ahorse, which cost the defendant <em>221.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\"><em>Jonathan Cobun </em>says, that in \u201967 or \u201968, <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>sen. and <em>John Stephens </em>settled on <em>Cobun\u2019s Creek, </em>and, after dividing the lands by an agreed line, the said <em>John Stephens </em>settled on that now in dispute. That each division was improved; but he does not know which was the oldest. That <em>Lewis Rogers </em>forbid <em>John Stephens </em>to settle on the said land, as <em>Rogers </em>and another had improved it, and had planted corn; although the deponent never saw any. However, that he did see some trees, which had been deadened, and some appearance of brush heaps, and the foundation of a cabin, two or three logs high. But, does not know, if the whole or any part of it was on <em>John Stephens\u2019s </em>land. That he saw the letters T. B. on a honey locust, in <em>Jonathan Cobun\u2019s </em>improvement, supposed to have been made by <em>Thomas Banfield; </em>who claimed the land, and gave up his right to <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>sen. previous to the division, between <em>Jonathan Cobun </em>and <em>John Stephens. </em>That the plaintiff and the defendant were present, and consenting. That the plaintiff\u2019s mother gave bond to indemnify the defendant against the heirs of <em>John Stephens; </em>and the deponent was security thereto. That the plaintiff\u2019s mother was daughter of <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\"><em>Meredith </em>says, that he had heard <em>Workman </em>say, he had sold his right to <em>John Stephens, </em>sen. for a quantity of liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\"><em>Ramsay </em>says, that he had heard <em>Rogers </em>say, he. and <em>Workman </em>had improved three places in one day; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Worleman </em>lost his gun. Upon which, they went away; and, on their return, that <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Cobun </em>settled. After which, <em>Rogers </em>expected to lose, and sold for a horse, which he said was better than nothing,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\">A fourth witness says, that he had heard <em>Workman </em>say, if he could find his gun, he would move away, as he did not like the country. That he did not understand that he had improved. That the land in dispute, is that which was improved by <em>Ear:field.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\"><em>Scott </em>says, that <em>John Stephens </em>and <em>Jonathan Cobun, </em>scnr. settled on the lands and made a dividing line. That <em>Stephens </em>cleared 4 acres, and raised corn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\"><em>Evans </em>says, that the plaintiff\u2019s mother was on the land; and, that 4 acres were cleared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\"><em>Bunfield </em>says, that he lay two weeks on the land; but, not with intent to settle it. That, he never claimed or sold it. That there were some small improvements, as brush heaps, deadened trees, &amp;c. there, at the time; but, docs not know who had made them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\"><em>Workman </em>says, that he settled the lands. That there were brush heaps, and a house 3 or 4 logs high. That he planted corn; and began to clear a meadow. That he lost his gun and went away; leaving his crop in the care of <em>Lewis Rogers. </em>That he would have returned, but <em>John </em>Stephens, father of <em>Geo. Stephens, </em>had taken possession, and kept him out. That he sold his right to the said <em>Rogers; </em>which ho would not. have done, had he known of the commissioners sitting there. That some small time after he had left that country, the said <em>Rogers </em>alarmed him about the <em>Pennsylvanians </em>and their proclamation. That he never told <em>John Sempson </em>that he would not return. That he never said that the defendant was to pay him, if he gained the suit; although he might have said, that he was to pay the expense he was at in going to have depositions taken. That he never told <em>Merrifield </em>that he had given his right to <em>John Stephens. </em>That he never saw him. That <em>Rogers </em>told him that <em>John Stephens </em>had offered him <em>51. </em>for the deponent\u2019s right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\"><em>Lewis Rogers </em>speaks to the same effect as <em>Workman; </em>and says, that he bought of <em>Workman </em>and sold to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-11\"><em>C.

That <em>Henry Stephens, </em>on behalf of the plaintiff, brought suit for the lands in dispute, which was decided in favor of <em>Cobun, </em>because he had the eldest improvement, to wit: <em>Workman\u2019s.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\"><em>J. Ratcliff </em>says, that he was present at the suit before the commissioners; and, that it was decided in favor of <em>Cobun; </em>who had <em>Workman\u2019s </em>right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\"><em>C. Ratcliff </em>further says, that the trees were deadened. That there was part of a small cabin before <em>John Stephens </em>took possession; but, she knows not by whom it was put, further than that she heard <em>Rogers </em>say it was <em>Workman\u2019s. </em>That <em>Rogers, </em>in <em>Workman\u2019s </em>name, warned <em>Stephens </em>to go off the land. That <em>Stephens </em>refused, saying he had offered <em>Rogers 3l. </em>for it. That she was present as a witness, before the commissioners; who decided for <em>Cobun.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-10\"><em>Decker </em>says, that about the year 1765, <em>Stephens, Workman </em>and <em>Lewis Rogers </em>improved two tracts of land, as the deponent has heard; one for his father, the other for himself. That he planted corn on both places. That the deponent, his father, and the said <em>Workman </em>left the country; and,' that <em>Rogers </em>left it some time after. That in about two years after, old <em>Cobun </em>and <em>John Stephens </em>came and settled on the said land. That <em>Stephens </em>never bought <em>Workman\u2019s </em>right. That <em>Rogers </em>went off, on account of the <em>Pennsylvania </em>proclamation. That <em>John Stephens </em>claimed to a fence, but he does not know the agreed line. That he saw the corn planted by <em>Workman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-11\">There are amongst the papers in the record, a copy of the judgment of the commissioners; and a copy of <em>Cobun\u2019s </em>surveys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-12\">The <em>County Court </em>decreed a conveyance to the plaintiff. The High Court of Chancery reversed the decree. 1. Because, the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor had no title. <em>2. </em>Because, the judgment of the commissioners was final, notwithstanding the infancy of the plaintiff, as it had not been reversed by the General Court. Whereupon, the plaintiff <em>Stephens </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-13\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-14\">Upon the principles of equity and the evidence in <em>'the </em>cause, the title was clearly in the appellant originally. For, the transitory possession of <em>Workman, </em>if indeed it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>be true he ever had it, cannot be admitted to have con- ' ferred any right, or if it did, he parted with it to <em>Stephens, </em>Therefore, unless the judgment of the commissioners has barred his claim, he was clearly entitled to a decree for the land. But, as he was an infant and his case not fully before the board of commissioners, their judgment ought not to preclude him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-6\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\">The merits, as well as the law of the case, are in favor of the appellee. For, it is established beyond controversy, that <em>Workman </em>made the first settlement and improvement.Therefore, <em>Stephens </em>was an intruder on his right; and the Weight of testimony is, that he never sold to any person but <em>Cobun. </em>The judgment of the commissioners is decisive; for the law expressly declares that it shall be final. Chanc. <em>Rev. </em>93, <em>[May, </em>1779, c. 12, 10 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>35, 42-6.] The appellant was plaintiff, by a person who acted as his next friend, before the commissioners, and appears to have been fully heard. Therefore, he ought to be barred by the judgment: For, an infant plaintiff, when heard by his next friend, is as much bound by the judgment, as a person of full age. Besides, it does not appear what testimony was before the board; and, perhaps, much stronger evidence was adduced by <em>Cobun </em>on the merits, than appears in the present record. For, although he has thought proper to adduce some testimony on the merits, he was not bound to do so; and, therefore, if his testimony were defective, (which it is not,) yet that would not affect his case; because, the judgment is conclusive, and cannot be impeached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-10\">But, for another reason, the decree of the <em>Chancellor </em>is right; namely, that <em>Cobun </em>and <em>Rogers </em>are no parties to the present suit; for, not having passed any deed for their title, and their rights having been drawn into controversy, they ought to have been made parties. <em>Buck </em>v. Copland, ante, 218, in this Court: Which is the stronger in the</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-11\">present case, as their testimony is objected to on the ground of interest; and, they ought certainly to be heard by answer or deposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-12\"><em>Cur. adv. </em>vult.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b396-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"As-\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that the act of Assembly was conclusive; and, that the decree was to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u2022 Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
