The other was a general Count, for \"money had and received by the defendant for the \"use \"of the plaintiff as guardian as aforesaid.\" Plea non assumpsit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am9\">At the trial the defendant demurred to the evidence; the plaintiff having shown and proved to the jury the or: der, with the pi'otest, or written refusal of Obed Waite to pay it; which, being set forth in hwc ~verba, corresp\u00f4uded `with the description thereof in the declaration; and also proved that, at several times, in the fall \"of 1811, \"and previous to the commencement of this suit, there \"was notice of the protest given by the plaintiff to the \"defendant, and a demand made ofpayment of the amount; \"that the th'awee was, at the time of the draft, and ever \"since, a man of sufficient property to pay it, and of un. \"doubted solvency; and also that he had not, at the time \"of the draft, or ever after, any fund in his hands, out \"of which he ought to have paid the said draft, or aiiy \"funds bf the drawer, whatsoever.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\">The Jury found for the plaintifi' ~1O8 85 cents darn-ages, with legal interest thereon from the 15th of August 1810, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the Demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">The Court having entered judgment for the plaintilr, the defendant obtained a writ of Snpersedeas, from a judge of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-6\">Wick/tam for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak\">Suit could not be maintained upon the writing in question, as a bill of exchange; it being drawn am a particmlarfuiul, and omitting the words \"or order,\" which are absolutely necessary.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Besicles;-our act of Assembly making bills negotiable, points out a particular form and mode of protest, which has not been observed in this case. If I am correct in this, no action is sustainable on the first Count in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">~. Whenever there is a demurrer to evidence, arid it appears that the evidence applies to the defective Cownt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>no judgment can be given for the plaintiff. Here, adniitting the second Count to be a good one, there is uo evidence applying to that Count.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A55\">S. If any person was entitled to sue, the children for whom Jliggins was guardian, niight, but not iliggins himself.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-3\">Leigh contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6D\">I admit this order or draft is not a bill of exchange: but that question is important only whore the negotiability of the paper is the point in controversy. Tlio' not negotiable, it is binding between the parties to the transaction. r11110 payee may recover of the drawer.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> I admit too, that the non acceptance in this case, is not a legal protests but that is unimportant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-4\">2. The SecOnd Count is substantially good, and the evidence does apply to it; for a draft is, virtually, an acknowledgment that the drawer has money belonging to the payee. Even if the first Count be bad, it may operate as notice of the special matter intended to be offered in evidence upon the other. The general money Counts are inserted, on purpose to provide for the eyent of the special Count's being found dcfective.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">S. When a writii~g is ghen to a guardian or executor, lie may bring suil npon it. So also may a factor. So, if an executor takes a bond for property of his testator sold by him, he may sue upon it and declare hi the debet and detinet.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-6\">Wickham in reply. A writing not under seal, does not in itself import a consideration. A note of hand, being not \"for value received,\" may be given in evidence; but the consideration must be proved. If, therefore, this draft had been good in other respects, it could not support the action, no consideration appearing. Drawn, as it is, without the words \"for ralue received,\" and not payable to the payee \"or order,\" it may have been given for the purpose of getting the money of the drawer, for his own benefit, out of the drawee's hands. There is nothing to show that the payee is entitled to it.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-7\">Where the writing is only eDidenee of a debt due to the Ward, the suit must be brought by the Ward himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>not by the Guardian. But where it is the foundation of the action, as in Peter, v. Cocke 1 Wash. 257, the case is otherwise: the bond being taken to A. B. \"guardian, executor, or factor, &amp;c.\" the words of addition may be re~jected. The rule is, that if the document itself be one that can be declared upon, the guardian, executor, or factor may sue upon it; but if it be ~uc1i as can oniy be given in evidence of a debt, the person to whom the debt is due must bring the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQP\">Leigh. This distinction is a new one to me. I should like to see an authority in support of it. Whether asswmpsit or debt be brought on a promissory note, in cither case the note is but evidence of the debt. According to Mr. Wickliain's argument, an executor may maintain debt on a note to himself, but cannot assvanpsit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b24-8\"> Gerard v.
