The 2d section of the Act of 1792. concerning slaves, extends only to slaves brought into this commonwealth by the absolute owner of them, and not to such as are bro't in by wrong doers, or by persons hay-. ing only a limited interest in them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b32-9\">2.The Court will not give such a construction to the general words of an Act,as would subject the, property of innocent individuals to loss by the acts of third' persons; nor such as would favour a partial emancipation during the interest of a particular tenant of slaves.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">THE question in this case, arising on a special verdict in a suit for freedom, was, whether the appellces, who were slaves unlawfu1l~ brought from North Carolina into this Commonwealth, and kept therein more than a year, by the appellant, who had in them a life estate only, were entitled to freedom under the 2d. section of the Act of 1T9~; (cdi. of 17'94, 1803 and `14, C. 108.) The County Court of Itussel decided against them; but the Superior Court of law reversed the judgment, and rendered one in their favour, from which, &amp;nth, ~the importer) appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Acj\">Call for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOv\">The act of Sonth, in bringing the slaves into the state, did not emancipate them, as he had only a life estate.. He could forfeit his own interest, but not that of those entitled in remainder. The reasonable construction of the law is, that, if the owner brings them in, he shall forfeit, and they shall be free.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\">Wm. Hay, Jr. for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asv\">The words of the Act are general; there is nothing to justify the Court iii restricting its operation.. If Mr. Call's construction were permitted, every evil intended to be guarded against, ~woiild be let in. South was the proprietor sub ~nodo, for lie had a life estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The following opinion of the Court was de1ive~ed by Judge ROANE.</p>\n<author id=\"b33-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AP4\">is of opinion that Ilie 2d. section of the Act of 1792, cli. 103, only, extends to cases of' slaves brought in by the absolute owner of them, and not to such as are brought in by wrong doers, or by those having oniy a limited interest in them. We are not disposed to give a construction to the general words of an Act, which would ~s11l)j ccl the property of innocent individuals to loss by the acts of third persons: and as to a construction favouring a partial emancipation during the interest of a particular tenant, it will not be adopted by the Court, because, in addition to other reasons, it would produce the same result, to the injury of the reversioner or remainder man.</p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">The construction adopted by the Court is justified by analogy to the Act of 1806, (R. Code, Edi. of 1808, p. 95.) the present law on the sul~jeet, which expi'essly provides that \"all the right\" of the person briiiging in a slave shall be forfeited, and the slave be sold for the term for which lie is owned by the importer. This sale, too, it is to be remarked, will not enable the slave to abscond, as a partial ema~icipation would, and thus enable him to defeat the hiterest of the person in remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"Ant\">On these groimds, the Court reverses the judgment of the District Court, and affirms that of the County- Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
