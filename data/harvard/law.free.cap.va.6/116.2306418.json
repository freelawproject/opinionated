That was a plea in bar, alleging, in substance, that <em>John Turner </em>having married <em>Susan Howies, </em>relict and administratrix<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> of <em>William Howies </em>deceased, and having so become administrator of <em>Howles's </em>estate in right of his wife, and having accordingly taken upon himself the administration of <em>Howles's </em>estate, received assets thereof to the amount of 524 dollars, which he failed to account for and pay over, and wasted, and so died indebted to <em>Howles's </em>estate to that amount; and that <em>Susan Turner </em>administratrix of <em>John Turner </em>had fully administered all the assets of his estate which came to her hands, except assets to the value of 524 dollars; that is, not more than enough to pay and satisfy the debt due from <em>John Turner, </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>administrator in his lifetime of <em>Towles\u2019s </em>estate, to that estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ams\">T0 this plea, the plaintiffs replied, that in the suit brought by <em>Craddock </em>against <em>Susan Turner </em>as executrix o\u00a3 <em>ppurner\u00a1 </em>it was ascertained by the verdict of the jury and the judgment of the court, that she had not fully administered the estate of that testator,, and that assets of that estate sufficient to satisfy the judgment, had come to her hands, as appeared by the record of that suit\u2014which was set out in the plea, <em>in Time </em>verla\u2014 and so the plea, without pleading this matter by way of <em>estoppel, </em>averred, that assets came to the hands of <em>Susan Turner, </em>of her testator <em>John Turner\u2019s </em>estate, sufficient to pay the amount of <em>Craddock\u2019s </em>judgment ; concluding with a verification. The court rejected this replication as naught.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">And then the plaintiffs put in another replication, stating, that though <em>John Turner </em>did marry <em>Susan Towles, </em>and so, during the coverture, became administrator with her of <em>William Towles\u2019s </em>estate, and did in his lifetime receive and become chargeable for assets of <em>Towles\u2019s </em>estate to a large amount, to wit, &amp;c. yet no judgment or decree for the same was ever rendered against <em>John Turner </em>and <em>Susan </em>his wife, or either of them, in his lifetime, or against her since his death; and <em>John Turner </em>died leaving his wife <em>Susan </em>him surviving; and she was and still is the administratrix of <em>William Towles, </em>legally and solely chargeable with .and responsible for the assets of <em>Towles\u2019s </em>estate, which came to her hands, or to the hands of <em>Turner </em>during his coverture with her, to be administered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">To this replication, there was a general demurrer by the defendant, and joinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">The court held, that the law on the demurrer was for the defendant, and accordingly gave judgment for her; to which this court, on the petition of the relator of the plaintiffs, allowed a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The cause was argued here, by <em>Lyons </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and <em>Daniel </em>for the defendant. The argument turned, mainly, on the construction and effect of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. $ 60. p. 389. which provides, that \u201cthe executors or administrators of a guardian, of a committee, or of any other person, who shall have been chargeable with, or accountable for, the estate of a ward, an idiot or a lunatic, or the estate of a dead person, committed to their testator or intestate by a court of record, shall pay so much as shall be d ue from their testator or intestate, to the ward, idiot or lunatic, or to the legatees, or persons entitled to distribution, before any proper debt of their testator or intestate.\u201d And the question was, Whether this provision embraces the case of the administration of the estate of a decedent, who, having married an executrix or administratrix, and so become charged with the administration in her right, during the coverture, dies indebted to the estate, of her testator or intestate, leaving her surviving him ?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b132-15\"> He decided the cause in the circuit court, holding <em>there, </em>the opinion held by the president here, on the first point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\"> So in tie record.

If it be so, it must be under the provision of the 60th section of the statute of wills, intestacy and distribution; which regulates the course of administration of the estate of a testator or intestate, to whom, in his lifetime, the estate of another decedent had been \u201c committed by a court of record.\u201d The words of the section are clear and unambiguous, when we take them in connection with the arrangements and provisions of the prior clauses of this same statute. It first declares what courts shall have power to hear and determine controversies testamentary, and to examine and take proof of wills, and grant certificates thereof; namely, the supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>riour courts of law, and the county and corporation ... .. . ..... , courts, within their respective jurisdictions: then it prescribes the rules by which they are to be governed; how wills shall be proved, and administration <em>granted; </em>|10W tke <em>executor or </em>administrator shall make oath, and give bond and surety; the form of the condition of this bond is set out at large; and so solicitous is the law, with regard to the security to be given, that it declares, that if any court shall grant a certificate for obtaining administration of a dead person\u2019s estate, without taking good security for the same &amp;c. the justices of the court, then sitting, shall be answerable to the persons injured &amp;c. for all loss occasioned thereby. After all these, and many other provisions, comes this 60th section, providing, in effect, that debts due from executors, to the estates of dead persons, committed to them by any court of record, shall be paid before their own debts. Having the whole scheme of the law before us, we see at once, what is meant, by committing administration by a court of record. It is clear, that the case made by the plea, is not within the literal meaning of the statute; for it needs no argument to prove, that the estate of <em>W. Dowles </em>was never committed to <em>John Turner </em>by a court of record. We must recollect too, that this provision of our statute, is not declaratory of the common law, but in derogation of its principles, and in derogation too of the rights of the fair creditors of the executor himself, a class highly favoured in law. These considerations are stated, as shewing, that we ought not to extend this section beyond cases clearly within its meaning and mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Is the present such a case ? The object of the statute was, that for the true and faithful administration of every dead person\u2019s estate, there should be a bond with good surety executed; and that all debts coming within this bond should be payable before the executor\u2019s own debts. The estate of <em>W. Dowlas </em>was, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>this law, committed to his widow, and she executed a bond with good surety for the due administration thereof, whether by herself, or by her agents. This bond was not cancelled by her marriage: it is to this day in full force and effect. Did <em>Turner </em>on his marriage, give any bond as administrator ? <em>No; </em>and there was no occasion for it, unless the sureties bound in her bond had demanded new security, and shewn a proper case for <em>it; </em>because the bond and security given by her comprehended all waste of the estate, whether committed by her before her second marriage, by the second husband during coverture, or by herself after his death. A full administration was committed to her; and she and her sureties are liable for the proper administration of the whole assets. Here, then, is all the security, which the law contemplated, for the waste stated in the plea to have been committed by <em>John Turner, </em>of the estate of <em>W. Bowles; </em>a security under the bond of <em>W. Bowles\u2019s </em>administratrix, not under the bond of <em>John Turner\u2019s </em>executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">How is the la,w settled in <em>England, </em>in case of waste done by the husband of a,n executrix ? In <em>Mounson </em>v. <em>Bourn, </em>Cro. Car. 519. the court said,\u2014\u201c If a man takes an executrix to wife, and. waste the goods, it is a <em>devastavit </em>in the <em>feme;\u201d </em>and <em>Jones </em>said, \u201cif there be a recovery against <em>baron </em>and <em>feme, </em>in the life of the <em>feme, </em>if the <em>har\u00f3n </em>survive the <em>feme, </em>he shall be charged, and also if the <em>feme </em>survive, she shall be charged; but if the recovery be not against the <em>baron </em>and <em>feme </em>in the life of the <em>feme, </em>and she dies, the <em>baron </em>shall not be charged. and with this <em>Brmnpston, </em>chief justice, agreed. I find, ihe same law laid down in <em>2 </em>Com. Dig. <em>Baron </em>and <em>Feme. 2 </em>B. <em>2 </em>C. pp. 237-8. and further it is stated, from a case in 1 Boll. 351. that if there be a judgment against husband and wife as executrix, <em>ut do bonis testatoris, </em>and upon <em>fi. fa. </em>thereupon, the sheriff returns <em>devasta,vit, </em>and. the wile dies before judgment against them <em>de bonis pro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>priis, </em>the husband shall not be charged\u201d (to which a <em>dubitatur </em>is added, whether by the reporter, or by whom, I do not know). \u201c So, if there be a judgment against husband and wife as executrix, and the wife dies, <em>debt </em>\u00bfoeg not pe againS(; the husband, upon a suggestion that he converted the goods of the testator to his own proper usefor which Lutw. 674. is cited. In 4 Vin. Abr. <em>Baron </em>and <em>Feme. </em>E. a. b. pp. 128-9.1 find the law laid down in the same way; and in later books, tire law is considered as so settled; all agreeing, that though the husband of an executrix commit waste, yet if he die before any judgment against him, his estate is discharged at law, there being no form of action in which it can be charged. And this, as a part of the common law, unchanged by any statute of ours, I consider to bo the existing law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Let us examine what is the effect of this state of the law, upon the plea of the defendant. She is the representative of <em>Martin Turner, </em>one of the sureties to the bond of the executrix of <em>John Turner. </em>Now, we all know, that these sureties being bound by the bond alone, are chargeable only so far as they have undertaken by that bond for the executrix. How far is that? The condition of the bond tells us. They undertake, substantially, that the executrix shall administer the estate according to law, paying the debts and legacies, so far as the goods, chattels and credits extend, <em>and the law shall charge her. </em>Did the law charge the executrix of <em>John Turner </em>to pay the 524 dollars, which he had converted to his own use, of the estate of <em>W. Bowles </em>? I have shown that it did not, because no <em>devastavit </em>being fixed upon him in his life, his estate was discharged, by the settled course of legal decisions ; and the administratrix of <em>W. Bowles </em>and her sureties were liable. It seems to follow, then, that the sureties of <em>John Turners </em>executrix never undertook for this debt, and are in nowise liable for it. If so, this plea cannot be good, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>states it to <em>be </em>a debt for which the sureties not only are liable, but liable in preference to a debt of the highest dignity, due from <em>John Turner </em>himself.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">But it is said, that though the estate of <em>John Turner </em>be not chargeable at law, a court of equity will follow it into the hands of his representative, and make her account for the actual amount received by <em>John Turner </em>of the estate of <em>W. Towles. </em>I admit, this is, to the fullest extent, laid down by lord <em>Redesdale, </em>in <em>Adair </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>1 Sch. &amp; Lef. 263, 4. and the cases he refers to. But this will not support this plea. For, so far from shewing it to be a debt of the first dignity, and payable before any <em>debt </em>of <em>John Turner\u2019s </em>own, this shews it not even to <em>be </em>a simple contract debt, but a mere equity. Lord <em>Redesdale </em>declares, repeatedly, that there is no remedy at law for such a debt. How then could it stand in the way of a debt due from <em>Turner\u2019s </em>executrix, by judgment against her, falsifying her plea of fully administered, and a <em>fi. fa. </em>on that judgment returned <em>nulla Iona </em>? But though <em>in equity, </em>the estate of <em>John Turner </em>is liable for as much as he received of the estate of <em>Towles, </em>that <em>equity </em>does not affect, in the slightest degree, the <em>sureties </em>to the <em>bond, </em>which the executrix gave. They have received no part of <em>John Turner\u2019s </em>estate. You can raise no equity against them. They undertook that she should pay the debts and legacies so far as the goods and chattels extended, <em>and the law charged her. </em>The law did not charge her to pay this debt; and we know it is a settled rule, that equity will never charge sureties, further than the law makes them liable. Upon every principle, then, I am of opinion, that this defendant could not defend herself by pleading this waste of <em>John Turner </em>of the estate of <em>Towles ; </em>and that the judgment must be reversed, the special plea of tho defendant and all the proceedings on it set aside, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"ABL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5T\">As I have the misfortune in this case-, <em>to </em>differ from my brethren, I must be permitted to assign at large the considerations which weigh with me. In doing so, I shall not find it necessary to examine the 0kjec\u00bfons which have been made <em>to </em>the declaration, as I am of opinion, that, without adverting to them, the judgment of the circuit court is clearly sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The action is instituted upon the administration bond against the administratrix of a surety, and sots forth a judgment and return of <em>nulla </em>bona, obtained against <em>Susan Turner </em>the administratrix of <em>John Turner </em>deceased, a copy of which judgment and execution are produced, though a <em>profer\u00ed </em>is not made of the whole proceedings. In the original suit it appears by the pleadings, that the administratrix had pleaded <em>fully administered, </em>which plea was found against her. In this action, the administratrix of the surety being impleaded, offered a plea of a debt of superiour dignity, and no assets <em>prater. </em>Out of this plea and the proceedings which followed thereupon, several important questions arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The first is, whether the verdict of the jury, in the action against the administratrix, is conclusive either against her or her surety. With respect to <em>her, </em>I think nothing can be more clear, than that <em>she might have been </em>estopped from pleading such a plea, if the plaintiff had properly made use of the -verdict against her. For there is no principle more clear than that a verdict between the same parties, in relation to the same matter, is usually conclusive if insisted upon by way of <em>estopr pel; </em>as it is unreasonable, that the suitor should be twice vexed with the trial of the same identical question, with the same adversary. Public policy requires, that limits should be opposed to the continuance of litigation upon the same subject matter, and between the same parties litigant; and therefore a matter once solemnly decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, is usually conclusive as to private rights. 1 Stark. Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Ev. part 2. p. 185. The administratrix, therefore, hod 1 <em>1 </em>. tiii she been a party to this action, coaid not have been received to contradict the former verdict that she had assets, provided that verdict was properly used as an ohstacle to the reinvestigation of the matters settled by it. On the other hand, however, it is not less true, as an elementary fule and principle of justice, that no man shall be bound by the act or admission of another, to which he was a stranger; and, consequently, no one ought to be bound as to a matter of private right, by a judgment or verdict to which he was not a party, where he could make no defence, from which he could not appeal, and which may have resulted from the negligence of another, or may even have been obtained by means of fraud and collusion. Id. These principles are stated and enforced with great strength by judge <em>Green, </em>in the case of <em>Munford </em>v. <em>Overseers of the Poor, 2 </em>Rand. 313. in which he examines, in detail, the question how far the sureties in an administration bond, are concluded by a verdict in an action against their principal establishing a <em>devastavit. </em>It is very clear from his argument, that he did not consider them as concluded; and he produces a variety of cases to shew, that the general rule, which protects one from the conclusive operation of a. verdict to which he was no party, embraces this very case of a principal and surety. The justice of this general rule, cannot be called in question, a,nd its generality must, of course, comprehend all cases not shewn to be exceptions to it. The surety, therefore, may well demand that his adversary should produce the adjudication which places him beyond the pale of this salutary principle. If there be any such case I am not aware of it, for I think it is very clear, that the cases of <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>1 Wash. 31. and <em>Greensides </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>3 Atk. 248. decide no such thing. Referring to judge <em>Green's </em>examination of these cases, which I cannot improve, and which it is unnecessary to transcribe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>I shall only point attention, particularly, to the fact, that in <em>Greensides </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>there had been suits against the sureties themselves, and judgments against them j so that the question was not whether they were concluded ky t]ie verdict and judgment against their principal, but whether they could gainsay the judgment obtained against themselves by default. As to the case of <em>Baker, treasurer, </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>Gilm. 235. it turned upon the question of the conclusiveness of the books of the trea sury, and not upon any previous verdict or judgment against the principal, though judge <em>Roane </em>relied on the two cases just cited, to sustain his opinion. That opinion has, certainly, not been very acceptable to the profession. It was most ably combated at the time, by one of the most distinguished judges of the general court, then sitting as a member of the special court of appeals which decided the cause. If it can be sustained, it is only sustainable, I think, upon grounds wholly different from those upon which the question as to the sureties for a due administration rests. Perhaps, it may be supported on the principles of the case of <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Watlington, </em>3 Brod. &amp; Bing. 132. 7 Eng. C. L. R. 379.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> though, as <em>Preston </em>was in full life, even this seems difficult. In that case, the action was on a bond given by the defendant, as surety for a collector of taxes, and the books of the collector were admitted as evidence against the surety, upon the ground, that the entries were entries in a <em>public book, </em>which it was not reasonable to suppose a man would wantonly make against himself. In that case, however, the collector was himself dead, which was important, as may be seen by reference to the principles laid down in reference to this branch of the law of evidence. 2 Stark. Law Ev. part 2. p. 312. 3 Id. part 4. p. 1388. Such, then, being the scanty ground upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>which the position is sustained, which makes a verdict . ~ . against the principal conclusive against the sureties, let us see, what is the state of authority on the other side. And here, 1 shall first refer to <em>Gordon\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Frederick Justices, </em>1 Munf. 1. where judge <em>Tucker </em>admits, that by our law the sureties are not concluded, though he deemed it otherwise by the euglish law; and next, I refer to the cases collected by judge <em>Green, </em>in <em>Mumford </em>v. <em>Overseers of the Foot. </em>From them we find, that the finding, in a <em>scire facias </em>on a recognizance, against a principal, is no <em>estoppel </em>in another <em>scire facias </em>against the surety; 10 Vin. Abr. Estoppel. K. pl. 17. p. 444. So, the admission of B. of the amount of goods bought by him, is not oven admissible against A. who bound himself to pay for <em>them; </em>5 Esp. Cas. 26. And the admissions of partners are no evidence against each other <em>after the dissolution, though both are </em>bound, and both were conjunct and principals in the partnership transactions; <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Cocke, </em>3 Munf. 191. <em>Rootes </em>v. <em>Welford, </em>4 Munf. 215. Now, as verdicts may bo found on the admission of a party, it would be incongruous to admit the verdict as evidence against one as to whom the admission is unavailing; so that I think we may affirm, that whore the admission of a party is not evidence against another, a verdict against him will not be so. Add to these cases, that of <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Wallinglon, </em>already cited; from which it appears, that even the <em>receipts </em>of the collector, though he was dead, were not admissible evidence against his surety; and we have a succession of authorities, which, though not to the very point in question, appear to decide it by necessary inference. In the case last cited, indeed, it is obvious, that chief justice <em>Dallas </em>considered the general rule to he, that books and receipts of the principal were not even admissible against the sureties, unless there were particular circumstances to justify their introduction. I next refer to the case of <em>Mumford </em>v. <em>Overseers of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Poor </em>itself. In that case, it was decided, that a judgment against the sheriff was not conclusive evidence against his sureties, and if it went no farther would be conclusive of the point, as it was the opinion of the whole court consisting of three judges. But it is of more weight, because this very question of the administrator\u2019s bond was discussed, and the law in relation to it declared by one of the judges, assented to by another, and not controverted by the third. The next case 1 shall mention is <em>M'Dowell </em>v. <em>Burwell\u2019s adm'r, </em>4 Rand. 317. In that case also, it was decided, that in an action against the sureties of a sheriff, judgments obtained against him, are not evidence against <em>them; </em>and to this opinion, there was an accession in the person of judge <em>Carr, </em>who had been appointed since the case of <em>Mun-ford </em>v. <em>Overseers of the Poor </em>was decided. In the case of <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Hill, 2 </em>Leigh 393. a judgment confessed by the sheriff, with the assent of the deputy, but without the knowledge of his sureties, was indeed held to be <em>admissible </em>evidence, but not <em>conclusive, </em>forjudge <em>Carr, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, said that it charged the sureties, unless disproved by them. In addition to these authorities, I will refer to an elementary writer, very often cited in this court, who seems to understand the principle of evidence as to this matter, as I do. In <em>2 </em>Stark. Law Ev. part 4. p. 48. it is said, that an ad-, mission by the principal is not evidence against his surety in the contract; and 3 Id. part 4. pp. 1386, 7. the same principle is again promulgated. In a note to the same page, <em>Beall </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>3 Har. &amp; M\u2019Hen. 242. is cited; in which it was decided, that, in an action on a bond against the administrator of a surety, a judgment on an award against the principal, in a former action brought by him, was not evidence. So, the record of a verdict and judgment in an action on a recognizance against the principal, is not evidence against the surety; 3 Yeates 128. 16 Mass. Rep. 6. Sustained by all these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>authorities, I cannot douht, that the salutary safeguard, which has been created for the protection of the rights of persons who axe no parties to the record, has a full application to the case of sureties in an administration bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">But, admitting it <em>to </em>be <em>true, that the </em>verdict against the principal <em>may </em>avail the creditor as conclusive, the next question is, whether, in this case, he has taken the proper steps to make it so. On this point, I think, there is no room for difference of opinion. Before a jury, there is no evidence in itself necessarily conclusive. There is no evidence which may not be contradicted, except in the case of an <em>estoppel, </em>and even then it must be pleaded and relied on as such, or the matter will be left at large. Even a verdict between the same parties, on the same matter in controversy, must be pleaded by way of <em>estoppel, </em>or it will not conclude; for if they go to trial on the general issue, it will only be evidence to be weighed by the jury, and they <em>may </em>find against it. <em>Vooght </em>v. <em>Winch, 2 </em>Barn. &amp;. Ald. 662. 6 Munf. 120. Hob. 206. 207. 3 East 365. 1 Wms. Saund. 325. note 4. 1 Chitty 573. 575. 617. In the case of <em>Vooght </em>v. <em>Winch, </em>a former action had been brought by the same plaintiff against the same defendant, for the same cause of action, and <em>the </em>defendant had a verdict. In this last action, he pleaded <em>not guilty, </em>and gave in evidence the record of the former verdict and judgment, insisting that it was conclusive evidence against the plaintiff, and that it operated as an <em>estoppel. </em>The court decided otherwise, and the plaintiff lia,d a verdict. These facts appearing upon the judge\u2019s certificate, and the case coming on to be heard, on a rule <em>nisi, </em>chief justice <em>Abbott </em>was of opinion, that the verdict and judgment were not conclusive evidence against the plaintiff on the plea of <em>not guilty. </em>\u201c It would indeed,\u201d says he, \u201c have been conclusive, if pleaded in bar to the action by way of <em>estoppel. </em>In that case, the plaintiff would not be allowed to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>case defendant, and for the second time to disturb and vex him by the agitation of the same ques-\u00bfon&gt; gut pas pieaqe(j <em>not guilty, </em>and thereby elected to submit his case to the jury. Now, if the former verdict was proper to be received in evidence, its effect must be left to the jury.\u201d\u2014\u201c It appears to me that the party, by not pleading the former judgment in bar, consents that the whole matter shall go to a jury, and leaves it open to them to inquire into the same upon evidence, and they are to give their verdict upon the whole evidence then submitted to them.\u201d He then expresses his dissent to an opinion of lord <em>Mansfield, </em>that a former recovery need not be pleaded, but may be given in evidence on the general issue. <em>Bayley </em>was of the same opinion, and so was <em>Holroyd. </em>\u201cA party,\u201d says the latter, \u201cmay have matter which he may either give in evidence, or which if pleaded would be an estoppelbut when he puts it to the jury to find what the fact was, it is inconsistent with the issue which he has joined, to say that \"the jury are <em>estopped </em>from going into the inquiry.\u201d This case, then, shews beyond question, that to make the former verdict and judgment conclusive, even between the same parties to a subsequent action, they must be pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Let us next inquire how they must be pleaded? And here, the authorities before quoted are equally decisive, that matter of <em>estoppel </em>must be pleaded and relied on as an <em>estoppel, </em>and must have the commencement and conclusion appropriate thereto. And if they have not, the <em>estoppel </em>loses its effect. For <em>estoppels </em>are odious in law, since they conclude the party from proving, and the court and jury from deciding, according to the truth. Therefore, they must be pleaded with certainty to every intent, and in tire strictest form. And where matter of <em>estoppel </em>is replied, the plaintiff should rely on it, or he will lose the benefit of it, and the proper conclusion is a prayer of judgment whether the defendant ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to be permitted to plead his plea. 1 Chitty 575. 616. 617. 1 Wms. Saund. 325. note 4. Nor is this mere matter of form; it is matter of substance: for the party by replying the <em>estoppel, </em>and relying on it, demands of the court to exclude the other party from the defence, not because it is not a good defence if true, but because after a verdict against him, he has no right to allege that it is true. Whereas if he replies the matter without relying on the <em>estoppel, </em>he does not demand that the plea shall be excluded, but admits it to be pleaded, and offers the former verdict as an answer to it. But answer, surely, it is none. For the plea here alleged, that the administratrix had no assets <em>prater, </em>and the first replication neither avoided that allegation, nor denied it, but merely set forth the finding of the fact the other way by a jury of twelve men. This was certainly not a reply, unless used as an <em>estoppel, </em>which it was not. I think, therefore, the court was right in rejecting the first replication to the plea, as it did not rely on the <em>estoppel, </em>and in no other aspect could it be regarded as a sufficient answer to the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Upon the rejection of this replication, however, the plaintiff filed another, to which the defendant demurred. I am of opinion that the replication was bad; but as the demurrer was on the part of the defendant, we are carried back by it to his own plea, which if faulty must be overruled. For the party who demurs exposes himself to the disadvantage of opening all objections to any part of his own pleadings, without a similar right to revive objections, which had once been waived by him, by pleading over to those of his adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We come then to the inquiry, whether the special plea of the defendant is a good plea. In substance, it is a plea that the defendant\u2019s principal had only assets enough to pay a debt duo from <em>Turner </em>her testator to the estate of one <em>Dowles, </em>whose administrator the- testator was, in right of his wife. He had himself wasted the estate during the coverture; and the debt thus due; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>from him to his testator\u2019s estate, was pleaded as of superiour dignity to the plaintiff\u2019s demand. To make this a good plea, two things must appear; 1. that <em>Turner's </em>estate is liable to <em>Dowles; 2. </em>that the debt is of supeiqour dignity, under our statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. $ 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">As to the first, it does not appear to me to be a debateable. question. No authority can be necessary to prove, that he who by law is invested with the administration of a dead man\u2019s estate, is responsible, if he 'wastes it or applies it to his own use; and that after his death, though the action died at common law, his representative is, in like manper, responsible, since our statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. \u00a7 65. 66. The <em>quo modo </em>of reaching him may indeed be matter of question; and it seems to be doubted by lord Redesdale, whether there is any form of action <em>at law, </em>whereby the estate of a husband executor in right of his wife, can be charged in a court of law, for a waste committed by himself during the coverture. Without designing to controvert this high authority, I shall observe, that the terms of our statute appear to embrace the case, in letter as well as in spirit. It provides, that the executor or administrator of a rightful executor or administrator, by whom any waste shall have been committed, shall be chargeable in the same manner, as his testator or intestate might have been. The testator would have been liable for the waste committed, to <em>Dowles\u2019s </em>estate, and therefore his executor would be. And, indeed, if the case of <em>M\u2019Murdo </em>be the law of this court, the <em>feme </em>administratrix, perhaps, could not recover for the waste, but the creditors and legatees of <em>Dowles </em>could only get at the assets by suing the representative of that executor who had wasted the assets. If this be so, then there can be no difficulty in reaching <em>Turner\u2019s </em>estate at law. But be this as it may, the same able chancellor just quoted, places it beyond question, that it is liable in equity; <em>Adair </em>v. <em>Shaw, 1 </em>Sch. &amp; Lef. 243. Now, whe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ther the estate be chargeable at law or in equity, the representative of <em>Turner </em>is equally hound, in behalf of a creditor of superiour dignity, to protect the assets against any demands of inferiour dignity.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Therefore, the true question is, <em>2. </em>Whether this ho a debt of superiour dignity f This depends upon the construction of our statute, the terms of which clearly comprehend the case of executors and administrators in their own right, but are supposed not to embrace the case of an executor in right of his wife. That a. man who marries an executrix or administratrix, becomes thereby executor or administrator in her right during the coverture, is a principle too familiar to require to be sustained by authority. That he and his estate should be liable for bis own acts, as she and her estate were liable before the coverture for hcr\u2019s, and that he is bound to administer precisely as she is bound to administer, would seem to be the natural consequence of administering in her right; for by the substitution to her rights, he is not less substituted to her obligations. And as, in the event of her death, the debt from <em>her </em>estate to <em>'Dowles, </em>would have been a debt of the first dignity, so it would seem, that in case of his death, the debt from <em>his </em>estate to <em>Dowles </em>must bo a debt of superiour dignity. The question of the dignity of the debts, is a question which does not concern the administrator, who is liable for all the assets, but cannot be made liable for more than all. It is a question which concerns the creditors of a decedent, and as between them, the la.w has chosen to give a superiority to those debts which are due to the estates of wards, lunatics, and testators or intestates. The object of that provision was to distinguish between debts, not to draw a line between the different kinds of fiduciaries. Its design was to give a superiority to debts due from executors and other fiduciaries, invested with their powers by act of law, and not to exempt one set of fiduciaries, while it was sedulously charging others. It uses very general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>language; language which conveys the idea, that the o o ca o purpose of the draftsman was to embrace all possible cases, instead of excluding any. If, therefore, the terms of the statute were not susceptible of a construction embracing the case of the husband of an executrix, I should still think the court bound to consider the case within it, as being obviously within the mischief. How many instances of this have we ? Actions of <em>trover </em>are not mentioned in the 64th section of the statute of wills, yet they are considered as comprehended by it. Executors are not named in the 58th section, yet they are comprehended by it. Legatees are omitted in the same section, yet they too are embraced by its construction. So here, the object was to render the estate of every fiduciary who derived his authority from the law, liable to pay the debt due to his ward, his testator or intestate, before his own proper debt. Now, the husband did derive his authority from the law; yea, from the record. Had he pleaded <em>ne unque executor, </em>his plea would have been falsified by production of the letters testamentary, and proof of his marriage. Had he sued, he must have averred the fact of marriage, and made <em>profert </em>of the letters testamentary, as giving him his authority. It is, then, no stretch of construction, to say, that the estate of <em>Dowles, </em>having been before the marriage committed to <em>Mrs. Dowles, </em>it was upon the marriage, to be taken to be committed to the husband, since otherwise he could have no authority to administer it, or to commence and prosecute actions against its debtors. He is, in short, executor in her right, but still he is executor. Under what authority ? Under the authority of \u201c the court of record\u201d which granted the administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">I am therefore of opinion, that the plea is good. I also think the last replication to it is bad, as under all circumstances the husband\u2019s estate is responsible for his own waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b142-4\"> The case of <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Watlington </em>decides, only, that the hooks kept by the principal, are <em>admissible evidence </em>against the surety, not that they are <em>conclusive evidence.\u2014Reporter.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
