The declaration was in the form laid down in 2 Ukitt~j on Pleadings, p. 267, with no material difference. The defendant demurred; alledging, 1st, that the remedy of the plaintiff for the injury in the declaration alledged, ought to have been an action of rIlreS_ pass vi et armis, and not on the case; `2dly, that the declaration contained no positive averment of any injury done by the tlefendaiit to the plaintirn The Court, on argument, over-ruled the demurrer; whereupon a Jury was impanelled.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzSR\"><em>On the trial of the cause, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the Jury that, if they should consider, from the whole of th~ evidence, that the father, in the interconrse between the defendant and the plaintiff's daugh</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ter <em>Polly Elliott, </em>(who was of full age,) did not act with the caution of a man of ordinary prudence, in that case they should find <em>for the defendant; </em>which instruction was retu5ed by the Court:-but the Court did instruct the Jury that, if the conduct of the plaintiff should appear to have been <em>indiscrete that </em>was a circumstance which should <em>mitigate the damages. </em>To this opinion the defendant excepted.

It is there said, in note (\u00ab), that <em>case </em>seems the inore proper form, when the action is <em>merely </em>for the seduction and loss of service; and so says Judge Buller in <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>Allcott, </em>2 <em>Term Rep. </em>167, which opinion is supported by the reason and nature of the thing; the injury being only <em>consequential, </em>and <em>not accompanied with force. </em>The declaration, it is true, <em>may </em>be in Trespass <em>vi et </em>armis, hut this is founded on a fiction of law, which <em>supposes force </em>in such cases; but, in fact, there is no force at all; at any rate, none to <em>the father </em>or <em>his </em>property: as to <em>him, </em>the damages are all consequential.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtSX\">As to the quoa c~trn, Chitty says it is proper in such a case as this, though improper in trespass.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In Pate v.
