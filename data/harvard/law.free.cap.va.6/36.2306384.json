The claim is opposed by the legatees of the testator\u2019s widow, who claim a share of this subject in her right. A provision was made for her by the will of her husband, which she never renounced. She had no right to any more of her husband\u2019s estate than that which was bequeathed to her by his will. The statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. \u00a7 26. p. 381. is express; and so are all the cases on the point in this court; the last of which is <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Winston, 4 </em>Leigh 152. where the other cases are cited. The decree is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
