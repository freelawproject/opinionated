This instrument was signed and sealed by <em>Roberts, </em>and by <em>Mays, </em>in the name of the firm, <em>Kyles Sp Mays; </em>but neither of the <em>Kyles </em>authorized him to execute it for them. <em>Mays, </em>and after him <em>Roberts, </em>died during the term of five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\"><em>William Davis, </em>the executor <em>of Roberts, </em>and <em>Matilda Roberts, </em>his widow and devisee, exhibited a bill in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>against <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle, </em>surviving partners of <em>Kyles SpMays, </em>and <em>Mary Ann Mays, </em>administratrix of the deceased partner Mays,\u2014setting forth the articles of the 6th May 1818, and alleging, that the house of <em>Kyles Sp Mays, </em>which was carrying on an extensive trade in dry <em>goods, </em>entered on the premises in pursuance of the lease, and occupied and enjoyed the same, paying the stipulated rent quarterly, until the death of <em>Mays: </em>that <em>Roberts, </em>the lessor, in his lifetime, had many dealings with <em>Kyles fy Mays, </em>purchasing goods of them, and receiving j^art of the rents of the premises; and after his death, his widow and devisee, the plaintiff <em>Matilda, </em>had also purchased goods of them, for which <em>Davis, </em>the executor, was willing that a credit should be allowed against the rents due from <em>Kyles SpMays </em>on the <em>lease; </em>but all these accounts remained yet unsettled: that <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle, </em>the surviving partners, now insisted, that they were nowise bound by the covenant executed by their deceased partner <em>Mays, </em>since they had not executed that deed, or given <em>Mays </em>authority to execute it for them; and that by agreement with <em>Mays, </em>the partnership was only to be liable for a rent of 600 dollars, for a house for the transaction of the partnership business: that if this was true, the administratrix of <em>Mays </em>was bound to pay 400 dollars of the <em>rent; </em>but the plaintiffs believed there was no such agreement between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Kyles </em>and <em>Mays, </em>and if there was, <em>Roberts, </em>the lessor, was not privy to it, but intended to lease the premises to the house of <em>Kyles fy Mays, </em>for the yearly rent of 1000 dollars, to be paid by the partnership; and if the partnership was not bound by the deed which was executed by <em>Mays </em>alone, yet it was bound by the contract made by <em>Mays </em>for its benefit, of which that deed was only the evidence, since the partnership had actually taken and enjoyed the benefit of it, and the rent reserved was perfectly reasonable, and had been credited to the lessor in his accounts with the partnership, on its own books, at the stipulated rate of 1000 dollars yearly: that the <em>Kyles </em>refused to pay more than 600 dollars of the yearly rents accrued before <em>Mays\u2019s </em>death, and refused to pay any of the rents accrued since: and that the accounts between <em>Kyles 8f Mays, </em>and <em>Roberts, </em>in his lifetime, and the plaintiff\u2019s since his death, having none of them been settled, it could not be known how much of the rent was due, or what proportion thereof was properly due to <em>Roberts\u2019s </em>executor, and what to his devisee; and therefore, the executor and devisee joined in this bill. And the bill called on <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle </em>to render the accounts; and prayed, that all the accounts should be settled, and a decree against <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle, </em>the surviving partners, for the balance that might be found due of the whole of the rents for the whole term of five years, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\"><em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle </em>answered, that they had never assented to or sanctioned the lease executed by <em>Mays, </em>or authorized him to execute any such <em>deed; </em>they were not bound by the deed; the plaintiffs\u2019 proper remedy was an action at law against the representative of <em>Mays; </em>and they had no just claim to relief in equity against the surviving partners: that <em>Mays </em>was authorized to take a house for the business of the partnership at a rent not exceeding 600 dollars a year: that the partnership was not bound to furnish him a house for the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>commodation of his family: that a part of the tenement leased by <em>Roberts </em>to <em>Mays, </em>was occupied for the use of the partnership, until <em>Mays\u2019s </em>death, but not the whole of it;. the other part having been occupied by <em>Mays, </em>in his lifetime, as a dwelling: that the yearly rent of 1000 dollars for the whole tenement, was most unreasonable : and that though it was true, that credits for the rent at the rate of 1000 dollars a year, to <em>Roberts </em>in his lifetime, and to his widow since his death, had been entered on the books of the partnership, yet the surviving partners had never been apprised of the fact till after <em>Mays\u2019s </em>death. And they exhibited all the accounts on their books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><em>Mary Ann Mays </em>administratrix of <em>David Mays, </em>answered, that she believed the lease of the tenement was taken by <em>Mays, </em>for and on account of the partnership : that the upper part of the tenement was occupied by her husband and his family as a dwelling, and she expected to be charged for the use and occupation thereof, in the settlement of accounts between her intestate\u2019s estate and his surviving partners, for which a suit was then pending: that the surviving partners had taken possession of all the partnership property; and that nothing of her intestate\u2019s estate had yet come to her hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">Depositions were taken and filed by the plaintiffs, proving that the yearly rent of 1000 dollars reserved in the lease, was the reasonable yearly value of the tenement. And it appeared by the accounts taken from the books of <em>Kyles fy Mays, </em>and exhibited by the defendants, that the rents had been credited in those accounts, to the lessor in his lifetime, and his representative since his death, at the rate of 1000 dollars a year, till the 31st March 1821.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">The chancellor referred the accounts to a commissioner ; who reported, that rents were due to the plaintiffs, at the rate of 1000 dollars a year, from the 31st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>March 1821 to the 1st June 1823, the end of the term. He also reported the accounts of <em>Kyles fy Mays, </em>and of the house after <em>Mays's </em>death, against the lessor in his lifetime and his widow since his death, as the surviving partners had rendered them, on which a balance of 812 dollars was claimed against the widow; but there was no proof of the justice of these accounts; and <em>Mrs. Roberts </em>the widow admitted, that 487 dollars, but no more, was due from her, on the 1st August 1822, to be credited against the demand for rents, as of that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">The plaintiffs excepted to the report, because interest was not allowed them on the balance of rents reported to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">The defendants, <em>D. </em>and <em>W. Kyle, </em>excepted to the report\u20141. Because, as <em>Mays </em>had died during the term, and they had occupied the premises since his death, and as there was no written contract of lease signed by them, or by any person authorized by them, the lease for the term of five years, was nowise binding on them, by the statute of frauds, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101. \u00a7 1. p. 372. and if they were chargeable for use and occupation, that charge could not be carried beyond the time of actual occupation. 2. Because if they were chargeable for use and occupation, after they ceased to occupy the tenement, the rent charged was too high. 3. Because a due proportion of the rent ought to have been charged to <em>Mays's </em>administratrix. And 4. because there was no credit given for 8.12 dollars, the balance of their account rendered against the plaint!S' <em>Mrs. Roberts, </em>which accounts, having been called for by the bill, were evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-10\">The chancellor, on the hearing, overruled all the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the report; and declared, that though the deed of May 1818 was not such a contract as would bind the surviving partners of <em>Kyles Sf Mays, </em>who did not execute it, in an action of covenant at law, yet it was written evidence of a contract for the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of a house for the use of the partnership, which was such a contract as one partner might bind the partnership to perform; and, as the partnership had entered on the premises, and occupied it for seyeral years in the transaction of their mercantile business, paying the rents reserved in the contract from time to time, the court therefore regarded the contract as binding in equity on the surviving partners : and that, as it was at least doubtful, having regard to the peculiar circumstances of the case, whether the plaintiffs could have distrained the goods of the surviving partners for the rent in arrear, therefore they were entitled to interest on the same. Therefore, the court decreed, that the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle </em>should pay the plaintiffs 1699 dollars (being the balance of the rents in arrear, as reported by the commissioner, after crediting 487 dollars, admitted by the plaintiff' <em>Matilda </em>Roberts, to be due from her, on the 1st August 1822), with interest on the balance of rents till paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">From this decree, the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants, said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ4\">1. That the case was not properly relievable in equity, since the executor had a plain remedy at law, by action of covenant against the\u2018administratrix of <em>Mays, </em>who had executed, and who was certainly bound by, the articles of May 1818, and whose estate was solvent; and the question how much of the rents ought to be paid by <em>Mays\u2019s </em>estate, and how much by the partnership of <em>Kyles Sf Mays, </em>was a question to be determined in the settlement of the partnership accounts, between the estate of the deceased partner and surviving partners. 2. That the deed of May 1818, not having been executed or authorized by <em>David </em>and <em>William Kyle, </em>was nowise binding on them, and could not be regarded as a note in writing of an agreement on their part, for a lease of five years, and so the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>agreement was void by the statute of frauds; or, if the deed could be regarded as a note in writing of such an agreement by the partnership, then an action at law on the agreement would have lain against the surviving partners, and there was no ground for resorting to the court of equity for relief. 3. That the court ought to have decreed such portion of the rents, as were justly due for the part of the tenement which was occupied by <em>Mays </em>for a dwelling, and not for the use of the partnership, against <em>Mays\u2019s </em>administratrix, since she admitted that her intestate\u2019s estate was justly chargeable with that. 4. That the accounts of <em>Kyles fy Mays </em>against <em>Mrs. Roberts, </em>having been called for by the bill, should have been taken <em>as prima facie </em>evidence at least, of the balance due from her; and a credit ought to have been allowed for the whole balance appearing on those accounts, instead of only so much of it as she admitted. 5. That the decree was erroneous in allowing interest on the rents. The ground on which it was allowed, was, in effect, that the rents were not due at law, but only in equity; which, he said, was a strange reason for giving interest in chancery, which a court of law would not have allowed, if the demand for the rents had been a legal one. He cited the cases decided by this court, on the question of allowing interest on rents in arrear; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Woodson, 2 </em>Call 249. <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Clinch, </em>Id. 253. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 463. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>Id. 470: <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Munf. 21. <em>Michie </em>v. <em>Wood\u2019s ex\u2019or, 5 </em>Rand. 571.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-8\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees, answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao0R\">1. That though the lessor\u2019s executor might have maintained an action at law against <em>Mays\u2019s </em>administratrix, yet if the plaintiffs had also an equitable demand against the surviving partners of <em>Kyles fy Mays, </em>the existence of a right of action at law against the former, was no reason for denying the equitable relief they were entitled to against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>latter. It was true, <em>Mays\u2019s </em>estate was solvent; but then, it consisted of his share of the partnership effects, and these were in the hands of the surviving partners. These rents were a debt of the partnership, which, though ex-linguished at law <em>by Mays\u2019s </em>covenant, was not thereby extinguished in equity. He cited <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Dishman\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>3 Leigh 548. as conclusive of the question of right, as well as the question of jurisdiction. 2. He said, that if <em>Mays </em>had signed the instrument of May 1818, without sealing it, that would have been such a note in writing of the agreement of the partnership for the lease of five years, as the statute of frauds required; and it would be strange, if the putting of a seal to the signature of <em>Kyles &amp; Mays, </em>should make it less a note in writing of the agreement. 3. Taking these rents to be a debt of the partnership, it was right to decree it against the surviving partners, leaving them to charge so much of it as was justly chargeable to the estate of the deceased partner, in the settlement of the partnership accounts. 4. The accounts of <em>Kyles Sf Mays </em>against the plaintiffs, were called for in the bill, for the purpose of shewing that the partnership had paid the rents, and how much of them had been paid. That there was no admission of the justice of those accounts, was obvious, since the plaintiffs did not know, at the time, what they were, and prayed a settlement of them. 5. As to interest on the rents, he said, there was no reason why interest should not be allowed on a just equitable demand, as well as on a legal one; that the principal reason why interest was not, in general, allowed on rents in arrear, was, that the lessor had a summary remedy for them by distress. This was shewn by the cases cited for the appellants. And in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>the court said, that it was discretionary in the court, to allow interest or not; that, in that case \u201c the defendant had no title to have it taken off, as he had endea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>voured to defeat the rents altogether, and thereby delayed the payment;\u201d which was exactly what the defendants had done in this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-8\">The court</author>\n<p id=\"AKfq\">held that the decree was erroneous in allowing interest on the rents, and therefore reversed it with costs; and it remanded the cause for further proceedings, with directions to allow the appellants to adduce proof, if they could, of the balance of their claim against <em>Mrs. Roberts, </em>beyond what she had admitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
