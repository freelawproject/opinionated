In the sale of a lease of a house and tenement iii a town, if the vendor fail to shew the lease to the vendee, and do not inform him of a Covenant therein, that, in case of destruction~ of the house by fire, the lease shall terminate and become void; this is such a concealment as vitiates the contract; and, if the house be destroyeclby fire in a short time~ Equity will relieve the vendee by injoining the Vendor from collecting the purchase ~noney, and by directing his notes for the same to be given up and cancel`ed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACQ\">Franklin exhibited his Bill against Suelson &amp; Co. in tho Superior Court of Chancery for the Richrnoi~d District, setting forth, that, on the 15th of March 1811, Doctor Jo1n~ R~ archer leased a house and tenement in Petersburg to Snelson &amp; Co. for the term of eight years and five months, to commence on the first of May in that year, and to determine on the 1st of October 1819, at the annual rent of ~OO, and, for the last five months, at the rent of ~8S S3 1-S cents; with a covenant that losses by fire, lightning and tempest, were excepted; and that, in case of destruction by such accidents, the lease should terminate, and because votd, but Snelson &amp; Co. should pay the rent up to the time of such destruction:that, on the 15th of July 1815, a contract was made between the complainant and defendants, whereby the foriner was to take the lease of a moiety of the premises, from that day to the end of the term, to pay them ~i500 for the same, by instalments, and moreover to pay Imi \u00a3 the rent per annum to Doctor archer :-that articles were drawn on the same day, which state that Franklin had taken the lease; (without adding that pOSSCSnOU was to be deli-vered to him on the .Mbnday following, as was in truth the agreement;) and that, in point of fhct, possession was never delivered: that lie gave his notes negotiable at Bank for the three instalments of the ~1 500; that he had never seen 4rcher's lease, and was utterly ignorant of the covenant for termiimation of the lease in case of destruction by fire, &amp;c~; that, on the-night of Sunday, July 16th, the whole house was destroyed by the great fire at Petersburg; yet, notwithstai~ding such destruction, whereby the lease was terminated, the defendants insisted on payment of the said three notes negotiable at Bank. The Bill prayed therefore, that they be enjoined from depositing the said notes in Bank for collection; that the notes he. delivered up to he cancelled: and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ad8\">The Injunction was awarded. <em>Snelson </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>answer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ed, that, having built a new bouse on the premises, they sold to the plaintiff their unexpired term in a moiety of the tenement; that it was the intention of the bargain that, as to that moiety, <em>he should stand in all respects in the same situation they stood' </em>in,; and that he was to pay them the purchase money <em>at all events. </em>They admitted that they did not show him their lease from <em>Archer, </em>nor mention to him the covenant therein for the termination thereof in case of destruction by fire &amp;c. They denied the, alledgod agreement that possession should be delivered on Monday July 17th; insisting that he took the lease on and from July 15th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-3\">The Complainant replied generally; and commissions were awarded. Depositions were taken, on one side, to prove that, in truth, possession was delivered on the 15th of July 1815; and, on the other, that it was not delivered, nor was to have been delivered, until Monday, July 17th. A witness swore that, on the said 15th of July, the Complainant, in conversation with him, agreed that, if the house should be burnt on the next day, it would be bis loss. It was also proved that <em>Archer </em>had re-entered on the premises since the fire, and leased the ground to <em>Hector McNeil, </em>the chief acting partner of the firm of <em>Snelson </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>for a term of twenty two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-4\">At June Term 1816, Chancellor Taylor perpetuated the injunction, and decreed that the defendants should deliver up to <em>Franklin </em>his negotiable notes, to he cancelled; whereupon the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-5\"><em>May </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">This is a contract under seal; from which the Court will not infer any thing more than it expresses. There is no <em>warranty </em>in it. Could an action at law have been maintained upon it by the Complainant against <em>.McNeil </em>and <em>f\u00ednelson? </em>They merely sold their lease as they held it. Shall the mere circumstance of his coming into equity to obtain an Injunction, to prevent their collecting the money, give him aright which he had not at law ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-7\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-8\">The important circumstance, that the lease was to terminate in case of destruction of the house by fire, was; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>concealed.-\u2014Such concealment is constructive fraud; and, whether so designed or not, it had all the effect of a fraud on ns. If the money had been paid, it might have been recovered by <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received, the consideration having failed. The Court of Equity, then, may exert it\u2019s preventive power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-4\">The statements in the answer arc not reconcileable with each other. It is there acknowledged that this circumstance was concealed; yet it is also said that the purchaser of the lease was to stand in all respects in the same situation with the original lessees! He took upon him indeed the risk of loss by fire, so far that he supposed he was to pay the rent though the house should be burnt; hut he did not suppose that, in such event, he was to lose the lease altogether: he knew nothing of that stipulation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\">There is a representation in the articles of agreement that the lease was to continue four years : which representation amounted to a covenant to that effect: but all the benefit that, at the utmost,passed to the purchaser was two days possession of the premises.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">October 30th, 1818, the Court affirmed the Decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
