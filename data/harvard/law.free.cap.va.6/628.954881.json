Pendleton </em>conveyed to <em>Fayette Mauzy </em>and <em>Martin Slaughter, </em>certain real and personal property, in trust, to be sold for the payment of his debts, in the order therein specified. <em>Mrs. Pendleton </em>did not join in this deed; hut upon an understanding with the trustees, that she was to be compensated for the value of her dower interest in the lands, she joined in the deeds to the purchasers, except as to a tract of thirty-eight acres of land and a mill thereon, which was sold by the trustees to <em>Waller R. Asher. </em>After this land and the mill had been sold by the trustees to <em>Asher, </em>hut before the contract of sale was reduced to writing, <em>Asher </em>consented that <em>Pendleton </em>should be joined with him in his purchase, and the memorandum of the agreement was between the trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of the one part, and <em>Asher </em>and <em>Pendleton </em>of the other _ part. The agreement bears date the 10th of September 1830, and sets out the sale by the trustees to <em>Asher </em>and <em>Pendleton, </em>of the land and mill, and the renting to <em>Asher </em>a certain field, for the year <em>1831; </em>for which property, <em>Asher </em>and <em>Pendleton </em>agree to give 1600 dollars, payable in three equal annual payments from and after the 1st of the next November, the payments to fall due on the 1st day of November in each year. And they agree to give their joint and several bonds, with good personal security, and a deed of trust to secure the purchase money. And in the same instrument, it was agreed between <em>Asher </em>and <em>Pendleton, </em>that <em>Asher </em>should pay 100 dollars for the field which he rented. And it was further agreed between them, \u201c that in case the said <em>Asher </em>had to pay all or any part of <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>portion of the purchase money, then he the said <em>Asher, </em>may if he chooses, demand a conveyance from the said <em>Pendleton, </em>of his interest in said mill and land attached, which he the said <em>Pendleton </em>agrees to make when he the said <em>Asher </em>shall have paid all the purchase money above mentioned, to the said <em>Mauzy </em>and <em>Slaughter, </em>and in case any part shall have been paid by the said <em>Pendleton, </em>shall have repaid the same to him with interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-9\">When the first payment for the land and mill became due, the acting trustee <em>Slaughter, </em>without applying to <em>Pendleton, </em>who he supposed to be unable to pay the money, demanded payment of <em>Asher, </em>who paid the whole amount; though <em>Pendleton </em>had informed the trustee that he expected to pay his proportion of the first instalment of the purchase money, by appropriating thereto the amount to which <em>Mrs. Pendleton </em>would be entitled from the trustees for her dower interest in the lauds which they had sold, and in the conveyances for which, she had united.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>It appears that <em>Asher </em>was in possession of the mill from the time of the purchase, and managed it for the joint benefit, of himself and <em>Pendleton; </em>but when he had been required to pay the whole of the first instalment the purchase money, he refused any longer to recognize <em>Pendleton </em>as a joint owner; and insisted that under their agreement, he was entitled to the whole property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-7\">Upon the refusal of <em>Asher </em>to permit <em>Pendleton </em>to share in the profits of the mill, <em>Pendleton </em>and his wife (she suing by her next friend) filed their bill in the Circuit court of <em>Culpeper </em>county against <em>Asher </em>and the trustees, in which, after setting out the deed and agreement as aforesaid, it was alleged that it had been agreed between <em>Pendleton </em>and the trustees and <em>Mrs. Pendle</em>ton, that she should have <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>interest in the land and mill, in consideration of her relinquishment of her right of dower in the other lands sold; or that <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>part of the purchase money should not be demanded until <em>Mrs. Pendleton\u2019s </em>dower interest had been valued, and the amount so due to her should be first applied to the payment of said purchase money. They charged that <em>Asher </em>was fully informed of this arrangement; and they also charged that the profits of the mill, to which she was entitled, would have paid all that was due from her. That <em>Asher </em>had procured from one of the trustees a receipt for 500 dollars, purporting to be on account of the mill purchased, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiffs, and without having been required by the trustees to pay on account of the said transaction, any thing more than his own part of the said first instalment; and that he then claimed to be the sole owner of the mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-8\">The prayer of the bill was, that the moiety of the land and mill might be decreed to be settled by the trustees to the separate use of <em>Mrs. Pendleton; </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Asher </em>might be compelled to render an account of the profits ; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-6\">The trustees answered, admitting that they had alw<em></em>ays considered themselves bound to pay to <em>Mrs. Pendleton </em>a reasonable compensation for the relinquishment of her dower in the real estate sold by them; and they exhibited with their answer, a statement of the proceeds of the sales, amounting to 4135 dollars 19 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-13\"><em>Asher </em>in his answer, said, that he had purchased the land and mill from the trustees, and that <em>Pendleton </em>was admitted as a joint purchaser, upon his representation that one half of the purchare money for the sale of the mill and land would be enough with other sales made by the trustees, to pay his debts mentioned in the deed of trust, and that <em>Asher </em>to whom he was indebted, should have the other half to pay that debt, amounting to 700 dollars; and that under these circumstances, <em>Asher consented to the </em>contract. He denied that at the time, or since, or at any other time, it was stipulated with his consent or knowledge, that any claim for dower, or for any compensation for dower or relinquishment thereof, was to be settled for <em>Mrs. Pendleton </em>in any manner on said mill, or that he ever agreed that <em>Pendleton's </em>interest in the mill should be settled to her use. And to any such contract, if proved or attempted to be proved, he pleaded the statute of frauds and perjuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-16\">He further said, that when the first instalment of the purchase money fell due, <em>Martin Slaughter </em>one of the trustees, called upon him for payment; and knowing that <em>Pendleton </em>was hopelessly insolvent, and that standing a suit would but increase the amount to be paid, he had paid up the whole amount of the first instalment; and he therefore insisted upon his right, under the contract, to the whole mill, as Pendleton, although he knew when the instalment was due, failed to pay any part of it. And he insisted that he had nothing to <em>do </em>with any controversy between <em>Mrs. Pendleton </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>trustees about her d\u00f3wer right; and that the bill was multifarious and ought to be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATBV\">The cause came on to be heard in November 1833, when the Court held that <em>Asher </em>and <em>Pendleton </em>became by the contract, joint owners of the land and <em>mill; </em>and that the stipulation in the contract for the forfeiture of <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>interest upon the default of payment by him, was one which a Court of equity would not enforce <em>; </em>and a decree was made directing a commissioner to settle various accounts between the parties. The Court also held, that <em>Mrs. Pendleton </em>was entitled to compensation for relinquishing her right of dower in the lands sold by the trustees, and to have the same settled to her separate use out of the interest of <em>John S. Pendleton </em>in the said mill and land ; and a commissioner was directed to ascertain what, under all the circumstances, would be a reasonable allowance to be made to her for uniting in the conveyances by the trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\">The commissioner made a report, which was excepted to and was recommitted, and at length a statement was made according to the directions of the Court, which including an account for payments for the purchase money of the mill and land, and of the profits thereof, and also the private account between <em>Asher </em>and <em>John S. Pendleton, </em>ascertained that <em>Pendleton </em>was indebted to <em>Asher </em>on the 15th of June 1839, in the sum of 396 dollars 82 cents. And the cause coming on to be finally heard on that day, the Court confirmed the report, and decreed that upon the plaintiff\u2019s paying to the defendant <em>Asher, </em>the sum of 396 dollars 82 cents, with interest thereon from that day until paid, the plaintiff be let into possession of the said mill, and an equal participation of the profits thereof, as a tenant in common with the defendant. And leave was reserved to the parties to apply at a future day for further directions in regard to the costs of the cause, and other matters in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>volved in the same. From this decree <em>Asher </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-4\"><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-5\"><em>Robinson </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b653-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AqY\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
