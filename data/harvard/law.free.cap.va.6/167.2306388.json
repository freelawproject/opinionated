Janes </em>alleged in his bill, that <em>Gall </em>having become indebted to him, by notes and bonds, in several sums, exceeding 200 dollars with interest, had departed from the commonwealth; that one <em>Wilright </em>having recovered a judgment against one <em>Hoover, </em>transferred the same to <em>Gall </em>for valuable consideration; that an execution sued out on that judgment in <em>Wilright\u2019s </em>name, was then in the hands of the sheriff of <em>Pendleton; </em>and though it did not appear by the execution itself that it was for <em>Gall\u2019s </em>benefit, it was so ,in fact. The bill, therefore, made <em>Gall, </em>the absent debtor of the plaintiff, <em>Wilright, </em>and the sheriff of <em>Pendleton, </em>parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>defendants ; and prayed, that the sheriff might be enjoined from paying the proceeds of the execution to <em>Wilright </em>or his order; and that the same, as being the property of <em>Gall, </em>the absent debtor, might be attached in the hands of the sheriff as garnishee, and applied to the payment of the debt due from <em>Gall </em>to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b183-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>1835. <em>March.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Wilright, </em>in his answer, stated, that having recovered the judgment against <em>Hoover </em>for 100 dollars, he <em>agreed </em>to lend the amount thereof to <em>Gall, </em>and therefore gave him an order on the sheriff for the proceeds of the execution when it should be levied, and an instrument of writing which was intended to transfer the same to him as a loan; that <em>Gall, </em>shortly afterwards, <em>became insolvent, </em>and absconded; that <em>Gall </em>never paid any consideration whatever for the transfer; and that, therefore, the proceeds of the execution were still, in equity, his <em>(Wilright's) </em>own property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">The answers of the sheriff of <em>Pendleton, </em>and of <em>the </em>administrator of <em>Gall </em>(who died after the bill was filed), disclaimed all knowledge on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">Without any replication being put in to the answers, or any award of commissions to take depositions, commissions were in fact issued, under which <em>depositions </em>were taken, and other depositions were taken by consent : whereby it was proved, that <em>Wilright </em>had transferred his judgment and execution against <em>Hoover </em>to <em>Gall, </em>absolutely, and for valuable consideration.

But, in the caption to this order of the court of chancery, <em>Jones\u2019s </em>name was not mentioned as one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">The issue was tried in <em>the </em>circuit court of <em>Pendleton; </em>and the jury found, that <em>Wilright </em>had made an absolute sale and transfer of the whole of his claim against <em>Hoover </em>to <em>Gall, </em>and that <em>Gall </em>had paid <em>Wilright </em>full value for the same. In the caption of the proceedings in the circuit court, also, <em>Jones\u2019s </em>name was not mentioned as one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">The verdict being certified to the court of chancery, a.nd the cause coming on for final hearing on the bill, answers, exhibits, and the verdict, the court made a final decree; in which, after stating, that it appeared, that the amount which came to the sheriff\u2019s hands on the execution of <em>Wilright </em>against <em>Hoover, </em>was, on the return day thereof, 185 dollars, and that the debt proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to be due from <em>Gall </em>to tbe plaintiff <em>Janes,, </em>exceeded that sum, it was decreed that that sum with the interest thereon accrued, should be paid to <em>Janes, </em>in part satisfaction of the debt which the absent debtor <em>Gall </em>owed him, and that the administrator of <em>Gall </em>should pay him the balance of the debt, <em>de bonis testatoris.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-4\">The execution of <em>Wilright </em>v. <em>Hoover </em>was not one of the exhibits in the cause, and the amount of the proceeds thereof nowise appeared in the record, but from the statement in the final decree. In the caption to the final decree, the name of Jones was mentioned as a party defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\"><em>Jones </em>appealed from the decree to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5O\">objected that the proceedings were wholly irregular, and in the actual state of the case on the record, there was no foundation for the decree. 1. The cause was set for hearing on the answer of <em>Wilright, </em>without any replication to that answer, or to the answer of <em>Jones, </em>denying the truth of them; and therefore the depositions must be disregarded, and the answers taken as true; and then, <em>Wilright's </em>execution against <em>Hoover </em>was his own property, not-<em>Gall's; </em>and so could not be attached for the <em>debt due </em>from <em>Gall </em>to <em>Janes. </em>Neither ought the court to have directed the issue to be tried at law, when there was nothing put in issue between the parties, by the pleadings. <em>2. </em>The verdict could not be binding on <em>Jones; </em>for it appeared by the caption to the order directing the issue, as well as by the caption to the proceedings of the circuit court in the trial of it, that <em>Jones, </em>was not then regarded as a party defendant. These proceedings were, as to him, <em>ex parte. </em>3. The execution of <em>Wilright </em>against <em>Hoover </em>was not among the exhibits, nor was there any document or -evidence in the record, whereby the chancellor could ascertain that the amount of the proceeds of that execution was 185 dollars.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee, answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-e\">1. that the depositions, some taken by commission, and some by consent, relating to the fact in controversy between the plaintiff <em>Janes </em>and the defendant <em>Wilright, </em>were all filed before the appellant <em>Jones </em>was made a party; and <em>Jones </em>was admitted a defendant, upon condition that the hearing should not be delayed thereby; which plainly implied, that he waived the necessity of sending the cause to the rules for replications, a regular award of commissions, and the taking the depositions over again. 2. The captions to the interlocutory order directing the issue, and to the proceedings thereupon in the circuit court, were no part of the record: the parties to the proceedings were to be ascertained by the record, not by the clerk\u2019s captions to the orders. <em>Jones </em>was a party defendant on the record; and at the final hearing, when he was certainly in court, he made no objection to the previous proceedings as <em>ex parte. </em>3. As to the amount of <em>Wilright\u2019s </em>execution against <em>Hoover, </em>the question was, whether the property in the debt had been transferred by <em>Wilright </em>to <em>Gall; </em>and this having been ascertained, <em>Jones </em>had no interest in the question what was its amount. <em>Wilright </em>did not appeal from the decree. Besides, it was plain, from the decree, either that the chancellor had the execution before him, or that its amount was agreed a,t the bar.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-8\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A7_\">The appellant <em>Jones </em>was admitted a party defendant in the county court, after all the depositions had been taken and filed, upon terms, that the hearing should not be delayed. <em>Jones, </em>in his answer, claimed the judgment and execution of <em>Wilright </em>against <em>Hoover, </em>on the ground of an assignment by <em>Wilright </em>to him. He admits that <em>Gall </em>had, previously to the assignment under which he claimed, presented an order from <em>Wilright, </em>to him <em>Jones, </em>then acting as deputy sheriff and having the execution in his hands, for the amount thereof: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>but he adds, that not long after, <em>Wilright </em>countermanded _ _ * ^ - the order, and said he had lent the money to <em>Gall, </em>and as be had absconded and left the country, he should not have it. That this took place prior to <em>Wilright\u2019s </em>assignment to <em>Jones, </em>is not only admitted in <em>Jones\u2019s </em>answer, but is proved by the depositions. I state these facts, to shew, 1. That from the situation of the cause when <em>Jones </em>was admitted a party defendant, it being then ready for hearing, and all the depositions taken that ever were taken, the terms on which <em>Jones </em>was admitted to put in his answer, that is, not to delay the hearing, prove that no steps were to be taken to put the answer regularly in issue by replications, or to take the depositions over again, since either must have caused delay: 2. That from <em>Jones\u2019s </em>own shewing, he had notice of <em>Gall\u2019s </em>claim, when he took <em>Wilright\u2019s </em>assignment to himself; and that the only point on which he could possibly hope for success, was, that <em>Wilright\u2019s </em>transfer to <em>Gall </em>should be proved to be a loan, and revocable; a point which was already controverted by <em>Wilright\u2019s </em>answer, so that, in truth, <em>Jones </em>and <em>Wilright, </em>as respected <em>Janes, </em>occupied precisely the same ground, and if the transfer to <em>Gall </em>could be disproved, the only question would he, whether <em>Wilright </em>or <em>Jones </em>should receive the money. The only point, then, in which <em>Jones </em>was interested, being in fact already in issue, it needed no step by replication to his answer, to enable him to take further proof touching the fact, if he thought proper, nor did the failure to reply to his answer authorize him to take it as a fact conceded to him, that the order from <em>Wilright </em>to <em>Gall </em>was a loan; because he no where in his answer asserts that fact; the utmost he says is, that <em>Wilright </em>told him so: and because too, the whole evidence in the cause, then ready for hearing, shewed him, that this was the only question in contest. The cause standing in this situation, was, by consent of the parties, removed to the superiour court of chancery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>Staunton. </em>Then follows the order of the chancellor, directing the issue to be tried in <em>Pendleton, </em>to ascertain whether <em>Wilright </em>made an absolute sale of his claim against <em>Hoover, </em>or any part thereof, to <em>Gall, </em>and whether, if he did, <em>Gall </em>ever paid him for it. Upon this issue the jury find, that <em>Wilright </em>did make an absolute sale to <em>Gall </em>of the whole claim, and that <em>Gall </em>had paid him for it. It happened, that in the caption of the chancellor\u2019s order sending the issue to <em>Pendleton, </em>the name of <em>Jones, </em>as a party defendant, was omitted; and the same omission, of course, followed in docketing the cause in <em>Pendleton, </em>as that would follow the other. This happened, perhaps, from carelessness; probably, from the fact, that the cause was new in the chancery court, and the names of the parties not familiar. But does any one suppose, that this omission was of any injury to <em>Jones, </em>the only appellant here, and, in truth, the only defendant really interested ? Had he not consented to the removal of the cause to Staunton? Was he not a parly there ? Did he not by his counsel, attend to the case there ? And when it was sent to his own county, to try the only facts in which he was interested, can we imagine, that this deputy sheriff would be either ignorant of, or inattentive to the trial of the issue ? Would this accidental omission of his name in the caption, induce him to suppose, that this was another suit, not that to which he was a party? I can have no such idea; and though there have been some irregularities in the county court (one of which was the making <em>Jones </em>a party defendant, by the court, without consent of the plaintiff) yet, as I think the clear justice of the cause has been attained, I am opposed to reversing the decree. Indeed, I am surprized that the chancellor should ever have thought of sending the cause to an issue, for to my mind, the depositions clearly prove a sale of <em>Wilright's </em>claim against <em>Hoover </em>to <em>Gall, </em>before the transfer to <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<author id=\"AXu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADY\">The condition on which <em>Jones </em>was admitted defendant, that is, of not delaying the hearing of the cause, took the case out of the ordinary rule, and implied that the depositions previously taken were to be read on the hearing; and this, by necessary consequence, absolved the plaintiff from the necessity of replying to the answers, and excluded that admission of the facts alleged in the answers, which, in ordinary cases, is the result of a failure to reply. The only question in the cause, was as to the fact of assignment from <em>Wilright </em>to Gall, not as to the date of that assignment; for if <em>Wilright </em>had really assigned to <em>Gall, </em>it was not denied, that that assignment preceded the assignment to <em>Jones. </em>Upon this question the evidence had been taken; and a jury afterwards passed upon it, and found in favour of <em>Janes, </em>that <em>Wilright </em>had assigned the claim to <em>Gall, </em>for full and valuable consideration. There can be no difficulty as to the amount of the claim thus assigned : the decree of the court, as respects that matter, declares, that it appeared, that the amount which came into the hands of the sheriff of <em>Pendleton, </em>by virtue of the execution of <em>Wilright </em>against <em>Hoover </em>was, on the return day thereof, 185 dollars. We cannot doubt, but that the execution shewing the amount, was before the court, although it is not now to be found in the record. I think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Brockenbrough, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b190-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJp\"><em>I </em>have no doubt the decree is according to the justice of the case, though there seem to me some irregularities that I cannot easily get over. My brethren, however, do not find the same difficulty, and for my own part, I feel no regret, that they are enabled to get over the mere technicalities which stand in the way of an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
