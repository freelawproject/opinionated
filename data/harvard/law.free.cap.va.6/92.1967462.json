One drawn on <em>Edward Harford </em>for 200/. sterling; another on <em>Robert Young </em>for 1811/. 3s. 11 <em>d. </em>sterling; another on <em>Robert Cary S? Co. </em>for 400/. sterling; amounting in the whole, to 2611/. 3s. lli/. sterling; and as great part of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>fortune, who was about to return to <em>Great Britain, </em>depended upon payment of the bills, and that drawn on <em>Young, </em>was for so large a sum, that a failure would have been ruinous, it was stipulated that the amount of it in case of protest, should be ultimately secured in <em>Virginia. </em>That in pursuance of that stipulation, a deed was given by <em>Braxton, </em>to the said <em>Robert Campbell, </em>for a tract of land called <em>Broadneck, </em>and another called <em>Fosters, </em>with sundry slaves, with proviso that if the bill for 1811/. 3s. 11c?. should be protested, and <em>Braxton </em>should afterwards pay the amount with- interest, that the deed should be void. That the bill on <em>Cary S? Co. </em>for 400/., and that on <em>Young </em>for 1811/. 3s. 11 <em>d. </em>were protested for non-payment; of which <em>Braxton </em>had notice. That he made some payments towards the same, reducing the balance to 1960/. 0s. <em>3d. </em>sterling, as appears by an account made up, by two persons for that purpose chosen; who have subscribed their names to their award or report thereon. That the said <em>Robert Campbell </em>afterwards being dissatisfied with the security, and requiring other, <em>Aylett </em>and <em>Brooke </em>entered into an obligation in writing, as securities for whatever sum <em>Braxton </em>might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>then owe <em>Campbell-. </em>That this obligation was by some accident destroyed, and that <em>Jlylett </em>and <em>Brooke, </em>being informed thereof, afterwards gave a writing, acknowledging the former, and obliging themselves anew. That for reasons unknown to the plaintiff, <em>Robert Page </em>afterwards placed himself in <em>Jlylett\u2019s </em>stead, by an endorsement on the said last named writing. That, the securities after-wards growing uneasy, <em>Braxton, </em>for discharging the debt and indemnifying the securities, gave a deed to <em>Drury Ragsdale </em>and <em>George Braxton, </em>for a tract of land in <em>Halifax, </em>two lots at <em>West Point, </em>and sixty slaves, in trust, to sell the same if necessary, for satisfying that and other debts, and indemnifying the securities aforesaid. That <em>Braxton </em>for further securing <em>Page, </em>and for securing <em>White, </em>who was his security in a debt due <em>Govan, </em>gave another deed to <em>Page </em>and <em>White </em>for seventy-six negroes and other property in trust, to sell them, if necessary, for their indemnity. The bill therefore prays relief against <em>Price, </em>executor of <em>Brooke, George </em>Braxton,. <em>Drury Ragsdale, Carter Braxton, </em>the administrator of <em>White, </em>and the other creditors stated in the first of the above mentioned deeds of indemnity; and that the lands, slaves, and property in the said trust deeds contained, might (except the lands released by <em>Robert Campbell,) </em>be sold for satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">The answer of <em>Braxton </em>states, that <em>Robert Campbell, </em>then of <em>Virginia, </em>was possessed of two bonds, the one for 1335/. sterling, the other for 1200/. liable to a deduction of 61/. That the first, he was not likely to receive for a long time, and the second was not to be paid till the estate of the obligor could raise it. That the defendant negotiated for those bonds, and purchased them, without recourse on <em>Campbell. </em>That this purchase was the only consideration for the bills. That <em>Robert Campbell </em>demanded interest at the rate of 10 <em>per cent, </em>upon the loan of the two debts, and took the bills of exchange to legalize the transaction, if he could. That <em>Young, </em>the <em>drawee </em>of the bill for 1811/. <em>3s. lid., </em>was a friend and relation of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>in <em>Scotland, </em>a clergyman, not engaged in commercial business, and unknown to the defendant, who had never heard of him before; that the defendant does not recollect when he received notice of the protests. That <em>Campbell </em>not content with the mortgage, made the defendant give the personal security mentioned in the bill: Upon which he engaged to relinquish the mortgaged pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>raises. After which, the defendant sold the mortgaged janc\u00a1s an(j most of the slaves. That <em>Campbell, </em>in <em>July, </em>1777, wrote a letter in which he declares the defendant is to pay 6 <em>per cent, </em>interest, from the- expiration of the deed to that time; but, notwithstanding this, he afterwards stated his account at 10 <em>per cent. </em>That the settled account stated in the bill was not intended to be conclusive, but was done merely to ascertain\"the payments made by the defendant.

That the contract was usurious; for, the real substance of the agreement was a loan, and the bills were but a mere device to take the case out of the statute. Every circumstance shews that it was clearly understood betwixt the parties, that the bills would come back protested. That on <em>Young, </em>was not drawn on a merchant of character, trading to <em>Jlmericu, </em>and therefore likely to have funds in his hands to answer it; but, upon an obscure Clergyman, not even inhabiting in a trading town,but residing in the interior of <em>Scotland, </em>and not shewn <em>to </em>have had any connexion whatever with <em>Braxton. </em>The bills were given for bonds at <em>par. </em>The mortgage is for the payment of the money by instalments; which would not have been the case, if it had been a purchase, instead of a loan. Neither would it have been the case in a security for a bill expected to be paid; but, it was very likely to be done, in the case of a bill which it was supposed would not be paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">2. That <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>claim was barred by the statute of limitations; for, <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>letters were not written within five years; and <em>Page\u2019s </em>engagement was not under seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">3. That the debt, at most, ought only to carry simple interest; for, the bill was merged in the mortgage; and, if a suit was brought at law, upon the covenants, a <em>jury </em>would only give 5 <em>per cent. </em>The securities were bound for a sum eertain, and not as endorsers of the bills; on which no action can be maintained against them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-8\"><em>Randolph </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-9\">Contended, that the contract was not usurious. That there was nothing which shewed <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>knowledge that the bills would be protested when he took them; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>although privately there might have been such an expectaf\u00a1on jn parties, these circumstances will not affect the case, unless it was part of the agreement that there were no funds in the drawee\u2019s hands, and that the bills should be protested. That the person on whom they were drawn <em>afforded no </em>knowledge of any such agreement; because <em>Braxton </em>might have money in his hands to answer the demand, by remitting in time, or by various other means: So that it was contingent whether they would be protested or not, and <em>Braxton </em>had it in his power to avoid the ten <em>per cent, </em>which took it out of the statute. That it did not appear that he affected to assert that the contract was for a lending and usurious, until long after the transaction. That the mortgage was taken merely in the room of an endorser, which was the customary mode; and, therefore, no unfavorable inference could be drawn from that circumstance. That the act of limitations did not apply, as the deed of trust protected the claim. That the deed being a collateral security for the <em>money </em>due on the bills, it was the bills themselves which were to ascertain the amount due to the creditor; and, as they bore ten <em>per cent, </em>interest, that rate of interest was to be paid out of the trust property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">[* See <em>Smith </em>et al. v. <em>Beach, </em>3 Day, 268; <em>Pollard </em>v.

It has but two real questions in it: 1. Whether the contract was usurious? 2. Whether the claim is' barred by the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"Ai_\">In order to simplify the case, I may throw out of it some points which are <em>too </em>plain for discussion: As first, whether the mortgage extinguished the bill of exchange? 2. Whether the securities, <em>Brooke </em>and <em>Jiylett, </em>became bound by \u25a0their agreement, to pay 10 <em>per cent, </em>interest, in the event of the bills being or having been protested? As to the first, it is clear that the mortgage recognized the bill of exchange, as an existing' one; and, so far from extinguishing it, creates an additional security for its payment. The bill of exchange, therefore, and not the mortgage, is the contract which determines the rate of interest to be paid, and is the contract really sued upon. As to the second, the general agreement of the parties will extend as well to the nature as to the amount of the debt due from <em>Braxton </em>to <em>Campbell: </em>and the nature of the\u2019 debt due by bill of exchange, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>determines the rate of interest to be paid by them on protest to be 10 <em>per cent, per annum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">The question of usury is rather more difficult; but I think, nevertheless, is sufficiently clear. I admit that, on questions of this kind we are at liberty to infer usury from the circumstances of the transaction itself. Otherwise, it would be generally impossible to detect it. But, in making this inference, we are confined to the enquiry, whether there is a corrupt contract or agreement for usurious interest? Now, such a contract or agreement pre-supposes the consent of both borrower and lender to this effect; and'without it there is no usurious contract; whatever may be the hopes, wishes, or expectations of either party. Thinking this principle to be almost self-evident, I shall proceed to examine the pi\u2019esent question by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The contract, by which <em>Braxton </em>transferred a right to money in <em>Scotland, </em>to <em>Campbell, </em>for a valuable consideration, as evidenced by the bill of exchange, was a lawful contract; and it had the concurrence of both parties thereto. It is no objection to the legality of such contract, that the drawee is a stranger to the drawer; that the latter has no funds in the hands of the former; or that the drawee is in a line of life other than commercial. This contract is for the payment of money in another country, (not in this;) and for the injury arising from a disappointment, the law has allowed an interest of tender <em>cent, per </em>annum; and so far operates as an exception to the general act of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">This contract is to be considered as the real contract between the parties,- unless it be subsequently changed, or it has been previously agreed that the bill is not to be paid, but to be protested, and the money paid here. In the last case, the bill would be considered as a shift to evade the statute of usury, and conceal the real agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">However strong the answer of <em>Braxton </em>is <em>to </em>shew an usurious tendency and disposition in Doctor <em>Campbell, </em>as evidenced by the unusual circumstance of his procuring <em>Braxton to </em>draw on a stranger, a clergyman, and a person having no funds of the drawer: Yet, he does not state any consent on his part to waive his right to consider this as a legal bill and to procure it to be honored. He does not-state any agreement on his part, subsequent to the drawing of the bill, that it should not be paid; or any previous agreement that the money was really to be paid here; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>consequently, that the bill is a mere shift to evade the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The question, then, is reduced to this short point: There is a complete agreement of both parties evidenced by the bill of exchange, that the money should be paid in <em>Scotland. </em>There is a hope, an expectation, and even a contrivance in the party, and probably an expectation' in both, that the money should not be paid in that country, but in this; but there is no agreement, carrying this expectation into effect, barring the right of <em>Braxton </em>to consider the contract as a real bill of exchange and to procure a payment in <em>Scotland, </em>and converting the contract into an usurious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">With respect to the plea of the act of limitations, there is no doubt, that laying out of the case the previous acknowledgments, but the deed of <em>Braxton </em>to <em>Page </em>and <em>White, </em>is an acknowledgment which will prevent its operation. That deed refers to the debt to <em>Campbell </em>as an existing one; and when it speaks of <em>20001. </em>it is only as being the amount of it as supposed by <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>representatives; and the license of <em>Page </em>and <em>White, </em>of the 14th of <em>April, </em>1793, to the Sheriff, to sell some of the negroes, recognizes and refers to that mortgage.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I think, therefore, the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">But, Mr. <em>Randolph </em>asks to correct it. 1. In decreeing that the slaves sold to <em>Adams </em>by <em>Page\u2019s </em>consent should be accounted for. And 2. That liberty should be reserved to the appellee to proceed against the distributees of <em>Brooke\u2019s </em>property.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">As to the first, I answer that such of <em>Brooke\u2019s </em>slaves mortgaged to <em>Page </em>and <em>White, </em>as were comprehended in the deed of mortgage from <em>Brooke </em>to <em>Campbell, </em>are now liable to <em>Campbell, </em>by the decree, into whose hands soever they may have come, and that <em>Campbell </em>has no lien upon the slaves not so comprehended, but the lien as to them was only in favor of <em>Page </em>and <em>White, </em>who have released it.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">As to the second, that the distributees of <em>Brooke </em>having given or being liable to give bond to the executor to refund, are completely entitled to their distributory shares exempt from any claim, except such as is supported by a specific lien on such property, which in this case is not, I believe, pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>FLEMING, Judge. The counsel for the appellant made'three points in this case. 1. They contended that the contract was usurious, and, therefore, void. 2. That the act of limitations applied in favor of the securities. 3. That the nature of the debt was altered, by security being given; from which time the contract was changed, and carried only 5 <em>per cent, </em>interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">As to the first, I observe, that in order to constitute usury, there must be a borrowing and a lending, with an intent to exact exorbitant interest beyond what is allowed by law, or a forbearance in consideration of such interest being paid. But, there appears no conclusive evidence that such was the case in the contract-now under consideration. There are, indeed, several suspicious circumstances respecting the bill drawn on <em>Young; </em>but it is unnecessary to repeat them, as they are not sufficient, in my mind, to bring the case within the statute of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As to the point of the act of limitations, I <em>think the </em>undertaking of the securities in <em>December, </em>1775, under seal, excludes them from the benefit of that act; and that <em>Page\u2019s </em>undertaking to stand in the place of <em>Jlylett </em>and to perform every engagement of his (although not under seal,) bound him to abide by every consequence, which was to follow from <em>Jlyleit\u2019s </em>suretyship. In addition to this, <em>Page </em>afterwards accepted a deed of trust from <em>Braxton </em>as an indemnity: which, with the other circumstances just mentioned, certainly removes all pretence for the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">With respect to the third point, that the taking of the mortgage for security of the debt, changed the nature of the contract, and made the debt bear five <em>per cent, </em>interest only, it is sufficient to observe, that the consideration of the mortgage expressly is, to secure the re-payment of the money <em>paid\u25a0 by the mortgagee </em>for a set of bills of exchange therein described, if they should be protested; which, in that case would by law carry an interest of 10 <em>per cent, per annum. </em>So, that <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>accepting the mortgage, did not change the nature of the debt, but was considered merely as an auxiliary security for the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Mr. <em>Randolph </em>thought there was error in the decree, in not allowing the appellee to proceed against the legatees of Mr. <em>Brooke </em>for the slaves in their possession, and to pursue the mortgaged slaves purchased by <em>Mams. </em>But, besides the answer already given to these objections, it is sufficient to observe that those parties are not before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Court, and, consequently, we can make no decision affectjng them. I am, therefore, for affirming the decree altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqqy\">CARRINGTON, Judge. Three exceptions have been taken to the decree of the Court of Chancery in this cause. 1. That the contract was usurious and void. <em>2. </em>That the plaintiff\u2019s'claim was barred by the statute of limitations. 3. That the ten <em>per cent, </em>ceased on taking the mortgage, and that only five <em>per cent, </em>could be demanded after that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">As to the first, it is said, that the contract is usurious, and, therefore, void. But, to constitute usury, there must be a loan or forbearance; and there are no features of either discoverable in this cause. Braxton, in his answer, calls the transaction a sale and purchase of two bonds, for which the bills in question were drawn; and, although he aftervrards speaks of them as a loan, yet from the nature of the thing in question, (namely bonds,) they could not have, been intended.to be returned: Because, in that case, they would have been of no use to the borrower; who contracted for them for the purpose of negotiating them in payment of his debts to others; and they were certainly drawn as a consideration for the purchase. As to the shift, which has been alledged, it is possible, that the intention of <em>Campbell </em>was to make greater profit than five <em>per </em>cent.; but such intention is not proved. Braxton, indeed, states it in his answer; but, the answer is not responsive to the bill, and is unsupported by testimony. Besides, although <em>Braxton </em>states that to have been <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>intention, he does not say that he himself consented to it, which was necessary to form the contract between them. In short, I discover no trace in the transaction, so conclusive as to justify me in criminating Campbell, and depriving his representatives of their debt. For, there is nothing in the case out of the usual course of that kind of business; which was thus, the debtor drew bills of exchange payable to his creditor, but, in case of the possibility of nonacceptance, an endorser was generally required. In the present case, however, in lieu of an endorser, <em>Braxton </em>conveyed an estate as a security for the large bill on <em>Young. </em>In this view, it was a fair transaction and not justly liable to any objection. But, added to this, <em>Braxton\u2019s </em>defence is materially weakened by his lying quiet so long, and making considerable payments, without any complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Upon the whole, I consider the case as not coming within the statute of usury; and, that the security taken was intended to strengthen and not injure the plaintiffs\u2019 legal rights under the bills of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The second exception was, that the claim is barred by the act of limitations. But, there is no ground for the objection; because the claim has been preserved from the operation of that act, by various transactions down to the year 1792, when the suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The third exception taken by the appellant\u2019s counsel, has been already anticipated; and I shall only add that I think there is no weight in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">As to the correction's asked for by the appellee\u2019s counsel, it is sufficient to observe that <em>Brooke\u2019s </em>representatives are not before the Court, and, therefore, we can make no decree against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Upon the whole, I concur in opinion with the other Judges, that the decree was pronounced on just principles, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\">[* See Mountstephen et al. v. <em>Brooke </em>et al. 3 Barn.and Ald. 141.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
