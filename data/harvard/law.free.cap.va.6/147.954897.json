They did not make <em>Thorpe </em>a deed, hut gave him a paper by which they bound themselves to convey to him the lots upon the payment of the purchase money ; and he executed to them his bond for 200 dollars, payable on the 10th of May 1838, with interest from the 10th of May 1837. <em>Thorpe </em>sold the lots to <em>William Stephens </em>for 250 dollar\u2019s, of which, <em>Stephens </em>paid him 140 dollars. And on the 10th of January 1838, <em>Stephens </em>sold the lots to <em>G. W.

That <em>Thorpe </em>should pay to <em>Stephens </em>the sum of 140 dollars, with interest from the 31st of December 1838, that being the amount of purchase money which <em>Stephens </em>had paid to <em>Thorpe: </em>And that the injunction to the judgment recovered by <em>Stephens </em>against <em>Hutchison </em>should be perpetuated, with costs. From these decrees, <em>Stephens </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-8\"><em>Fisher, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-9\">Jackson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-10\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aji\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The Court is of opinion, that the obligation of the defendant <em>Hutchison </em>to account with the defendant <em>Stephens </em>for the full amount of the purchase money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>which he contracted to pay to him for the lots in the proceedings mentioned, was, under the circumstances, equally the same after the sale of said lots under the interlocutory decree of April 184.0, that it was before; and that the subject ought to be adjusted between them upon the like principles as if the property had not been sold, but the lien of <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe </em>discharged on the day appointed for the sale, either by <em>Stephens </em>or <em>Hutchison, </em>it is immaterial which; for if by Stephens, then <em>Hutchison </em>would, of course, be bound to pay up the whole purchase money due from him, and if by Hutchison, still the latter would be properly chargeable with that purchase money, and credited with the amount of the said lien of <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe. </em>Such adjustment between <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Hutchison </em>is purely a matter of account, and the sale of the property under said decree, occasions no forfeiture from <em>Stephens </em>to <em>Hutchison </em>of any part of the purchase money due from the latter to the former. <em>Hutchison </em>ought therefore to be debited to <em>Stephens </em>with the sum of 280 dollars, with interest till the 4th of July 1840, the day of said sale; on 100 dollars, part thereof, from the 10th of January 1838; and on 180 dollars, the residue thereof, from the 10th of January 1839; making in the aggregate, the sum of 310 dollars 92 cents; against which, he ought to be credited with 200 dollars, the principal of the lien of <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe, </em>with interest thereon from the 1st of April 1837, till the 4th of July 1840 ; making in the aggregate, the sum of 237 dollars 60 cents; and leaving a balance in favour of <em>Stephens </em>against <em>Hutchison, </em>of 73 dollars 32 cents, with interest thereon from the 4th of July 1840, till paid; to which balance, <em>Stephens </em>having had a lien on the lots therefor, ought to be applied the surplus proceeds of sale in the hands of the receiver. And the costs recovered by <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe, </em>and paid out of the proceeds of said sale, ought not to be credited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Hutchison </em>against <em>Stephens, </em>inasmuch as there was not only more than enough money in the hands of <em>Hutchison </em>due to <em>Stephens, </em>to pay off the lien of <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe, </em>but at the time of <em>Hutchison's </em>purchase from <em>Stephens, </em>it was arranged between them, that <em>Hutchison </em>should pay 100 dollars of the stipulated price to the- defendant <em>Thorpe, </em>who was expected therewith, and the sum of 140 dollars he had received from <em>Stephens, </em>to discharge the lien of <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe; </em>and the continued existence of that lien, and the necessity of enforcing it by suit, are attributable not to the default of <em>Stephens, </em>but of <em>Thorpe </em>and <em>Hutchison. </em>The said costs, however, ought to be reimbursed, to <em>Hutchison </em>by <em>Thorpe, </em>who was primarily bound to discharge said lien, it being the debt contracted by him for the property, and he having wholly failed therein, though he had received the said sum of 140 dollars from <em>Stephens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">And as between <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Thorpe, </em>the Court is of opinion that <em>Stephens </em>having acquired the property by purchase from <em>Thorpe, </em>is bound to account with him for the balance of purchase money remaining unpaid to him, to wit, the sum of 110 dollars, with interest thereon from the time when the same fell due; and on the other hand, as by the adjustment between <em>Stephens </em>and <em>Hutchison </em>above indicated, the result is, that <em>Stephens </em>is subjected to the discharge, out of the purchase money due him from <em>Hutchison, </em>of the principal money and interest of <em>Mayberry </em>and <em>Kincheloe\u2019s </em>said lien, amounting as above stated, on the 4th of July 1840, to 237 dollars 60 cents, the balance in favour of <em>Stephens </em>against <em>Thorpe </em>is to be ascertained by deducting the said sum of 110 dollars, with interest thereon till the 4th of July 1840, from the said sum of 237 dollars 60 cents, which balance, with interest thereon till paid, <em>Stephens, </em>is entitled to recover against <em>Thorpe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The Court is therefore of opinion, that the final decree of the Circuit court is erroneous, except so much thereof as perpetuates with costs, the injunction of <em>Hutchison </em>to the judgment recovered against him in the name of the assignee of <em>Stephens; </em>and it is decreed and ordered that the same, except as aforesaid, be reversed and annulled, and the residue thereof affirmed; and that the appellant recover against the appellee Hutchison, his costs by him expended in the prosecution of this appeal. And these causes are remanded to the Circuit court, to be proceeded in according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
