It appeared at the trial, that the plaintiff was a white man, and the defendant a free negro, as was also her testator. And the plaintiff having introduced two free negroes as witnesses for him, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to them as incompetent, on the ground, that free negroes could not be examined as witnesses in a cause to which a white man was a party; but the court admitted them, and they were sworn and examined as witnesses; to which the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>dant\u2019s counsel excepted. There was a verdict and 1 judgment for the plaintiff; to which this court, upon the petition of the defendant allowed a <em>supersedeas. </em>\u00b1 -*\u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AtV\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the plaintiff in error; no counsel for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b91-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARH\">The question is, whether in a suit by a white man against a free negro, a negro is a good witness on the part of the plaintiff? To me it appears most clear that he is not. By the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. 5. p. 422. which provision was enacted in 1801, it is affirmatively provided, that \u201c any negro or mulatto, bond or free, shall be a good witness In pleas of the commonwealth, for or against negroes or mulattoes, bond or free, or in <em>civil cases </em>where free negroes or mulattoes shall <em>alone </em>be partiesand then negatively, \u201cin no other cases whatever.\u201d Now, as this is a civil case, and as negroes are not alone parties, the plaintiff being a white man, it is clear that by this clause a negro could not be a good witness in the case. It is true, there is another statutory provision on <em>the </em>subject, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 131. \u00a7 3. p. 517. which was enacted in <em>1792, the </em>words of which are, merely, \u201cno negro, mulatto or Indian, shall be admitted to give evidence, <em>but against or between </em>negroes, mulattoes or Indians.\u201d But this clause, being altogether negative, cannot be construed to extend the capacity of the negro beyond that which was conferred by the statute first quoted. Indeed, I have no doubt it was designed to mean precisely the same thing, the first part of the clause referring to prosecutions against negroes, and the second to civil cases <em>between </em>negroes. The provisions however, having been loosely drawn (for according to its strict <em>letter, </em>a negro would not have been a witness <em>for </em>a negro in a criminal prosecution), a new provision was introduced by a statute passed in 1801, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>from which the clause I have first cited was taken. Sess. Acts 1800. ch. 70. \u00a7 4. If there be any inconsistency between them, this last must prevail; for in the construction of the laws re-enacted at the revisal, we mugtj jn cage 0f fixeconcileable difference, look to the dates of the original statutes, in order to ascertain the last declaration of the legislative will. This opinion has been pronounced by this court in a case which I cannot now recall, but in which the resolution was delivered by judge <em>Roane. </em>I do not, however, consider these clauses as conflicting. The latter law only explained what was obscure in the former, and by its language embraced what was possibly deemed to have been omitted by the statute of 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">I am therefore of opinion that there is error in the judgment of the circuit court; and that it must be reversed, the verdict set aside, and a'new trial directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The other judges concurred. Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
