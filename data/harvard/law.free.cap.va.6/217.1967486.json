Verdict for the plaintiffs for 217/. 14s. <em>5d. </em>The defendant moved to arrest the judgment, for the following reasons: \u201cFor, that the only evidence given in the said cause, is the letter recited in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration; and no legal consideration to found an assumpsit on the part of the defendant, either to the plaintiffs\u2019 testator, or to the said plaintiff is stated, as appears in the said declaration.\u201d The District Court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiffs; and the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_i\">This is a new attempt to charge an executor, out of his own estate. The letter is in the usual style of a letter fr\u00b0m an executor to a creditor of the testator\u2019s estate; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>there Is nothing to shew, that he meant to bind himself personally. No part of it contains any actual <em>assumpsit </em>in his own right; for, as to the propositions, concerning the sale of the corn, and. the event of the crop, they at most only mean, that he would apply as much of his own money as the amount of the assets, which probably would not, so speedily, have commanded money. But, if more was thereby intended, they were offers which do not appear to have been accepted; and, therefore, are not obligatory. For, if an executor offers to pay a debt, it does not oblige him, unless there be some new consideration; as forbearance, or assets, or something else of that kind. But, here, there does not appear to have been any new consideration at all: for, it is not alledged in the declaration, that there was a forbearance in consequence of the offers; or that the defendant had assets sufficient to pay; or any other consideration to support the promise, which was therefore a mere <em>nudum pactum. </em>But, the averment is wholly insufficient, both as to the sum, and the proportion of the crop, for which the defendant was liable. For, the declaration does not state the sum certainly, or the amount and proportion of the crop, for which the defendant was liable; but, the averment is, only, that the defendant was liable for the whole, or a great part; and the <em>assumpsit, </em>which is in the words of the averment, is just as uncertain; and, therefore, void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-6\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">The letter contains a clear assumpsit; for, it is as soon as the.corn is sold, or the crop should come in; and, when he speaks of difficulties, it is a plain solicitation, that <em>Gilchrist </em>would not distress him with a suit, and is tantamount to a request of forbearance, which was a good consideration. <em>Pow. </em>on Contr. 354. It was, in fact, a clear acknowledgment of his obligation to pay. <em>[Hawkes </em>et ux. v. Saunders,] Cowp. 289, is a strong authority in our favor; for, the letter here amounted to an admission of assets; and that, according to the case in <em>Coioper, </em>was a good foundation for an assumpsit. The averment, in the declaration, is sufficient; for, it is in consideration of all the preceding matters, which had been stated, that the defendant is said to have assumed. Therefore, if any of the uncertainties, insisted on by the opposite counsel, do in fact exist, they may be rejected as surplusage, and the proper foundations, of the <em>assumpsit </em>only relied on.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A0o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>Randolph, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiN\">There was probably other evidence in the cause, and after verdict the Court will in- \u2019 tend that every thing necessary to support the action was' proved. No set words are necessary to constitute an assumpsit; but, if the whole spirit of the agreement amounts to it, that is sufficient. The object of the letter plainly was, to obtain forbearance; and by assuring <em>Gilchrist </em>that the debt was ultimately safe, to obtain it. Therefore, if there was any design at bottom, it will not avail the defendant, who should be bound by the terms held out in the letter. The uncertainty of the time, when the corn would be sold, or the crop would be reaped, necessarily proves that he was soliciting forbearance; because <em>Gilchrist, </em>in waiting for either, was inevitably to be delayed. But, forbearance was itself a sufficient consideration, and, therefore, the promise was obligatory. The \u2018 averment is sufficient. For, the offer was accepted by the defendants waiting for, and betaking himself to the fund proposed, which rendered a more explicit averment unnecessary. But there was no occasion, for any particular consideration to be alledged in the present case; because the assumpsit was in writing; which -superseded the necessity of averring or proving any particular consideration. [Mr. Justice Wilmot, in <em>Pillans </em>et al. v. <em>Mierop </em>et al. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] <em>3 </em>Burr. 1670. For, where there is a written agreement, the defendant should show that there was no consideration; and it is not necessary for the plaintiff to prove there was. If the executor acknowledges he has effects enough to pay, it is sufficient to support an assumpsit, <em>Cowqper, </em>284; and here the letter was tantamount; for, no other inference could be drawn from it. The letter was written with a knowledge of the testator\u2019s estate, and that is sufficient to oblige him; especially as it is in writing. <em>[Reech </em>v. <em>Kennegal,] </em>1 Ves. <em>sen. </em>124. The averment is in the terms of the contract; which is all that was requisite. For, the certainty was to <em>be </em>made out in evidence; and, as before observed, it is to be presumed, that it was done, as the jury could not have found the verdict without</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">The last argument would support every declaration, however defective; and is expressly repugnant to <em>Chiches</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>ter </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>1 Call, 83, in this Court; which established that the Court can only infer what is made absolutely neeessary to be proved by the declaration. The letter only amounted to an offer, and not to a promise. The forbearanee should be stated, as general, or for a particular period <em>Pow. </em>on Contr. 354. But here neither is averred. The case in <em>Cowper, </em>is of the first impression; and carries the doctrine farther than good sense warrants.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Unless the contrary is expressly shewn, an executor is always considered, as promising in his fiduciary character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">If the plaintiff proceeded on the idea of an admission of assets, he should have averred it. The uncertainties which I spoke of before, cannot be rejected as surplusage; and the truth is, there was no promise made. If the plaintiff had averred forbearance, assets, &amp;c. we might have traversed it; but, as it is, we could not come prepared to controvert his evidence, on those points, which we could not foresee, he would endeavor to establish. The plaintiff should have alledged the price the corn sold for, or the amount of the crop; for the averment, in the words of the letter is not enough; but he should, as he might have done, have alledged it with certainty. That the offer was in writing, makes no difference; for, the passage from <em>Burr. </em>is the solitary opinion of a single Judge, and a like position is to be found no where else. Pow. on Contr. 334, shews, that if you declare in an action on the ease upon a note of hand, and do not alledge a consideration, it is <em>nudum pactum. </em>The case in 1 <em>Pcs. </em>instead of being against us, is, in fact, for us; because, it is there said that the defen- . dant was liable in his fiduciary character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">[* But see <em>Rann </em>v. <em>Hughes, 7 </em>T.
