A testa~ tor, in the year 1790 bequeathed his slaves severally to his children, with a proviso, \" that \";sOne of \" them be sobt \"out of the \"families t~ \"-ishom devis'\"ed; that, of f' offered for \"sale bij any of them, out \"of the fam\"ily of/do \"`isife hts \"daughter \" and sons, \"the,j be inz~ \"mediately \" liberated.\" A8oe of the testator to whom a female s1a~e was bequestlied, being in possession by virtue of the bequest, di~ ed intestate, and she came into the possess~ ion of a granddai~ghter, by whose husband a child of the said slave was sold to a stranger, to be carried o~t of Virginia. it was decided that a right to freedom did not thereby accrue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajv\">THIS was a suit for freedem in behalf of Peggy and Mary, filed against the appellee, in Loundon County Court. It was removed, by consent, to the Superioe Court of law, where a case was agreed, shewing the fol-rowing facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJZ\">Peggy was the daughter of Lucy, a slave who belong-~d to William Carr, whose will, dated in January 1790, was proved in the County Court of Prince William in t791; the testator having departed this life in Nov. t790~</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHB-\">After bequeathing Lucy to his son John Carr, he added; \" My will and desire is, that the negroes bequeathed to \" my (lear children should remain with my (lear Wife during her life, unless she should marry: in that case, \" my will and desire is, that my slaves should go immedietely to those to whom they are devised, and that \" none of them be sold out of the families to whom devised, ~f offered for sale, by any qf them, out of the family of my wife, my daughter and sons, that they be im2ne\"diately liberated, and I do hereby desire they may be \"free to all intents and purposes.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB-\">John (Jarr, under the devise, had possession of Lucy, of whom, while in his possession, Peggy was born. He (lied intestate, and Margaret Tebbs, daughter of Betsy Tebbs who was the testator's daughter, came into possession of Peggy. Margaret Tebbs married Thoma:~ Tripleti who sold Peggy to .Nhthaniel Legg, (a strange~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>110^ connected with the <em>Carr </em>family,) on Condition that he would take her out of Virginia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-Ze\">On these facts, the case was submitted to the Court, which gave judgment for the defendant. The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9Ps\"><em>Gilmer </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2mH\">There must be a <em>venire de novo </em>as to the child for it is not found in the case agreed whether <em>she </em>was sold to <em>Legg, </em>or not, or whether she was bora <em>before, </em>or <em>since </em>the sale of her mother. If' she was herself sold, or was born <em>since </em>the sale, she is entitled to freedom; otherwise not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVWu\">But, as to <em>Peggy, </em>the Court may proceed to judgment, though the case agreed be insufficient as to <em>Mary. </em>The question then is, whether <em>Peggy </em>is entitled ? If her case were subject to the law concerning bequests of chattels on <em>remote contingencies, </em>I should ask a <em>venire de novo </em>in her case also; for it is not -found whether <em>Lucij </em>(her mother) is yet dead, or whether the contingency happened within 21 years after her death. But bequests of freedom to slaves are not subject to such restrictions.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> By the common law, when we adopted it, all men were free. It is in violation of the common law that they are slaves. It is vain therefore to appeal to <em>it </em>to support an authority to which it is repugnant throughout. The right to emancipate by Will is given by Act of Assembly. And here is a Will, emancipating, on a condition <em>which has actually happened. </em>There must be overpowering arguments, to take away this double confirmed natural right; tlje right to be free, and the right to bequeath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axf\">It may be said, that the condition was repugnant to the bequest to the testator\u2019s children. But this case is not like <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Peixoto, </em>3 <em>Vesey jr. </em>324, or <em>King </em>v. <em>Burchett, Ambl. </em>379; for the condition does not prohibit alienation <em>altogether, </em>as in those cases; the members of tho family may alienate the slaves to each other, and each may alienate, to the slaves, by emancipating. If then the testator could alienate them in that manner; if he could, in <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pleasants, </em>annex to the bequest a condition binding the legatees to give them freedom in a certain event; what shall invalidate <em>this </em>condition ? The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>reason of the doctrine against restraints upon alieuiation, is to.firoour the legatee:<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> this opeiate~ eqnally in favrnirof the slaves; f~i a/7er the condition happens, they beCome ObjeCtS of the ~ostator's bounty, aiid them the condition should be Coflstrtle(l favourably for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYtz\">A condition not to alienate except to particalar person-c, is good<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> rFIIiH condition, therefore, is not repugnant to the estate; and, if it were, it would still be good; for the law al1o~ws the destruction of an estate hi sia~ces.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR5\">N'rther is this CaSe withiii The Inealling or PolicY of the laws against perpelniLies. A perpetuity is defined in Stanley v. Leigh, 2 P. Wms. 688, and Washborn v. Downes, Cases in Ch. 213, to be \"the 1i~iiting of an es- \" tate Iii f4~IC11 n~annei~ as would render itnnalwnable Ion- \" ger than loP a 1il~, or Bve~, in being' at the same tiew; and some short or reasonable thee after. Accordim~ to this definition, the COfl(liIJOH anriexeti i0 the bC(1UCst of these slaves does not cecate a perpetoity; for (as I stated beIbie,) the restriction is not Complete; but alienation is permitted, to peesons of the same 1~unily, or to the slaves themselves. 11cm jS 110 restraint of fami1~j seUlements; <footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> tior of co1~i.,~1u'ree; for the rcstrictioii in the Will is only upon ~coiuntar~j, not coni~~ul~orq, sales; and the law allows slaves, actually emimcipated, to be sold for debts contracted before eniancipation. <footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqM\">.N~o CO1fliS1'1 aPP~~ared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\"> <em>Pleasants </em>v.
