They begun said survey about two and one half chains in the <em>South </em>branch of Potowmack, about four miles below the mouth of the <em>North </em>fork, near to where fort <em>George </em>formerly stood, the first course extended eleven poles up a run, between two hills, the second course crossed the point of a hill which was not passable; they measured back on the first course, into the bottom, to enable them to run the second course.

And further proved by <em>Michael Lee0 </em>that he has resided in this county fifty years, that the <em>North </em>fork enters into the <em>South </em>branch about a mile and a quarter above the upper end of the land in dispute, that the <em>South </em>fork of the said river, empties into the <em>South </em>branch, about eleven miles below the said land. And further proved by <em>Job </em>Welton, that he was summoned by the Sheriff of this county, to attend a survey on the lands in dispute, and that they began the first course of the survey about the middle of the <em>South </em>branch where fort <em>George </em>formerly stood, that they run the first course, about eleven rods up a run between two hills, where the timber was chiefly cut, they then started on the second course, and run some distance when they came to a steep bank which they could not go down; they measured back on the first course, into the bottom, to enable them to run the second course.

To which evidence the demandant by his counsel demurred as insufficient in law, to support the right of the tenants to the land in contest, and produce in support of his right, a copy of a patent duly attested as the law directs, from his late Majesty <em>George </em>the second, king of <em>Great Britain; </em>in the words and \u2019figures following <em>George </em>the second, &amp;c. and the act of Assembly passed in the year 1748, entitled, An act for ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>confirming the grants made hy his Majesty, within the bounds of the <em>Northern Neck,\u2019as </em>they are now established; and also, a copy of the last will and testament of <em>Robert Green </em>deceased, authenticated under the seal of <em>Orange </em>county, where the same was admitted to record, in the words following to wit: In the name, &amp;c. and prays the judgment of the Court, whether he has more right to the tenements which he demandeth against them, or they to hold it, as they demand it,\u201d -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-12\">That the Court refused to permit the demurrer to be filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-13\">Verdict and judgment for the tenants; upon which the demandant appealed to the District Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-14\">The District Court was of opinion, that the judgment was erroneous in this, <em>\u201c </em>that the Court bel.ow ought not to have admitted the evidence stated on the part of the tenants as mentioned in the demandant\u2019s bill of exceptions, to have gone as evidence to the jury; and in not receiving the demurrer of the said demandant.\u201d That Court therefore reversed the judgment; and thereupon the tenants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-15\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\"><em>October </em>Term, 1800.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-16\">A demurrer to evidence, should be capable of being-reduced to so much certainty, that the Court may ascertain the fact; and although the Court may presume every thing against the party tendering the demurrer, they cannot presume any thing against the other party. For, it would be absurd to oblige \u00e1 man to admit what he denies. But, in the present' case, neither do the lands claimed, agree with those described in the count; nor does it appear, that the demandant was entitled, under the will <em>o\u00ed _ Robert Green. </em>For it is not shewn, that the plaintiff is the person to whom the lands are devised; which it was necessary for the demandant to have done; because that was the foundation of his title. It would have been clearly so in a special verdict, or in pleading; and as strict a rule, at least, ought to obtain against the party tendering a demurrer; who, by drawing the cause from the jury to the Court, and thus preventing an ascertainment of facts by the country, takes upon himself, to state a complete title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Williams, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-3\">The demandant might demur to the tenant\u2019s evidence. <em>Trials Per Pais: </em>And this upon principle; for the evidence begins with the tenant; <em>Booth </em>on Real Act. 98; and, therefore, if insufficient, <em>the </em>demandant <em>may refer it to </em>the judgment of the Court The evidence here, did not go to shew that the tenants had more mere right than the demandant; for, it is evident, on the whole matter, that our\u2019s was the better title. The tenants could not be permitted to prove, that the land claimed was different from that described in the count. For, <em>non tenure </em>is a plea in abatement; and cannot be given in evidence, where the <em>mise </em>is joined upon the mere right. The act of 1786, [c. 59, <em>12 Stat. Larg. </em>345,] will not be considered as making any difference; for, that only permits any thing to be given In evidence that might have been specially pleaded; which means any thing that might have been plead in bar, and not abatement. <em>Non tenure </em>is not only considered as a plea in abatement, by the common law, but the act of 1748, c. 1, \u00a7 <em>21, </em>[5 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>416,] treats in it the same manner. With respect to the certainty of the person demanding the land, it is sufficiently shewn: For, <em>James Green </em>is the person named in the will; and <em>James Green </em>is the person who brings the suit. Upon <em>ihe whole, </em>therefore, the Court below ought to have compelled the tenants <em>to </em>join in the demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApNk\">The demurrer ought to have been received. For, the uncertainty spoken of, related only to <em>non tenure, </em>and the identity of the lands; which were mere matter of abatement, both at common law and by the act of 1748. But, It has been already properly shewn, that the act of 1786 does not alter the law, in that respect. For, it clearly means pleas in bar, and not in, abatement: Like the ordinary case of the general issue, with leave to give the special matter in evidence; which means evidence relevant and suited to the case. The count states certain bounds, and the tenants defend those bounds; it would, therefore, be strange, to allow them to deny the very bounds, which they professed to defend. That would be both to admit and deny the identity, which would be absurd. But, certainty to a common intent, is sufficient, as well in special verdicts as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>demurrers to evidence; and there was a certainty to a common intent, in the present case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-8\">The act of 1786 permits every thing to be given in evidence, which might have been specially pleaded; and <em>non tenure, </em>or any other matter in abatement, might be specially pleaded, as well as matter in bar. At common law, every thing might be given in evidence, but collateral warranty; <em>Booth </em>on Real Act. 9S: According to which doctrine, <em>non tenure </em>might have been given in evidence, before the act of 1786; although the <em>mise </em>was joined on the mere right.

There was no point of law in the case; and, therefore, the demurrer was improper. No evidence is offered to shew, that the demandant was the devisee; and, therefore, the Court cannot infer it.-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-9\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0c\"><em>Non tenure </em>could not be given in evidence; for, the judgment would be a bar, and the demandant liable to be surprised. The 1 <em>Mod. </em>214, does not prove that it may be plead in bar; the distinction taken there, by <em>Burr el, </em>expressly proves the contrary. There were questions of law, in this case, arising upon patents, acts of Assembly, wills, &amp;c., which rendered a demurrer proper.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-10\">\n<em>Randolph.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoW\">The judgment would not be a bar in a suit for other lands; because, the demurrer would shew that they were not the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-11\">This term, the Court desired the point, whether, in a demurrer to evidence, it was necessary to state all the evidence on both sides, to be spoken to by counsel.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-12\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-13\">It is absolutely necessary, both on principle and authority, that, in a demurrer to evidence, all the testimony, on both sides, should be stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-14\">1. Upon principle:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-15\">There is a strict analogy between a demurrer to evidence and a demurrer to pleadings. Both are governed by the, same principles: In each, the plaintiff must shew a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>good title, against a weak defence: And, the defendant must either shew, that no title is set forth by the plaintiff; or he must oppose a good defence to the good title, alledged by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-4\">Hence, it follows, that although the defendant may some times demur to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, without shewing any, on his own part, as where the evidence, adduced by the plaintiff, renders it unnecessary for the defendant to produce any on his part, yet the plaintiff never can demur \u25a0 to the defendant\u2019s evidence, without setting forth his own; because, he must shew a good title in himself to recover, or the weakness of the defendant\u2019s title is of no consequence. For, he is to recover upon the strength of his own, and not upon the weakness of his adversary\u2019s title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">The end of all pleadings, and a demurrer to evidence is a species of pleadings, is to bring the points, in controversy, fairly before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">Therefore, as the plaintiff, in his declaration, must set forth a good title, or the defendant may demur, without alledging any other matter of defence; since it is immaterial whether the defendant has a title or not, provided the plaintiff has none: So, the plaintiff must prove a good title, or the defendant may demur to his evidence, and pray judgment on account of its insufficiency, without offering any new matter upon his own part; for, it would be useless to bring forward testimony, to avoid a title which is not shewn to exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">It results from all this, that it is absolutely necessary that it should appear, by the demurrer, that the plaintiff has a good cause of action; which <em>prima facie </em>entitles him to judgment, unless it be destroyed by countervailing testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">\u2022 But, if the plaintiff does set forth a good title in his declaration, the defendant must answer it by a good bar, or the plaintiff may demur. For, his own title being good, unless a proper defence to it is set up, he ought to have judgment. So, if the plaintiff proves a good cause of action, the defendant must avoid it by a proper defence, or the plaintiff will be entitled to judgment. For, an insufficient answer can be no bar to a good title, which necessarily stands, until it is obviated by a paramount defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-9\">But, if the declaration contains a good title, and the plea a good defence, then the plaintiff must reply a sufficient matter, to avoid the plea, or the defendant may demur; - because, having given a sufficient answer to the claim, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>will stand until it is repelled by some new matter offered by the plaintiff. So, if the plaintiff proves a good cause of action, which is destroyed by the defendant\u2019s evidence, plaintiff must avoid the defence by countervailing evidence on his part; for, his first evidence being destroyed by that of his adversary, his action is destroyed also, unless he can repel the defence. And so on, <em>in infinitum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Als\">Thus far, is sufficient to shew the analogy between the demurrers, which, upon examination, will be found to run through all the various stages of a cause; with this difference only', that where the demurrer is to the pleadings, the alternate steps are distinctly shewn; whereas, in the demurrer to evidence the testimony is thrown together, without order or- arrangement, so that the alternate steps do not at first sight appear. But, still the principles remain the same; because they exist in the very nature of things; and the Judge, when he conies to decide, is necessarily' drawn into the arrangement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-5\">It follows, therefore, that in every step, in pleadings or in proof, unless where the defendant demurs to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, in the first instance without offering any on his own part, the demurrant must show that his own title is good, before he can derive any advantage from the weakness of the countervailing claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-6\">To illustrate this by some examples.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATYa\">If in ejectment for lands, the defendant shews a conveyanee from the plaintiff, the latter may prove that it was given during coverture: To which the defendant may shew subsequent acts of ratification, after the disability'\u2019 removed; and to this the plaintiff may demur, if she thinks the defence incomplete. But, then she must in her demurrer, shew the coverture; or the conveyance being proved, shall entitle the defendant to judgment, whether the defendant\u2019s other testimony be important or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">So, if in an action of <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>the plaintiff does not prove the consideration and promise, the defendant may demur, for the insufficiency of the testimony; but, if the consideration and promise be proved, and the defendant produce a receipt against all demands, here if the plaintiff offers to prove, that it was given for a part, the defendant, if he thinks the testimony does not avoid the receipt, may demur to the evidence; but, then he must produce the receipt itself, or the plaintiff having proved an original cause of action, will recover, whether his subsequent evidence be important or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>So, that in every case, the demurrant\u2019s testimony must not only contain an answer to that of his adversar}7, but it must moreover shew a complete title, through all the stages of the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-4\">The propriety of stating the whole evidence is more obvious, when the object of the demurrer is considered.* Which is, that the jury, if they please, may refuse to find a special verdict, and then the facts never appear upon the record; to prevent which inconvenience, the party resorts to the demurrer, in order to exhibit all the facts, for \u2022 the judgment of the Court. <em>[Cocksedge </em>v. <em>Fanshaw,] </em>Dougl. 127. So, that the demurrer is, in fact, a mere substitute for a special verdict. But, in a special verdict, all the facts on both sides must be found, or the Court will grant a new trial; and, therefore, in the demurrer, which is the substitute, the same thing must be done, or the Coui\u2019t may refuse to receive the demurrer. For, the Court are to judge of the <em>allegata ct probata </em>on both sides; and not upon those of one side only. In other words, they are to decide upon the whole case, and not upon parts: or else, <em>the truth of the title never </em>could <em>be discerned.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\"><em>A </em>moment\u2019s reflection will inevitably lead us to this conclusion. For, if the testimony on both sides was not stated, the combination and connection of the parts could not ho perceived. It would oftentimes become a mer&lt;\u00ed <em>farrago </em>of unintelligible jargon for want of knowing they points, to which the repelling testimony of the party murred unto, was applied. So, that, although the <em>ques~\u00a1 </em>tion might turn upon the competency of the repelling tes-i timony only, it would never occur; hut, the Court would'. have to decide upon that which was offered, by the adversary, before the demurrant ever produced any at all: And thus it would inevitably happen, that it would be impossible to have the very point determined by the Court, which was meant to be decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">It will be no objection to. say, that by this means, the person demurred unto, will be driven to admit the truth of the demurrant\u2019s testimony. For, that consequence does not follow.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-10\">There are but two grounds upon which that objection could possibly occur; namely, the credit of the demurrant\u2019s witnesses; and, the circumstances which he might insist on, to establish particular facts. For, as to facts actually proved, the demurrant has as much right to state those in his own favor, as the party demurred unto, has to state those in his favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>But, neither of those two cases produces the effect objected to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-7\">Not the credibility of the demurrant\u2019s witnesses:</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-8\">\u2022 Because, the demurrant, when stating his <em>own </em>testimony, can only insert the undisputed facts; and, if any objection as to the credit of the witnesses arises, that alone is a sufficient reason for rejecting th'e demurrer; because, the credit of a witness is matter of fact, and not of law; and as the Court cannot try a matter of fact, it must, if insisted on, remain with the jury. Therefore, if the demurrant chooses to take the cause from the jury to the Court, he must relinquish the impeached witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-9\">Not the circumstantial evidence:</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-10\">Because, the demurrant necessarily yields up his presumptions and probabilities; for, by drawing the cause from the jury to the Court, he loses the opportunity of insisting on them before those, who alone are able to draw conclusions of fact. But, the case of the party demurred to is very different; for,, if he insists on probabilities and presumptions, the demurrant is bound to admit the fact he would infer from them; because, he is forced into the demurrer against his consent, and has no opportunity of addressing the jury to infer them. He is not, on this account, however, bound to admit the facts, which the demurrant would establish by such testimony; because, the demurrant might have left them to the jury; and, he cannot, by drawing the cause, <em>ad aliud examen, </em>oblige the other party, against his inclination, to confess what he was disposed to deny. The demurrant is therefore driven to state the facts he actually proves, without any inferences from circumstances; and if any contest arises about the facts so proved, it is to be reserved to the Court. Because, the whole. operation of entering the matter upon record, and conducting a demurrer to evidence, is, and ought to be, under the direction and control of the Court;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> subject, however, to an appeal by bill of exceptions, if any point be improperly recited or rejected by them. For, it is said, that if the Court may over-rule, it may also regulate the entry of the proceedings upon the record, and the admissions which are to be made previous to the allowing of the demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-11\">Thus, then, it clearly appears, that the objection is imaginary; and, that the person demurred to is not bound to admit the truth of the facts insisted on by the demurrant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>but, that the latter must prove them. Yet, when he has proved them, he has a right to insist on their efficacy, in destroying the opposite claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AruR\">The propriety of these remarks is the more obvious the following consideration; namely, that the Court is to pronounce, whether the plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the matter in controversy; which they cannot do, if the whole evidence is not stated: Especially as it seldom happens, that the demurrer is argued the same term, in which it is filed; and, therefore, whether they be the same, or other Judges, they can know nothing of the matter, unless the whole testimony appeal\u2019s of record. Thus far on principle:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-6\">2. But, upon authority, the point is equally clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-7\">A demurrer to evidence may be defined to be, an aliegation of the demurrant; which, admitting the matters of fact alledged by the opposite party, shews that, as set forth, they are insufficient in law for the adversary to\" proceed upon, or to oblige the demurrant to give any, or a further answer thereto; either because they are, in point of law, defective in themselves, or are, in law, destroyed by countervailing testimony. It is thus described by Sir William Blackstone: <em>&lt;c </em>But, a <em>demurrer </em>to evidence shall be determined by the Court, out of which the record is sent. This happens, where a record or other matter is produced in evidence, concerning the legal consequences of which there arises a doubt in law: in which case, the adverse party may, if he pleases, demur to the whole evidence; which admits the truth of every fact that has been alledged, but denies the sufficiency of them all, in point of law, to maintain or overthrow the issue: which draws the question of law from the cognizance of the jury, to be decided (as it ought) by the Court.\u201d <em>[Blacks. </em>Com. 3 vol. 372, <em>Wms. </em>ed.] This passage proves expressly his own opinion to have been, that it was necessary to state all the evidence. Because, he says, that the party may demur upon the <em>whole </em>evidence; which, admitting the facts, denies the sufficiency of them <em>all </em>to maintain or overthrow the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-10\">This agrees with the doctrine laid down by the Court, in the case of <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Pynder; </em>the statement of which, according to <em>Mien\u2019s </em>report of it, was as follows: \u201cIn a trover and conversion, brought by an administrator, upon <em>not guilty </em>pleaded, the defendant, upon the evidence, confesses that he did convert them to his own use; but, further saith, that the intestate was indebted to the King; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and that, 18 <em>May. </em>14 <em>Car. </em>it was found, by inquisition, jle died possessed of the goods in question; which being returned, <em>a venditioni exponas </em>was awarded to the Sheriff; who, by virtue thereof, sold them to the defendant. And, to prove this, the defendant shewed the warrant of the treasurer, and the office book in the exchequer, and the entry of the inquisition, and the <em>venditioni exponas </em>in the Clerk\u2019s book; to which the plaintiff saith, that the matter alledged is not sufficient to prove the defendant <em>not guilty; </em>and that there was no such writ of <em>venditioni exponas. </em>And the defendant saith, that the matter is sufficient, and that there was such a writ.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-6\">In this case, according to <em>Styles, </em>34: \u201cRoil, Justice, took two exceptions to the pleading; (meaning the demurrer; because the plea was <em>not guilty;) </em>1. That the goods mentioned in the schedule appear not to <em>be </em>the same contained in the declaration: 2. No title is made to the indenture by him who brings the action; and concluded upon the whole matter, that the demurrer was not good, and that there ought to be a <em>venire facias de novo, </em>to try the matter again. Bacon, Justice, much to the same effect; but, <em>differed in </em>this, that there ought not to be a <em>venire facias de novo, </em>but said, that judgment ought to be given against one party, to wit: the defendant, for ill joining in demurrer, to the intent, the party that is not in fault may be dismissed, and the parties here have waived the trial <em>per pais, </em>by joining in demurrer. But, Rome, answered, <em>that no judgment at all could be </em>given; for, both parties bo in fault; one, by tendering the demurrer; the other, by joining in it; and the defendant might have chosen whether he would have joined or no, but might have prayed the judgment of the Court whether he ought to join.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0z\">Here both Judges agreed that the demurrer was bad, in not ascertaining the goods, and setting forth the plaintiff\u2019s title to the indenture: they differed, indeed, as to the judgment to be given; one of them thought, there ought to be another <em>venire facias; </em>the other, that there ought to be judgment final; but both opinions were grounded on the imperfection of the demurrer. Taking either opinion, however, to have been the correct one, and it equally proves, that the Court were right in rejecting the demurrer in the present case. For, if a new <em>venire facias </em>ought to have gone, then the Court wTero not bound to receive a demurrer, merely for the form of setting it aside again; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>and, if there ought to have been final judgment against the tenants, for joining in an insufficient demurrer, that alone is a proof, that the Court ought not to have received the demurrer, and compelled the defendants to join. In point of fact, however, a <em>venire facias </em>was actually awarded, as appears by <em>Mien\u2019s </em>report of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">We have, then, both the opinion of a most able commentator, and an express decision of the Court, that it is necessary for the <em>demurrant to state the whole </em>evidence, and to shew a complete title. They are, therefore, authorities to the very point; and decide the present question, without any necessity for a further enquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">But, as the point is of importance, it may be worth while to investigate it a little further; and to examine precedents upon the subject, in books of entries: Because, the forms of pleadings are always considered as evidences of the law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">In <em>RastalVs </em>Entries, 148, pi. 12, there is a demurrer to evidence, to the following effect:</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\"><em>ie </em>And, upon this, the aforesaid D. G. and M. shewed in evidence to the jurors aforesaid, to verify and prove the issue aforesaid, on their part, to wit: <em>(as in the evidences;') </em>and the aforesaid I B. and B. to verify and prove the issue aforesaid, on their part, to wit: that they had not entered into the tenements aforesaid, with the appurtenances, shewed in evidence to the jurors aforesaid, and say, &amp;e. <em>(as in the evidences.) </em>And the aforesaid G and M. say, that they, to the matter aforesaid, by the said I. B. and B. above in evidence to the jurors aforesaid shewn, &amp;e.\u201d Going on to conclude the demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-15\">Which clearly proves, that the evidence, on both sides, is to be inserted. For, such is the mode pursued in that form; as it first states the evidence of D. G. and M. and then that of I. B. and B.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-16\">This precedent agrees with the language contained in the first <em>mentioned </em>books; and <em>the whole of them expressly </em>supports the propriety of the doctrine laid down by this Court, in the case of <em>Hoyle </em>v. Young, 1 Wash. 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-17\">In which, the President, in delivering the resolution, of the Court, says: \u201c We think the proper rule is, io allow a demurrer to evidence at any time before the jury retire, although the party demurring may have examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>witnesses on his part, (the <em>whole evidence on both sides </em>being stated; which, in all cases, ought to be done,) unless the Court think the case clear against the party. In, which case, the books agree, that the Court may refuse to receive the demurrer. In this case, the opinion of the Court, as to this point, was right: 1st. Because, the <em>whole evidence </em>was not stated: And, 2dly Because, we think the case was clearly against the defendant.\u201d This case, therefore, confirms the others; and leaves the question no longer doubtful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-8\">So, that it may now be considered as a fixed rule, that, in every case, the demurrant must insert, the <em>whole </em>evidence; in order that the Court may judge whether <em>all </em>of it is sufficient to maintain the issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\">But, it is more necessary still in a writ of right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-10\">1. Because, no other action remains to redress the error, if one intervenes in the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-11\">2. Because the Court ought always to instruct the jury on the trial of a writ of right, <em>Co. .Lilt. </em>293; and by analogy, they ought to be able, on executing a writ of enquiry, after a decision of the demurrer, to say to the jury, that, upon the whole evidence, the right was with the tenant. But, this they cannot do, if the evidence is not stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-12\">As, therefore, a. faulty demurrer was offered, and as that demurrer did not shew title in the demandant, the County Court did right in refusing to receive it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-13\">In consequence of the various decisions in this Court, that a demurrer to evidence cannot be used as a bill of exceptions,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it becomes unnecessary .to add any thing on the subject of <em>non tenure. </em>Therefore, I shall only observe, that the act of Assembly, to avoid difficulties on the trial, seems to have intended, that every thing, which would destroy the demandant\u2019s action, might be given in evidence at the trial of the <em>mise, </em>upon the mere right. And it can never be right to say, that the demandant should recover lands to which he had no title, upon a mere slip in the pleadings. Besides, in <em>E tier\u2019s </em>Pleadings, 321, <em>non tenure </em>is expressly called a plea in bar; and if so, it ends that; question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-14\"><em>Willimns, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-15\">I do not mean to controvert the doctrine on demurrers to evidence: But, <em>non tenure, </em>upon this issue, was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>absurd and improper. In a demurrer to evidence, every thing which may be inferred, is admitted; and, if the objection that the demandant was not the <em>Robert Green </em>mentioned in the will, be at all founded, it might have been corrected by the Judges\u2019 notes; or the Court will now set aside the proceedings, in order to supply the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-3\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-11\">[* See <em>Gibson </em>et al. v. <em>Hunter, </em>2 Hen.
