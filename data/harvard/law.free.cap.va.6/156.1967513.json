That <em>Taliaferro and Woodford </em>took administration on the estate; and that the plaintiffs <em>William </em>and <em>Mildred </em>have intermarried. The bill, therefore, prays an account and distribution of the personal estate, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-13\">The answer of <em>Taliaferro </em>states, that many of the debts due the decedent, were paid in paper money. That all the personal estate was sold by the administrators, amounting, with a crop, to 13,848/. 4s. 3-f. That 4,739/. 13s. <em>Ad. </em>came to the hands of the defendant; who received also sundry debts of the intestate to the amount of 400/. That, out of the monies received for the sales of the estate and other accounts, several debts due from the intestate have been paid. That in <em>July </em>1779, there was paid to <em>John Lewis, </em>father of the plaintiff <em>Mildred, </em>the sum of <em>4,1111. 9s. 7d. </em>and to <em>Thornton Washington, </em>by a written order from his father, the sum of 4,200/. 18s. <em>0d.; </em>which were the amount of their shares after the proper deductions were made; and for these sums he took receipts from the said <em>John Lewis </em>and <em>Thornton Washington. </em>That the said <em>Thornton Washington </em>and the said <em>John Lewis, </em>father of the plaintiff <em>Mildred, were </em>present at the sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of the personal estate, and purchased several articles respectively. That the defendant has been sued for a considerable debt claimed of the said <em>John Thornton; </em>which suit is yet depending. That after <em>Woodford </em>went into the army, the administration was conducted by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\">The answer of <em>Woodford\u2019s </em>executrix, speaks of the sales of the estate, and that, after <em>Woodford </em>Went into the army, the administration was conducted by <em>Taliaferro.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The Court of Chancery referred the accounts to a commissioner; who credited the estate with the money for the sales of the personal estate, upon the days when the sales respectively took place; which were on the 19th of May, 1778, the 1st of December, 1778, and the 2d of January, 1779. He also credited the estate, on the 5th of <em>June, </em>1779, with four Loan Office certificates paid to <em>John Lewis, </em>for his daughter <em>Mildred </em>the plaintiff, <em>vis: </em>One of 300 dollars, dated 5t,h of <em>March, </em>1777, with interest to the 5th of <em>June, </em>aforesaid; when it was paid to <em>Lewis, </em>as above mentioned: a second of 1800 dollars, dated 17th of March, \u25a0T778, with interest as above; a third of 2,3331- dollars, dated 1st of <em>March, </em>1778, with interest as above; and a fourth of 1,500 dollars, dated 6th of <em>November, </em>1778, with interest as above. He also credited the estate at the same time, with 1,347/. 125. continental certificates for emissions of <em>Jipril </em>and <em>May </em>paper money; to which no date being affixed, the date of payment to <em>Lewis </em>was assumed. He also, on the 5th of <em>July, </em>1779, credits the estate with a Loan Office certificate of 4,333! dollars, dated 5th of <em>December, </em>1777,,with interest to the said 5th of <em>July, </em>when it was paid to <em>Thornton Washington. </em>He likewise credits the estate with monies collected. After which, he debits the estate with sundry disbursements; but leaving due from John Taliaferro, as administrator of <em>John Thornton </em>deceased, a balance of 158/. 95. <em>2d. </em>to the estate of <em>Thornton Washington; </em>and of <em>3611. 18s. 7\u00a7d. to </em>the estate of <em>Woodford </em>the other administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">In this report the commissioner, being uncertain whether the monies paid <em>Thornton Washington </em>by <em>William Woodford </em>were included in any of the payments made by <em>John Taliaferro, </em>considered the separate receipts as separate and distinct payments. He added, that as the payments of the 5th of <em>July, </em>1779, were included in one receipt, without specifying the particulars, except the certificate, the purchases at the sales with the certificate and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>much paper money as made up the 3,800/. were taken together for <em>Thornton Washington\u2019s </em>share, and that as the sales were all made for ready money, and few debts to pay two and a half <em>per cent, </em>commission only, were allowed the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">\u2022 The defendant <em>John Taliaferro </em>excepted to the report for the following reasons, amongst others. .1. That the certificates for the emissions of paper money in <em>April </em>and <em>May </em>1778, being for paper money received at the sales of the estate and funded, ought to be considered as part of' the sales; and, therefore, as the whole amount of the sales was credited, the said certificates ought not to be made a separate charge again; for by that means, the' defendant was twice charged with the same thing. But, if the certificates had been a proper charge, the depreciation ought to be calculated from the time the certificates were received by him, and not from the time they were paid to <em>Leivis. 2. </em>That the commissioner in charging the disbursements and payments by the defendant, had made him liable for the depreciation, between the dates of the receipts, and those of the payments; whereas if the scale was to be applied at all, the defendant ought not to be answerable for the loss arising from the intervening depreciation: But, that according to the act of Assembly, all payments in paper money, ought to stand at their nominal amount. 3. That 2-1 <em>per cent, </em>was not a sufficient commission for his administration on the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-11\">On these exceptions the commissioner remarked that, the certificate for the <em>April </em>and <em>-May </em>money, could not be included in the sales already made, .because it is credited by the defendant over and above the sales of the estate. So that the only question is; whether the value is rightly ascertained ? To which there could be no objection; because the defendant is not made answerable for more, on that ground, than he has credit for in the accounts of <em>Minor </em>and <em>Washington. </em>In which the <em>debits </em>of the certificates, with interest in their accounts, correspond with the credit to the estate in the account current; upon which statement of the certificates, he observed the defendant\u2019s exception vanished; because he paid the same value that he received. That, as to the exception concerning the disbursements, and payments made by the defendant, he thought himself warranted under the decretal order of the Court, to do the parties material and complete justice as far as their respective cases would admit; and that the act of Assembly did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>not prevent a fair adjustment of the accounts of executors, administrators, guardians, or other trustees. That the act directs, <em>\u201c </em>that debts and contracts, are to be reduced to true value in specie at the days or times the same were incurred or entered into. A. buys a horse of B. for two hundred pounds in <em>January, </em>1778, payable January, 1779, but he fails to pay for him, until <em>January, </em>1782, when paper money ceased to be a circulating medium: When the contract was entered into, the scale, was four for one, and therefore A. must owe to B. 50/. with 7/. 10s. for three years interest thereon, making the sum of 57/. 10s; whereas if the term <em>incurred </em>is applied to the debt at the day of payment, when the scale was eight for one,. he will only have to pay half that sum. That the last is not the sense, in which the Legislature used the term <em>incurred, </em>appears cleai\u2019ly from the proviso in the second section of the act.; where it is provided, that actual payments made in the then current paper currency, should not be scaled. The injustice done to the debtor, by scaling the debtor contract at the time it was incurred or entered into, and not at the date of payment, is here transferred to the creditor, with accumulated force. And although the debt- or under the terms of the act in the case propounded, would pay double, yet if he paid the creditor <em>with </em>interest on the last day of <em>December, </em>1781, to wit, two hundred and thirty pounds reduced by the scale of one thousand for one, making four shillings and seven pence, he would pay him with about the two hundred and fiftieth part of his debt. The last clause of the act proves, that the Assembly foresaw that gross injustice would be done by a rigid adherence to the scale, or to the payments made by debtors, and therefore a discretionary power was vested in the Courts. Under this opinion, your commissioner has, in every instance referred to him by the Court, endeavored to do justice to both debtors and creditors. In some cases where the credits to an estate arose <em>from </em>sales on credit, and the collections of debts due to the testator or intestate, which are not always punctually paid, he hath reduced the paper money credits by a medium scale,- and used the same rule for disbursements. In others, where the sales were made for ready money and no debts to collect, and few or no demands to satisfy but the claims of distributees, he hath applied the scale according to the dates. This last rule was applied to the case under consideration, it appearing to your commissioner that the administrator had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>debts of any consequence to pay, which could retard the distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">That the whole of the disbursements were of such a nature as made them necessarily known to the defendant, and it was, therefore, his duty to have paid them directly, as he had money on hand for that purpose \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">The Court' of Chancery over-ruled the exceptions, and decreed payment of the 1S8\u00bf. <em>9s. 2d. </em>to the estate of <em>Washington, </em>and of the <em>3611. </em>18s. <em>7i, to Woodford, </em>with interest on each sum <em>from the 5th </em>day of <em>July, </em>1779.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">From which decree <em>Taliaferro </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-7\"><em>Randolph, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\"><em>Salle </em>v. <em>Yates et </em>ux., 1 Wash. <em>226, </em>and <em>Granberry </em>v. <em>Granberry, </em>1 Wash. 246, contain the general doctrines of the Court upon paper money, which ought to influence this case; and prove that the appellant ought only to be charged according to the scale value, as that was the real value of the subject in his hands.

The reasoning of the master commissioner, on the subject, tends to illustrate some of the evil effects of paper; but, it belonged to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Legislature, and not to the Courts of Justice, to fix the mode of winding up that unhappy affair, so as to subject individuals, on the whole, to the least of unavoidable evils; which was done by the act of 1-781. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Amongst other regulations, it is declared, that all actual payments, made in paper, in discharge of debts or contracts, should stand at their nominal amount and not be scaled: Nor is the case of such payments within the proviso empowering the Courts to vary the scale upon equitable circumstances. Perhaps the conduct of this administrator is less exceptionable, than almost any which hath been brought before a Court; since, in the next year after the intestate\u2019s death, he paid the two complaining distributees all, nearly all, or probably over, their proportions of the estate to that period. The account ought to be stated in paper to the time of the last payment to them, and the balance, either way, reduced by the scale of that month, carried to the account of subsequent specie articles,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and interest allowed against the debtor from time to time thereafter. The Court is further of opinion, the administrator ought to be allowed five <em>per cent, </em>commissions on the amount of the sales and debts received by himself, (but not on the loan office certificates or debts collected by Day, who probably retained a commission;) that allowance not being too great for selling and receiving, paying and accounting for the money, and risqueing the receipt of counterfeit paper; an instance of which appears to have happened \u00abto his loss-<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> Amongst the loan certificates, is a continental one for one thousand three hundred and forty-seven pounds, twelve shillings, emissions of <em>Jlpril </em>and <em>May </em>money, 1778, which the administrator is charged with, because it is part of four thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine pounds, thirteen shillings and four pence, credited in his account for the certificates, besides a credit for the amount of the whole sales. This he states, in his exceptions, to have been a mistake as to the certificates in question; which were taken for paper money received for the sales and funded by him; and so a double charge. Which, though not proved, is very probable; since the certificates, being after the intestate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>death, must have been for paper found in the house or received. by the administrator for sales or debts: Of the former, eighty pounds, six shillings, and six pence, is accounted for, which it is presumed was all. It is remarkable that a like mistake was made by the administrator, in the case of <em>JlrmisleacPs </em>certificates, which was corrected by the commissioner. This article, therefore, of one thousand three hundred and forty-seven pounds, twelve shillings, ought to be open for enquiry and adjustment on taking the new account. The decree in favor of the representatives of <em>William Woodford, </em>the co-administrator, seems improper, since no contest, between them and the appellee, appears in the record, nor any account of their separate transactions, except in the state of the accounts by the commissioner; unless that was done by consent, which would justify it.-- And that the decree aforesaid is erroneous. Therefore, it is decreed and ordered that the same be reversed and annulled; and that the appellees pay to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here; and the cause is remanded to the said High Court of Chancery, for that Court to have the account, between the parties, reformed; and a decree entered, according to the principles of this decree.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-5\">[* 10 <em>Stat.
