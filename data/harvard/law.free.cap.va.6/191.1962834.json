It was admitted by the parties, that the said <em>Thomas Reynolds </em>was once the owner of the slaves in the said paper mentioned, of whom the plaintiffs constituted a <em>part; </em>but the defendants contended that, long before the date of the said paper, he had sold them to his son <em>John; </em>and, in proof thereof, they adduced the parol evidence of three witnesses:\u20141. <em>Daniel Givens </em>stated that the plaintiff <em>Milly at the time of the birth of her first child f Isaac, </em>stated in the said paper as being <em>ten </em>years of age,) <em>was in the possession of the said John, </em>as were also the other slaves mentioned in the said paperthat, about one or two years afterwards, the said <em>Thomas </em>told the witness, several times, that he had sold the said slaves to his said son <em>John, and had made him a bill of sale for them; </em>and <em>John </em>and those claiming under him remained in possession thereof \u2019till <em>John\u2019s </em>death, which happened about the yeai* 1814. 2. <em>Amy Handly </em>testified that, <em>some years dgo, </em>(the number she could not recollect,) the said <em>Thomas </em>came to her house, and, in conversation, in which he manifested some disatisfaction towards his son <em>John, with whom he resided, </em>said it was true that he had sold him the said slaves, and executed a Bill of Sale to him for them; and that the said <em>John </em>had executed a Bond for 2001, as the price for <em>them; </em>but that he had lost the bond, and <em>John </em>had lost the Bill of Sale; by which the witness believed he meant <em>\u201c John had it not now.\u201d </em>The Witness, though a neighbour, did not recollect to have heard, at the time o\u00ed that conversation, of a deed of Emancipation or other disposition of said slaves by <em>Thomas Reynolds, 3. George Hancock </em>testified that, <em>some years ago, John Reynolds </em>consulted him as Counsel, on the effect of a bill of sale (which he shewed him) of slaves from his father fo him j viz, whether his father could (as he intended) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>make any other disposition or alienation of them; and the Witness, being informed by <em>John </em>that he had been in possession of the slaves some years, advised him that his father could not make another disposition of them. The plaintiffs objected to any other evidence being given to prove the sale from <em>Thomas </em>to <em>John, </em>without producing the said Bill of Sale, or proving it\u2019s existence, and it\u2019s loss, and the manner of it, by satisfactory evidence; and, though the defendants offered to prove the sale by parol evidence of the same, and the payment of the consideration contracted to be paid, the Court sustained the objection ; whereupon the defendants filed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-4\">The defendants also offered in evidence the deposition of <em>John Caldwell </em>sen., taken <em>de hene esse, </em>by virtue of an order of Court, and written notice to <em>Moses F. Cook </em>Attorney for the plaintiffs, and proved the inability of the witness to attend at the trial. The plaintiffs objected to the reading thereof, because no <em>commission appeared </em>among the papers; (though it appeared from the Clerk\u2019s fee-book that <em>one had been charged to the defendants </em>;) and there was no other evidence that the Magistrates who took the deposition acted under a <em>Commission; </em>and because it appeared, from the Clerk\u2019s endorsement, in these words, \u00ab <em>Returned open, </em>23d August 1816,\u201d that the said deposition was returned to his Office, <em>open and unsealed. </em>The Court sustaining this objection also, the defendants again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">After the deed of emancipation had been read to the Jury, and the defendants had given in evidence declarations made by <em>Thomas Reynolds, </em>(not in the presence of <em>John,) </em>for the purpose of proving that a sale had been made of the negroes, by the said <em>Thomas </em>to <em>John, </em>after the said <em>John </em>had come to the possession thereof, (some of which declarations were made after said <em>John </em>had so come to the possession,) the plaintiffs offered to give in evidence other declarations made by said <em>Thomas, fnot in the presence of John,) </em>after the latter had come to the possession as aforesaid, for the purpose of proving that, when the negroes first came to his possession, they <em>continued to be the property of Thomas, </em>and came with his consent to <em>John\u2019s </em>possession:\u2014to which evidence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>defendants objecting, it was excluded by the Court; and thereupon the <em>plaintiffs </em>excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ago\">After the Court had rejected the evidence offered by. the defendants, (as stated in the first bill of exceptions,) the defendants introduced a Witness who swore that, some time previous to the deed of emancipation, (how\" long he did not recollect,) he heard <em>Thomas Reynolds </em>say that he had sold to <em>John Reynolds, or let him have </em>the negroes, <em>\u201c and that said John was to keep him and furnish \u201c him with suitable cloathing, which he had failed to </em>do.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel then moved the Court to instruct the Jury that, if they should be of opinion that the sale spoken of by said witness was the same sale of which evidence had been rejected as aforesaid, they ought to disregard said evidence so far as the same went to prove a sale of the negroes by <em>Thomas </em>to John:\u2014and it being admitted that said negroes were the property of <em>Thomas </em>up to the time when they came to the possession of <em>John, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel moved the Court farther to instruct the Jury, that if they should be satisfied, from the evidence in the cause, that, when the said <em>John came to the possession of </em>said negroes, the right of property was not, transferred to him by said <em>Thomas, </em>then, unless they should be satisfied that the said <em>John </em>subsequently and previously to the deed of emancipation, acquired the right of property by alienation to him, the .mere continued possession thereof for more than five years would not bar the plaintiffs\u2019 right under the deed of emancipation. Whereupon, the Court gave the first instruction, but declined giving the last, and left it to the Jury; all which, on the application of the plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel, was ordered to be spread on the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">A verdict was found, and judgment rendered, for tho plaintiffs, which being affirmed upon an appeal to the Superior Court of law, the defendants again appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AKL\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASX\">1. A Bill of sale for the slaves was not a necessary muniment of our title; for personal property passes hy <em>delivery </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>without a deed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOP\">g, That title, too, became unquestionable by five years unjn^eiTUpj;ed possession. The right of the slaves to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>freedom cannot stand on a better footing than that of the person under whom they claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">3. The Court at the instance of the plaintiffs suppressed evidence concerning the sale, and gave the most singular instruction that ever was given by a Court, flow could the Jiiry know whether it was the same sale, or not, when the evidence in relation to it had been excluded?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">4. The deposition of <em>Caldwell </em>ought not to have been excluded; for it appears that a Commission to take it actually issued, and, not being found among the papers, must have been mislaid.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-6\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ace\">The main point, certainly, is that presented by the first bill of exceptions; hut, in the \"first place, 1 \\\\ ill endeavour to clear the case of minor objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">1. <em>Caldwell\u2019s </em>deposition was properly excluded. In England, commissions to take depositions <em>de bene esse, </em>as ev idence in trials at law, are awarded only on consent of parties, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in Virginia, they are authorised by Act of Assembly in particular circumstances. But, in both Countries, the practice, doubtless, is adopted to save the necessity of resorting to a Court of Chancery to award the commissions for obtaining such depositions. We therefore must look to the practice in Chancery to asccr- ' tain the form of such commissions, and modes of executing and returning them. And there, surely, it is not sufficient that the commission be awarded and issued, but it must be <em>delivered </em>to the Commissioners; and, regularly, it must he returned, <footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such is the constant practice. But, in this case, it does not appear that the Commission ever was delivered to the Commissioners:\u2014they do not even profess to act under it\u2019s authority:\u2014in other words, it does not appear that they had any authority at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">Again; the deposition was returned open.-\u2014The rules of practice prevailing in Virginia, in regard to <em>jmUicalion </em>of depositions, are certainly different from those in England; but, in <em>this </em>respect, the practice is the same in both Countries; the depositions must be returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>unc^ercover&gt; sealed up. </em>The Commission itself always re-5 quires it; and such rule is necssary, to prevent undue practices, to alter the testimony, or, indeed, to suppress it, if found unfavourable, <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An7a\">2. As to the instruction given by the County Court in relation to the character of the transfer of possession fr\u00b0m <em>Thomas Reynolds </em>to his son; there can be no question, <em>now, </em>concerning it, (according to the settled practice in our Courts,) whether that instruction was right or wrong. The defendants acquiesced in it at the time: they neither opposed it before, nor excepted to it after it was given:\u2014they can not therefore be permitted to stand by in silence, take their chance before the Jury, and, if the result be unfavourable, avail themselves, in order to impeach the verdict and judgment, of an error of which they made no complaint at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">3. The principal question remains; whether parol evidence could be given of the <em>contents </em>of the alledged <em>bill </em>of sale, without accounting for the non production of the instrument itself in a more satisfactory manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">It may be remarked, in the first place, that, before this objection was made, the defendants had already examined several Witnesses to prove the sale; and then, the Court did not instruct the Jury to disregard the evidence that had been given on that point, but only excluded <em>other </em>evidence on the same point. It appears, too, from the exceptions filed by the plaintiffs, that the defendants did, even after farther evidence on that head had been excluded by the Court, adduce testimony of the very kind which the Court had declared inadmissible:\u2014so that, notwithstanding that opinion, which it seems the Court did not <em>enforce, </em>they in fact availed themselves of the benefit of the evidence intended to have been excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">Excepting the testimony that <em>Thomas Reynolds said </em>his son <em>John </em>had lost the bill of sale, there is none other that it <em>was </em>lost. If ever there was a case in which a party should be held to strict proof of the loss of an instrument, before he should be allowed to prove it\u2019s contents, this is one. The paper was certainly not lost before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>John Reynolds </em>had notice of his father\u2019s design to emancipate or alienate the slaves} for he afterwards consulted Counsel on it\u2019s effect, and it is probable it was not lost \u2019till after the deed of emancipation was recorded. Here then was the strongest motive for a careful preservation of it} so that, if it were lost, it would be wonderful that the very time, cause and manner of such loss could not be proved. With full notice of the deed of emancipation on record, <em>John </em>would have complained of the loss of his title paper to every neighbour he had. The purchasers from him could not have failed to hear of such a remarkable fact as this recorded manumission} and they doubtless enquired of their vendor as to the particulars of his title, and the fate that had befallen the evidence of it. Yet no kind of evidence is adduced to shew when or how this paper was lost} which evidence was iudispensible to enable them to prove it\u2019s contents, <footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It does not even appear that any enquiry had been made, for the paper, of <em>John Reynolds\u2019 </em>representatives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\">4. Length of possession is now relied upon by the defendants, though, in the Court below, they made no such objection to our right:\u2014but, to suits for <em>freedom, </em>the act of limitations is no bar. The slavish condition and ignorance of the plaintiffs exempt them from it\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply. I admit the act of limitations does not run, against the plaintiffs, <em>since </em>the date of the deed of emancipation: but they claim under <em>Thomas Rey</em>nolds:\u2014if <em>his </em>title was barred by length of time, <em>before </em>he executed the deed, <em>he </em>could convey no right by the deed; because the slaves were <em>then </em>the property of another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">As to the instruction, if it was erroneous and appears on the record, a bill ol\u2018 exceptions is not necessary} the only object of which is, to get the thing spread on the record. There is no appearance of any assent, or <em>waiving </em>of the objection, on the part of the defendants___ Either Mr. <em>Leigh </em>is wrong, or the record is. The Court did exclude the defendants\u2019 parol testimony to prove the sale, after it was discovered there was a bill of sale__ That instrument was not a paid of the <em>res gesta </em>at the <em>time </em>of the sale:\u2014it was executed <em>after-wards, </em>being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>intended as a confirmation of the title:\u2014hut it was no mil-. niment of <em>our </em>title:\u2014we were purchasers from <em>John, </em>it is true; but there is no proof that we knew, or over heard, 0f the bill of sale, until it came out in evidence, from the other side, that there had been such a paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">Another argument was had, on the following questions suggested by the Court; viz:\u2014\u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">1. Is the acknowledgment of a deed of emancipation in the <em>District </em>Court a due probate thereof, or must the probate be in the Court of the <em>County </em>or <em>Corporation?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-7\">2. Is it competent to one to emancipate slaves of which another has <em>adverse </em>possession at the time?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-8\">As to the first point, <em>Leigh </em>remarked, that the Act does not require the Deed to be <em>recorded, </em>but only that it should bo <em>proved </em>or <em>acknowledged </em>in the County or Corporation Court. It\u2019s object therefore is not the same with that of the Statutes requiring registration of other deeds, to give <em>notice </em>thereof to the world; it is, simply, to provide a convenient and solemn method of <em>taking </em>and <em>preserving </em>the evidence of the act of emancipation. This was necessary for <em>taking </em>the evidence; because the slaves are merely passive, and incapable of making\u2019 a contract with their master for their freedom; and therefore the Court is appointed a trustee to receive <em>delivery </em>of the deed for them; which accordingly takes effect, not from the day when it was signed and sealed, but from the date of it\u2019s probate. It was also necessary for <em>preserving </em>the evidence; because, since many might claim freedom under the same deed, to entrust it to the custody of one might be highly injurious to all the rest: it is committed therefore to the custody of a Court of Justice, to take care of it for the benefit of all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-9\">If such was the object of the Act requiring probate of these instruments, it would seem too literal a construction, too regardless of the end proposed by the probate, to say that probate in a <em>district </em>Court, is not as good as in a County or Corporation Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-10\">In relation to the 2d point, it would be very rigid to apply the doctrine which prohibits the assignment of clioses in action, to a donation of freedom. It is agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>on all hands, that the Act of Limitations is no har to a claim to freedom: and, if a positive statute be not allowed to defeat the right, it were strange that a technical rule, respected in Courts of law only, and disregarded in equity, should be allowed to defeat it. In <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Reynolds, 5 Munf. </em>552, the pauper claimed under a Will that had been lost. A claimant of any <em>other </em>right under the Will, must have resorted to a Court of Equity to set it up:\u2014but, it\u2019s substance being proved <em>ex-parte </em>in the County Court, this Court sustained the pauper\u2019s claim to freedom. In that case, the pauper enforced, in a Court of <em>law, </em>an <em>equitable </em>right to freedom. I insisted in argument, that he might do so; and the Court sustained the claim. So, in this case, I hold that the donor might lawfully give his slaves <em>all the right he had </em>in <em>them.\u25a0, </em>whether they were in his own possession, os* In another\u2019s.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-4\">But how docs it appear that this pauper <em>was </em>in the <em>adverse </em>possession of <em>John Reynolds, </em>at the time <em>Thomas Reynolds </em>emancipated her? Looking to the circumstances of the case, as they appear on the record, the Jury (their verdict being for the <em>plaintiff\u2019s,) </em>have found the direct contrary; that <em>John\u2019s </em>possession was <em>not </em>adverse. The case comes here on particular exceptions; not on demurrer to evidence, orease agreed, oi* special verdict; we know not what evidence might have been given, besides what appears. It does not appear that the County Court was called on to give any opinion upon this point, or that it ever was presented to it\u2019s consideration. Appellants here have the right to complain of errors <em>actually commuted, </em>not of such as <em>might </em>have been committed, if points had been submitted by them, which they did not submit. If the judgment be reversed on this ground, it will be for error in an opinion not pronounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\"><em>Wickham. </em>Every tiling in the laws on this subject shews, that the Legislature contemplated the emancipation to be made by the person having <em>possession </em>of the slaves, and power to give the instrument full effect, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the plaintiffs be at all entitled to freedom, their remedy is in <em>equity, </em>not in a Court of <em>law. </em>.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGtP\"><em>Leigh. </em>If there be a remedy in equity, there is one at jaWj \u00a1n <em>[]Lis </em>case. for&gt; jn pauper causes, the question is, as to the mere <em>right </em>to freedom, unshackled by technical rules.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">The Deed\u2019s being recorded in the <em>District </em>Court is not important. Even in the case of- a Patent, Judge Pendleton, in his opinion in <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tapscott, </em>2 <em>Wash. 276, lays it down </em>as a general principle, that the <em>attested copy </em>of a Patent recorded in a <em>County Court, </em>is as good as a Copy from the Register\u2019s office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\"><em>Wickham. </em>The case of <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tapscott </em>relates altogether to <em>old Patents. </em>A copy of a Patent <em>now </em>recorded in a County Court, would certainly not be evidence.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> <em>Jacob </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>1 <em>East. </em>460.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b215-13\"><em> </em>3 <em>Tuck.

The Coux*t ei*rcd therefore in rejecting the evidence of the declarations of <em>Thomas Reynolds, </em>and the other evidence offei'ed to prove a sale by him; and also in rejecting the evidence of the witness <em>Hancock, </em>so far as it tended to prove an advex*sary possession in the said <em>John </em>Reynolds; but that the same ought not to have been relied upon as. tending to px*ove the contents of the Bill of Sale, in the absence of sufficient proof that the same was not then in, the possession or power of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The Court is farther of opinion that the alledged deed of emancipation, (made part of the record in this Bill of exceptions,) not being acknowledged or proved in the Court of the County or Corporation, as the law directs, was not so authenticated as to make it evidence in the trial, nor ought to be received as such evidence until it shall be pi\u2019oved or acknowledged before the propop Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Court is also of opinion, that there was no ei*ror in rejecting the evidence mentioned in the third Bill of Exceptions; and that, as the instruction contained in thq fourth Bill of Exceptions was predicated on the 1-ejec-tion of the evidence mentioned in the first, the same was erroneous;\u2014that there was also no error in refusing to give the last instruction asked for and stated in the said fourth bill of exceptions; but, instead of leaving the matter thereof to the J ury, they ought to have been instructed, that, if the possession of <em>John </em>was adverse to that of <em>Thomas, </em>and so continued for dye years before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>execution of tlie deed of emancipation, such possession as effectually prevented the operation of that Deed, as the change of property by alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"Au5_\">With respect to the deposition mentioned in- the second hill of exceptions, a majority of the Court is of opinion that,, as it sufficiently appears to have been taken under a Commission, and upon notice, and as the same is not shewn to have been erased or altered, and as, for aught appearing by the Clerk\u2019s endorsement, it may have been returned open by the magistrates themselves, it would be too strict to reject it as evidence at the trial; and that there is error in the judgment of the Court in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">The Judgment is to be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to the Court to admit the evidence, so improperly rejected, if again offered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
