And afterwards, by what was called \u201c an article of agreement,\u201d dated the 33,st May 1817, <em>Dudley </em>assigned the residue of the term yet to come (subject to his previous assignment thereof in part of the premises to Curtis) to <em>John Estill </em>and <em>Martin Coyner, </em>for a yearly rent of 3.20 dollars in one event, and of 200 dollars in another event (which last, it seemed, actually occurred), a.s long as the lease should last,\u2014with a <em>proviso, </em>that \u201cif <em>Moffett </em>should sell the property, agreeably to the original article entered into between him and <em>Frazier, </em>this article of course should expire.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-7\">Of the 1000 acres of land which was the subject of these contracts, <em>Moffett, </em>by articles dated the 12th January 3.83.8, agreed to sell 400 acres to <em>Frazier, </em>in fee simple, to make a conveyance thereof to him within three months from the date of the articles, and to give him possession on the 1st January 1819, for 6000 dollars to be paid by <em>Frazier; </em>namely, 3000 dollars at the time of the delivery of the conveyance, and the other 3000 dollars, in three annual instalments, of 1000 dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>iars each. And by other articles dated the 28th Feb- ^ ruary 1818, <em>Moffett </em>agreed to sell the residue of the lan\u00bf (600 acres) to <em>Dabney Cosby </em>and <em>William Lambert </em>in fee, to convey the same to them when required, and to give them immediate possession, reserving to the tenants then on the land the privilege of occupying the houses till they could gather the crop then growing, for 5600 dollars; namely, 4500 dollars to he discharged by work and labor, in the building of houses, which the vendees had contracted to build for <em>Moffett, </em>and the balance llpO dollars, to be paid in six equal annual instalments commencing on the 1st October 1820.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\"><em>Dudley </em>brought an action of covenant against <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner, </em>in the circuit court of <em>Augusta, </em>on the covenants contained in the articles between those parties of the 31st May 1817. The declaration, after setting forth the lease from <em>Moffett </em>to <em>Frazier, </em>and the assignments of the term by <em>Frazier </em>to <em>Dudley, </em>and by <em>Dudley to Estill </em>and <em>Coyner, </em>and the covenants therein contained,\u2014 alleged, as the breach of the covenants contained in the articles of the 31st May 1817 on the part of <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>to be performed, that they had not paid him the rents reserved to him in those articles, according to their covenant in that particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\"><em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>took <em>oyer </em>of all the deeds; and then pleaded, 1.

A determination of the lease by sales made by <em>Moffett, </em>according to the terms stipulated in his original lease.to <em>Frazier: </em>and 4. A determination of the lease by the sales made by <em>Moffett to Frazier </em>and <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert, </em>which were averred to be more advantageous to him and more difficult to be obtained, than the terms mentioned and provided in the covenant for the surrender of the lease by <em>Frazier, </em>in the original lease from <em>Moffett </em>to Frazier,\u2014and payment of the rents reserved, till the time when the lease was so determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Dudley </em>put in a general replication to the three first mentioned pleas, and issues were made up upon them. To the last plea he replied specially, that by the covenants in the lease from <em>Moffett </em>to <em>Frazier, Moffett </em>was only authorized to determine the lease, in the case of his selling the land for 10,000 dollars, one half to be paid in cash at the time of such sale made, and the other half in four annual instalments, and he did not sell the premises to <em>Frazier, </em>and <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert, </em>upon those terms. <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>put in a general demurrer to this special replication, and the court overruled the demurrer ; whereupon, they put in a general rejoinder to it, and so an issue was made up upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff on the issues joined on the two first mentioned pleas. And as to the issues on the other two pleas, they found a conditional verdict for the plaintiff, for 397 dollars with interest &amp;c. if the court should be of opinion, that <em>Moffett's </em>right to sell the premises, under the covenant contained in his lease to <em>Frazier, </em>was so limited, that ho could only sell for at least 5000 dollars cash and at least 5000 dollars in four annual instalments, and that a sale for an equivalent or even more in value, equally or more advantageous to <em>Moffett, </em>and equally or more difficult to be effected, would not in law suffice to constitute a substantial and valid sale according to the true intent and meaning of that covenant: but if the court should be of opinion, that a sale made by <em>Moffett </em>for an equivalent or something of more value to him, than 5000 dollars cash and 5000 dollars in four annual instalments, and a sale more advantageous to <em>Moffett </em>though less difficult to be effected, (as they found that <em>Moffett's </em>actual sale was), was within the intent and meaning of that covenant, then they found for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">Upon this conditional verdict, the court gave judgment for the defendants: to which this court, upon the petition of the plaintiff allowed a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>B.

Adopting this rule, let us look into this contract, and see what was the real design of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><em>Moffett, </em>in November 1815, made a lease of 1000 acres of land to <em>Frazier, </em>for the term of ten years, at a certain <em>rent; but </em>as he contemplated a sale <em>of the </em>land, provided he could do so advantageously, it was provided between the parties, that if he should be able to sell for 10,000 dollars, <em>Frazier </em>should surrender the possession at the end of the then current year. It is obvious from the provision, that it was introduced for the benefit of <em>Moffett, </em>not for the advantage of <em>Frazier, </em>who being unwilling to part with a lease which he doubtless deemed profitable, else he would <em>not </em>have taken it, insisted upon a sale for at least 10,000 dollars, before he would hold himself bound to surrender. This lease <em>Frazier </em>transferred to <em>Dudley, </em>and <em>Dudley, </em>afterwards, to <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner. </em>In the transfer from <em>Frazier, </em>there is ajprovision for the surrender of the possession, similar to that in the lease from <em>Moffett </em>to himself. But in the deed from <em>Dudley </em>to <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner, </em>instead of such provision, other language is used : <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>agreed to pay the said <em>Dudley </em>two hundred dollars annually as long as the lease should last, but if <em>Moffett </em>should sell the property \u201c <em>agreeably to the </em>original article between him and <em>Frazier, </em>this article of course should expire.\u201d Now, this expression is not equivalent (nor was it so designed) to a declaration, that the lease should expire absolutely upon the completion of the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>by <em>Moffett. </em>It was a mere reference to the fact that the sale would, according to the original articles, probably terminate the lease, and then the contract between <em>Dudley </em>and <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>would <em>of course expire. </em>It was not the interest of <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>to terminate their own lease, before the rights of <em>Frazier </em>or <em>Dudley, </em>under their contracts, were terminated. And <em>Dudley, </em>on his part, had no motive for desiring to defeat and terminate the lease of his under lessees, before the original lease was at an end. He had sold, and they had bought, his lease out and out, and by the first part of the articles his whole interest was parted with lor the residue of the term of ten years. If from any cause, the original lease continued during the whole term, <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner </em>were fully entitled <em>to it. And </em>this phrase was introduced into the contract, merely to attest the intention and understanding of the parties, that the possession and interest of the under lessees were to depend upon the continuance or the termination of the original lease to <em>Frazier. </em>In the deed to <em>Betty Curtis, </em>the idea is carried out more clearly, indeed; but I am persuaded that the intention was the same in both cases. If, ibr instance, after the sale by <em>Moffett, </em>he had waived the surrender of the len.se by <em>Frazier, </em>and if his vendee had also waived it, the lease would not have been defeated or terminated. The lease to <em>Frazier </em>does not provide, that immediately upon the sale the lease shall cease and be void, in which case it would instantly and <em>ipso facto </em>have been at an. end; but it provides for a <em>surrender, </em>in that event, by the lessee. Until that surrender was made and accepted, or at least was demanded, the lease continued in full force; and if the parties waived it, the lease was not impaired. Even if the lessee had refused to surrender, though he would have been liable in covenant, yet he could not (I incline to think) have been ousted by ejectment, without a previous demand. But certain it is, that if <em>Moffett </em>and his vendee waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the surrender, the lessee was still in under his original lease. Could it then be contended, that although the lease was not terminated by surrender, but was continued by a waiver of it by those entitled, <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner\u2019s </em>term was at an end, and their title gone f Could <em>Dtidley, </em>who had assigned to them his whole lease have successfully claimed the possession from them for the unexpired residue of the ten years lease ? Might they not well have said, that the true intent of the contract was, that he was to have the lease so long as it continued, and that until the surrender by those under whom they claimed, he was entitled to the possession ? To me it appears obvious,\u2014and that <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coyner\u2019s </em>rights as lessees, could not be terminated, unless by their own voluntary surrender, or the surrender of those under whom they claimed, or by a demand of the possession on the part of the lessor or his vendee. If this be the state of the case, then it is obvious, that <em>Estill </em>and <em>Coy tier </em>are liable upon this covenant for the rents until the termination of the lease by the entry of <em>Moffett </em>or his vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\">The verdict of the jury has expressly negatived the fact of such an entry, by finding for the plaintiff upon the plea alleging an eviction: and hence I infer, that the plaintiff is entitled to a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The verdict upon the other pleadings, however, creates some embarrassment; for the jury find for <em>Dudley, </em>if <em>Moffett\u2019s </em>sale was <em>not </em>within the contract, but they find for the defendant, if it was. Now, this finding is upon the two last pleas, only; for on the other two, the verdict is unconditionally for the plaintiff. And the verdict not only goes out of the issue as to the third plea, and submits a question of law upon the two pleas, without responding to the fact, but in truth and in fact both of those pleas are insufficient and defective. Had they alleged the termination of the lease, without more saying, they might have been sustained; but they un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>dertake to set forth by what, and in what manner, it was determined. And if I have been right in the view I have taken of the case, the facts set forth shew no termination. They only set forth the sales made by <em>Moffett, </em>which did not terminate the lease, but only gave a right to terminate it. They fall short, therefore, of what is necessary to constitute a good bar. Indeed, upon the demurrer to the replication to the last plea, judgment ought to have been given, that that plea was naught. The third plea was equally defective, and the verdict being for the plaintiff upon the only good pleas, judgment cannot be entered for the defendant upon his bad pleas, whether the sale was within the meaning of the contract or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">There must, therefore, be a reversal of the judgment, the verdict set aside, and a repleader awarded; upon which the plaintiff may demur to the faulty pleas. 1 Chitt. Plead. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The court, however, thinks it not improper to say that it considers the sale of <em>Moffett </em>as substantially within the contract.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
