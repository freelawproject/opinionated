Code, ch. 236. \u00a7 1. 2. 3. pp. 233, 4. in cases of applications for new roads, or for the alteration of old ones,\u2014made an order, \u201c on the motion of <em>George Hollins, </em>that the new rood, running by the <em>Bolling Spring </em>tavern, turning out of the old road at <em>Batter son's </em>hill, be established, and the old road discontinued.\u201d About two years afterwards, the court on the motion of <em>Alexander Patterson, </em>ordered, that <em>Hollins </em>should be summoned to shew cause, if any he could, why the former order made on his motion, establishing the new road above mentioned, should not be set aside. And upon the return of the summons, both parties appearing by counsel, the court made an order, that \u201c the first order establishing the new road and discontinuing the old one, should be rescinded.\u201d From this order <em>Hollins </em>appealed to the circuit court of <em>Campbell, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>affirmed it; and then he appealed from the order of affirmance to this court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b473-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>1835. <em>November.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AG7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Upon this, Crenshaw,\u2014who, and not <em>Hollins, </em>was in f\"act the owner of the <em>Bolling Spring </em>tavern, and of the land on which the new road had been established on the motion of Hollins,\u2014preferred a petition to the county court, praying the same alteration of the road which <em>Hollins </em>had proposed; and thereupon, the court appointed viewers to report the conveniences and inconveniences, as well to individuals as to the public, that would result from the proposed alteration-. The report of the viewers being made and returned, <em>Patterson </em>appeared to oppose the proposed alteration of <em>the </em>road; and the court, upon a hearing of both parties by counsel, rejected <em>Crenshaw\u2019s </em>petition for the establishment of the new road', and ordered, that the old road should be established. <em>Crenshaw </em>appealed to the circuit court; where many witnesses were examined for both parties, touching the comparative conveniences and inconveniences of <em>the </em>old and the new road; and it was somewhat doubtful, on which , side the weight of evidence (which was all stated on <em>the </em>record) preponderated. The order made by the circuit court, stated, that the judge of the court, from his own knowledge of the ground on which the old and the new road ran, was of opinion, that the judgment of the witnesses who preferred the old road, was founded on better reasons, than that of the witnesses who preferred the new road; and, therefore, the court affirmed the order of the county court. From this order of affirmance, <em>Crenshaw </em>appealed <em>to </em>this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants in <em>both the cases,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ash_\">said, 1. As to that of <em>Hollins </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>that however irregular the first proceedings might be, in which the county court, summarily, on <em>Hollins\u2019s </em>motion, ordered the new road to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>be established and the old one to be discontinued, it was not competent to that court to rescind the order, at a subsequent term: that the proper course for any person discontented with the alteration, would have been, to apply by petition to the court, to alter the road back again from the new to the old track; and this, he said, plainly resulted from the provisions of the statute. Upon such a petition, the court would have appointed viewers, and upon their report, summoned the proprietors of the land, awarded a writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>if desired by the proprietors, a.nd so proceeded regularly to hear and decide the controversy upon its merits. <em>2. </em>The main question, in the other case of <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>was a question of fact, depending on the evidence, which of the two roads was, all circumstances considered, preferable ? And he contended, that the evidence shewed, that the new road was preferable. The judge of the circuit court seemed to have thought the evidence for and against the alteration, in itself, nearly if not exactly equipollent; a.nd he decided the cause upon his own knowledge of the ground on which both roads ran. But the judge\u2019s imowJedge was matter of evidence, a.nd ought to have been given, like all the ether evidence, on oath.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-4\"><em>John Robertson, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap3\">maintained, 1. that the last order of the county court in the case of <em>Plollins </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>rescinding its first order by which the new road proposed by <em>Hollins </em>was established, was regular and right; for, lie said, the court had no jurisdiction to make an order altering a public road, when there was no cause or proceeding pending in court, in which any such order could be made; and as it was impossible for any person discontented with or aggrieved by this erroneous and unauthorized order, to prosecute a <em>supersedeas </em>or <em>writ of error </em>to correct it, because there was no party to the proceeding on the record but the applicant himself; thci:cfore, no alternative was left, but to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the order valid, illegal as it was, or to admit the competency of the county court to rescind it. <em>2. </em>As to the question of fact in <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>he said, it ought to be conclusive, that <em>both </em>the county and circuit <em>court, </em>judges of both of which were acquainted with the localities, and had the witnesses before them, held the old road preferable. In mill causes, where the testimony was doubtful, this court had always respected the concurring judgments of the county and circuit courts, tribunals sitting in the neighbourhood; <em>Home </em>v. <em>Richards, 2 </em>Call 507. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Moody, 4 </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>1. </em>18. The same principle, upon the like reasons, prevailed in road causes; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>5 Rand. 446. And as the opinions of the inferiour courts were respected, on the ground of the personal knowledge they were presumed to have opportunities of acquiring, it could be no objection to the order of the circuit court, that the judge stated, in express terms, his personal knowledge of the subject, as a ground of his decision.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b476-4\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ApU\">The orders, in both causes, are <em>to be </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
