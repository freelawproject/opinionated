The division of the slaves and stocks, as directed by the Will of <em>Thomas </em>Bolling, had not taken place during her life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">A Bill was filed in the Superior Court of Chancery for the Richmond District, by <em>William Robertson </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>his wife and <em>Rebecca Murray, </em>against the said <em>William Bolling </em>in his individual character, as executor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Thomas </em>Bolling, and also as executor of <em>Betty Bollings </em>the complainants claiming, as her residuary legatees, a moiety of all the slaves and stocks which were of the sa^ <em>Thomas Bolling at </em>the time of his death, together with the increase of the females, one half of the crops of the said lands in Goochland and Powhatan for the year 1818, together with the hires and profits of their moiety of the said shaves and stocks, until the same should he given up to them; and also an account of the profits of the joint estate during the life of the said Betty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-3\">On the 2d of July 1818, Chancellor Tayaor decreed^ {with a slight variation mentioned in the note,) according- to the prayer of the Bill; being of opinion that in so doing, he \u201crejected that construction of the Will of \u201c Thomas <em>Bolling </em>deceased which would render utterly \u201c useless, insensible and inoperative, that provision of the \u201c said Will which directs that all the testator\u2019s negroes \u201c and stocks in the Counties of Goochland and Powha- \u201c tan, should be, the December after his decease, equally \u201c divided between his wife <em>Betty Bolling </em>and his son \u201c <em>William Bolling, </em>and gave such a construction to the \u201c said Will as would render all it\u2019s parts sensible, con- \u201c sistont and operative.\u201d From this decree the defend\u00bb <em>\u2018f </em>ant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-4\"><em>Wickham </em>for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWFF\">Nothing hut a life in\u00bb tercst was given to Mrs. <em>Bolling </em>in the negroes. They were bequeathed for a particular object only. Whenever the trust is for a particular object, the estate is to be construed as commensurate with it, notwithstanding the words used by the testator would extend farther. She had the <em>use </em>only; not even the <em>estate </em>for life. <em>Cujus est </em>dare, <em>ejus est disponere. William Bolling </em>was to have a <em>right </em>to a moiety; hut <em>she </em>took only a <em>beneficiary </em>interest for a certain purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">The testator did not moan an equal division of the <em>slaves, </em>hut of their <em>profits. Cuibono? </em>Why should ho direct a <em>division </em>of the slaves, when they were still to be <em>kept together and worked on his estate? </em>The words, \u201c equally divided, the December after my decease,\u201d were intended only to point out the time when the wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>right to the moiety of the profits should commence. The time appointed fin* dividing the <em>stock </em>is the same. This shews that an <em>actual </em>division was not intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8e\">In construing a Will, words may be <em>rejected, </em>in order to give effect to the testator\u2019s intention,<footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The words, <em>ie </em>equally to be divided,\u201d have been held as giving only a tenantry in common, not as requiring actual division,</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahs\">The clause concerning the waggon and team fortifies my construction of the Will. The testator could not intend that the waggon and team should be divided: it was a <em>personal </em>privilege to the Wife, to continue during her life only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">Upon a <em>JL fa. </em>against Mrs. <em>Bolling, </em>tlie Sheriff could not have sold any of the negroes to be carried off the plantation. So, in the case of an execution against an individual partner, the partnership property can not be sold, in any other manner than \u00a1subject to the right of the other partners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">The <em>whole </em>Will must he taken together ; and, from the <em>nontext, </em>it appears, that no motive of convenicncy or propriety could induce the testator to give his Wife an absolute estate in these negroes. His son was the principal object of his bounty. It is obvious he considered the, negroes on the Goochland estate as not more than enough to cultivate it. Can it be doubted that, when he gave his son the land, he meant to give him the negroes also? No estate, in <em>remainder </em>is given to the <em>Wife, </em>but <em>all the rest and residue </em>to the, <em>son. </em>It is remarkable that, in all the devises to the, Wife, he gives a life estate only; shewing his wish to keep the property together.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-8\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the Appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnMi\">The testator, in the first clause of his will, gives his wife Ms landed estate in Chesterfield, called <em>Cobbs, </em>and the use, of the slaves, stocks, &amp;o. on that estate, <em>during her natural life: </em>thus evincing, that he well knew bow to limit <em>a life estate, </em>when he intended one; that he knew the difference between giving the <em>use </em>of property, and giving the <em>property itself </em>and that his attention was wide awake as to both those points. When, therefore, in the very next sentence, he directs, that his slaves, stocks, &amp;c. in <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan* </em>shall be equally divided between his wife and his son <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>William, without expressing what quantity or quality of estate either of them should take, can it be doubted, that he meant to give them both, an absolute estate in quantity an(* quality according to the legal import of the words? ; that, if he had intended to give his wife the <em>life estate </em>and the <em>use </em>only of <em>this </em>property, he would have so limited it in express terms ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-3\">Suppose this clause had stood alone; suppose there had been no residuary clause: would not the son have taken, by this clause, an absolute estate in <em>his </em>moiety ? The same words must give the wife the same estate in <em>her </em>moiety.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-4\">If the testator had intended to give his wife a life estate only, in the moiety of the slaves, &amp;c. in <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan, </em>why was he so particular in appointing tiie time when the division of that property should be made between the wife and the son? Why was a division directed at all? The will directs, <em>that it shall be equally divided between them, the December after the testator\u2019s death. </em>If the appellant\u2019s construction were correct; if a provision for the wife, <em>for her life only, </em>were here intended ; no such division at any period would have been necessary. The direct, simple, obvious method of effecting the purpose attributed to the testator by the appellant, would have been, to give his wife, for her life, a moiety of the profits of the whole of those estates, lands, slaves, and all. It seems to me impossible to reconcile this very particular direction for a division, with an intention to give his wife only a life estate, and only the <em>use </em>of the property; a <em>life interest </em>in the <em>profits </em>of these slaves, &amp;c., and not <em>an absolute estate </em>in a moiety of the <em>slaves themselves.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">In the- principal devise to this favorite son, the testator gives him his <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan </em>lands, <em>subject to the condition mentioned in the first clause of his will during the life of his </em>mother; that is, to his mother\u2019s right to work her moiety of the slaves on those lands, and to receive a moiety of the profits of both lands and slaves. Here again, the same subject is brought to his mind; here again, we might expect a limitation of the interest he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>gave bis wife, if such limitation was intended. But we find the interest given by the former clause to his wife, limited to a life estate with respect to the <em>lands </em>only, without any such limitation with respect to her interest in the <em>slaves, </em>&amp;c. If it ivas intended, that the son should have all those slaves, &amp;c. subject to the mother\u2019s life interest carved out of the son\u2019s absolute estate therein, why were not the <em>slaves, </em>&amp;c. as well as the lands, given to the son, <em>subject to Ms mother\u2019s life interest therein? </em>The testator does here, in effect, explain the first clause of the will; referring to it, as giving his wife a mere life interest in the <em>lands, </em>hut not as giving her a mere life interest in the <em>slaves, See.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-4\">It is argued, that the qualification, which limits the estate at <em>Cobbs </em>to the wife during her natural life, runs through the whole of that clause, and equally applies to and affects the estate given her in the <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan </em>slaves, &amp;c. This is a point to he determined by simple inspection. It is not to be elucidated by argument. Such an interpretation violates, at once, all the grammatical and all the legal rules of construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">It is thought highly improbable, nay impossible, that the testator should have intended to give his wife an absolute estate in <em>any </em>of his slaves or other personalty, and should have failed to give her such an estate in the <em>family servants, household furniture, See. </em>at <em>Cobbs, </em>the place of his and her residence: he gives her <em>only a life estate </em>in <em>this </em>property: therefore, it is inferred, he could not have intended to give her <em>more than a life estate </em>in the <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan </em>slaves, <em>See. </em>What were the testator\u2019s motives, it were as vain as it is needless to enquire. But it may be fairly supposed, that he had contracted a partiality for his family servants, his family pictures, his plate, even his furniture; and wished <em>that </em>property particularly to go to his favourite son, along with the family mansion, at his wife\u2019s death. It seems to me, indeed, more natural, that he should give his wife an absolute estate in the slaves on his distant estates in <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan, </em>than in the property at <em>Cobbs,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0xm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>If? as it is said, the wife took only a life interest in the <em>waggon and team and driver, </em>which are directed <em>to be kepi up, for the use of the plantation, and to transport necessaries io \u00ae\u00b0^s&gt; for Ihe wife\u2019s use, when she might think necessary to order it; </em>this can only operate, at most, as an exception of <em>the waggon and team and driver </em>from the general eifect of the preceding\u2019 bequest. But it is remarkable, that the testator was careful to add, that <em>this waggon and team and driver should not be considered as belonging to Cobbs. </em>'Why? If he meant, that the wife should have the <em>same estate </em>in the moiety of the <em>Goochland </em>and <em>Powhatan </em>slaves, as he had given her in those at <em>Cobbs; </em>if only a life estate was intended to be given her in both sets of slaves ; it was immaterial, whether the <em>waggon and team and driver </em>were to be considered as belonging to <em>Cobbs </em>orto <em>Bolling-Hall. </em>This careful discrimination, therefore, fortifies the construction of the will, for which the appellees contend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\"><em>Call </em>on the same side. The testator\u2019s intention is to be collected from his words, or by <em>necessary </em>inference from them. Speculative <em>suppositions </em>of what ho <em>may </em>have intended, are not to be resorted to. The words, <em>\u201c equally to be divided,\u201d </em>can not be got over, there being no other words in the Will to do away their eifect. Why did the testator direct a division of the <em>slaves </em>as well as of the profits, if he meant a division of the <em>profits only? </em>Take Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>construction, and the testator gave all to his son, and nothing to his daughters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\"><em>Wickham </em>in reply. Discarding nice grammatical disquisitions, the intention of the testator is evident, to give his wife a limited estate for a particular purpose. We are Confined to that purpose, and not authorised to go beyond it. The expression of one object is the exclusion of another. She had an estate <em>for life </em>in the Cobbs estate: she had a qualified interest, or use, only, for the same time in the Goochland estate. In hundreds of instances, the words, \u201c <em>equally to be divided,\u201d </em>do not signify an actual division; for instance, where a <em>single </em>slave is bequeathed to be equally divided. The testator never meant an equal division <em>in numero, </em>but to appoint the time when the equal interest of his wife and son in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>moieties should commence. Why should he intend <em>two </em>divisions;-first, of the slaves, and <em>afterwards, </em>of the profits ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANMZ\">Words <em>may </em>he rejected, to give effect to a testator\u2019s intention: yet \u00ed do not contend for <em>rejecting </em>the words, \u00ab equally to be divided the December after my decease.\u201d Their meaning is, to express the right of the wife to an <em>equal </em>interest, and to fix the time for it\u2019s commencement,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"AP26\"> Note The word <em>\u201c crops\u201d </em>is used in the Bill; the word p\u00a3 <em>profits\u201d </em>in the Pecree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AHH\"><em> </em>Doe <em>v.
