He took judgment, however, against <em>Glassel </em>only. The defendant filed a bill of exceptions, reciting the notice and execution, with the Sheriff\u2019s return, in <em>hsec verba; </em>and stating, that the defendants excepted to the same as improper, but that the District Court over-ruled the exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-12\"><em>Glassel, </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aq1x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad1K\">The question is, was the notice sufficient for the Court to give judgment against the appellant only ? A notice should he at least as particular as a declaration; and upon a joint declaration, the plaintiff could not cease to prosecute the suit against some of the defendants, and take judgment against the rest. This is a fault which the statute of <em>Jeofails </em>would not cure, and much less will that statute cure the error on a motion; to which the statute does not apply.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-5\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgL\">Was stopped by the Court; who held clearly that the notice was sufficient to warrant the judgment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Judgment affirmed. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">[* See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Stevenson's adm'r. </em>ante, 213.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
