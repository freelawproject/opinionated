The bill states, that the plaintiff\u2019s brother was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>sued in Philadelphia, for 240,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco. That the plaintiff and <em>Shore </em>and M\u2019Connico, became his security to Wilson, the creditor, for payment thereof. That the plaintiff conveyed property to <em>Shore </em>and M\u2019Connico, as counter-security. That payments were made, which reduced the debt to 70,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, and 2007 sterling on a protested bill. For which balance, suit was brought, judgment obtained, and an appeal taken to the General Court, where the judgment was affirmed in October, 1787. That the .plaintiff sold ten negroes, at vendue, and applied the amount to the discharge of the judgment, at which time the defendants advanced the plaintiff 20,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, worth <em>22s. per not., </em>which was likewise applied in payment of the judgment. That, for this advance, the plaintiff delivered the defendants two slaves (shoe-makers by trade) as'a security; and the defendants were to have the profits of them, for the use of the tobacco lent. That their profits were 20s. <em>per </em>week. That the deed was drawn by the defendant <em>Campbell; </em>and is, in form, an absolute conveyance, the'plaintiff believes, although intended only as a security. That, afterwards, the defendants, with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, sold a female slave and children, for 4,520 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco; and applied it towards re-payment of the loan; leaving a balance then due of 15,750 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, besides interest. That, on the day of the sale of the slaves, 30,135* <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, and 2077 sterling, was the balance due <em>Wilson: </em>who agreed, in consideration of the hardships the plaintiff labored under, that if the plaintiff paid the defendants the said balance by the day of , he would remit of the damages, on the affirmance of the judgment. Whereupon, the-plaintiff sold his blacksmith, but fell short of payment, 2,560 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, and 387 8s. With which payment, however, the defendants appeared satisfied, as by a statement of the judgments in <em>Wheeler\u2019s </em>writing; which <em>does not </em>mention the damages. That the plaintiff hoped the profits of the shoe-makers would have been applied to the discharge of this balance; especially, as the debt was assigned by <em>Wilson </em>to the defendants. That the defendants have issued execution against the plaintiff for tobacco, and will not remit the damages as <em>Wilson </em>had promised. Therefore, the bill prays, that an account may be taken of what is due on the judgments, and of the hire and profits of the slaves; that the damages may be remitted; and the defendants injoined from further proceedings; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The answer admits the judgment; but denying that the 20,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco was advanced on mortgage, insists that the defendants bought the shoe-makers absolutely, at 16,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, and the woman and children at 4,000. Refers to the bill of sale: admits the promise to the plaintiff, that, if he re-paid the tobacco in the course of the season, they would return the slaves; but insists that this was \u25a0no part of the original contract; and that they had positively refused to advance the tobacco on mortgage. That, if the slaves had died, they would have been the defendants\u2019 loss. That the defendants purchased with reluctance, and only to. serve the plaintiff. Admits the agreement to release the damages, and to take, in lieu thereof, 5 <em>Per cent, </em>provided the tobacco debt was fully discharged on or before the first of <em>May, </em>1788, and the sterling money debt, on or before the first of July, 1788; but states, that no part of the sterling debt was paid until January, 1789: Admits that the defendants are entitled to the benefit of the judgments; and alledges, that the complainant is indebted to them, on other accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\">A witness says, th\u00e1t some time after he had heard, from the plaintiff, that he had let the defendants have the use of the shoe-makers for an advance of 20,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, the deponent was in conversation with the defendant <em>Campbell, </em>who observed to him, that it was a kind of property he did not wish to lay his money out in; which conveyed to\u2019 the deponent an idea, that <em>Robertson </em>had a right of redemption, but there were no words respecting the instrument of writing, which secured their services. That the deponent\u2019s reason for thinking the bargain advantageous, was, that the plaintiff said, they produced 50/. <em>per annum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">Another witness says, that he was present at the bargain. That the plaintiff was to let the defendants have the use of the shoe-makers for an advance of 20,000 <em>lbs. </em>of tobacco. That he considered the plaintiff, notwithstanding the bill of sale, as having the right to redeem. That the value of the use of the slaves was estimated at 2O\u00ed. <em>per </em>week, or 52/. <em>per annum. </em>That, he understood the woman and children were to be sold in order to pay part of the balance due upon <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>judgment; but understood afterwards, that the plaintiff had consented, that the proceeds should be applied towards re-payment of the .20,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco. That the deponent being informed by the defendant <em>Campbell, </em>that the defendants were about to issue execution up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>on the judgments, he observed to them that as the balance was small, it was hard to exact damages; whereupon, <em>Campbell </em>observed, that <em>Robertson </em>and <em>Scott </em>were indebted to him, and he knew not how else to recover the money. That, in <em>January, </em>1789, the plaintiff paid, through <em>J. Barret, 2701. </em>on account of the judgment on the sterling debt. To a question put by the defendants, whether it was an absolute sale, he answered that the defendants did object to any but a positive conveyance, and possession of the negroes; although the deponent supposed, that was owing to the embarrassed situation of the plaintiff\u2019s affairs; that he does not recollect that any time of redemption was specified, but the defendants were to have the use of the negroes till that took place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-4\"><em>Barret </em>says, that being indebted to <em>Archibald Robertson, </em>he gave his bond to the defendants on the 10th of <em>January, </em>1789, for <em>3001. </em>with interest, which he understood, the defendants received, as a payment from <em>Archibald RoSertson, </em>on some account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">A fourth witness says, that the defendants, when they paid for the slaves, made a memorandum in their day <em>hook </em>that the plaintiff was to return the price paid for them in six months; and they, in the mean time, were to have the hire or value of their labor. That, the absolute right, as <em>per </em>bill of sale, in and to the said property, if the plaintiff failed so to do, was uniformly declared to be vested in the defendants. At least, the defendants said so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">A fifth witness says, that <em>Shore </em>and <em>M\u2019Connico </em>discharged 30,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco on account of <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>judgment, by the sale of the shoe-makers to the defendants. That, therefore, he does not think they or <em>Robertson </em>would have been affected by their deaths. That, the defendants refused to take a mortgage, through fear of a <em>Chancery </em>suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-7\">Several witnesses prove the value of the slaves, and their yearly profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-8\">The bill of sale was as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-9\"><em>u </em>Know all men by these presents, that I, <em>William Robertson, </em>in and for consideration of the quantity of twenty thousand weight of <em>Petersburg </em>crop tobacco, to mein hand paid and satisfied, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have this day-bargained, sold and delivered unto <em>James Campbell </em>and <em>Luke Wheeler, </em>four negroes, to wit; <em>Frank White </em>and <em>David </em>TVhite, shoe-makers by trade; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Fanny, </em>and her child at the breast.

The evidence of <em>M\u2019Connico </em>is conclusive as to this, and his deposition is strengthened by other testimony in the cause. If this evidence had been part of the bill of sale, there would have been no doubt; and the defendants\u2019 apprehensions of a suit in Chancery, which prevented its being inserted, rather strengthens the case. It may, perhaps, be said, that there was no covenant to redeem, or to re-pay the money; but, that would apply to most cases of mortgage; and the plaintiff would still have owed the money, like the case of alostpawn, <em>Co. Litt. </em>89; <em>[Anony. </em>] Salk. 552. Besides <em>Ross </em>v, <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 14, is decisive on the subject. The hire of the slaves was to go against the interest of the money; which is a mortgage expressly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqY\">But the contract was usurious. For, it was, as before stated, a contract for a loan; and the hire of the slaves was worth more than the interest of the money. <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>2 Dougl. [736.] The contingency was merely colourable ; which is <em>not </em>sufficient to take it out of the statute. 5 Co. 69, <em>Burton\u2019s </em>Case.

Treat. Eq. <em>263, [2 Am. </em>ed.;] 1 <em>Pow. </em>on Mort. <em>156. </em>In which respect it is less strong than the ease of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner. </em>1 Call 280, in this Court ; where one gave an instrument of writing to another, stating that he had received 30l, and had put a slave as a security into the hands of the other; who, if the money was not paid on or before a certain day, was to have the slave for 30/. This was held to be no mortgage, but a eonditional sale, and irredeemable. Such a construction is more reasonable, in the present case, because the defendants had no other security for the money; and, if the slaves had died, the debt would have been irretrievably lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">There is no pretence for saying that the contract was usurious; because the sale was absolute, and, but a mere indulgence to re-purchase allowed. Besides, the defendants did not loan any thing to the plaintiff; and, consequently, there could be no usury. For, in order to constitute usury, there must be a borrowing and a lending.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">The plaintiff not having paid the lesser sum in time, the defendants were entitled to the whole debt, and to the 10 <em>per </em>cent. damages also. This is the constant rule. For, unless the money is paid in time, the condition is forfeited, and the debtor has no equity or conscience on his side. But, the present case is stronger, because there was an express stipulation to that effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-10\">The defendants are entitled to interest on the 10 <em>per cent, </em>damages; because, it is a judgment; which is an ascertained sum. And <em>Robertson </em>and <em>Scott's </em>debt ought to be deducted, because the plaintiff was bound for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-11\">If the plaintiff were even entitled to redeem (which is denied) yet he would not have any right to an account of profits, because it was agreed, that they should go against the interest. At any rate, he would only have been entitled to the profits actually received, and not to such, as might have been made, by the greatest care. For, the defendants would not have been bound to use extraordinary attention: and the plaintiff might have put an end to the loss by payment of the money. 2 <em>Pow. </em>on Mortg. 272. Besides, those who come into equity for an account, must take it as they find it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Hay, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoS\">There is a striking difference between a mortgage and a conditional sale. <em>Pow. </em>on Mortg. 37; 2 <em>Fonb. </em>Treat.

Robert<em>son\u2019s </em>right, in the present case, was only that of a conditional sale. <em>For, the deed was absolute; </em>and, he had only a right to re-purchase. Although parol evidence may be received to explain an absolute deed, yet a mortgage will not readily be presumed against an absolute conveyance. 2 <em>Fonb. </em>Treat. Eq. 263. The answer denies, that it was a mortgage; and, <em>Pow. </em>on Mortg. 50, shews that the answer may be used to prove the nature of the agreement. The answer will prevail against a single' witness, although positive, which <em>M\u2019Connico </em>is not; for, he only states his opinion. . There was no disproportion in the price; but, if there was, that is nothing in a conditional sale. 1 <em>Vern. </em>268. The property was delivered in the present case; which differs it from that of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 17. There was no loan; for none is proved: and, it is not likely, that the defendants, who were merchants, would wish to lend, when they could have made greater profit on it, in the course of their business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-8\">If tobacco had risen, the defendants could not have insisted on a loan; and, therefore, the right would not have been reciprocal.

For, there the whole case was reduced to writing, and nothing concealed; which was a strong circumstance in favor of the purchaser. Besides, the full value was given in that case; but, not in this. 1 <em>Pow. </em>on Mortg. 156, w;as the case of a rent charge: and, the exception proves the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-12\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vulL</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-13\">PENDLETON, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AK1\">The first question in this case is, whether the transaction, between the parties, respecting the two negro shoe-makers put <em>into </em>the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>sion of the appellees fori, 600 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, is to be considered as a mortgage, or conditional sale ?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">That there is a difference between those modes of transfer, and that they produce different consequences, is certains- |Tn the case of a mortgage, the estate is at all times, \u2022redeemable, until a decree of foreclosure passes, or a dereliction of the right to redeem is presumed, from the length of time. In the other case of a conditional purchase, the time of performing the condition must be strictly observed. These rules are seldom controverted; but, the questions have generally been, to which class the transaction discussed belonged ? And, this must always depend, on the whole circumstances of the contract; and, is not confined to the mere written evidence of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Call, 280, the writing imported to be a mortgage, drawn by <em>Chapman, </em>an over-match for <em>Turner, </em>an uninformed planter, but the circumstances stated in the report of that case, abundantly shew, that a purchase, was the intention of the parties, and not the loan of money: Which <em>Turner </em>constantly refused; and purchased and paid his money under an agreement, only, that the slaves should be restored, on re-payment of the money, without interest, at the next <em>Hanover </em>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Chapman </em>did not then, or during his life, offer to return the money: but his widow after his death, and when the slave, who was a female, had two or three children, tendered the money, and demanded a redemption by her suit: which was justly determined against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On the other hand, in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>1 Wash. 14, although the bill of sale was absolute, as in the present case, yet, on the circumstances, it was decreed to be a mortgage, and <em>Norvell </em>let into a redemption upon the usual terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">It must often happen, in disquisitions of this sort, that there will be difficulty in drawing the line <em>between those </em>two sorts of conveyances. The great desideratum, which this Court has made the ground of their decision, is, whether the purpose of the parties was to treat of a purchase, the value of the commodity contemplated, and the price fixed? Or, whether the object was the loan of money, anda security or pledge for the re-payment, intended?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The former was the case in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Turner: </em>the latter, in <em>Ross </em>v. Norvell. Then, what is the present case? And what commenced the treaty between the parties? We hear not a word of purchasing slaves, nor any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>consideration had of the price, for which <em>Robertson </em>was willing to part with the property. On the contrary, <em>Wilson </em>states, that the 20,000/5s. tobacco, was the estimated value of the four slaves; importing, that the estimate was made, for the purpose of considering, whether they were a sufficient security? The real agreement was, that they should be a security only; that the woman and child should be sold, and the produce applied to discharge the debt; and, for the balance, that the two shoe-makers should remain with <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Wheeler, </em>and their profits applied to discharge the interest, until the balance should be re-paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Why then was the absolute bill of sale taken? The appellees furnish the answer: That it was the justice of this Court allowing redemption in case of a mortgage: An attempt, which the Chancery has constantly repelled, wherever it appeared, that the real contract was a mortgage, and - which, this Court 'have no difficulty in frustrating, upon the present occasion; allowing a redemption of the slaves, upon the usual terms; that is to say, that <em>Robertson </em>shall be charged with the principal and interest, and any other just demand, which <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>may have against him; and they to be accountable for the profits, really made by them, and no farther; unless, in the case of gross negligence to employ them.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The objection that <em>Campbell </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>risked the lives of the slaves, since they could not have recovered their money, if the slaves had died, was truly said to be, only another state of the question; which would, upon the evidence, have been decided in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"AXp\">The agreement to set the profits against the interest, since, on any view of the subject, they will appear greatly to exceed the legal rate of interest, is so far usurious and void; and the account is to be taken on the usual terms, where the mortgagee is in possession; to charge the profits <em>against </em>principal <em>and interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The remaining question respects the damages recovered upon the affirmance of the common law judgment in tobacco, which, in <em>April, </em>1788, were agreed to be remitted, on condition that the balance, with interest, was paid by the next month; or, as the appellees explain it, during the season.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">That the rule is, as stated by the counsel, <em>\u201c </em>that on an agreement to remit part of a debt, on condition the residue is paid within a certain time, the condition must be strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>performed,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is unquestionable; but surely the creditor may, by his consent, enlarge the time: which appears to have been done in the present case. This intention of keeping up the strictness, expressed by <em>Wilson, </em>was to be a <em>stimulus </em>to <em>Robertson, </em>to exert himself, in raising the money in time; and the creditors, discovering that he had done so, and probably made sacrifices to effect it, as it appears he did of 30/. in <em>Barrett\u2019s </em>bond, and he says he did in the sale of a valuable blacksmith, meant not to' insist on a forfeiture, although he had not fully completed the payment. Accordingly, we find, that as to the money on demand, they wholly remitted the damages, although the balance was not paid, until <em>November, </em>1794; and as to the tobacco, no damages are charged, but the balance with interest only, in <em>August, </em>1791; which amounted, then, to no more than 3,051 <em>lbs. </em>of the value of 34/. <em>6s. 5d. </em>In the same account, they state the damages of 10,837/65. tobacco, to stand conditionally: Intended, no doubt, to keep up the stimulus for payment of the balance; as they never could mean to make <em>Robertson </em>pay that enormous penalty, for his default, in paying less than a third of the sum: Or, if they did, a Court of Equity would sit to very little purpose, if they did not relieve against it, upon making just compensation. That compensation, in equity, is fixed, at the interest of the money, in cases of this sort; and not the profit, which they might have made, with the tobacco, by speculation in a basket of earthenware, or otherwise. Indeed, it appears that, in a conversation afterwards with a friend, who intimated, that it was hard to insist upon it, Mr. <em>Campbell </em>seemed to concede that it was; and then, as well as in his answer, said, that his view was, to cover, by that means, a doubtful debt, due from <em>Robertson </em>and <em>Scott. </em>That debt he will be allowed, in the account to be taken under the mortgage, which will remove the objection; and we think the damages ought to be wholly remitted, as they were in the case of the money, under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The decree is to be reversed with costs; and one, to the , following effect, entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court is of opinion, that although the writing, in the proceedings mentioned, purported to be an absolute bill of sale, yet, as the real intention of the parties, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>time of the contract, was a loan of the 20,000 <em>lbs. </em>tobacco, an&lt;^ t'lat ^le f\u00b0ur s^aves should be pledged, as a security the re-payment, the same ought to be considered as a mortgage, and the appellant let into a redemption of the two slaves, remaining unsold, upon the usual terms of his being made chargeable <em>for the 16,000 lbs. </em>tobacco and interest, and any other just debt,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for which he may be liable to the appellees: against which, he is to be allowed the profits really made of the slaves, by the appellees; and no further, except for the time in which they may have grossly neglected to employ them.
