That the parties should build three merchant mills on <em>Edmund\u2019s </em>land, if leave of court could be obtained for building three, if not, then one mill on the main stream, with as many pair of stones as the stream would suffice to work; and that the parties should contribute, each, one third of the expense of building the mill or mills, and when completed, should work the same jointly, and receive, each, one third of the profits, for the term of seventeen years from the date of the articles ; provided, that <em>Edmund Tait </em>should have' the whole profits of the grist mill for grinding indian corn. 2. That the parties should also, upon the same terms, erect a distillery or distilleries at the mills. 3. That <em>Edmund Tait </em>should be allowed the full value of all the work he had already done, and of all the materials he had collected for building a mill, which were to be used for building the mills on joint account; and should provide and furnish timber and stone from his lands for completing these mills, at certain rates specified in the articles. 4. That at the expiration of the term of seventeen years, if rebuilding of the mills should be necessary, it should be done at joint expense of the parties, and the mills should be delivered to <em>Edmund Tait </em>or his heirs, and the other two parties should be allowed a credit on final settlement of accounts for two thirds of the expense of such buildings : and also, on such final settlement, <em>Edmund Tait </em>should refund to the other two parties, two thirds of the expense of the buildings in the first instance. And by another agreement dated the 12th January 1814, <em>Deison, </em>with the consent of <em>Edmund Tail, </em>transferred all his interest to <em>Caleb Tait, </em>who undertook to reimburse to <em>Deison </em>what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>he had already contributed, and to perform all his en-<em>J L </em>gagements for the future; so that <em>Caleb </em>was now entitied to two thirds of the benefit, and subject to two thirds of the burden, and <em>Edmund to </em>the other third.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgL\">The par\u00bfes commenced the buildings, according to the articles, and built one merchant mill house at the lower seat where <em>Edmund </em>had previously made the dam. But in the spring or summer of 1814, there was a fresh in the creek, which broke the dam, and carried the mill house entirely away. The work, and the business of the partnership, were then abandoned, but whether owing to the fault of <em>Caleb Tait </em>or <em>Edmund, </em>was a controverted point in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">Shortly after the mill house had been carried away, <em>Edmund Tait </em>executed the following covenant to Caleb\u2014 \u201cI <em>Edmund Tait </em>have agreed to pay <em>Caleb Tait </em>the amount of his expenditures on the mills when the same is ascertained, within ten years from the present time. In witness whereof I have hereto set my hand and seal this 1st August 1814.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-9\">Before the expiration of the ten years mentioned in this covenant of the 1st August 1814, <em>Caleb Tait </em>died, and his administrator exhibited a bill against <em>Edmmd Tait, </em>in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>setting forth the facts above stated; and charging, that upon the destruction of the mill house by the fresh in 1814, his intestate, <em>Caleb Tait, </em>was desirous, and proposed, to rebuild the mill house, and proceed in the joint business, according to the articles of January 1813; but <em>Edmund Tait </em>refused to contribute to the rebuilding of the house, and the business was therefore abandoned; in consequence of which <em>Edmund Tait </em>executed the covenant to <em>Caleb, </em>of August 1814, binding himself to pay <em>Caleb </em>the amount of his expenditures on the mill, when the same should be ascertained, within ten years: that, in order to ascertain the amount of <em>Caleb Tail's </em>expenditures, which would be payable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>him according to the last mentioned covenant, the plaintiff had endeavoured to procure a settlement of the joint accounts of expenses, while the witnesses and evidence were in existence, by which the items of the accounts, on both sides, could be proved and ascertained; but <em>Edmund Tait </em>refused to make any settlement of the accounts; and now denied, that he was bound to reimburse to the estate of <em>Caleb, </em>the amount of expenditures contributed by him to the building of the mill. The bill, therefore, prayed an account of <em>Caleb Tait\u2019s </em>expenses incurred in' the joint or partnership business, so as to ascertain the sum which would be due to his estate from <em>Edmund Tait, </em>under <em>Edmund\u2019s </em>covenant of August 1814.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-3\"><em>Edmund Tait, </em>in his answer, said, That upon the destruction of the mill house by the fresh in 1814, he earnestly insisted on rebuilding the house, and proceeding in the partnership business according to the articles of January 1813, and that <em>Caleb Tait </em>refused to contribute his proportion of the expense of rebuilding, and to proceed in the execution of the contract, unless <em>Edmund </em>would give him ample real security to reimburse to him his proportion of such expenditures, at the expiration of the term of seventeen years; that he, <em>Edmund Tait, </em>being nowise bound by the articles to give any such security to <em>Caleb, </em>refused to comply with this unreasonable demand; and thereupon <em>Caleb </em>refused to contribute any portion of the expense of rebuilding the mill, and abandoned the contract. And the defendant insisted, that, under these circumstances, he was not bound by the articles of January 18.13, to reimburse to <em>Caleb Tait\u2019s </em>estate, any part of the expenses contributed by him in building the mill which had been destroyed, and thus wholly lost to both parties; but that the joint accounts ought to be settled, each party credited for his advances, and each charged with his proportion of the burden. As to the covenant of 1814, the defendant al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>leged, that that covenant had been obtained from him by <em>Caleb Tait, </em>by fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation; that <em>Caleb Tait </em>had the articles of January x 1813 in his possession, and falsely represented to <em>Edmuni, </em>that he was bound by the terms thereof, to pay <em>Caleb </em>the amount of his expenditure in building the mill house, though the house was destroyed immediately after it was erected, and though <em>Caleb </em>refused to join in rebuilding it without real security for ultimately reimbursing him his proportion of the expenditure; and, therefore, that <em>Caleb\u2019s </em>administrator was not entitled, in ' equity, to avail himself of the covenant of August 1814.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">There were depositions taken and filed to prove, that, upon the destruction of the mill house by the fresh in 1814, <em>Edmund Tait </em>was desirous to rebuild it, and to proceed in the execution of the articles, and required of <em>Caleb, </em>that he should contribute his proportion of the expense of rebuilding; but this <em>Caleb </em>refused to do, unless <em>Edmund </em>would give him real security for the reimbursement to him, at the expiration of the term of partnership, of the amount of his expenditures; and <em>Edmund </em>refusing to comply with this demand for security, the contract and the joint business was abandoned. But there was, in the opinion of this court, no proof of any fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation on the part of <em>Caleb Tait, </em>to procure from <em>Edmund </em>the covenant of August 1814; and so far from the fact being that <em>Caleb </em>had possession of the articles of January 1813 (as alleged in the answer), it appeared, that those articles had been deposited in the clerk\u2019s office of the county court of <em>Campbell, </em>and so were equally open to the inspection of both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-8\">The chancellor made an interlocutory decree, declaring, that, under the circumstances of the case, as disclosed by the evidence, <em>Edmund Tait </em>was not further or otherwise bound by the covenant of August 1814, than he was by the terms of the articles of January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>1813; and referring the accounts between the parties to a commissioner, to be settled and adjusted according to those articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-3\">There were three reports made by the commissioner. Upon exceptions taken to the first and sec.ond, they were successively recommitted. In the third report, the commissioner first ascertained the amount of the advances and expenditures of each party, in the business of building the mills; and then charged <em>Caleb Tait </em>with two thirds of <em>Edmund's </em>advances, and credited him with one third of his own: and it resulted from the accounts, stated on this principle, that <em>Caleb Tait's </em>estate was indebted to <em>Edmund Tait, </em>in a balance of 80 dollars. There were many exceptions to the details of the account, and the principle was earnestly contested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\">The chancellor approved the report; and the defendant waiving an account of the assets of <em>Caleb Tait's </em>estate, in order to ascertain whether the plaintiff, his administrator, should be charged with the balance reported against him, and being willing to accept a decree for his costs only, the bill was, therefore, dismissed with costs. From this decree, the plaintiff applied, by petition to this court, for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-7\">Brockenbrough, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AuH\">The first question is as to the proper construction of the articles. <em>Caleb Tait </em>and <em>Charles Deison </em>were to unite with <em>Edmund Tait </em>in erecting mills on the land and stream of the latter; when built, they were to share equally the profits for seventeen <em>years; </em>at the end of which term, the mills were, if necessary, to be rebuilt at their equal and joint expense, and delivered to <em>Edmund Tait; </em>and he was then bound to refund to the other two, the two thirds of the whole expense incurred in rebuilding them, and two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>thirds of the expense of the original building. The parties did not provide for the event which subsequently occurred, of the destruction of the building by the flood. Soon after these articles were executed, <em>Deison </em>transferred all his interest in the subject to <em>Caleb Tait. </em>And after the destruction of the mill which was built, the two brothers were each bound to the other, to put up the buildings, and to have them there at the end of the seventeen years, then to be delivered into the exclusive possession of <em>Edmund Tait.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">It seems to me, that, according to the plain meaning of these articles, the right of <em>Caleb Tait </em>to reimbursement of the two thirds of the expense incurred in erecting, and in renewing the buildings, did not attach till the end of the term; and not then, unless the buildings should be delivered to <em>Edmund Tait, </em>or unless <em>Caleb </em>being willing and offering to rebuild, should be prevented by <em>Edmund </em>from rebuilding. The object of <em>Edmund </em>was to have the mills built on his land, by the joint contribution of the other two and himself, to have a partnership in the milling business for the specified term, and, at the end of it, to have the exclusive interest and possession of the mills in himself. As he was then to have such exclusive possession, he was bound by the contract to pay to his brother the two thirds of the whole expense of erecting, and re-erecting them. But if, from any cause, the exclusive possession of the mills should not be'given to him at the end of the term, why should he pay for more than his own share of the expense of the first, or any other erection ? In the event that the mills should be delivered to him at the end of the term, each party would be benefited according to the original intention, of the contracting parties; he would have his mills, and they would have their share of the price of erecting them. In the event of the destruction of the mills, and the abandonment of the intention- of rebuilding them, the loss of each would be equal: each would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>lose the sum advanced for the erection. At the end of the term, <em>Edmund </em>would lose his own share of the expense of erection, and the advantage of the use of a mill in operation; <em>Caleb </em>would lose his share of the la-hour and materials employed in the erection. But if the articles are so construed, that <em>Caleb </em>shall be paid for his labour and materials, although the mills are not rebuilt, then the whole loss would fall on <em>Edmund, </em>the other sustaining no part of it. This would be unequal and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">Although such is my construction of the articles, in which, it seems, 1 differ from my brethren, yet 1 am satisfied that it was competent for these parties, after the <em>loss </em>happened, to make a compromise, to construe the contract in their own way, and adjust the loss according to their own ideas of right. It appears that this was done. <em>Edmund Tail </em>agreed, by solemn instrument, to pay to <em>Caleb </em>the amount of his expenditures, when the same should be ascertained, within ten years from the time of the agreement. The bill alleges, that <em>Caleb, </em>after the loss, offered to proceed with the rebuilding, but that <em>Edmund, </em>being much discouraged by the loss, refused to proceed any further, and on thus abandoning the contract, promised to repay him his expenditures, and in compliance with that promise, executed the instrument of August 1814. The answer positively denies, that <em>Edmund Tait </em>refused to proceed with the building; and, on the contrary, avers, that <em>Edmund </em>required <em>Caleb </em>to go on with the buildings, which <em>Caleb </em>refused, except on inadmissible terms. There is some evidence to support this allegation of the answer, but I think it is not sufficient to outweigh the evidence of <em>Edmund\u2019s </em>own solemn obligation, unless indeed that obligation can be impeached. This is attempted by the defendant; for, in his answer, he charges, that the bond was obtained by false and fraudulent misrepresentations ; but in the proof of this charge he has totally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>failed; there is not the slightest evidence to prove that it was so procured. The bond then being unimpeached, I hold it to b.e satisfactory evidence to prove, either that <em>Edmund </em>construed the articles as imposing on him the duty of repaying to his brother his expenditures on the erection, or that he had determined to abandon the milling project, and would not permit the building to go on. In the first alternative, if he gave a wrong construction to the articles, as I suppose, he is still bound by his obligation, for it was founded on a mistake of the law, and not of the facts: in the other alternative, that of abandonment, he was clearly hable. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded, for further proceedings.</p>\n<author id=\"b178-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">I differ entirely from the chancellor on the main points in the cause. It seems to me, that by the articles between the parties of January 1813, it was intended, that the partnership, as to joint profit, should commence with the grinding of the mills; the building and the expenses thereon incurred, were mere preparation for this. The land and mill seat.belonging to <em>Edmund, </em>the other parties were to share the profits with him for seventeen years, and then the concern was <em>to </em>cease; the property to remain with the owher, and the other partners to receive the moneys they had expended, whether in the original erection or subsequent rebuilding of the mills. The same, I presume, would have been the consequences, if the parties, before the end of the term, had at any time dissolved the partnership, without making a particular provision for them. A fresh swept away their mill house as soon as it was completed. This seems to have been an accident unprovided for in the articles. Whose should be the loss ? His, I think, who owned the property. Every man is the insurer of his own houses, unless he gets them insured. I do not think these articles made the partners the insurers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The risk was one to which the mills were known to be liable, and no provision is made against it. This it <em>seems to me is </em>the fair construction of the contract. If when the house was destroyed, <em>Edmund </em>insisted on rebuilding, and a continuance of the adventure, and <em>Caleb </em>refused, an action for damages, or a bill for specific ex-ecutionj was the course. Neither of these was taken; but instead of this, the brothers agree to adjust the matter by abandoning the scheme, and <em>Edmund </em>executes to <em>Caleb </em>his obligation to repay him the amount of his expenditures on the mills, when the same are ascertained, within ten years. Herp, then, is to my mind, a clear construction given to the articles by the parties themselves, who must have understood, <em>better </em>than all the world besides, what they themselves meant in the contract; and unless this obligation be impeached in some way, I hold that no human tribunal can touch it. The answer states, that it was obtained by fraudulent contrivance and imposition, <em>Caleb </em>withholding the articles, and misrepresenting them to <em>Edmund. </em>This is a charge which would require strong proof to sustain it: The record furnishes none; not the slightest. We do not find even, that <em>Caleb </em>had possession of the articles; they seem to have <em>been </em>in the clerk\u2019s office of the county court, equally accessible to both parties. This view of the case seems to me decisive. I think the decree should be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b179-5\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ayf\">The appellee in this case, being the owner of a mill seat, entered into a contract with his brother, the appellant\u2019s'intestate, and. another person, for the erection of mills and other water works. By this agreement, each party was to advance one third of the expenses of erection, and they were then to hold the property in partnership for seventeen years, receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>equal portions of the profits. At the end of that period, the property was to be given up to the appellee, who was to refund to the other parties, all these advances for the original erection, or for any re-erection which might be rendered necessary; the parties distinctly engaging, that at the expiration of the term, if rebuilding should be necessary it should be done at their joint expense. In pursuance of this contract, one mill was erected, but it was swept off by a fresh within a short <em>lime; </em>which seems to have discouraged the parties, and to have suspended further operations. <em>Caleb Tait, </em>the intestate of the appellant, had bought out the interest of the third party <em>Deison; </em>and the appellee contends, and I think it is proved, that he refused to make advances for the rebuilding, except upon condition of receiving security to refund; a term which he certainly had no right to introduce into the contract. It is now contended, that he is not entitled to recover his advances for the original building, but that in consequence of the abandonment of the contract, he must now be considered as a <em>partner </em>in the original erection, absolutely bound for one third of the expenses, and without a right to reclamation, except for any excess he may have advanced, over and above his own proportion, and that of <em>Deison </em>whose interest he had bought out. I cannot perceive any foundation for this pretension.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It cannot be denied, that if <em>Caleb Tait </em>had strictly complied with his engagements, and had advanced two thirds of the funds for the rebuilding, he would, at the end of seventeen years, have been entitled to recover back not only those two thirds, but two thirds also of the expense of the original construction of the mill that was swept away; thus clearly shewing, that losses by flood or otherwise, were to fall upon <em>Edmund Tait, </em>the owner of the estate, and not upon the other partner; except that he would lose the profits of his adventure, and receive no interest on his advances for seventeen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>years. Now, if tlxis was the character of the original contract, it surely cannot he contended, that, by a failure to fulfil it on the part of <em>Caleb Tait, </em>this whole character was changed, and he was made liable to bear a loss which never was contemplated to be borne by him. If he broke his contract, he was liable to the action of <em>Edmund Tait, </em>who might recover such damages as he could shew he had sustained; but it does not follow that, by the breach, he is to forfeit his right to recover back those advances, to which he would have had an unquestionable right, if he had fulfilled his contract. The ca.se is, in this regard, precisely within the principle of <em>Pordage </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>1 Saund. 320. c. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Weldon, </em>3 Rand. 71. and <em>Bream </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>4 Leigh 21. If it were otherwise,\u2014if the recovery of the first advances was to depend upon the complete fulfilment of the engagement to make the further advance,\u2014then the failure to the amount of one dollar, would exclude <em>Caleb Tait </em>from a right to recover back any thing; and thus, the penalty on him might be thousands of dollars, while the loss to <em>Edmund Tait </em>would have been only the loss of the use of one dollar. To avoid such flagrant injustice, these covenants would have been construed independent, even if they had been otherwise in form. But, in tru th, they are not dependant even in form; and if at the end of seventeen years, <em>Caleb Tail </em>had sued for his original advances, it would not have been necessary that he should have averred a fulfilment, of the contract for advances for the rebuilding of the mill. In this view of the case, it is obvious, that, whether the subsequent bond had been given by <em>Edmund Tait </em>or not, <em>Caleb Tait </em>would have been entitled to recover back his original advances. But this bond, which appears to me entirely free from the imputation of fraud or circumvention, has definitively settled the rights of the parties. The difference between them under the original articles, was terminated by it; <em>Edmund Tail </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>agreeing to pay to <em>Caleb </em>the amount of his expendiS <em>, </em>, \u25a0, , , , , . 1 tures on the milis (when the same should be ascertained) within ten years, without any stipulation for interest in the mean time. By this obligation, <em>Edmund </em>became no farther bound than he was before, except in so far as the repayment of the advances is accelerated by it. Of this acceleration, <em>Edmund </em>does not complain. He complains of being bound to pay at all. The motives for fixing upon ten years, we cannot penetrate, nor \u2019is it necessary. It was, probably, a compromise between the brothers, <em>Edmund </em>insisting on further advances, and <em>Caleb </em>refusing to make them without security. In this state of things, they seem to have abandoned the scheme, and to have fixed upon the terms of adjustment evidenced by the bond. It must, therefore, be respected as a settlement of their differences, and its terms must be enforced accordingly. At first, I doubted,- however, whether the bill was not prematurely filed, as the ten years had not expired at the commencement of the suit. But on reflection, I think the reasons assigned in the bill, and the terms of the bond, are sufficient to justify the proceeding. The bond contains an implied promise to account, at a period anterior to the expiration of the ten years, which may <em>properly be </em>enforced in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the decree should be reversed, and the cause sent back for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
