The fourth count charged, that the defendant, in consideration that the plaintiff \u201chad given unto him an obligation of him the plaintiff, promising to assign, transfer and deliver to the said defendant or his order, on the fifteenth day of <em>June, </em>in the same year, the sum of five thousand dollars of the funded debt of the <em>United States </em>of <em>\u2019America, </em>bearing an annual interest of six <em>pdr </em>centum, commonly called six <em>per cent, </em>stock, undertook and faithfully promised,-on receiving the said sum of five thousand dollars of the funded debt of the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>hearing an annual interest of six <em>per centum, </em>agreeably to the obligation aforesaid, to pay to the said plaintiff, or his order, the sum of six thousand <em>Spanish </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>milled dollars, or the value thereof in gold; and the plaintiff in fact saith, that he, on the said fifteenth day of June, in the year aforesaid, at the town aforesaid, offered^ to the said defendant the said sum of five thousand dollars of the funded debt' of the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>bearing an annual interest of six <em>per centum per annum, </em>agreeable to the obligation aforesaid, and offered that the same should be assigned and transferred to him, <em>or </em>his order, and required him to perform his promise aforesaid; and the said defendant then and there refused to receive the said sum of five thousand dollars <em>six per cent, </em>stock aforesaid, and refused that the same <em>should be </em>transferred <em>to him. </em>\u201d The declaration then concludes with assigning a general breach, in the following words: \u201c Nevertheless, the said defendant, though often afterwards required to perform his said several promises aforesaid, and still doth refuse to perform them and each of them, to his damage three hundred pounds, and therefore he brings suit, and so forth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABi\">The defendant prayed <em>oyer </em>of the writing, and then plead <em>non assumpsit </em>to the first, second and third counts; on which the plaintiff took issue: and, as to the first count, the defendant further plead, \u201cthat the plaintiff did not assign, transfer and deliver to him, or his order, the sum of five thousand dollars of the funded debt of the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>bearing an annual interest of six <em>per centum per annum, </em>commonly called <em>six per cent, </em>stock, agreeably to his said obligation.\u201d And, as to the fourth count, the defendant demurred, 1. Because the plaintiff did not alledge that he offered to assign and transfer the said 5,000 dollars of the funded debt at the <em>Treasury of the United States, </em>or at the <em>Office of the Commissioner of Loans. 2. </em>Because the tender set forth in the declaration was informal and insufficient. 3. Because it is not averred that the plaintiff had a right to assign and transfer the said 5,000 dollars of the funded debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">The plaintiff, as to the second plea to the first count \u2022 says, that he on the 15th of <em>June, </em>1793, at the <em>town aforesaid, </em>offered to the defendant \u201cthe said sum of five thousand dollars of the funded debt of the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>bearing an annual interest of six <em>per </em>centum, agreeable to the obligation aforesaid, and offered that the same should be assigned and transferred to him, or his order, and then and there required the defendant to perform his promise aforesaid; and the defendant then and there refused to receive the said sum of five thousand dollars six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>per cent. </em>stock aforesaid, and refused that the same should be transferred to him.\u201d Then follows an entry in these words: by <em>e&lt; </em>consent of the parties, the declaration is amended to the fourth count, <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the demurrer filed withdrawn. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">The defendant demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s replication aforesaid to the second plea to the first count. 1. Because it appeared by the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing, that the offer to transfer was made at the town of <em>Alexandria, </em>and not at the <em>Treasury of the United States, </em>or at <em>the Office of the Commissioner of Loans. 2. </em>Because it appears by the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing, that he hath not performed what he ought to have done, in order to entitle him to hiaction against the defendant. 3. That it is not averred, that the plaintiff had a right to transfer the said 5,000 dollars of the funded debt. The plaintiff joined in the demurrer. The <em>Hustings </em>Court decided in favor of the plaintiff upon the demurrer, and awarded a writ of enquiry of damages. The jury found 159/. damages; and the <em>Hustings </em>Court gave judgment for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The defendant appealed to the District Court, where the judgment of the <em>Hustings </em>Court was affirmed; and from the judgment of affirmance the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">The case was argued at a former term, by Marshall, for the appellant, and Lee, for the appellee; when <em>the </em>judgment of the District Court was reversed: but, that judgment<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> was set aside during the same term, and the cause continued for another argument.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-8\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-9\">The declaration does not shew a sufficient cause of action. It does not shew, with sufficient certainty, that the defendant accepted the plaintiff\u2019s obligation, without which, there was no consideration: but, if it did, still the plaintiff has not entitled himself to what he claims; for, the mere offer to transfer was not enough. <em>[Shales </em>v. <em>Seignoret] </em>1 Ld. Raym. 440; <em>[Lancashire </em>v. <em>Killingworth, </em>Ib.] 686, 12 Mod. 529, S. C. Therefore, the plaintiff having omitted to shew a performance on his part, has not stated a sufficient ground of action against the defendant. But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the declaration must shew a sufficient cause of action, or plaintiff cannot recover. 5 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 332; <em>[Gwil. </em>ed.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A34\">Nothing, then, can sustain the declaration, unless the replication has aided it; which has been supposed, inasmuch as it is said that the declaration and replication may be incorporated together, so as to make one plea. But, this cannot be done; because it would be a departure: For, it is a distinct matter which is set forth in the replication, from that which is contained in the declaration; and this; according to all the authorities, is a departure. It is-a variation from the title, which the plaintiff had once insisted on; and, therefore, is expressly within the definition and principles laid down in 3 <em>Black. </em>Com. 310, and 5 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 449. The instances there put illustrate and confirm it. Thus, in the case of the assize, where the tenant pleads a descent from his father and gives colour, the demandant entitles himself by a feoffment from the tenant himself, the tenant cannot say that the feoffment was on condition and shew the condition broken; for, it would be a departure, as containing matter new and subsequent to that of his bar: which is a case in- point, and proves that the subsequent matter contained in the replication, was a departure in the present case. This doctrine is supported by <em>[Palmer </em>v. <em>Stone </em>et al.] 2 Wils. 98; and, in short, there is not a single authority which does not go to shew the same thing; and to prove incontestably,- that the new matter, introduced into the replication here, was a departure from the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-5\">So that, if it were even true, that a declaration and replication can be incorporated, it would not assist in the present case. But, there is no case which goes to prove that such incorporation can be made. For, that would be to allow every bad and insufficient declaration to be amended by the' replication: and in short, every bad prior plea to be amended by the subsequent. So, that the series would be infinite; and the <em>endless altercation, </em>spoken of by the books, and which the doctrine of departure was established to prevent, would be introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP\">But, there is another fatal objection in this case; namely, that no <em>assumpsit </em>is laid in the declaration. For, the mere recital of the note was not sufficient. The <em>assumpsit, </em>which tff\u00ae law raiRed, ought to have been averred: Because, the promise is the very <em>gist </em>of the action; and, therefore, should be stated. <em>[Buckler </em>v. <em>Angell,] </em>1 Lev. 164; <em>[Lea </em>v. <em>Welch,] </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1516; <em>[Winston\u2019s ex\u2019r. v. </em>Fran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>cisco,] 2 </em>Wash. 187. Which last case is an express authority to the very point; and the same doctrine was after-wards held in the case of <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>1 Call, 83, in this Court. If the <em>English </em>books of practice be consulted, no form will be found which omits an averment of the implied promise. So, that as well upon the authority of adjudged cases, as upon the forms in use, it is clear that the failure to state the assumpsit is an incurable error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">But, the judgment is erroneous upon another ground. There were two pleas to the first count; the first a general plea of <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the second a special plea. Upon the former, the parties were at issue; and notwithstanding this, the Court, on over-ruling the demurrer, have proceeded-to enquire of the damages, without trying, or otherwise disposing of the issue upon a good and sufficient bar: Which is manifest error; because the defendant had a right to insist on having his plea tried.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-9\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-10\">The declaration and replication may he incorporated together and taken as one plea. For, all the pleadings of the party, is but one exposition of his case. The replication operated like an amendment to the declaration, and might supply the omission and deficiencies in that. <em>[Alsope </em>v. <em>Sytwell,] </em>Yelv. 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-11\">The replication is not a departure from the declaration: Because, it is every way consistent with it; and may be said to grow out of it. For, the declaration charges a general offer of performance on the part of the plaintiff; and the replication only extends the allegation and shews how he offered to perform. It is, therefore, within the reason of all the cases upon pleadings; which admit that the replication may explain the generality of the count. 5 Com. Dig. 438. Besides, the plea here, rendered the replication necessary, because it denied the transfer; which denial was true; and, therefore, the plaintiff was obliged to confess and avoid, or the bar would have precluded him. It is, therefore, within the reason of the doctrine of new assignments: Which were never held to be a departure, merely because they stated a new fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-13\">It is not true, that because additional matter is added, it is, therefore, necessarily a departure. On the contrary, even surplusage, although containing additional matter, is not <em>[Duffield </em>v. <em>Scott </em>et al.] 3 T. R, 376: Which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>shews that every thing consistent with the declaration may <em>he </em>united to it, and the rest rejected. The case in <em>2 </em>Wils. 8, <em>[Long </em>v. <em>Jackson,] </em>explains the nature of departures, and was a stronger case than this; because there, the defendant might have taken issue on the replication; but here it was absolutely necessary to answer the defendant\u2019s bar; and a necessary answer to the opposite plea is never considered as a departure. 5 <em>Com. </em>Dig. 438.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-3\">The replication contains a sufficient cause of action; because, the offer to transfer was enough, when the defendant refused to accept. For, the case is very different from that in <em>Ld. Raym. </em>440; because, here the offer was to the defendant himself, which the Court in that case allowed would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\">There is a sufficient <em>assumpsit </em>laid; because the note itself contains an express promise; and, it is immaterial how the promise is stated, provided it be laid at all; For, the only object in stating it, is to shew that there was an agreement to pay. But, no particular set of words is required. It is wholly immaterial what expressions are used, if the agreement be actually shewn. But you cannot render the agreement more certain by any other form, than by a recital of the very words of it; which, as the end of all pleading, is only to inform the adversary with what he is charged, is <em>the </em>least exceptionable mode, and most certainly effects the desired object. The case of <em>Buckler </em>v. <em>Angell, </em>1 Lev. 164, does not oppugn these observations; because, in that case there was no express promise stated; and for want of it the declaration was nonsense. The same observation applies to <em>2 Ld. Raym. </em>1516; and perhaps, in both cases, the omission at this day would be considered as a mere <em>vitium clerici, </em>not affecting the judgment. There is probably some omission in the statement of the case of <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Francisco, 2 </em>Wash. 187; but at any rate, there was no recital of an express promise in that ease, as there is in this; nor did the replication there repeat the promise as it does here. For, if it had, the recital would have been sufficient. <em>Euer\u2019s </em>Plead. 45. As to the case of <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>the failure to lay an assumpsit was not the ground of decision there; but the omission to aver what sum the other daughters received. In short, after stating the express promise, it never can be necessary to repeat the assumpsit which the law raises. For what purpose should this be done? No use can result from it; and it would only tend to create a redundancy of words, and to fill the record with needless repetition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>As to the last point, relative to the enquiry of damages, without trying the issue; it does not appear that the defendant asked for a trial; and his omission to do so, must be considered as a waiver of the plea of <em>non </em>assumpsit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-4\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-5\">The case in <em>Yelv. </em>18, does not apply, because the replication there would have pursued the declaration; but here the foundation of the action is the refusal in the defendant to take the stock; and that is no where stated before in the declaration. For, the declaration merely is, that the plaintiff offered to perform all the things on his part to foe performed, and says nothing of the refusal; Which is not drawn forth in the replication by any thing contained in the plea of the defendant; which in fact was but a mere denial of the declaration. None of the cases cited by the appellee\u2019s counsel, come up to this, which was a clear departure. For, it introduced new matter, without any necessity for it from the adversary pleadings. The form of declaring in <em>England, </em>is, to state the promise which the law raises, although the promise in the contract he previously stated. 1 Rich. Prac. <em>K. B. </em>119. And the cases cited before, particularly that of <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Francisco, 2 </em>Wash, completely prove that <em>it </em>must be so laid. <em>There </em>was no necessity for the defendant\u2019s asking for a trial of the issue; because the plea stood upon the record; and the Court ought to have taken notice of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">Call. In the form in 1 Rich. Prac. it was necessary to lay the second promise, as the plaintiff' counted on the statute; for, if he had counted at Common Law, he must have shewn the consideration of the note. Therefore, the second promise laid in that declaration was the <em>assumpsit </em>which the statute raised; and without which, he could not have recovered. But here was not the same necessity; because there is a good consideration expressed in the note itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Cur. adv. mlt.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-12\"> It \u00bf\u00a102s not appear in the record, that any thing farther two ever done, as to the Kinendjnen\u00ed* ,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ALm\">[\u2020For that <em>judgment,seepost, </em>[375.]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b59-8\">PENDLETON President, \u25a0</author>\n<p id=\"AfK\">delivered the resolution of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The objection to the declaration for want of laying a promise directly, if stirred by the counsel oa the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>argument, does not appear in our notes. We know it was not considered by the Court; but the case was decided upon other points which are unnecessary to be considered if this be against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The declaration is, that the defendant <em>made the </em>note, which it recites in <em>hsec verba, </em>without alledging any other promise, than that contained in the note itself; and the question is, whether, independent of the act of Parliament in <em>England </em>and of our. act of Assembly (neither of which apply,) an action on the case will lie on a promissory note singly, without adding a promise ?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The cases produced, and two othei\u2019s coming more directly to the point, <em>Clerke </em>v. <em>Martin, (2 </em>Ld. Raym. 757,) and <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Souter </em>in the same book, 774, prove that it will not: but that the declaration must lay an <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>according to the form in the Attorney\u2019s Practice in the <em>K. B. </em>and give the note in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Although it is difficult to justify the rationality of this opinion, yet since it is the law, and as such has been recognized by this Court in former cases, it ought not to be stirred again. For my own part, I can yield to it, without reluctance, as a point of little consequence in this country, where an action of debt is usually brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">This count in the declaration then, is bad; and judgment is to be entered for the defendant upon the demurrer. But what is to be the consequence ? Is a final judgment to be entered for the defendant, as if this was the only count, when there are three others, on which there has been no decision by Court or jury ? Or shall our en- \u2022 try be, that the plaintiff take- nothing by this count, but the defendant as to that, go without day, and recover his costs occasioned thereby; and that the cause be remanded for further proceedings on the other three counts, so as to enable the plaintiff to recover, if he can support his action upon either of them ?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Our present impressions are, that the latter is the proper mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">The following judgment was afterwards entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">\u201cThe Court is of opinion, that the judgment of the said District Court is erroneous. Therefore it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled, &amp;e. and this Court proceeding to give such judgment, as the said District Court ought to have given, is of opinion that the judgment of the said Court of <em>Hustings </em>is erroneous, in this, that the law is for the appellant on the demurrer joined to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>replication of the appellee, to the appellant\u2019s plea put into the first count in the appellee\u2019s declaration, which as to that count is insufficient to maintain the appellee\u2019s action. Therefore it is further considered, that the said judgment be also reversed, and that the appellee take nothing by the said first count, &amp;c\u201e And the cause is remanded to the said District Court for further proceedings to be had therein as to the other counts contained in the declaration.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\">[* See <em>Wooddy </em>v. <em>Flournoy, </em>6 Munf. <em>506; </em>Lambert v.
