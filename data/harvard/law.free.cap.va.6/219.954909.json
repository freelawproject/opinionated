Banner </em>had placed in the hands of one <em>John Strayer, </em>a bond on one <em>Philip Liggett, </em>which bond was to be converted into money, and the avails to be applied ratably to the several debts of plaintiff and of defendant, who were creditors of <em>Sanner; </em>and also that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the bond was converted into money by delivering it to <em>Liggett </em>the obligor, who took it at a discount of 6 <em>per cent, per annum, </em>(the bond having about 6 years to run,) and 5 <em>per cent, </em>additional j that the money was paid to defendant <em>Moffett </em>and one <em>John D. Zirkle </em>jointly, at one and the same time, and amounted to 296 dollars. The defendant offered evidence tending to shew that the plaintiff <em>Bowman </em>had refused to have any thing to do with the bond of <em>Liggett; </em>and the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that he assented to and accepted the arrangement of <em>Sanner. </em>Thus upon the question whether the plaintiff had assented to and accepted the arrangement by <em>Sanner, </em>there was a conflict of testimony. The defendant further offered proof tending to prove that in the event of <em>Bowman's </em>refusing to accept <em>Sanner's </em>arrangement, then the avails of <em>Liggett's </em>bond were to be applied to the debt of <em>Moffett </em>and one <em>John D. Zirkle, </em>ratably, in due proportion to their amounts. The jury having heard all the evidence and arguments of counsel, after deliberation of several parts of days, came into Court and rendered a verdict in these words: \u201cWe the jury agree that <em>Bowman </em>and <em>Moffett </em>shall have the money in proportion to their several debts, as <em>Banner </em>intended and thereupon in open Court the plaintiff\u2019s counsel remarked in the presence of the Court and jury, that the verdict might be rendered certain, if the amount of <em>Moffett's, </em>debt on <em>Banner </em>could be ascertained, of which as the Court certifies, no evidence had been offered. The debt of the plaintiff on <em>Sanner </em>having been proved by production and proof of his bonds, and the defendant <em>Moffett </em>having given information that his debt was 119 dollars or 120 dollars, a calculation was made in figures following, to wit: [This was a calculation which, taking the debt of <em>Boioman </em>at 262 dollars 60 cents and that of <em>Moffett </em>at 120 dollars, ascertained the ratable proportion of the money received, to which <em>Moffett </em>was entitled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to be 92 dollars 86 cents, and to which <em>Bowman </em>wa<em>s </em>entitled, to be 203 dollars 14 cents.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AeB\">After the calculation was made, the verdict which <em>\u2019 </em>was rendered, was written and read by the counsel for the plaintiff alone, in the hearing of the jury; and the defendant\u2019s counsel suggested that probably the jury might have intended to give plaintiff only the difference between <em>Moffett's </em>whole debt 120 dollars, and 92 dollars 86 cents, his ratable part of the fund, if <em>Bowman </em>was to participate in the fund. Some discussion took place at the bar, whether the informal finding of the jury could bear such a construction; and the jury having been sent to their room to consider again of their verdict, returned into Court and rendered the verdict which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had written. This verdict was again ,read audibly in the hearing of the jury, and assented to by the jury; and the defendant\u2019s counsel insisted on having the jury polled, by having them called one by one; and interrogated each one, whether that verdict (which was again audibly read) was his, and was answered by each one, that it was his verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">A short time after the jury had rendered their verdict and had been discharged, the defendant\u2019s counsel suggested to the Court that some of the jury had made a mistake in rendering a verdict for 203 dollars 14 cents, instead of 27 dollars 16\u00bf cents: and moved for a new trial on the ground of that mistake; and proposed to have the jurors called in again in order to have them interrogated; which application the Court at the time deferred, as it was engaged in another <em>cause; </em>but required the defendant to exhibit affidavits in support of his motion for a new trial; and thereupon the defendant exhibited the affidavits of <em>Thomas Lindon </em>and others, in the words and figures following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Arg\">The undersigned, who were members of the jury which tried the case of <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>at the October term of the Circuit Superior court of <em>Rocking-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ham, do hereby certify that the verdict as returned and recorded does not contain the verdict which they intended to render, and that the same was returned by them under a mistake of its legal effect. Immediately after they were discharged, and before they had left the courthouse yard, they were informed that the effect of their verdict was to give the plaintiff 203 dollars 13 cents damages, with interest from 30th December 1840, until paid; and such not being their purpose, they felt it their duty to make known the error into which they had been led, to the defendant and one of his counsel, that the error might be corrected. This communication was voluntarily made, and without solicitation on the part of the defendant or his counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-4\">This error arose thus: the jury originally came into Court with a verdict in the following words: \u201cWe the jury agree that <em>Bowman </em>and <em>Moffett </em>shall have the money, in proportion to their several debts, as <em>Banner </em>intended.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then drew that verdict, which was finally rendered, and which the jury without exception, believed would have the effect, not of giving the plaintiff 203 dollars 13 cents, damages, but only 27 dollars 16 J cents, that being the difference between 120 dollars, the sum which <em>Moffett </em>actually received, and his ratable proportion of the fund, 92 dollars 83\u00bd cents, which he was entitled to receive. We hereto append the calculations made by the jury. The whole fund received by <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle </em>was 296 dollars. By the principal calculation, which is in the handwriting of <em>Thomas </em>Lindon, the foreman of the jury, it was ascertained that the proportion of the fund which <em>Moffett </em>the defendant was entitled to receive, was 92 dollars 83\u00bd cents; by a second calculation made by <em>Felix T. Sheets, </em>another of the jury, on the same piece of paper, and embraced in the black circle, it was ascertained that that sum deducted from the sum actually received, 120 dollars, left a balance of 27 dollars 16\u00bd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>cents, which the jury intended to give.

The evidence clearly discloses that the utmost sum which he could have any claim to recover, was 27 dollars 16 cents. That sum the jury intended to find for the plaintiff. Their informal verdict proves it. The calculations in the figures and handwriting of the jury prove it. The affidavits of the jurors and sheriff prove it. But by some strange mistake of the legal' effect of their verdict, the jury found for the plaintiff 203 dollars 14 cents, instead of 27 dollars 16 cents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-13\">The action was for money had and received to plaintiff\u2019s use. The whole sum which defendant received was, unquestionably, but 120 dollars; of this sum the jury themselves say <em>Moffett </em>was entitled to retain 92 dollars 86 cents. The difference between that sum and 120 dollars, was the amount they intended to hold <em>Moffett </em>responsible for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-14\">But the verdict requires <em>Moffett, </em>out of 120 dollars, to pay 203 dollars 14 cents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-15\">But <em>Mr. Samuels </em>says we ought to have pleaded in abatement the joint liability of <em>Zirkle. </em>Not so. How could we know, except from the declaration, what would be the pretensions of the plaintiff ? <em>Moffett </em>was sued <em>singly </em>for money received by <em>him. </em>How could he divine that in such an action, plaintiff would try to hold him responsible for a <em>joint liability </em>with another ? How could we have tendered the plea ? The plaintiff might well have replied, \u201c it is a departure\u201d\u2014we are seeking to hold <em>you </em>bound for your <em>own receipts. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>point of fact there was no <em>joint </em>liability. <em>Moffett </em>received his share and <em>Zirkle </em>his. Each was responsible for his own receipts. It is true that the money was paid to the parties at the same time, but <em>Moffett </em>received only 120 dollars, and <em>Zirkle </em>the balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-3\">Under these circumstances, even if the receipt was in one sense <em>joint, </em>yet as they at once divided it according to their respective rights, the plaintiff might have proceeded against them <em>jointly </em>for their <em>joint receipt, </em>or <em>separately </em>for their <em>separate </em>appropriation of it. Having elected to proceed <em>separately, </em>the plea in abatement would not have been proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-4\">That injustice was done is evident from all the proof in the cause. The Judge says he could not understand how the jury could have been mistaken. That may be; but they have sworn to the fact, and their figures and the affidavit of the sheriff sustain their oaths.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">I presume the solution is, that the jury thought <em>Bowman </em>was entitled to 203 dollars 14 cents, but that <em>Moffett </em>was to pay 27 dollars 16 cents, and <em>Zirkle </em>the balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">The only authorities to which I will refer, are <em>Cowperthwaite </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>2 Dall. R. 55; and <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Street, </em>1 Wash. 79. In the former case the doctrine is stated thus: \u201c Whenever it appears that manifest injustice has been done, or that the jury have proceeded on an <em>evident </em>mistake, either of law or. fact, or contrary to strong evidence, a new trial will be granted.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">As some of the cases referred to by <em>Mr. Samuels, </em>refer to the admissibility of the affidavits of jurors, I beg leave to refer to the fact that the case does not rest exclusively on their testimony. We have the sheriff and the written evidence besides. But upon the authority of <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Street, </em>the affidavits of jurors given voluntarily and without any circumstances of suspicion, may be received to prove the mistake. Here the error was of a clerical character in reducing the verdict to form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The appellant begs leave to suggest another point. He was an acknowledged creditor of <em>Banner, </em>and had a right in conscience to receive his whole debt. He was guilty or no wrong in receiving it when tendered to him by <em>Banner's </em>agent. His case is entirely different from what it would have been if he had not been a creditor of <em>Banner. </em>There can be no implied promise on his part to pay <em>Bowman. </em>If any body did wrong, it was <em>Liggett; </em>and if any body should be sued, it should be <em>Liggett. </em>He and not <em>Moffett </em>is responsible. Suppose A is indebted to B and C, to each 100 dollars. He places 100 dollars in the hands of D to be paid to B, but D by mistake pays it to C, who surrenders his bond, which is cancelled. B certainly could not maintain an action against C to recover that 100 dollars. He had a moral right to receive his debt from <em>A; he </em>knew nothing of B in the transaction; there was no privity between <em>them; </em>and there could be no ground for an implied contract between them. If G knew of the trust reposed in D by A, and received the money with a knowledge of the trust, then, in equity, he might be treated as a trustee and compelled to account. But there would be no action at law; the suit could not be maintained. See <em>Bize </em>v. <em>Dickason, </em>1 T. R. 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-10\">For the appellee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-11\">This is an action of <em>assumpsit </em>brought by <em>Bowman </em>against <em>Moffett </em>for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-12\">The record shews that <em>Sanner </em>had deposited with <em>Strayer </em>a bond given by <em>Liggett, </em>the avails of which were to be divided between <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Bowman, </em>ratably in proportion to the amount of the debts due to them from <em>Sanner. </em>If <em>Bowman </em>refused to accede to <em>Sanner's </em>arrangement, then <em>Moffett </em>and <em>John D. Zirkle </em>were to divide the money between them. The money was <em>jointly </em>received by <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>The jury find that <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>right to his ratable portion was superior to that of <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle, </em>who by their joint act of receiving were jointly liable to <em>Bowman. </em>Suit was brought against <em>Moffett </em>alone, who waived his right to have <em>Zirkle </em>jointly sued by failing to plead in abatement; the case was therefore properly proceeded in against <em>Moffett </em>alone. See 1 Chitt. Pl. 36 and 442; <em>Robertson </em>v. Smith, 18 Johns. R. 459; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Belches, </em>1 Wash. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-4\">The plaintiff in error seems to place great stress on the fact that <em>Moffett, </em>if liable at all, was jointly liable with <em>Zirkle. </em>This may be so ; but failing to plead in abatement, he takes upon himself the joint responsibility of both to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">No question is presented upon the record about the superiority of <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>right over that of <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle: </em>the jury decided that question in favour of <em>Bowman, </em>and no new trial was moved for, because that finding was against evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">The superiority of <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>claim to his ratable portion of the money being established and acquiesced in, it would seem that the whole matter was disposed of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">The theory of the case presented by the plaintiff in error is this: Although <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>right to his ratable portion of the fund is superior to that of <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle; </em>and although they are jointly liable to <em>Bowman ; </em>still, as <em>Moffett </em>had a claim to the residue of the fund equally good with <em>Bowman\u2019s, </em>which residue he also received jointly with <em>Zirkle, </em>therefore <em>Moffett </em>should not be held responsible for <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>money improperly received by him and <em>Zirkle. </em>It is submitted that the fact that <em>Moffett\u2019s </em>title to part of the money was good, does not exempt him from liability for another portion to which he had no title. If <em>Moffett </em>had contented himself with receiving his own ratable part of the fund, he would never have been drawn in question ; but having jointly with <em>Zirkle </em>received not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>only his own, but also <em>Bowman's </em>part, he should not expect to evade responsibility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-4\">The superior right of <em>Bowman </em>being acquiesced in, it is yet objected that the recovery of <em>Moffett </em>should be for only 27 dollars 16 cents, the alleged excess of receipt above his ratable part; this sum is gratuitously assumed to be the excess received, when the record distinctly shews that the excess was 203 dollars 14 cents, and received jointly by <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">It is alleged to have been the purpose of the jury to subject <em>Moffett </em>to the payment of only 27 dollars 16 cents. If <em>Bowman </em>could only recover this amount of <em>Moffett, </em>then he could not recover more of any other person; he could not recover at all of <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle, </em>or of <em>Zirkle. </em>See <em>Wilkes </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 355; <em>Ammonett </em>v. <em>Harris &amp; Turpin, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 488; Chitt. Pl. 32; <em>Willings &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Consequa, </em>Peter\u2019s Circuit court R. 301; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Motter, </em>2 Rob. R. 536.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\"><em>Bowman's </em>right to his ratable portion (amounting to 203 dollars 14 cents,) is recognized by the jury in their informal finding, \u201c <em>that Bowman and Moffett shall have the money in proportion to their several debts, as banner intended.\" </em>Their verdict, when rendered certain and put in form, establishes his right and ascertains the amount; each individual juror, when specially interrogated, approves the verdict; the plaintiff in error acquiesces in the existence and amount of <em>Bowman's </em>claim by omitting to move for a new trial because the verdict is against evidence; the Court declares itself <em>\u201c entirely satisfied\" </em>with the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">It is not alleged by the jurors that <em>Bowman </em>was not regarded by them as entitled to his ratable portion of the fund; it is not alleged by them that 203 dollars 14 cents is not the true amount of that portion; the end and purpose was, or should have been, to give <em>Bowman </em>a verdict for the amount he was entitled to; yet, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>way of carrying out and executing this purpose, some \u00b0f the jurors say they intended to give a verdict for 27 dollars 16 cents, which would have the effect (if any) o<em></em>f precluding all recovery of a larger amount. Regarding the attainment of full justice as the end, and the verdict as the means, it will be found that the alleged intended means will effectually defeat the end.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\">Shall the end, now fully attained, be sacrificed, because, as some of the jury say, the mistaken and absurd means contemplated by them were not adopted ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAn\">The great object of all trials is to do justice between the parties; the justice of this case will be to give <em>Bowman </em>the money conceded on all hands to be due to him; if the. record, instead of being regular and free from error, had even shewed irregularities and error, the Court would not set aside the verdict. In addition, let it be remembered that there is great danger in allowing jurors to assail the work of their own hands. See <em>Mather </em>v. Bailey, 1 Price\u2019s Exch. R. 1; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>18 Eng. C. L. R. 331; 3 Black. Com. 392; <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>44 Eng. C. L. R. 377; <em>Wickes </em>v. <em>Clutterbuck, </em>9 Eng. C. L. R. 490; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Kitchin, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 338; <em>Edmondson </em>v. <em>Machell, </em>2 T. R. 4; <em>Price's ex'or v. Warren, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>385; Goode </em>v. <em>Love's adm'r, </em>4 Leigh 635.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-10\">I have hitherto treated this case as if the jury had really made a mistake. Yet the Court obviously did not believe that any mistake had been made which would entitle <em>Moffett </em>to relief. A short review of the facts will shew that their mistake, if it existed at all, was not one of fact. The jury informally found that the money arising from <em>Liggett's </em>bond should be divided between <em>Bowman </em>and <em>Moffett. </em>The precise amount could only be ascertained by finding out the amount of <em>Moffett's </em>debt against <em>Banner; Moffett </em>voluntarily stated the amount of his debt, and a calculation was made in the presence of the jury, and a ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>diet written and read to them. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the verdict, and suggested that the jury might have only intended to allow the difference between <em>Moffett's </em>whole debt and his ratable part of the fund; the jury were sent out again to consider of the verdict with this suggestion fresh in their minds: they made a calculation for themselves, and returned the verdict which was previously prepared: it was read to them a second time, and agreed to by them <em>all; </em>they were polled after hearing the verdict again read, and each one declared his concurrence in the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-4\">There is no pretext that the verdict was falsely read or misunderstood by the jury as it was read. There is no pretext that they did not intend to find that <em>Bowman </em>had not refused to accede to <em>Banner's </em>arrangement, and therefore <em>Zirkle's </em>contingent right never became vested. There is no pretext that the jury did not intend to find that <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle </em>jointly received the money; the only mistake alleged is, that the jury intended to sever the amount wrongfully received, and make <em>Moffett </em>liable for <em>27 </em>dollars 16 cents, and (we may presume) make <em>Zirkle </em>liable for the residue ; and this in the face of the fact, that the receipt was joint; and in the face of the settled law, that <em>Bowman </em>could recover nothing more than he might recover in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\">The verdict, as rendered, carries out the intention of the jury ; the means contemplated (a verdict for <em>27 </em>dollars 16 cents) would defeat that intention. It is respectfully submitted that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b253-6\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOM\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">It seems to the Court from the evidence adduced on the motion for a new trial, (which evidence was, under the circumstances, properly received by the Circuit court,) that it was the intention of the jury, by their decision, to divide <em>pro rata </em>between <em>Bowman </em>the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>and <em>Moffett </em>the defendant in the action, the proceeds of <em>Liggett's bond; </em>which intention might have been accomplished by the verdict for the plaintiff, if he had made <em>Zirkle </em>a defendant to the action, as well as <em>Moffett, </em>as he ought to have done according to his pretensions of their joint liability to him; but of which failure to do so, in that view of the case, <em>Moffett </em>could not avail himself, inasmuch as it was an objection proper only for a plea in abatement. The intention of the jury, therefore, was not accomplished by their verdict for the plaintiff, the effect of which was, instead of giving <em>Moffett </em>his ratable proportion of said proceeds, to subject him solely to the ratable proportion of <em>Bowman; </em>and the mistake of the jury probably arose from not adverting to the consequence of <em>Zirkle's </em>not being a defendant in the action. But whatever may have been the cause, the mistake itself is established by the evidence, and furnished a sufficient reason for a new trial, unless it had appeared to the Judge that the merits of the case were attained by the verdict of the jury. The Judge, it is true, was satisfied with the verdict, and if the facts upon which his opinion was founded, did not appear from the bill of exceptions, it would be a question proper for consideration, whether this Court would revise his decision. But though the facts actually proved at the trial are not detailed in the bill of exceptions, yet the facts which the evidence given tended to prove, are therein set forth: and by conceding that <em>Bowman's </em>evidence proved all that it tended to prove, and that <em>Moffett's </em>evidence only tended to prove his conflicting pretensions, the question is presented in the most favourable aspect for <em>Bowman, </em>whether the Judge ought to have been satisfied with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In this aspect of the case, it appears that one <em>Sanner </em>had placed in the hands of one <em>Strayer, </em>the said bond on said Liggett, which bond was to be converted into money, and the avails to be applied ratably to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>several debts respectively due to <em>Bowman </em>and <em>Moffett, </em>who were creditors of <em>Banner ; </em>that the bond was converted into money, which was paid to <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zi</em>rk<em>le, </em>who claimed the same on the pretension that <em>Bowman </em>had refused to accept the arrangement, and that in that event <em>Banner </em>had directed the proceeds to be applied ratably to the several debts due from him to <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle </em>respectively. The opinion of the Judge was, of course, founded upon the idea that <em>Bowman </em>was entitled to a verdict against <em>Moffett </em>for the whole amount so paid to <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle, </em>inasmuch as it was paid to them jointly at one and the same time. But it seems to the Court that this idea was incorrect, the money not having been received by <em>Moffett </em>and <em>Zirkle </em>for their joint use, but to be applied ratably, and there being no pretence that <em>Moffett </em>retained more than his own proportion : so that, in substance and effect, each of them appropriated only the sum claimed by himself in discharge of his several debt, and cannot be treated as having received the share of the other: and consequently that <em>Bowman\u2019s </em>right of action was not against both jointly, but against each respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">It seems therefore to the Court, that the judgment of the Circuit court is erroneous: And it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled, with costs to the plaintiff in error. And it is further considered that the verdict of the jurors be set aside, and the cause remanded to the Circuit court, for a new trial thereof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
