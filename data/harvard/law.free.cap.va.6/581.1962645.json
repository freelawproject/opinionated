GIu~oRv and Johm Taliaferro adminjstrators of .Thitm Smith, jr. deceased, brought detinue, for two slaves, against E1i~abeth IL Smith, in the Supcrioi Court of Spottsylvania County. A case was agreed by the parties, stating, that the slaves in the declaration mentioned were the property of Jane Johnstom on the 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>day of August 1807; and that she on that day conveyed them by Deed to <em>Elizabeth II. Smith </em>the defendant, then, the wife of <em>John Smith </em>the plaintiff\u2019s intestate; which Deed was in the following words and figures:\u2014\u201c Know \u201c all men by these presents, that I <em>Jane Johnston </em>of the \u00ab Town of Fredericksburg and State of Virginia, for and \u00a3\u00a3 in consideration of my natural love and affection I <em>bare \u201c </em>towards my daughter <em>Elizabeth H.

In Witness \u201c whereof; S have hereunto set my hand and seal this 2d f.\u00a3 day of August 1807.

This gave 1iei~ a separate property in them', exonerated from the ~naritaI eighth of her 1uiisbat~d; ai',d, therefore, at his death, no right vested in his ~cpresentatives. The doctrine, in cases of this nat~\u00fc~e, has been settled on liberal principles, to carry into effect the intention of the donor withoat regard to technical forms. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> If the had aiy ~it1~, i~ ~va~ that of a m~r~ trustee, ~T1th the be~ieficiaIh~tei.est to the sc~para~te n~e of the wife~ and~ as such trust arose from the necessity produced by the coverture~ it ceased at his death, and was not transrnis~ sible to his representatjvjes: and, even if it vested in them, it could cot be set up against the eestn~q ~e frnst<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqk7\">i'his is nota question between a wife and creditors, but rnily between her and the adrnimstrators of her husband's~ estate. In the case of Boyd and Swepson v. Stainbach others, 5 Munf. 305, it was decided taht property conveyed to the wife's separate use is not assets in the hands of the husband's administrator, but only claimable by his ereditor&amp; If creditors were to sue in this case, it might be a question, (which is not now necessary to be decided,) whether they could take m&amp;re than the l~fe interest of Mrs. Smith, which alone could be vested in her `husband by virtue of hIs marital rli~hts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ACst\">\n<em>Bouldin contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_mP\">It is manifest that, under the deed, Mrs. <em>Smith </em>took a <em>fee simple </em>estate, <em>which </em>therefore vested in her husband, as soon as he obtained possession of the slaves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1Jy\">Mr. <em>Stiinard </em>construes the words, <em>\u201c special use,\u201d </em>in the same manner as <em>separate use. </em>The cases referred to by him, (as far as my Library enabled me to refer to them) are cases arising under Wills. I have found none where such loose and informal expressions have operated in <em>deeds. </em>The words <em>Ci special use\u201d </em>might be intended to signify that the slaves were to he used as <em>howse-servanis. </em>In order to give a wife property, separately from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>her husband, a <em>separate </em>use must be <em>expressly </em>declared in the deed. In this deed there are <em>no trustees, </em>to intercept the marital rights of the husband. In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>there were trustees. The circumstance that trustees are not appointed, affords an argument to prove that a separate estate in the wife is not intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKBe\">The separate estate of a wife is the creature of a Court of <em>Equity: </em>I have never known it set up in a Court of <em>Law. </em>If a Bill in Equity were resorted to, the Court could judge of all the circumstances, and consider whether the wife\u2019s claim ought to be sustained; or the property left in the hands of the administrators, which would be decreed if creditors were to be satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHvG\"><em>Stanard </em>in reply. The Deed in this case was written by the donor herself, and ought to be construed with the same liberality as a Will. Her intention is manifest.\u2014 But all the cases are not of Wills. That of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Brock </em>was on a Deed; and there the Court did not permit the legal estate of the trustee to. be interposed to prevent the <em>cestuy que trust </em>from recovering the property at law.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"AaE-\"> Note.
