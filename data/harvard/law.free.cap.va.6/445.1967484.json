There is no more reason for allowing the new trial here, than there would be for allowing the act of limitations; or atender, after a'judgment by default; because the justice of the case was with the appellant, as the debt was an honest one, and the attempt is to get rid of it, by a rigid rule of law. 5 <em>Bac. </em>Abr. 47; <em>[Wits </em>v. <em>Polehamp</em>ton,] Salk. 647.

It was consequently right, that the party should have an opportunity of shewing the death. But it appears, upon the face of the declaration, that the co-obligor was dead; and, therefore, it was sufficient cause to arrest the judgment. Consequently, this Court, proceeding to give such judgment as the District Court ought to have given, may, without regard to the bill of exceptions, arrest the judgment now, and thus put an end to the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-11\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b466-12\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AI3\">Delivered the resolution of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">That the plea of payment was improperly put in by the attorney, instead of pleading the discharge.
