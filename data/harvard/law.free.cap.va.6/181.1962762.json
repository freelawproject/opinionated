Stevenson, 2 Call 213, that the penalty of the forthcoming bond was saved by the Supersedeas. This indeed is a stronger ease than that :-for it might have been contended that a Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>*aW WaS n\u00b0* ^oun&lt;^ take notice of an <em>Injunction </em>from a Court of Equitybut here the Writ of <em>Supersedeas </em>is a common law remedy, in <em>the </em>face of which the Sheriff cou^ n0^ proceed without a contempt of the Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVvu\">\n<em>Stanard contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asm\">insisted, 1st, that the forthcoming bond must be regarded as forfeited, according to the only return of which the Court can take notice. After such a lapse of time, the Sheriff could not be permitted to amend his return, especially from a recollection confessedly imperfect <footnotemark>(1.)</footnotemark> No return, whether original or amended, ought to be accepted unless it be <em>precise </em>and certain <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But the only positive part of this amended return, is that which says that the property was not delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-5\">2dly, The facts that the <em>Supersedeas </em>was awarded and emanated before the day of sale, do not appear by evidence of which the Court can take judicial notice. If these facts existed, they were of record, and were prove-able only by the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\">3dly, The emanation of a <em>Supersedeas </em>to a Judgment after the levying of an Execution thereupon, does not supersede the farther proceeding upon the execution, in relation to the property taken by the Sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXr\">The principle determined in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>2 <em>Gall </em>213, is that, if a forthcoming bond be not forfeited when an injunction issues, the penalty is saved, because compliance with the condition would be useless, since the property, immediately upon it\u2019s being delivered to the Sheriff, must be restored to the defendant. This proposition, that the property must be restored, is drawn from the case of <em>Ross v. Poythress, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>120. In that case, the Court, adverting to the position of Counsel, that, under the law of England, an injunction would not authorise the restoration of goods on which execution had been levied, but would stay them in the Sheriff\u2019s <em>hands,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says, <em>\u201c </em>we .give no positive opinion as to the \u201c effect of an injunction obtained upon an execution <em>\u201c </em>against the goods and chattels, after seizure,* as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>44 case is not before ns:-probably it would be consider-44 ed as settled by the Act of 1791, which, directing a 44 restitution of the money levied, would seem to include 44 inferior cases, and to extend, by an equitable construc44 tion, to the restitution of goods seized in execution, 44 and not sold.\u201d The decision therefore rests solely on the equitable construction of the <em>Act of Assembly, </em>and not on the commou law. But that Act applies to the case of an <em>Injunction; </em>saying nothing of a <em>Supersedeas.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYx\">Let it be conceded, that, if the effect of a <em>Supersedeas </em>he to <em>restore </em>the property to the defendant, the principle in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Stevenson </em>will cover this case: the question then is, does a <em>Supersedeas </em>entitle the party suing it out to a restoration of the property actually in execution?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnY\">There is no statutory provision on the subject:-it consequently is a question of common law:-and, by a series of ecisions ever since the year books, it has been settled, that an Execution is an <em>entire </em>thing, which, being once <em>begun, (that is </em>levied,) can not be <em>stopped </em>or superseded. <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP5y\">Wickliarn in reply. No exception was taken to the act of the Court in giving the Sheriff leave to amend his return. The circumstances do not appear which induced the Court to give that leave. It therefore must be presumed to be right, since nothing appears to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATr\">IC any argument can be drawn from the dela~j, it was chargeable to the plaintiff himself, who let seven years elapse before lie moved on the bond. If the return was uncertain, let him go against the Sheriff for making an insumcicnt return. But the return is positi~ce, that the Smpersedeas was issued before the day of sale. rfl~e Sheriff says he thinks it was delivered to himself on that da~j.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEI\">As to the point of Jaw concerning the effect of the persedeus~ the practice of the Courts in this Country is to be relied upon. In Moss v. Moss's administrator, 4 H. &amp; M. 297-8, Mr. Munford, in argument, relied on the English practice to shew, that judgment could not be against 44 part of Die obligors in ajoint bond (the others. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\"being alive,) until further process (evem to outla~wry) had beeii taken out against the others who failed to appear:\" but the practice of this Country, being different, prevailed.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> There is no such thing in England, as a forthcoming bond. I am certain it is the established practice of this Court to grant the Sitpersedas~ even when informed that Execution was levied; and the. Sheriff thereupon, if the property is in his possession, restores it to the defendant..</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><em> Dalton's </em>Sheriff, 163-168.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em> </em>2 <em>Har.
