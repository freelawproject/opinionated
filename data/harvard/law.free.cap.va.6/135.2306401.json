The <em>first </em>was a general count for money had and received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use. The other was a special count, alleging, that <em>J. Ross </em>surviving partner of <em>J. C. Ross, </em>being justly indebted <em>to the </em>plaintiff <em>Ashby </em>in the sum of 200 dollars, and having, at the same time, a judgment against one <em>Towles </em>for a large amount, transferred and assigned to the plaintiff so much of that claim against <em>Towles, </em>as would suffice to pay and satisfy the debt due from <em>Ross </em>to the plaintiff, and gave the plaintiff free and full control over the claim against <em>Towles, to </em>prosecute the same to satisfaction; find the plaintiff having after-wards, accordingly, revived the judgment, in the name of <em>J. Ross, </em>the surviving partner of J. <em>Sf C. Ross, </em>against the administrator of <em>Towles </em>who was then dead, sued out a <em>fieri facias </em>against <em>Toivles's </em>estate, which was levied; hut the defendant <em>Green, </em>acting under the di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>rections of <em>J. Ross, </em>and as his special agent and attorney, demanded and received from the sheriff the money by him levied on this <em>fieri facias, </em>so sued out by the plaintiff in the name of <em>J. Ross, </em>surviving partner &amp;c. against <em>Towles\u2019s </em>administrator; and-the defendant <em>Green, </em>so becoming indebted to the plaintiff <em>Ashby </em>in the sum of 200 dollars, in consideration thereof, assumed to pay him the same. The defendant pleaded the general issue. Upon the trial, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 72 dollars, with interest from the 1st January 1811. The defendant moved the court to set aside the verdict, as being wholly unsupported by the evidence; but the court overruled the motion, and gave the plaintiff judgment according to the verdict. Whereupon, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions to the refusal of the court to grant a new trial, in which ah. the evidence adduced at the trial, was set out at large.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b151-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>1835. <em>February.</em></decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The bill of exceptions stated, 1. That the plaintiff \u201c gave in evidence,\u201d that the defendant, as the attorney of <em>J. Ross, </em>demanded and received from the sheriff, the amount of the <em>fieri facias </em>sued out in the name of <em>J. Ross </em>surviving partner &amp;c. against <em>Towles\u2019s </em>administrator, claiming the same as the money of <em>J. Ross, </em>but before the defendant paid tins money over to <em>Ross, </em>he had notice that the plaintiff claimed it as the assignee of <em>Ross. </em>2. That the plaintiff .then, to prove his right to this money, \u201cgave in evidence\u201d two fee bills for fees due from <em>J. 8f C. Ross </em>to him as deputy sheriff of <em>Culpeper, </em>for commissions on executions sued out by them'against one <em>Beverley, </em>and levied by the plaintiff as sheriff: these two fee bills, which amounted to 72 dollars, and were dated as early as December 1810, the plaintiff insisted had never been paid by <em>Ross, </em>and they were the foundation of his present claim. 3. That the plaintiff\u2019 also \u201c gave in evidence\u201d short abstracts of two judgments of <em>J. f C. Ross </em>against Bever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>ley </em>for largo debts, and of the executions sued out thereon in 1809 and 1810, and put into the hands of the plaintiff as sheriff to levy. 4. That the plaintiff also gave in evidence a mutilated paper (mutilated, a,pparently, by accident) which was set out, in its actual state, in the bill of exceptions, and which, as fax as its meaning could be made out from what remained of it, imported, that the plaintiff was thereby authorized to prosecute and recover <em>J. C. Ross's </em>claim against <em>Towles: </em>this paper was signed <em>\u201c J. Ross </em>surviving partner of <em>J. fy C. Ross.'' 5. </em>That the plaintiff then introduced a witness, who testified, that up to the year 18\u00cd6, he had been for many preceding years deputy sheriff of <em>Culpeper, </em>and had the management of the execution of <em>J. fy C. Ross </em>against <em>Towles, </em>which was originally for a large amount, but had been reduced by payments made to him, the sheriff; that <em>J. Ross </em>frequently applied to him for information respecting this execution, as was his habit in regard to all his executions ; that in the latter part of the time the witness was sheriff, and frequently after he was out of office, down to a period about a year before <em>Towles's </em>death in 1824, the plaintiff <em>Ashby </em>applied to the witness to go with him <em>to Towles, to settle </em>the execution, which the plaintiff said was for his benefit, and the witness so far believed this, that he would have taken <em>Ashby's </em>receipt for the money, and he believed <em>Towles </em>would have been willing to do so too ; that the plaintiff <em>Ashby </em>also shewed the witness about that time, a statement of an execution in the handwriting of <em>J. Ross; </em>but he never shewed him any assignment from <em>Ross, </em>nor did he ever hear from <em>)\u00a1\u00a1,oss, </em>that the plaintiff' had any right or claim to the monoy, nor did he know that <em>Ross </em>was aware that the nlaintiff did claim it; but after the time <em>Ashby </em>set up a claim to the money, <em>Ross </em>never made any inquiry r bout the execution, though the witness occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>sionally saw him; that the witness never knew the plaintiff <em>Ashby </em>to.be <em>Ross's </em>agent in any other case, though <em>Ross </em>had. many executions in <em>Culpeper, </em>but when the plaintiff assumed authority over this case [the execution against <em>Towles] Ross </em>had no other unsettled execution that the witness was aware of. 6. That the plaintiff introduced another witness, who testified, that two years before the defendant <em>Green, </em>as the attorney of <em>Ross, </em>received the money in question, the witness was employed by the plaintiff <em>Ashby, </em>to prosecute a claim upon an old judgment in the name of <em>J. Sf C. Ross </em>against <em>Towles's </em>estate; that the plaintiff told him the claim was prosecuted for his benefit; that the witness knew nothing of <em>Ross </em>in the business, though he brought the action of debt on the judgment against <em>Towles, </em>in the name of <em>J. Ross, </em>as surviving partner of <em>J. Sf C. Ross ; </em>that the plaintiff never shewed him any assignment of the debt from <em>Ross </em>to him, nor did the witness know, that <em>Ross </em>was aware of the claim set up by the plaintiff to the money; that a short time before the action of debt on the judgment against <em>Towles </em>was tried, the defendant <em>Green </em>told the witness, that he was retained by <em>Ross, </em>to assist in the management of the case. \u201cAnd this was all the evidence in the ease,\u201d though the defendant stated the facts, as they were asserted and insisted on by <em>Ross </em>in explanation of the fee bills, and the authority given by him to <em>Ashby; </em>denying that the fees ever were due to <em>Ashby ; </em>and explaining, that he had given the paper in question [the mutilated paper adduced by the plaintiff] to enable <em>Ashby </em>to take out the necessary process, and to manage the claim against <em>Towles </em>for <em>Ross, </em>so as to <em>get \\ </em>\u00a1he money for him as his friend, <em>Ashby </em>living in <em>Toujlcfs </em>neighbourhood, and <em>Ross </em>at <em>Frederichsburg.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAXX\"><em>Green </em>applied to this court for a <em>supers',edea* </em>to the judgment, which was allowed. <em>!</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The cause was argued here, by <em>Stanard </em>for the plaintiff <em>in </em>error, and <em>Lyons </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_\">The question on the merits was, Whether the evidence shewed any right whatever in <em>Ashby, </em>to the money which <em>Green </em>has collected from <em>Towles\u2019s </em>administrator, as the attorney of <em>lloss ? </em>13ut the principal point in the argument, was a point of practice: Whether the bill of exceptions was well taken ? that is, whether, as the bill of exceptions only stated the <em>evidence </em>adduced, not the <em>facts proved, </em>though the evidence was all on one side, without any conflict of testimony, or question a,s to the credit of witnesses, it was competent to this court to review the judgment of the circuit superiour court on the motion for the new trial? The following cases were cited and examined; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>6 Munf. 125. <em>Keys </em>v. <em>M\u2019Fatridge, </em>Id. 18. <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>1 Leigh 340. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, 2 </em>Leigh 337. <em>Jackson\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>3 Leigh 196.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b155-5\">BnocKENBROtroat, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AM5\">The question here presented, is, whether this court shall judge of the propriety of the judgment of the circuit court in refusing to grant a new trial, on the statement made in the bill of exceptions taken to that refusal? <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway </em>established the principle, that if the exceptor spread out the evidence given at the trial, and the evidence was conflicting and contradictory, the appellate court could not decide whether the new trial should be granted or not, and therefore such a bill of exceptions should be entirely disregarded. This court said, that, in such cases, the trying court have the witnesses before them, and can judge not only from the words spoken, but from the manner of testifying, the hesitation or partiality manifested on the trial, or the like, on which side the truth is; but these lights are excluded from the appellate eff yt, who onlv see the evidence on paper, and therefore^- : c; ame opportunity of judging correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of the credit to be given to the respective witnesses, and whether the verdict, so far as it is affected by the comparative weight of the testimony, be contrary to the evidence, or not. The court also said, that if a bill of exceptions states <em>facts, </em>as they appear in evidence to the trying court, the appellate court may decide on such a bill of exceptions: that in such case, the appellate court does not depart from or overrule the decision of the trying court, as to the weight of testimony, or the credit due to any witness; it only acts upon the certificate of the inferiour court, and the acknowledgment of its opinion on the subject. This decision of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hard-away, </em>has not been shaken. That case did not call for any exposition of the <em>character of the fads, </em>of which the appellate court might judge, on an application for a new trial. Now, it is well known, that in trials before a jury, circumstances are every day given in evidence, which do not of themselves prove the fact which is in issue, but the fact itself may bo inferred from those circumstances. The circumstances proved are facts, and the deduction to be drawn from them is also a fact. There is then a distinction between what may be denominated circumstantial facts and inferred facts. If there be no conflict or contradiction in the circumstances given in evidence, the appellate court may judge of the inference to be drawn from them as well as the trying court. If there be nothing in the estimation of the trying court, either in the manner or character of the witness who testifies to the circumstances, and no evidence adduced to shake his credit, then the circumstances given in evidence are <em>proved facts, </em>which may be fairly certified as such by the trying court; but if there be a conflict in the evidence given, or some of the witnesses are unworthy of credit, then the trying court cannot certify, that all the circumstances given in evidence are <em>proved fads, </em>but it may from the mass of evidence certify what facts are in its opinion proved, and the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>late court will judge from that certificate, -whether the <em>, </em>. . new trial was properly granted, or refused.</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">The case of <em>Carrington </em>v. Bennett, afforded an opportrinity of discriminating between circumstantial and inferred facts. It was debt on a bond, and the defendant pleaded, that the bond was given for money won of him by unlawful gaming at cards. The evidence on the part of the plaintiff, was the bond alone. The defendant could not prove by a witness, that that identical bond was executed for the gaming consideration, but he gave in evidence certain circumstances, and acknowledgments of the plaintiff, from which the fact of the vicious consideration might, or might not, be inferred. There was no conflict or contradiction in the evidence given of those circumstances, and they were therefore certified as having been <em>proved, </em>that is, they were certified as <em>facts. </em>The jury, however, did not from them infer the fact, of the illegal consideration of the bond, but made the opposite inference, and the trying court refused to grant a new trial. But the appellate court, being of opinion that the fact in issue was properly and irresistibly deducible from the circumstantial facts admitted and proved, reversed the judgment, and directed a new trial.' In so doing, the court seems- to me not to have departed from <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>but to have carried it into effect. If the trying court had contented itself with merely certifying the fact which it inferred, there would have been no mode of correcting the error of an improper inference deduced from admitted and proved facts, and there would have been no use whatever in signing a bill of exceptions in which the inferred fact alone was inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Next came <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing. </em>There, the bill of exceptions did not purport to state the <em>facts proved </em>before the trying court, but the <em>evidence </em>given; and it seems at first sight to be in opposition to the two former cases; but I am satisfied, from the best reflection I can give to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the subject, that the discrepancy is more in form than . ... ... . . . _ . m principle. Although the <em>evidence </em>only was given, yet there was no conflict or contradiction in any part of it, and the appellate court was not called on to decide on the credit of the witnesses. Their credit was not impugned, and their evidence was admitted to be true. The defendant gave evidence in support of his pleas, and the verdict was in his favour, and the trying court refused a new trial. The appellate court decided, that, throwing out of view the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and admitting all of the defendant\u2019s to be true, his defence was not supported. In that view of the case, the appellate court had the same lights which shone upon the trying court. Evidence admitted to be true, seems to me to be in nowise different from <em>facts proved. </em>I think that this court properly reversed the judgment, and granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The case now before us is very much lik\u00e9 that of <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>as to the character of the bill <em>of </em>exceptions. It does not state the facts which were proved, but gives us the evidence on which the plaintiff relied to maintain his action. That evidence is not contradictory in <em>itself; </em>and the defendant gave no evidence. We must then take the evidence of the plaintiff to be true, and we must consider all facts fairly deducible from that evidence, as <em>facts proved. </em>We have the same lights to lead us to a just conclusion that the circuit court had, for we are not called on to weigh evidence, nor to judge of the credit of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In examining the evidence set out in the' bill of exceptions, I have taken up a strong impression, that it may be fairly inferred from the evidence, that, although <em>Ross </em>did not <em>assign, </em>yet he <em>transferred </em>to <em>Ashby, </em>the judgment against <em>Towles, </em>for the purpose of applying so much of the proceeds of it, as might be necessary to pay the debt due from <em>Ross </em>to <em>Ashby, </em>evidenced by the fee bills; that, consequently, <em>Green </em>was liable to <em>Ashby </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in the equitable action for money had and received to _ -in 1-1 1 \u2022 the use ox <em>Ashby; </em>and therefore, that there is no error in the judgment. But all the rest of my brethren have formed decided opinions to the contrary; and though my impressions are not entirely removed, I yield to their better judgment, and do not deem it necessary to state the grounds of my impressions.</p>\n<author id=\"b159-11\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APj\">This case comes before us, upon a refusal of the court below to grant a new trial, and an exception taken to that refusal, spreading <em>all the evidence, </em>not the <em>facts proved, </em>on the record. In <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>this court decided, that the only effect of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway </em>was, that a party shall not be permitted so to frame his bill of exceptions as to refer the credit of the witnesses to the appellate court; and that where there was no conflict, and of consequence, no question could arise as to the credit of witnesses, the appellate court would consider an exception well taken, which spread the <em>whole evidence, </em>instead of <em>the facts proved, </em>upon the record. In <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Easing, </em>this opinion was again considered as correct, and acted upon. According to these decisions, we must receive the exception here, as well taken, <em>for the </em>evidence is all on one side, and there cannot be a question of the credit of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Does the evidence shew a clear case of mistake in the jury and court below? Are the verdict and judgment <em>clearly </em>contrary to law and evidence ? For, unless there be clear error upon one of these points, I should be against disturbing the judgment. After the best examination I can give the case, I am compelled to say, that I think there is clear error; that the verdict was contrary to evidence, and against law. <em>Ross </em>had a judgment against <em>Towles: Green </em>was the attorney of <em>Ross, </em>and in that character received this money on an execution; but, before he paid it over to <em>Ross, </em>he received notice that <em>Ashby </em>claimed it as assignee of <em>Ross. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>To support his claim, <em>Ashby </em>produced fee bills to the amount of <em>72 </em>dollars due to him as sheriff, from <em>Ross, </em>which he said had never been paid him. He' also produced a mutilated paper, of which no sense can be made in its present form, but which is claimed to be an authority from <em>Ross </em>to the plaintiff to <em>prosecute and recover </em>the judgment against <em>Towles, </em>without, however, passing any interest therein to him. He also proved by a deputy sheriff, that he at one time, had the management of the execution of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Towles: </em>that for a time, <em>Ross </em>often applied to him for information, down to about 1824: that the plaintiff told him this execution was for his benefit, but never shewed him any assignment: that he did not know, that <em>Ross </em>was ever aware that the plaintiff claimed an interest in the judgment: but, after the time'the plaintiff claimed the judgment, <em>Ross </em>made no more applications to him for information. He proved by another witness, that about two years before the money was recovered, the plaintiff employed him to prosecute the claim against <em>Towles's </em>estate, telling him it was for his benefit; but this witness never saw any assignment, and did not know that <em>Ross </em>was aware of the plaintiff\u2019s claim: and that, a short time before the action of <em>debt on </em>the judgment against <em>Towles, </em>which was in <em>Ross's </em>name, was tried, the defendant told him he was employed by <em>Ross, </em>to assist him in the management of the cause. This was the evidence: and to me it seems, that allowing it the utmost weight that in fairness can be claimed for it, it proves no transfer of this debt, either legal or equitable, from <em>Ross </em>to <em>Ashby, </em>nor any ground for an inference of such transfer. <em>Ashby </em>said it was his, but, surely, this, without assent or even knowledge of the claim by <em>Ross, </em>could prove nothing. <em>Ashby </em>produced an account against <em>Ross; but, </em>whether just or unjust, due or paid off, it could operate no transfer of this particular debt. <em>Ashby </em>produced a paper, but so mutilated that no meaning can fairly be placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>upon it; and give it all the meaning claimed, it is a mere authority, uncoupled with any interest, to collect the money. Could such proof as this authorize <em>Green, </em>\u2022who was employed by <em>Ross </em>specially to attend to this case for him, to pay this money to <em>Ashby? </em>Could it create that privity which is necessary to support an action ? Suppose <em>Ross </em>had given <em>Ashby </em>an order on <em>Green </em>for the money, and <em>Green </em>had refused to pay; would <em>not the </em>resort have been upon Ross? Could <em>Green </em>have been sued upon an order which he refused to accept ? And if not upon such an authority from his client, surely he is not more liable, when he holds the money for his client, or pays it over to him, refusing to pay it to this adversary claimant. Who was the legal owner of this judgment? All must admit that <em>Ross </em>was, even if he had assigned it, since judgments are not legally assignable. What legal right, then, could <em>Ashby </em>have to call upon <em>Green </em>for the money? There could not be two legal adverse claims on him at the same time.</p>\n<author id=\"b161-5\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqY\">I am clearly of opinion, upon the authority of the cases of <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>and <em>'.Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>that the exception to the opinion of the court overruling the motion for a new trial, was properly taken, there being no conflict in the testimony, which was all on one side, and against the party tendering the exception: and that, in such a case, it is competent to this court, and it is its duty, to deduce from the testimony all such inferences of fact, as the jury might have deduced from it. I am also of opinion, that the evidence does not prove, either directly or by fair inference, any right in Ashby to the money received by <em>Green. </em>Giving to it all the latitude which can be justly claimed, it proves no assignment or transfer of the debt to <em>Ashby, </em>but only an <em>authority </em>to receive it. Therefore, when <em>Green </em>received it, he received it as <em>Ross's </em>money, not as <em>Ashbfs.</em></p>\n<author id=\"A_6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Abf\">If we are to decide this case on the evi- <em>, </em>............ . dence set out m the bill oi exceptions, I must concur m the opinion of my brothers <em>Cabell </em>and <em>Can-, </em>that the verdict of the jury was wrong, and that.the circuit court erred ih refusing to set it aside, and direct a new trial. But I confess, I do not understand the case of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>as it seems to have been understood by this court, in the two cases (in which I did not sit) of <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>and <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing. </em>I understand the principle of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway </em>to be, that this court cannot review the verdict of a jury, and the judgment -of the trying court refusing a new trial, on <em>mere evidence </em>stated in a bill of exceptions, because it cannot have the same lights from evidence on paper, which the court below had from <em>viva voce </em>testimony; but that on <em>facts </em>certified by the judge as proved, this court may review his judgment on the law of the case so stated. Neither do I understand, that it was, in that case, considered material, whether the evidence stated in the bill of exceptions was contradictory or not. Judge <em>Roane, </em>indeed, in delivering the opinion of the court, remarked, as a circumstance which fortified the objection to the bill of exceptions, that the evidence was contradictory ; but it was not intended, that it should be implied from that remark, that this court would, in any case, entertain an appeal'from a judgment of an inferiour court, upon a statement of <em>evidence </em>in a bill of exceptions, disregarding the preference \u00f3f <em>viva voce </em>testimony to evidence on paper; on the contrary, I think it quite clear, from many passages of the opinion of the court, that no such inference was intended. Thus, speaking of the trying court, judge <em>Roane said\u2014\u201c </em>That court, while it can faithfully transmit to this, the actual words spoken by the witnesses, can give no <em>fac simile </em>of the manner of testifying, the hesitation or partiality manifested on the trial, or the like. With respect to these important circumstances, as they relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>weight of testimony and credibility of witnesses, this . . . . , , , court is altogether m the dark: the advantages are exclusively confined to the court of trial.\u201d Now, the circumstances, that there is no contradictory evidence set out in the bill of exceptions, and that the evidence set out is entirely that of one party, either the exceptor or his adversary, do not obviate these objections. And there is another objection, which I think more important, as it is founded in the very nature of our appellate jurisdiction\u2014that this court is required to, review the judgment of the court of trial, not. on the facts which that court deduced from the testimony before it, but on the facts deduced by this court from the evidence, which was <em>before the </em>court of trial, stated on paper; thus reviewing the decision of that court, not on the law of the .case as it appeared to it to be proved by the testimony, but on the law of the case as it appears to this court to be proved by the evidence on paper; in other words, reviewing the judgment of the court of trial, not on the law, but on the facts, of the case. This is in contravention of the opinion of the court in <em>Bennett. </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>where it is said\u2014\u201cIt is an important principle, that the revising court should have the same lights, and act upon the same <em>data, </em>as the inferior^ court. This is always so, where the case <em>depends </em>upon a ques-tion of <em>law; </em>for that question being permanently spread upon the record in the trying court, is carried up to all the revising tribunals. It is a further principle equally important, that where this advantage is wanting in the revising court, the judgment of the court below will preponderate. On this principle this court acted in the case of <em>Chaney </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>3 Munf. 51. On this principle, <em>it </em>is held, in <em>England, </em>that a new trial will be granted after a trial at bar, rather than after trials at <em>nisi prius, </em>because the former founded upon what appeared to the <em>whole court, </em>whereas the latter is founded on the opinion of p single judge;\u201d 1 Burr. 394. I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>at a loss to reconcile with these principles, the subsequent adjudication of <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing. </em>In that case, on a motion for a new trial being overruled, all the evidence given at the trial on both sides, was stated in a bill of exceptions; and the appellate court, excluding all the evidence of the party against whom the verdict was found, and admitting the truth of all the evidence of the party for whom it was found, held the verdict contrary to evidence and to justice, set it aside, and ordered a new trial; thus, treating the bill of exceptions exactly as a demurrer to evidence ; a practice, which must end in the trial of every case over again in the appellate court, upon a bill of exceptions stating the whole evidence on paper, not in reviewing the judgment of the inferiour court on the law of the case, as the facts appeared to it to be proved by the testimony. In short, <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing </em>presents a new mode of trial, not to be found in any of the books, and more congenial with the civil than the common law. In the case now before us, I think it impossible, that the jury or the circuit court could have taken the same view of the <em>viva voce </em>evidence which was before them, that they would have taken of the evidence stated for us on paper in this bill of exceptions. As to the distinction which has been taken, between evidence of facts, and inferences from facts and circumstances proving facts, which, it is said, this court is as competent to draw as the jury or the court below, there would be something in it, if such inferences were matter of law, and not of fact: but such inferences are matters of evidence, and depend much on other evidence in- the cause, which is admitted to be the peculiar province .of the jury, and of the court of trial, upon the <em>viva voce </em>testimony, to weigh and decide. It is an appeal from the judgment on the facts, and not on the law, which the distinction requires this court to ent\u00e9rtain. This, I think, is not justified by the authority of <em>Bennett v. Hardaway, </em>though it is by that of <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>and <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b165-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\n<em>Tucker, P.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">The first question in this case, brings up the often debated point, as to the proper form of a bill of exceptions, on the refusal of a motion for a new trial. It seems to be agreed on all hands, that it is not competent for the appellate court, in a case of conflicting testimony, to revise and reverse the opinion of the court and jury, touching the credit of the witnesses. In such case, therefore, the party who takes the exception must have the <em>facts, </em>as contradistinguished from the <em>evidence, </em>spread upon the record, for the judgment of the appellate court. When this is done, the question presented is, whether the jury has erred in the <em>inferences </em>drawn from the facts proved, or in matter of law as arising out of those facts ; and thus, where the court of trial concurs with the jury, no other question can fairly be brought before the appellate tribunal in a case of conflicting testimony. From this view of the matter, we may deduce the rule, that no bill of exceptions is properly taken, which submits to this court, conflicting evidence, upon the credit of which we must decide, before we can pronounce upon ''the judgment of the inferiour court. And for a like reason, though the evidence be all on one side, yet if that which is introduced is adduced by the excepting party, the bill of exceptions is not properly framed, if it recites the evidence which was given, instead of setting forth the facts; for, peradventure, the court and jury may have disbeJieved the witnesses, and if so, this court could not interfere. This was the case in <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>in the opinion of one of the judges. There was no conflicting evidence on the real matter of litigation between the parties. All the evidence to that point, was on the side of the ex-ceptor, and as the court and jury both decided against him, this court could not, upon its own principles, have overruled their opinion upon the weight of the evidence, unless the facts as proved were duly stated. In this the whole court very obviously concurred, though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>mai'ority were of opinion, that the question of the truth . . , . , . , oi the evidence was not submitted, but that the facts were properly certified. I coincide in that opinion. All that the rule 'requires, is, that the appellate tribunal be absolved from the decision of the question whether the testimony is true or untrue. And where the bill of exceptions states, as it did in <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>that \u201c the witnesses.proved\u201d so and so, and that \u201c these were all the facts <em>proved </em>in the cause,\u201d this court must <em>take </em>it, that the matter stated was proved to the satisfaction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AgE\">In the case of <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>the question presented itself in another shape. The party excepting did not rest upon his own evidence, but contended that, admitting the truth of all the evidence adduced by his adversary, it was not sufficient to maintain his plea, and entitle him to a v\u00e9rdict. And the court decided, accordingly, that the bill of exceptions was sufficiently taken, although it did not purport to set out the <em>facts proved, </em>but only detailed the <em>evidence </em>which had been given. In this opinion I concur; for the reason of the rule has no application, where the evidence is only on the side of the successful <em>party; </em>since, in such case, the exceptor may safely <em>he </em>considered as admitting its truth, which is equivalent to its being set forth as matter <em>proved </em>in the cause. Nor is there any hardship in this. The exceptor cannot complain, since he must either submit to an affirmance by reason of the informality of the bill of exceptions, or submit to the inferdnce that his adversary\u2019s evidence is incontrovertibly true. And the successful party cannot justly complain, that the court considers his evidence as equivalent t\u00f3 indisputable facts. The modification of' the rule of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>which is effected by the case of <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>seems to me essential to justice : for, surely, it would be grossly wrong to refuse <em>to </em>correct the error of the court, below in refusing a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>trial, where it is plain, that the proof exhibited by the plaintiff; admitting it to be true in every tittle, established no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"AZd\">Such I conceive to be the case at bar. The testimony is all on one side, and is against the exceptor. Admitting it to be true, it neither establishes the facts necessary to charge the defendant, nor justifies such inferences as might go to charge him. And I agree; in the opinion expressed by judge <em>Green, </em>that although this court cannot review the opinion of the court below as to the weight of evidence, it is its duty to correct the false inferences which may be drawn from facts that have been proved; 1 Leigh 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In the case before us, there are two counts ; the first a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>the second a special count. This latter is clearly not sustained by the evidence ; for it sets forth a debt of 200 dollars, and an assignment of part of the debt of <em>Towles, </em>which the defendant had received from the sheriff; whereas the evidence fails, I think, in proving either the original debt to <em>Ashby, </em>or an assignment to him for hi s own use of the judgment against <em>Towles, </em>though it does, indeed, conduce to prove an authority to collect it, but for whose use wo <em>know not, </em>except that, in the absence of evidence, it must be taken to be for <em>Ross\u2019s </em>use. This count is moreover altogether defective, and <em>inter alia, </em>in omitting to set out that <em>Green </em>received on the judgment enough to pay <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>demand. Then, as to the general count: this presents the question, whether the evidence establishes any right of action against the defendant. I am of opinion that it does not. To sustain the action, it was at least necessary to prove, that <em>Green had </em>received the money, that the plaintiff had the best right to it, and that <em>Green </em>had either not paid it over, or had notice not to pay it. I think the proof is essentially defective on the second point. I do not think a jury could fairly infer .from the existence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>fee bills, made out no one knows when, for services performed very many years ago, that <em>Ross </em>was <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>debtor at all. And still less could they infer a transfer of the judgment against <em>Towles </em>for the purpose of paying such debt. The mutilated fragment produced by <em>Ashby, </em>so far from proving an assignment for any such purpose, uses the terms <em>\u201c </em>hereby authorized to prosecute and recover,\u201d without any words pf appropriation to <em>Ashby, </em>and thus shews only an authority, without establishing an interest, or shewing an assignment. Without proof of such assignment, moreover, the receipt of the money by <em>Green </em>was an authorized act, as it would seem, he was one of the attorneys of record. And in that view of the case, it might fairly be questioned whether he would be liable to <em>Ashby </em>for having paid over to <em>Ross, </em>even though it should appear that <em>Ashby </em>was equitably entitled to the money. For it is difficult to admit, either that an attorney can retain his client\u2019s money upon notice of a claim to it by a stranger, or that the question of <em>Ross\u2019s </em>right could be fairly tried in an action against <em>Green. </em>On the other hand, if there was an assignment, if the money really was <em>Ashby\u2019s, </em>if he brought the suit, if he employed other counsel than <em>Green, </em>to recover the <em>amount in Ross\u2019s </em>name,' the suit was his suit, and the introvention of <em>Green, </em>at the instance of <em>Ross, </em>could not have given him authority to receive the money from the sheriff, as <em>Ross\u2019s </em>agent. In that state of facts, with notice of <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>rights, he w'ould perhaps have been hable to the action of <em>Ashby, </em>as the receipt would have been in-officious ; though the difficulty would still exist, as to the competency of a suit against <em>Green, </em>to try the right of <em>Ross </em>to the money in question. It is not necessary to go into this question here, and I therefore waive it, only referring to the following authorities, as bearing upon these questions; <em>Robson </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>1 T. R. 62. <em>Butter </em>v. <em>Harrison, 2 </em>Cowp. 566. <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Burr. 1984 <em>Travis </em>v. Claiborne, 5 Munf. 435. <em>Mires </em>v. <em>Solebay, 2 </em>Mod. 242. 1 Bac. Abr. Assumpsit. A. 260. 261. It is sufficient for this case, to say, that the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s action is wanting. The assignment is not proved, nor can it be fairly inferred; and without such proof the case is defective in all points.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>directed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
