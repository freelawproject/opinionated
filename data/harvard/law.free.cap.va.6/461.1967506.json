Because, all the land contained in the said survey and plot is the proper estate of the said <em>Thomas Field, </em>in fee simple, and is included within his ancient and known lines, duly processioned, and in quiet and peaceable possession of the said <em>Thomas Field, </em>and those whose estate he hath and claimeth under the devise of his late father <em>Theophilus Field, </em>deceased, in his last will and testament, for the space of fifty years.last past, appropriated and occupied, with a visible personal property thereon, of sufficient value to pay and discharge all the quit-rents and land taxes, wherewith the same was ever chargeable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-10\">Secondly. Because, all quit-rents and land-taxes, ever due upon the said land, have been duly, and regularly paid by the said <em>Thomas Field, </em>and his predecessors in the freehold; agreeable to the quantity expressed in the old surveys and grants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-11\">Thirdly. Because, the said <em>Thomas Field </em>was in actual possession of the said land, at the time of the said survey:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-12\">And, fourthly. Because, the said survey and plot, and the record and return thereof are irregular, improper, and contrary to law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-13\">At <em>Mecklenburg </em>County Court, <em>November </em>1790, a jury were impanneled <em>to find such facts as are material to the cause, and not agreed by the parties. </em>The record then states, that, .\u201cIt appearing to the Court, that the warrant, under which the defendant claims, issued previous to an act of Assembly, passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, directing the manner of obtaining rights to unappropriated lands, on the eastern waters, and the survey aforesaid made in consequence of an entry by the said warrant, and that the said defendant has no right to a grant by virtue of the said survey, under the said warrant: Therefore, it is considered, that a grant issue to the plaintiff for the said lands, upon his complying with the laws in such cases made; and that he recover against the defendant his costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-14\">The defendant filed a bill of exceptions to the foregoing opinion of the Court; which stated, that the defendant offered in evidence to the jury, a Land-Office Treasury Warrant, dated the 29th of <em>November, </em>1783, issued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Daniel </em>Carter, for 300 acres due him, in consideration of 480/. current money, paid into the public treasury; and assigned by <em>Carter </em>to <em>Harper\u00a1 </em>and by him to <em>Samuel Dedman: </em>who assigned two hundred acres thereof to <em>Mitchell; </em>arid likewise endorsed that he had surveyed 38i-acres of the warrant for Culbreath. That the defendant also offered in evidence an entry, in the following words? \u201c <em>Jipril </em>8th, 1788, <em>Thomas Culbreath </em>enters, by Land-Office Treasury Warrant, No. 20,900, granted <em>Daniel </em>Carter, and dated the 29th day of <em>November, </em>1783, for all the vacant land, between the lines of <em>John Clark, Thomas Field, James Williams, </em>and <em>William Culbreath, </em>deceased.\u201d That he also offered in evidence a survey, which begins at a corner white-oak on <em>Grassy Creek; </em>thence to corner pointers in <em>John Clark\u2019s, </em>line; thence to <em>Williams\u2019s </em>corner post-oak in <em>T. Field\u2019s </em>line; thence to a maple on <em>Grassy Creek; </em>thence down the same, as it meanders, to the beginning. That the plaintiff prayed judgment of the Court, because the defendant had located the said warrant on lands lying in <em>Mecklenburg </em>county, and not on the western waters; on which, alone the plaintiff insisted the defendant had a right to locate the said warrant, since the said act of 1785; and that the Court * was of that opinion. The defendant prayed an appeal; which was refused by the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-8\">The District Court granted a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which they reversed (because there were no facts found by the jury, nor were the jury discharged) and retained the cause for further proceedings. At a future Court, it was sent to the rules, for an issue to be made up; which order, at another Court, was set aside, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, and the cause put upon the issue docket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-9\">In <em>May, </em>1797, a jury were charged, <em>to find such facts as are material to the cause, not agreed by the parties: </em>who found a verdict in these words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-10\">\u201c We of the jury find the land-warrant in these words, to wit: (setting it forth.) We also find the following assignments on the back of the said warrant (setting them forth as above.) We also find, that the said <em>Thomas Cut-breath </em>came possessed of the said land-warrant, in a short time after the said last assignment above-written on the back of the warrant aforesaid. We likewise find the testament and last will of <em>Theophilus Field, </em>deceased, in these words, referring to it generally, but particularly stating the following clause: \u2018Item, I give and devise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>my son <em>Thomas Field </em>and to his heirs forever the several trac*s and quantities of lands, to wit: All my lauds and plantations on <em>Grassy Creek, </em>on the south side of <em>Roanoak River, </em>containing 2,898 acres; of which 404 I formerly took up, 2,3001 bought of <em>John Rood, </em>36 <em>o\u00ed John Bressie, </em>and 158 acres thereof I lately took up; also the l%nd and plantation on the north side of <em>Roanoak River, </em>I bought of <em>Thomas </em>and <em>John Sailer White, </em>(containing 400 acres:) That a woman had built a log house on the said 384 acres of land; surveyed, as aforesaid, for the said <em>Thomas Culhreath, </em>and dwelt on the said 384 acres of land, for eighteen years, or thereabouts. We further find, that <em>Lemuel Wilson </em>attended the processioning of the lines of the said <em>Thomas Field </em>and others twenty odd years ago, when the said <em>Thomas Field </em>informed him the said <em>Williams, </em>that the creek was the line, tho he knew there was an old line across a place called the Mountain, and further, that <em>James Williams </em>attended the processioning of the lands of the said <em>Thomas Field </em>and others, three or four times, at which times the said line across the mountain aforesaid was marked as the line of the said <em>Thomas Field, </em>and that the said 384 acres of land was considered as vacant and unappropriated land; but was informed, by the said <em>Thomas Field, </em>that he had an order of counsel for the same. And we further state, that the said 384 acres of land was vacant and unappropriated land, and not included in the ancient boundaries of the said <em>Thomas Field, </em>at the time the entry was made by the said <em>Thomas Cul</em>breath.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsQM\">^ Upon this verdict, the District Court gave judgment for the defendant; and <em>Field </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-7\"><em>Call, for </em>the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-8\">By the act of 1785, c. 42, [12 <em>Stat. Larg. </em>100,] a different land-warrant was necessary; for the Legislature, by that act, clearly intended, that no lands upon the Eastern waters should be granted, after the passage of that law, upon any other terms than those mentioned in it:, because, by prescribing a particular mode, they thereby necessarily' excluded every other; and because, too, by the last clause they, in express words, except two cases from the operation of the statute: 1. Cases where a location had been already begun prior to the passing of the act: 2. Cases of pre-emption rights to marshes and sunken grounds: which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>obviously excludes the right of commencing an entry under any former warrant. For, by declaring the warrant good, where the entry was begun, or it was a case of preemption rights, they manifest their .intention, that it should not be so, where the entry was not begun, or it was not a case of pre-emption rights. Again, the object of the law was to provide a fund to aid the discharge of the public debt due to foreigners, which object would be utterly defeated, upon any other construction of the act: Because, then the old warrants would all have been bought for locations upon the Eastern waters, at a less price than the public would sell new ones for; but greater than the price of warrants for lands, on the Western waters. So that the individual holders would be enriched, but the public purse would remain as empty as before the passage of the law. Which would have wholly disappointed the views of the Legislature: for, the Eastern lands would still have continued to be located on the ancient terms, and new warrants would only have been taken out for those on the Western waters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">It cannot be said, that the construction, now contended for would give the act an <em>ax post facto </em>operation, which would be prejudicial to the holders of the old warrants, whose former rights would be thereby divested or circumscribed; because, they may still lay them on the Western waters, and thus have full satisfaction for the claim. Bo that the public faith is not violated towards them. Besides, the warrant itself did not give them a right to any lands in particular, until they had made locations. It was only a right to locate them on unappropriated land, which they might never exercise; and therefore could acquire no right to any land, either on the Eastern or Western waters, until a location was made: which is the first inception of a right to lands in any particular part of the State. <em>Wolcott </em>v. Swan, (ante 298,) in this Court. Therefore, the warrant only gives a privilege of locating them on any waste and unappropriated lands, at the time of the proposed entry. For, the very term unappropriated, means not applied to, or set aside for, any particular use or purpose. But, if a particular parcel is declared ungrantable, or specifically appropriated, before the holder has exercised the privilege, ne can no more complain, than if an individual had made a location before him. The only difference is, that it is an individual who appropriates, instead of the public; but, the public has as much right to do so, as the individual. Now, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>in the present case, the public have appropriated the lands 011 t^e Eastern waters, to a particular purpose, prior to the exercise of the right under the old warrant; which only gave the holder a right to locate it on unappropriated lands: a te2-in not applicable to the lands in question, at the tune of the location. But, as the warrant only gave them a right to locate it on <em>unappropriated </em>land, that necessarily supposed a right in government to appropriate; and, the Legislature have done so, with regard to the lands on the Eastern waters, by creating them into an auxiliary fund for the payment of the foreign debt. A contrary construetion would defeat the act of <em>May, </em>1780, which declares that commons, &amp;c. upon the Eastern waters, should not be grantable in future, although the act admits they were so, before the passage thereof; which is only justifiable on the ground of argument now assumed, namely, that they were previously appropriated before any attempt to locate. In fine, no location having been made before the act, no injustice is done the holder, who may still have satisfaction for his warrant on the Western waters, and the meaning of all the laws be preserved: whilst the contrary construction would wholly defeat them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-4\">But, if the warrant were good, the entiy is too vague and uncertain. For, it has no beginning as it ought to have: Nor does it ascer-tain the lands with convenient precision, accoi\u2019ding to the case of <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Call, 206, in this Court. For, it does not appear\u2019, that the lines, described in the entry, do include .the lands in question, upon all sides; and, in point of fact, when the survey came to be made, not more than two of the lines, described in the entry, corresponded with those mentioned in the survey. So, that the entry may have comprehended a great extent of country, and much beyond the quantity contained in the warrant; which was his only authority to locate at all. For, a location without a warrant in possession is actually void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">The question is, whether the caveat shall be sustained? Which can only be, where the party who caveats, has a better right himself, than the per-son applying for the patent; for, as to the point, whether the warrant is sufficient to entitle the holder to locate on the Eastern water-s, that is a matter purely for the consideration of the Register; who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>will refuse the patent if wrong, and grant it, if right. In the present case, <em>Field </em>shews no title; and, therefore, he has no right to prevent a patent, from issuing to another. No injury results from this doctrine; because, the Commonwealth will not be bound by the dismission of the caveat. The act of 1785 does not take away the right, to locate prior warrants, on the Eastern waters. It does not do it in express words; and the tenor of the law is prospective. The Legislature did not mean to take away a vested right, from the holder. The case of commons, &amp;c. stands upon the same grounds as public roads, mill-dams, and other public conveniences. The land warrant was a contract, allowing the holder to locate on any unappropriated lands; and, therefore, any extraordinary attempt, by the Legislature, to diminish the objects of location, would have been a breach of the public faith. The entry was sufficiently certain. For, it is for all the vacant lands lying within certain boundaries; which supersedes the necessity of a beginning; for, that is only requisite, where there are surrounding, unappropriated lands. A caveat is like a declaration; it states facts, and the grounds of objection. But here, if it were even true, that a person, having no title himself might caveat another\u2019s patent, the appellant has not stated, that the warrant could not he located on the Eastern waters, or that the entry was defective.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-8\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-9\">Any person, whether interested or not, may prevent a patent from issuing to a person not having title to one, in order to prevent imposition on the public; and, if nothing of this kind he done in the Register\u2019s Office, the Court, as guardians of the public rights, would <em>ex-officio </em>interpose, where it plainly appeared, that the party was endeavoring to procure a patent, contrary to law. For, although such a patent would be void against a future locator, yet no person would willingly* involve himself in a law suit with another, who was in possession, under a patent issued by the proper authority. The question is not, whether the Legislature could prevent the holders of old warrants, from locating them on the eastern waters, but whether they have not specifically appropriated those lands? For, if so, no injury is done the holders, who may still locate them on. any unappropriated lands. The entry is altogether uncertain. A beginning was clearly necessary, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the appellee\u2019s own argument. For, it does not appear, that there were no surrounding unappropriated lahds, but the contrary; inasmuch as the lines, described in the entry, do not agree with those in the survey. So, that it does not appear, that the entry comprises no more land than is contained in the survey.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b488-6\"><em>PER </em>CUR.</author>\n<p id=\"Abq7\">Affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
