In an action against the Surveyor of a County, for refusing to furnish co_pies of certain surveys of lands which the plaintiff wished to enter as waste and unappropriated; the court on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, instructed the Jury, \u201cthatthe \u201c surveys in question having been made in Way 1774, the Land was liable to be en- \u201c tered as vacant in <em>December </em>1809, <em>unless they -mere returned to the Land office,- </em>\u201c but that the <em>plaintiff </em>was not bound to shew that they were <em>not </em>returned to the \u201c Land office in due time;\u201d and this instruction was not considered erroneous by tiw Court of Appeals.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">A special action on the case was brought, in the Superior Court of Washington County, by <em>Henry, Bowen </em>against <em>Robert Preston.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-11\">The declaration contained two counts. The 1st. stated, that the plaintiff, on the twenty second day of December 1809 applied to the defendant, Surveyor of the County of Washington, at his office in the said County, <em>\u201c </em>for copies of six surveys, which had been <em>\u201c </em>made in the name of and by a certain <em>John Donnell, </em>and <em>\u201c James, Robert </em>and <em>John Barr, </em>(which said surveys are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>\u201c </em>^escr^e(t to have been made, the one half for the said \u201c <em>John Donnell, </em>the other h alf for the said <em>James, Robert </em>\u201c and <em>John Barr, </em>as tenants in common and not as joint- <em>\u201c </em>^enants,) and were of record in the Surveyor\u2019s books \u201c of the said defendant in his said office; the plaintiff be- <em>\u201c </em>ing then and there ready to pay the fees allowed by <em>\u201c </em>law to the defendant, for makiug the said copies, <em>\u201c </em>whose duty it was to furnish them to the plaintiff; he <em>\u201c </em>the said plaintiff wanting them for the purpose of \u201c enabling him to enter and locate the lands circumscrib- <em>\u201c </em>ed and included by the said surveys, <em>which then had \u201c become waste and unappropriated, </em>and to the locating of \u201c which the said copies were essential and important:\u201d that the defendant, contrary to his official duty, delayed and <em>refused </em>to make out and deliver those copies to the plaintiff, and thereby delayed and prevented the plaintiff from making his entries and locations, until other persons, with whom the said defendant had combined and confederated for the purpose of defrauding him, had entered and located the said lands. The 2nd Count stated, that <em>\u201c </em>whereas the plaintiff applied to the defendant <em>\u201c </em>surveyor of Washington County, at his office in said \u00ab County, and furnished him <em>memoranda </em>for copies <em>\u201c </em>of certain surveys, which were of record in the said <em>\u201c </em>office, and were made in the name of <em>John Donnell, </em>and <em>\u201c James, Robert </em>and <em>John Barr </em>and were commonly <em>\u201c </em>known by the name of <em>Donnell\u2019s </em>surveys, and was <em>\u201c </em>then and there ready to pay the fees allowed by law <em>\u201c </em>for making the copies of said surveys, amounting to six \u00ab in number, containing one thousand and fifty four \u201c acres; copies of which said surveys were necessary to <em>\u25a0\u201c </em>enable the plaintiff to enter and locate the said several \u00ab tracts of land, <em>which had then become waste and unap- </em>\u00ab <em>propriated and subject to the location of the plaintiff:\u201d </em>and the defendant <em>fraudulently delayed and refused </em>to make out and deliver those copies to the plaintiff within a reasonable time after the application, and, fraudulently and contrary to official duty, combined with one <em>John Preston junr. </em>and delayed to deliver those copies <em>to the </em>plaintiff, in order to enable the said <em>John Preston </em>junr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>to enter and locate the same lands before the plaintiff; and thereby the plaintiff was prevented from entering the lands, and <em>John Presi\u00f3n junr. </em>was enabled to enter them before him, and did enter and locate them before the plaintiff; and thus the plaintiff was prevented from obtaining the lands; by reason whereof, he was injured, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\">At the trial, upon the plea of <em>not. guilty, </em>the plaintiff offered in evidence genuine copies of four Entries made by <em>John Preston junr., </em>December 23d 1809, (which are set forth in <em>here verba,) </em>with the view of shewing, by that and other evidence, that the defendant and <em>John Preston junr. </em>his confederate had deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity of locating the same lands comprised in the surveys, mentioned in his declaration, copies of which ho also offered in evidence, <em>(in h\u00e6c verba:) </em>whereupon, the defendant objected to the admission of the evidence, on the ground that the description of <em>John Preston junr\u2019s. </em>surveys and entries, in the <em>declaration, </em>was so <em>general </em>and <em>vague </em>that no such evidence ought to be received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">The Court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">Copies of two other Entries by <em>John Preston junr. </em>and two other surveys, (both set forth <em>in hive verba,) </em>were offered by the plaintiff, for the same purpose for which the others were offered as aforesaid. The defendant, for the \u2022same reason, objected, but the Court admitted them also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQV\">The defendant objected, that, the statement in the declaration, <em>that the lands circumscribed and included \u201c within the boundaries of the surveys,\u201d </em>therein referred <em>to,\u00abhad become waste and </em>unappropriated,\u201d(without stating <em>how,) </em>being too <em>vague </em>and <em>general, </em>the Court should not permit any evidence to be given relative to such statement. In this objection, he was again overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-8\">He moved the Court to instruct the Jury, that the surveys mentioned in the declaration, as those of which the plaintiff demanded copies, <em>were legal, valid and subsisting appropriations of She lands </em>therein comprised, at the time when <em>John Preston junr. </em>made his entries, and when the plaintiff was prevented from locating the same land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>as stated in the declaration, <em>unless the plaintiff proved that the survetjs had become void. </em>The Court refused to give such instruction, and, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, in-the Jury, \u201c that, the surveys in question having <em>\u201c </em>been made in May 1774, the land was liable to be en- \u201c tered as vacant land in December 1809, <em>unless they \u201c were returned lo the Land </em>office; but that the plaintiff <em>\u201c </em>was not bound to shew that they were <em>not </em>returned to the Land office in due time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">To these several opinions of the Court, the defendant idled as many bills of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">The Jury found for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages to one thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">After the verdict was rendered, all the evidence, that, had been given on the trial, was stated at large, and made part of the record; and a motion was made for a new trial; 1st, because the Jury had rendered a verdict without <em>sufficient </em>evidence; 2dly, because the damages were excessive. The Court thought the damages excessive, but, on the plaintiff\u2019s releasing $492 part thereof, overruled the motion; whereupon the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">The defendant moved, also, in arrest of judgment; 1st, because the delaration stated no cause of action; no law having imposed it as a duty on the Surveyor to furnish copies of Surveys generally:\u20142dly, because it did not state a case from which the Court could decide that it was not embraced by the 29tli section of the Act concerning the Land Office, passed December 17th, 1792; and Sdly, because the declaration was too general, and wanted precision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">The Court overruled this motion also, and entered judgment for the plaintiff for $508, damages, and costs; from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-10\"><em>Stanard </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJcu\"><em>waived the objections taken at the </em>trial, but insisted on the reasons assigned for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment. He also remarked, that the appellant'was not apprised by the plaintiff of the purpose for which the copies were wanted, in order that he might know the importance of a prompt and immediate compliance with the request.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>Leigh </em>tor the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Kd\">By the errors in arrest of judgment it is objected to the declaration, that it states no cause of action, because no law has imposed on the Surveyor the duty of furnishing copies of surveys, generally. I own, 1 can find no <em>such </em>law. Neither can I find any law <em>imposing it as a duty </em>on the Register of the Land Office <em>to furnish copies </em>of Patents. The Land law says, only, that the Patent shall be recorded by the Register, and that a copy attested by him shall be as good evidence as the <em>original.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So, too, 1 have searched in vain for a law <em>requiring </em>the Clerks of any of the Courts of Justice to furnish copies of Deeds, Wills or Records, generally. Will this Court then adopt a principle, which, exempting a Surveyor from the duty of furnishing copies of documents recorded in his ofiice, will go the length of exempting the Register from the duty of furnishing Copies of Patents, and the clerks of the Courts of Justice from furnishing copies of records and instruments recorded in their respective offices? But the offices of the Register and the Clerks ai\u2019e public offices, for recording, and thereby preserving, certain muniments of titles and rights; and certain fees are allowed them by law, for furnishing copies required of them:\u2014it results then, from the very nature and end of the institution, that they are <em>hound </em>to furnish copies. In like manner, the Surveyor\u2019s office is a public office instituted by law for recording and preserving certain muniments of the <em>inception of titles; </em>fees are appointed by law for copies furnished by him; and therefore it follows, from the nature and end of the institution, that every Surveyor is <em>bound </em>to furnish coin\u00e9s of documents recorded in his office. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> It is provided in the Land Law,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> that the Surveyor shall not, within twelve months after a survey made, issue or deliver any certificate, copy or plat of land, except to the persons for whom the survey was made, or their order, unless in cases of Caveats. But for this provision, the Surveyor would have been bound, at <em>any </em>time, to deliver Copies of surveys to any body demanding the same:\u2014the provision plainly supposes that such had been, his duty. Except in the ease so provided for, any per*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>son is entitled to demand a copy of any survey. It is farther provided, <em>(d) </em>that it shall not he lawful for the surveyor to withhold from any person entitled to deman&lt;* ^ie same\u00bb a plat hy him demanded; saving tliat he shall not be bound to deliver a plat to any non-resident, \u2019till his fees are paid or secured. This provision furnishes foundation enough to sustain the present action, even if it were founded on the Surveyor\u2019s refusal to furnish the Copy, simply. Blit that is not the only foundation of the action. The declaration charges that the Surveyor confederated with another to deprive the plaintiff of his location, and to vest the fruits of his diligence in such confederate: a proceeding surely contrary to his; official duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZX\">It is also objected to the declaration, that it docs not state a case from which the Court can decide that it Avas not embraced by the 29th section of the land laAV, before cited. But, if the Surveyor was bound to furnish copies generally, and he could have defended himself on the ground that <em>these </em>copies Avere not demandablc by the plaintiff, as being within the exception provided by that section, <em>he </em>ought to have <em>pleaded </em>that matter specially\u00bb The declaration alledges, substantially, that the copies demanded were not Avithin that exception; for it says that it was <em>his official duty\u25a0 </em>to furnish them, which could not be, if the provisions of that section applied to the case. IIoAATever, all objections of this kind to the declaration, are cured by the verdict. It cures omissions of averments of any matter, without proving Avhich the Jury ought not to have given such verdict; and this they should not have done, if it was not proved that the copy of the survey was demanded more than tAvelve months after it was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">As to Mr. <em>Stanard\u2019s </em>objection, that the appellant was not apprised by the plaintiff of the purpose for which he wanted the copies, the answer (which has been anticipated, and is I think conclusive,) is, that the declaration alledges that the defendant not only <em>failed, </em>but <em>fraudulently refused </em>to furnish the copies. The action Avas not brought for mere neglect of duty, but for a wilful and vicious denial of right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The defendant\u2019s exception to the Court\u2019s refusal of a new trial, can not be supported. The first ground of the motion, that the evidence was not <em>sufficient </em>to warrant the verdict, is surely untenable. The Jury, (not the Court,) is to judge of the <em>sufficiency </em>of testimony, unless it be withdrawn from their cognizance by a <em>demurrer </em>to the evidence.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Upon the second objection to the verdict, the defendant, in fact, <em>succeeded. </em>The Court refused the new trial, only because the plaintiff released nearly half the damages assessed by the Jury. It does not appear that the defendant himself, after that release, made any complaint as to the <em>quantum </em>of damages.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> Ed\u2019n. of 1794, 1803 and 1814, c. 86, \u00a7 43, 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"><em> </em>Ed\u2019n. of 1794, 1803 and 1814, c. 86, \u00a7 25, 27, 28, 55; <em>Ibid, </em>c. 115. \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> <em>Ibid </em>\u00a7 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"AZbj\"> Note.
