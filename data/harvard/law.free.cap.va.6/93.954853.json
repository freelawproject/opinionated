Mitchell, </em>under an older and better title. It appears that <em>William Moore </em>of <em>North Carolina </em>claimed to own three small tracts of land in the county of <em>Carroll, </em>adjoining each other, one containing seventy, one fifty-eight, and the other one hundred acres. When these tracts came to be surveyed, it was ascertained that two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of them laid on the northeast of <em>Cranberry </em>creek, and ^e greater part of the other on the southwest of the creek; hut when the purchases hereinafter mentioned were made it was not supposed that <em>Moore </em>owned any ]an\u00bf southwest of the creek. In fact the whole of the tract of seventy acres which was on the southwest of the creek, was held and occupied by <em>John B. Mitchell, </em>under another and older <em>title; </em>and his land was bounded by <em>Cranberry </em>creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-4\">In 1835 or \u201936 <em>John B. Mitchell, </em>acting for himself and <em>James Stafford, </em>purchased <em>Moore\u2019s </em>lands; and at that time neither of them knew or supposed that any part of them laid southwest of <em>Cranberry </em>creek. They agreed upon a division line between them, by which the land lying along the creek on the northeast side thereof, was allotted to <em>Mitchell; </em>and this land thus allotted to <em>Mitchell </em>separated the lands of <em>Moore, </em>which laid on the northeast of the creek, from the creek, except for a very short space.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">After <em>Mitchell </em>and <em>Stafford </em>had fixed their division line, and before <em>Moore\u2019s </em>conveyance to them had been fully executed, though it had been prepared, <em>Stafford </em>sold to the plaintiff <em>White </em>his portion of the land bought of <em>Moore, </em>for the price of 300 dollars, reserving a small portion; and then it was agreed between <em>Stafford, Mitchell </em>and <em>White, </em>that <em>Moore </em>should execute to <em>White </em>a deed for the whole of the land, and <em>White </em>should convey to <em>Mitchell </em>his part of it, and to <em>Stafford </em>the small piece reserved by him. <em>Moore </em>accordingly conveyed to <em>White, </em>and <em>White </em>conveyed to <em>Mitchell.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">At the time <em>White </em>purchased of <em>Stafford, </em>it does not appear to have been known that any part of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>land laid southwest of the creek, but it being ascertained that the deed from <em>Moore </em>to him embraced land there, which was in the possession <em>of Mitchell, </em>who held under a better title than <em>Moore\u2019s, White </em>claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>this land was embraced in his purchase from <em>Stafford, </em>and that he was therefore entitled to an abatement from the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-4\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court below perpetuated the injunction; and thereupon, <em>Stafford </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-5\"><em>John T. Anderson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-6\"><em>Floyd, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b115-7\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_m\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The Court is of opinion, that it fully appears the parties at the time of the contract for the sale and purchase of the land in the proceedings mentioned, supposed that the lands were bounded on the southwest by <em>Cranberry </em>creek, and did not know that the lines called for in <em>Moore\u2019s </em>grants included any land on the southwest of said creek; the same being then, in the possession of <em>John B. Mitchell, </em>who held under what is admitted by the parties to be an older and better title. It furthermore appears, that at the time of the contract certain portions of the laud on the northeast side of said creek were reserved by the appellant out of the sale, for the benefit of himself and said <em>John B. Mitchell, </em>which reservations were made by metes and bounds, but the quantity thereof was not ascertained. And for the residue of the <em>Moore </em>tracts, so supposed by the parties to be situate on the northeast side of the creek, the appellee agreed to pay an aggregate sum, without reference to any specific quantity. The appellee has therefore in fact obtained the land for which the parties supposed they were contracting, and for which he agreed to pay the stipulated price, and although in running the lines, it turns out that the boundaries called for in the <em>Moore </em>grants, extend across <em>Cranberry </em>creek, and include land on the southwest side thereof, held by <em>Mitchell </em>under a better title, this fact does not entitle the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>pellee to any deduction from the purchase money. The Court is therefore of opinion that the decree perpetuating the injunction is erroneous, and the same is reversed with costs to the appellant. And this Court proceeding, &amp;c., dissolves the injunction and dismisses the bill with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
