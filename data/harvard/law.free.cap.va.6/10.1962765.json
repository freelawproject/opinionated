Plea <em>non detinet. </em>Verdict for plaintiff for the slave, of $100 value, and $886 damages for detention; subject to the opinion of the Court on a demurrer to evidence, which set forth, (among other matters,) 1. the record of an action of detinue for the same slave, brought in the County Court' of Fauquier by <em>Thomas Withers, </em>in which he recovered judgment against <em>Enoch R. Withers, </em>(in August 1794,) for the slave, of 100l value, and <em>SQL </em>damages:\u2014 2. the record of a suit in the same County Court in Chancery, wherein <em>Enoch R. Withers </em>was plaintiff, alledging in his hill, that the said slave had been <em>given </em>to him by <em>Thomas Withers </em>(who was his father,) and that the trial of the action of detinue was had in the absence of his witnesses, so that he was unable - to make defence at law; and therefore praying an injunction, which was granted:\u2014the said record shewing, also, that the suit abated in March 1795, by the death of <em>Thomas Withers, </em>and was revived against his executors^ after which, (in the year 1796,) the complainant took three depositions, proving the gift aliedged in the bill,*'\u2014an answer was filed by the executors, in 1809, denying the complainant\u2019s allegations; and, in 1813, the suit abated by Ms death:\u20143. proof of the identity of the slave; of his being in the possession of <em>Enoch R.

If the title be by a Judgment, the plaintiff may recover upon that title, by giving the judgment in evidence, as he might a bill of sale.\u2014A <em>scire facias </em>would not have been a complete remedy:\u2014it would not have given the intermediate damages, for detention of the slave, subsequent to the judgment, while the suit in Chancery was pending.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\"><em>Call </em>in reply. The form of the declaration in detinue is, in general, such as, Mr. <em>Leigh </em>states; hut where detinue is brought on a Judgment, it is necessary to set it forth particularly, to prevent the defendant from being harrassed twice for the sam\u00e9 thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">The plaintiff can get no better remedy by action of detinue, than he might by <em>sdre </em>facias.\u2014According to the principle of Mr. <em>Leigh\u2019s </em>argument, a plaintiff, having obtained a Judgment in <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>might bring the same action again, and give the judgment in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-9\">The doctrine is laid down in <em>Murrell </em>v. <em>Johnson\u2019s adm\u2019r. </em>1 <em>H.

It is true that the point was not <em>involved in the decision </em>of that case; but this Court expressed it\u2019s <em>disapprobation </em>of the instruction given to the Jury by the District Court; which instruction was, that a recovery of the slave <em>might </em>be had in such subsequent action, unless the defendant to such action could prove payment of the value of the slave, by the original defendant, to the plaintiff.-If the converse of this proposition, viz. that such recovery cannot he had against a third per, son, while the judgment against the original defendant remains unsatisfied, be incorrect, <em>&lt;\u00a1usre, </em>under what circumstances could such recow 'ery be had?</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-13\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AfT\">pronounced the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">The Court, (not deciding whether an action, other than a <em>scire facias, </em>can be maintained on a judgment in detinue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>or n\u00f3t~) is of opinion, that the present action is not brought upQn the judgment, but is a new action of detinue, in which the former judgment is not declared upon, but is oniy relied upon as evidence of title, and not as fixing the value and damages, as to which, this action is in the nature of a new trial, in a case in which there has already been a judgment.-The judgment is therefore reversed with costs; amj judgi~ent is to be entered for th~ appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
