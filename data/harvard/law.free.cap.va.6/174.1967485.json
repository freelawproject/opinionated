Of which the said defendant had notice, by reason of all which premises the said defendant became liable to pay to the said plaintiff, the said 222/. <em>5s. </em>7S-, and being so liable, he afterwards, to wit: on the day and year last mentioned, at the county aforesaid, in consideration thereof, undertook and faithfully promised that he would pay the said 222/ <em>5$. </em>7a. to the said <em>Benjamin, </em>whenever he should be afterwards thereto required. Nevertheless the said <em>Alexander, </em>although often required, hath not yet paid the said 222/. <em>5s. </em>7g. to the said <em>Benjamin, </em>but hitherto to pay the same hath refused and still doth refuse to the damage of the said plaintiff of sixty pounds, and, therefore, he brings suit, &amp;c. Plea, <em>non assumpsit, </em>and issue. Upon the trial of the cause, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions, which stated, that \u201c the defendant moved the Court to. instruct the jury, that the 10 <em>per cent, </em>before the appeal was dismissed, was not due, and was not included in the contract stated in the declaration. It appealing, also, from the record, that the appeal mentioned in the declaration was dismissed in the year 1791; but the Court, being divided, did not instruct the jury, for the following reasons: because it depended upon the evidence, what the parties agreed was due, at the time the contract was made for the dismission, and because the jury were the judges of the said contract, which was verbal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">There is a copy of the order for dismissing the appeal, copied by the Clerk into the record, which is in these words: <em>\u201cFredericksburg </em>District Court, <em>April </em>30th, 1791. <em>Alexander Spotswood, </em>appellant, against <em>Benjamin Pendletbn, </em>appellee, upon an appeal. .This suit being agreed between the parties, it is dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-10\">The judgment is not described with sufficient precision, as it is the foundation and <em>gist </em>of the action. But, if it was, still the action could not be maintained; because, it is <em>assumpsit </em>for matter of record: Which' will not lie, as the party has a higher remedy: Consequently, if it were true that it lay for the damages, it would not for the judgment itself. Besides, the Court left the question of damages to the jury improperly: 1. Because, the evidence did not correspond with the declaration; which ought to have stated the amount of the damages: 2. Because, the amount of the damages was a question of law; and, therefore, should have been decided by the Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-12\"><em>Randolph, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-13\">The justice of the case has certainly been attained, and therefore every thing is to be presumed in favor of the judgment. The assumpsit was not in consideration of the judgment, but of the dismission; and the judgment was gone by the appeal, having been dismissed agreed. The description is particular enough; because, it is sufficient notice to the defendant. The evidence does correspond with the declaration; for it is averred, that the defendant promised to pay the amount of the damages, in consideration that the plaintiff would suffer a dismission of the appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-14\">There was nothing improper in leaving the question, concerning the damages, to the jury; because, it was a matter of calculation, more than of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-15\">Wickham,,in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-16\">It is not true that the former judgment was gone by the dismission; for, that only means that the parties relinquished the question concerning the errors, but the judgment remained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-17\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AVzv\">LYONS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A59V\">Delivered the resolution of the Court, that there was no error in the judgment.
