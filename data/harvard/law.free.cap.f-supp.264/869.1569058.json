Newton Trucking Company (\u201cNewton\u201d) brings this action to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and to remand the proceedings to the Commission for interpretation or amendment of its certificate of public convenience and necessity to include authority \u201cenabling continued complete service by it throughout the territory in which it operates\u201d as a motor carrier of frozen fruits, frozen berries, and frozen vegetables.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is the decision of the district court which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1336 and which is composed of three judges as required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2325 and as constituted pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, defendants, admit that Newton as required by 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 17(9), 305(g) and (h) has exhausted its administrative remedies through proceedings begun back in 1958. Newton filed with the Commission a \u201cgrandfather\u201d application under \u00a7 7(c) of the Transportation Act of 1958 (P.L. 85-625; 72 Stat. 568), and later a second application pursuant to 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307 seeking an extension of its authority in the event it was not satisfied with the scope of its existing authority as determined in the \u201cgrandfather\u201d proceedings. The \u201cgrandfather\u201d and extension proceedings were consolidated and division 1 of the Commission granted Newton limited authority under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision (84 M.C.C. 759). Division 1 also granted certain new authority in the extension proceedings, but then reversed itself and denied Newton\u2019s extension application in its entirety (89 M.C.C. 269). Newton thereupon filed the present action. Thereafter, the Commission on its own motion reconsidered its prior orders, modifying the order on Newton\u2019s \u201cgrandfather\u201d application and again denying Newton\u2019s extension application (98 M.C.C. 702). Still not satisfied, Newton filed a supplement to its original complaint by which it sought to set aside the latest Commission order. It is that order we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Newton advances three arguments in support of its contention that the Commission erred in refusing to grant broad authority for transportation of frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables throughout some sixteen Eastern states. Newton first declares that its present certificates should be construed to grant authority to transport frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables not only under the commodity descriptions \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d, as the Commission held, but also under the headings of \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d and \u201cfarm produce\u201d, which the Commission denied. If we accepted this first argument that Newton\u2019s present certificates already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>authorize the desired full scope of transportation, it would of course become unnecessary to proceed further to Newton\u2019s second and third arguments under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d and extension provisions, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Newton\u2019s first argument based on its outstanding certificates requires reference to \u00a7 203(b) (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act. This section excepted from regulation under the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">\u201cmotor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of * * * agricultural * * * commodities (not including manufactured products thereof), if such motor vehicles are not used in carrying any other property, or passengers, for compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The Interstate Commerce Commission adopted a strict construction of this exception in two of its aspects. First, the Commission interpreted the exemption to apply only to the carrying of agricultural commodities in vehicles never used for carrying non-exempt products (i. e., in vehicles which were not \u201ctainted\u201d). Second, the Commission interpreted the exemption to apply only to agricultural commodities essentially in their natural state.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The courts, however, adopted a more liberal approach toward this exception. As to the first aspect, the courts held that the exemption extended to all transportation of exempt agricultural commodities even in \u201ctainted\u201d vehicles except in mixed loads with non-exempt products. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Dunn, 166 F.2d 116 (5th Cir. 1948); Interstate Commerce Commission v. Service Trucking Co., Inc., 186 F.2d 400 (3rd Cir. 1951). This judicial interpretation has not been altered by later judicial or Congressional developments and remains the law today. As to the second aspect, the courts held in a series of decisions that various degrees of processing did not remove agricultural products from the agricultural commodities exception. For example, it was held that the exemption covered otherwise exempt agricultural commodities in a fresh frozen state. Home Transfer &amp; Storage Co. v. United States, 141 F.Supp. 599 (D.C.Wash.1956), affd. per. cur., 352 U.S. 884, 77 S.Ct. 129, 1 L.Ed.2d 82 (1956); Frozen Food Express v. United States, 148 F.Supp. 399 (D.C.Texas 1956), affd. per cur. 355 U.S. 6, 78 S.Ct. 38, 2 L.Ed.2d 22 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">In order to halt the continued expansion of the agricultural commodities exemption and to return to regulation some eleven items including frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables, Congress passed the Transportation Act of 1958.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A saving clause was provided to give effect to certain certificates which the Commission had issued under its assumption of jurisdiction but which contrary judicial decisions prior to the Transportation Act had held were not required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>In addition, a \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause was provided to protect carriers who had been engaged without certificates of authority in the <em>bona fide </em>transportation of commodities theretofore exempt from regulation but thereafter to be subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>\u201cUnless otherwise specifically indicated therein, the holder of any certificate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>permit heretofore issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, or hereafter so issued pursuant to an application filed on or before the date on which this section takes effect, authorizing the holder thereof to engage as a common or contract carrier by motor vehicle in the transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of property made subject to the provisions of part II of the Interstate Commerce Act by paragraph (a) of this section, over any route or routes or within any territory, may without making application under that Act engage, to the same extent and subject to the same terms, conditions and limitations, as a common or contract carrier by motor vehicle, as the case may be, in the transportation of such property, over such route or routes or within such territory, in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">The specific problem raised by New^ ton\u2019s first argument is to determine as a matter of statutory construction of section 7(b) of the Transportation Act of 1958 the extent to which Newton may transport frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables under the certificates it held before the effective date of the Act in 1958. In the 1930s Lester C. Newton, the proprietor of the business which later was incorporated, obtained a certificate authorizing the transportation of numerous special products and agricultural commodities. After the development of processes for the freezing of foods, Newton in the early 1940s sought permission te) transport fresh frozen berries, fruits and vegetables and other frozen products under its then existing \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d authority. In Newton Extension-Frozen Foods, 43 M.C.C. 787 (1944), the Commission denied that these frozen items were exempt agricultural commodities, but granted Newton certain new authority to transport frozen products under \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d clauses. It is this \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority which Newton under the Commission\u2019s construction of \u00a7 7(b) retains after the Transportation Act of 1958 removed the exemption of frozen fruits, berries and vegetables.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Newton argues that a re-evaluation of its certificates is required as a result of the judicial interpretations of the agricultural commodities exemption subsequent to the Commission\u2019s ruling in the Newton extension case of 1944. Newton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>contends that the moment before the effective date of the Act the \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d clause in its certificates included frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables. Therefore, Newton concludes, it may continue to engage in the transportation of these frozen products under its \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d and \u201cfarm produce\u201d authorities which are preserved by \u00a7 7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The Commission responds to Newton\u2019s argument by attacking the proposition that the moment before the effective date of the Act the \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d clause in Newton\u2019s certificates encompassed frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables. Division 1 argued that Newton\u2019s \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d certificates were issued at a time when frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables were not considered to be within that class:</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">\u201cIn view of this Commission\u2019s past interpretation of Section 203(b) (6) of the act, there is no doubt but that Newton\u2019s certificates authorizing the transportation of agricultural commodities or farm produce were not, at the time of their issuance, intended to authorize the transportation of frozen fruits, berries, or vegetables.\u201d (84 M.C.C. 759, 768, confirmed 98 M.C.C. 702, 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The implication of the Commission\u2019s argument is that \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d certificates would be saved by section 7(b) if issued after the 1956 judicial decisions which held that frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables were within that class. In fact, the Commission has so held, citing the Newton proceedings, in Chesapeake Motor Lines, Inc., Common Carrier \u201cGrandfather\u201d Application, 89 M.C.C. 237 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">We find some difficulty in accepting the Commission\u2019s interpretation that the coverage of the \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d class remains fixed as of the time of issuance of such a certificate. \u201cAgricultural commodities\u201d are those products, whatever they might be at any point in time, which are exempt under \u00a7 203(b) (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act when carried in straight loads. Therefore, the purpose of a Commission \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d certificate can only be to authorize the transportation of these items in mixed loads with non-exempt goods.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As judicial or legislative changes are made in the items encompassed within the \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d exemption of the Interstate Commerce Act, it is arguable that there are corresponding changes in the coverage of \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d certificates. Accordingly, it might well be concluded that the moment before the effective date of the Transportation Act of 1958 Newton\u2019s \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d and \u201cfarm produce\u201d authorities permitted transportation of frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables in mixed loads with non-exempt products.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">However, we find it unnecessary to resolve this issue as to the coverage of Newton\u2019s \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d certificates. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are included, we conclude from the language and legislative history of the Transportation Act of 1958 that \u00a7 7(b) does not save this \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d authority to haul frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables in mixed loads with nonexempt products.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Section 7(b), like section 7(c), refers to the \u201ctransportation * * * of property made subject to the provisions of part II of the Interstate Commerce Act by paragraph (a) of this section.\u201d Thus, we think the Commission reached the correct conclusion that Newton could continue the transportation of frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables in straight loads under certificates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>authorizing the transportation of \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d. Such certificates authorize the transportation of \u201cproperty made subject to\u201d the Interstate Commerce Act because the transportation in straight loads of certain \u201cfrozen foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d had been held to be exempt by the courts and was made subject to regulation by the Transportation Act of 1958. By the same token, we believe the Commission reached the correct conclusion that Newton could not continue the transportation of frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables in mixed loads with nonexempt products under certificates authorizing the transportation of \u201cfarm produce\u201d and \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d. Such certificates do not authorize the transportation of \u201cproperty made subject to\u201d the Interstate Commerce Act because the transportation of \u201cfarm produce\u201d and \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d in mixed loads with non-exempt products had not been held to be exempt by the courts but was already regulated prior to the Transportation Act of 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The legislative history of the Transportation Act of 1958 also supports the conclusion that section 7(b) did not save Newton\u2019s authority to transport frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables in mixed loads with non-exempt products under its \u201cfarm produce\u201d and \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d certificates. House Report No. 1922 indicates that the amendment of 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(b) (6) \u201cfreezes the so-called agricultural exemption from motor-carrier regulation by the Commission to the present list of exemptions, except for a roll-back on frozen fruits, frozen berries, frozen vegetables * * * (i. e., these articles would no longer be exempt).\u201d 1958 U. S. Code Cong, and Admin. News, p. 3457. Other passages from this report make it clear that the Transportation Act of 1958 was intended to \u201coverrule\u201d the <em>Home Transfer </em>and <em>Frozen Food </em>cases which had exempted frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables when carried in straight loads. There is absolutely no indication that the Act intended to deal with the regulation of otherwise exempt commodities when transported in mixed loads with nonexempt commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The conclusion we reach, then, is that Newton may continue the transportation of frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables in straight loads to the extent the Commission authorized such transportation under the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d descriptions in its certificates issued before 1958. Other rights claimed by Newton must find their support, if at all, not under the \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d and \u201cfarm produce\u201d clauses of its certificates, but under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d or extension provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Newton\u2019s second argument is that the Commission unduly restricted its grant of authority under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision, \u00a7 7(c) of the Transportation Act of 1958, as a result of an inappropriate statistical analysis of the carrier\u2019s past shipments and a disregard of the territorial nature of its service and the transportation characteristics of the frozen foods involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The governing legal principles are clear. In Alton R. Co. v. United States, 315 U.S. 15, 62 S.Ct. 432, 86 L.Ed. 586 (1942), the Supreme Court stated the basic propositions which have often been reaffirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-9\">\u201c \u2018Territory\u2019 is not a word of art. The characteristics of the transportation service involved as well as the geographical area serviced are relevant to the territorial scope of the operations which may be authorized under the \u2018grandfather clause\u2019. While the test of \u2018bona fide operation\u2019 within a specified \u2018territory\u2019 includes \u2018actual rather than potential or simulated service\u2019 (McDonald v. Thompson, 305 U.S. 263, 266, 59 S.Ct. 176, 83 L.Ed. 164), it does not necessarily restrict future operations to the precise points or areas already served. The characteristics of the transportation service rendered may of necessity have made trips to any specified locality irregular or sporadic. And they may likewise have restricted prior operations to but a few points in a wide area which the carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>held itself out as being willing and able to serve.\u201d (315 U.S. 15, 20-21, 62 S.Ct. 432, 436).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">In addition to repeating these principles, the Court in United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 315 U.S. 475, 62 S.Ct. 722, 86 L.Ed. 971 (1942), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">\u201cThe Act provides the test of \u2018bona fide operation\u2019. That standard carries the connotation of substantiality. It also makes clear that a holding out to serve a specified area is not alone sufficient. * * * Substantial, as distinguished from incidental, sporadic, or infrequent, service is required. * * * In addition, the Commission, in determining the precise territory which may be served by a particular carrier cannot be unmindful of its responsibility to coordinate the various transportation agencies which constitute our national transportation system * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">\u201c* * * [T] he purpose of the\u2018grandfather clause\u2019 was to assure those to whom Congress had extended its benefits a \u2018substantial parity between future operations and prior <em>bona, fide </em>operations\u2019.\u201d (315 U.S. 475, 480-481, 62 S.Ct. 722, 726).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">With a terse per curiam opinion (three justices dissenting), the Supreme Court in Willis Shaw Frozen Express, Inc. v. United States, 377 U.S. 159, 84 S.Ct. 1154, 12 L.Ed.2d 211 (1964), made it clear that the Interstate Commerce Commission must apply these standards under the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d of the Transportation Act of 1958:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">\u201cWe think United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 315 U.S. 475, 62 S.Ct. 722, 86 L.Ed. 971, requires reversal of the judgment and a remand to the Commission for reconsideration in light of appellant\u2019s status and performance as a common carrier, the transportation characteristics and marketing pattern of these seasonal agricultural products, and the demonstrated ability of appellant to perform the services.\u201d (377 U.S. 159, 159-160, 84 S.Ct. 1154, 1155).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">In its final report in the case under consideration here, the Commission indicated its awareness of these principles when it cited the <em>Carolina Freight </em>case and stated that \u201cthe characteristics of the transportation service rendered are relevant to the territorial scope of the operations to be authorized.\u201d (98 M.C.C. 702, 706). Our subsequent specific review of the Commission\u2019s conclusions will also consider Newton\u2019s evidence of the factors listed in the <em>Willis Shaw </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">While the relevant legal principles are thus quite apparent, there is considerable difficulty in applying them to peculiar facts and circumstances in each case. Several recent eases have arisen in which the courts have found error in the Commission\u2019s treatment of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d question. These cases provide a convenient starting place for analysis of the Commission\u2019s action in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Many of the cases have involved the issue of what period of operations is relevant to the statutory date of May 1, 1958. For example, in Frozen Food Express v. United States, 219 F.Supp. 131 (D.C.Texas 1963), the Commission had refused to consider shipments transported prior to January 1, 1957 as being too remote. The Court held that there was error in the selection of this cut-off date, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">\u201cThe plaintiff should have been given an opportunity to show the nature and extent of its operations for a sufficient period prior to 1957 to prevent any distortion of the true pattern of its activities due to a variance in seasons and in the other factors that affect crops of the kind here involved.\u201d (219 F.Supp. 131, 139).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">See also Winter Garden Co. v. United States, 211 F.Supp. 280 (D.C.Tenn. 1962) ; Hale Distributing Co. v. United States, 221 F.Supp. 266 (D.C.Calif. 1963) . In the case presently under consideration, although Division 1 stated that certain shipments transported by Newton in 1956 were \u201ctoo remote from the statutory date of May 1, 1958, to establish bona fide operations thereon, and will not be considered by us\u201d (84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>M.C.C. 759, 774), the full Commission on reconsideration included these 1956 shipments in its analysis (98 M.C.C. 702, 704, 707-708). Our review likewise will include consideration of Newton\u2019s evidence of shipments in 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">Another issue raised in the cases is whether frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables should be considered as a single commodity class for purposes of analyzing bona fide operations under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d cl\u00e1use. For instance, in Winter Garden Co. v. United States, 211 F.Supp. 280 (D.C.Tenn.1963), the Court held that in certain instances the Commission committed error by restricting authority to frozen berries to the exclusion of frozen vegetables. See also Frozen Food Express v. United States, 219 F.Supp. 131 (D.C.Texas 1963); Willis Shaw Frozen Express, Inc. v. United States, 256 F.Supp. 257 (D.C.Ark.1966). In the case presently under consideration, although Division 1 in its findings treated the three commodities in separate classes (84 M.C.C. 759, 771), the full Commission on reconsideration stated that it was \u201cinclined to believe that the evidence considered as a whole supports the view that the three involved commodities have been handled by applicant as a single class, and they will be so regarded herein\u201d. (98 M.C.C. 702, 707). Accordingly, in our review we also will treat the commodities as being in a single class.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">We turn now to a specific consideration of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority which the Commission granted on the basis of the evidence submitted by Newton. In particular, we must review the evidence upon which the Commission determined the extent of Newton\u2019s actual bona fide operation as contrasted with mere holding out. In undertaking this task we are not unmindful that \u201cthe precise delineation of the area or the specification of localities which may be serviced has been entrusted by the Congress to the Commission\u201d, United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 315 U.S. 475, 480, 62 S.Ct. 722, 86 L.Ed. 971 (1942), and that \u201cthe judgment required is highly expert. Only where the error is patent may we say that the Commission transgressed\u201d. Ibid., at 482, 62 S.Ct. at 726. In fact, the United States Supreme Court in a case involving review of a Commission action in another area has very recently reversed a judgment of a three-judge District Court on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">\u201cAs we said in Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n., 383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966), \u2018the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence\u2019. It is not for the court to strike down conclusions that are reasonably drawn from the evidence and findings in the case. Its duty is to determine whether the evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s findings is substantial, Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474 (1951) 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.\u201d Illinois Central R. Co. v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co., 385 U.S. 57, 87 S.Ct. 255, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (November 14, 1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">It appears from the evidence before the Commission that Newton is an irregular-route motor common carrier operating 16 tractors and trailers, 15 of which are refrigerated, from a base terminal in Bridgeville, Delaware. Two shippers appeared before the Commission in support of Newton's application. One, John H. Dulany &amp; Son, Inc., ships the frozen foods involved from its own processing plants at Bridgeville, Delaware and Exmore, Virginia and from co-processors elsewhere to warehouses and distributors in the territory under consideration. The other, Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby, ships frozen foods from its processing plant at Houston, Delaware and warehouses elsewhere to customers and other warehouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Newton submitted into evidence a record of some 225 separate trips it made during the years 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1959. This record included all of the shipments of the involved commodities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>handled by Newton from January 14, 1957 through November 19, 1959, except those originating from Exmore, Virginia and Bridgeville, Dover and Houston, Delaware; seven shipments in 1956 also claimed by another trucker; and shipments hauled by Newton from Exmore, Bridgeville, Dover, and Houston during the month of August of the years 1957, 1958, and 1959.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While we recognize that Newton during these years may have engaged in transportation which is not of record, we are limited to these 225 or so trips to the extent Newton\u2019s actual performance is relevant in our review of the Commission\u2019s action. Newton itself has made the decision to base its \u201cgrandfather\u201d application on these 225 or so trips and we cannot speculate on the impression which might have been created by a record which contained a different sampling, or indeed all, of the trips Newton undertook during this or any other period of time. Of course, as we have seen the law requires, we also look beyond the actual trips to other factors which might indicate that the particular hauls are representative of a broader service.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">It will be useful to break our analysis down into three stages corresponding to the three areas of operation Newton desires to have authorized.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At each stage we shall compare the authority Newton sought with the authority the Commission granted and analyze the evi-deuce of shipments not only actually made but also authorized to be made under Newton\u2019s \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d clauses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For we agree with the Commission below that:</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">\u201cTo exclude from consideration shipments which might have been transported under authority then held by applicant would create a fragmented hnd distorted view of the totality of applicant\u2019s operation and constitute a serious impediment to the achievement of substantial parity between applicant\u2019s past and future service. Indeed, such a conclusion would, in effect, penalize applicant for holding certificates authorizing broad \u2018general commodity\u2019 and \u2018frozen food\u2019 authority.\u201d (98 M.C.C. 702, 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">Newton first requested authority to transport the frozen foods involved throughout the Middle Atlantic area of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The Commission granted Newton an area-wide authority between all points within a central core comprised of Maryland, Delaware, that part of Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula, and Washington, D. C. The Commission made this grant on the basis of Newton\u2019s evidence of some 85 shipments between points within this area, and on the basis of the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>The Commission also granted Newton authority from all points in New York to all points within the central core area. The Commission made this grant on the basis of Newton\u2019s evidence of 8 shipments from points in New York to points within the central core, and on the basis of the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the Commission granted Newton authority in the opposite direction from all points within the central core area to all points in New York. The Commission made this grant on the basis of Newton\u2019s evidence of 39 shipments from points within the central core to points in New York, and on the basis of the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">The Commission also granted Newton authority from all points within the central core area to all points in Pennsylvania. This grant was made on the basis of Newton\u2019s evidence of 21 shipments from points within the central core to points in Pennsylvania, and on the basis of the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the Commission granted Newton authority in the opposite direction from all points in Pennsylvania to Exmore, Ya. This grant was made on the basis of Newton\u2019s evidence of 15 shipments from points in Pennsylvania to Exmore, Va.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Finally, the Commission granted Newton authority from all points within the central core area to Kearney and Jersey City, N. J. The Commission made this grant on the basis of 5 shipments from points within the central core to Kearney and Jersey City, N. J., and on the basis of the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">It appears from the foregoing analysis that, while the Commission granted rather extensive authority within the Middle Atlantic area, it failed to grant the full authority Newton desires. There was some evidence which might have been a basis for further grants of authority. A statewide authority to New Jersey from the central core might have been based on Newton\u2019s evidence of a single shipment from Exmore, Va. to Spring Lake, N. J., and on the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>we believe that the Commission\u2019s decision was adequately supported by its judgment that \u201ca single shipment to Spring Lake, N. J., in 1959 appears to have been an isolated one which does not, in our opinion, warrant additional rights\u201d. (98 M.C.C. 702, 708). Nor can Newton be greatly hurt by this conclusion because it possesses \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority from Exmore, Va., and Bridge-ville and Dover, Delaware to all points in New Jersey and \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority between all points in the central core, authorities which together allow it to go from all points in the central core to all points in New Jersey by following sometimes circuitous routes through Exmore, Va., or Bridgeville or Dover, Del.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Again, there was some evidence which might have been a basis for a further grant of authority from all points in New Jersey back to the central core area, namely, the \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d and \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, as Newton submitted no evidence of transportation from New Jersey to the central core we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s judgment not to grant such authority was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\"> Newton also submitted evidence of one trip from Seabrook, N. J. to Norfolk and Roanoke, Virginia which might have been the basis for additional grandfather rights. But we cannot substitute our judgment for the Commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201ca split load from Seabrook, N. J., to Norfolk and Roanoke, Va., in 1957 * * * [is] not demonstrative of continuous operations justifying a \u2018grandfather\u2019 grant\u201d. 98 M.C.C. 702, 707). Newton also submitted evidence of a shipment from Salisbury, Md. to Norfolk, Va. which, together with the \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, might have been the basis of a grant of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority from the central core area to Virginia. But again our limited powers of judicial review do not allow us to upset the Commission\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">There was certain \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d authority which might have been the basis of a grant from Pennsylvania to the base area.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But as these Pennsylvania points are all concentrated along the Delaware River near Delaware the Commission was justified in not basing a grant of statewide authority from Pennsylvania upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Finally, Newton\u2019s evidence of a single shipment from Richmond to Ex-more, Va. in 1959 is not sufficient for any additional grant of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">This detailed examination of the evidence of shipments within the Middle Atlantic area reveals that the Commission was rather generous in its grants of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority to Newton. The Commission adopted an origin territory approach rather than an origin points approach. Compare Jarman v. United States, 219 F.Supp. 108 (D.C. Md.1968). The Commission did not fail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>to consider the other relevant factors detailed in the <em>Willis Shaw </em>decision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> With few exceptions, the Commission did in fact base grants of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority upon all the actual shipments Newton introduced into evidence. Even when considered together with Newton\u2019s alleged holding out,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> these exceptions which involved only a few isolated shipments are not sufficient to justify interference with the Commission\u2019s denial of further grants of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">Newton secondly requested authority to transport the frozen foods involved between the Middle Atlantic area and the New England states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and between the Middle Atlantic states and the Southeastern area of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The Commission granted Newton authority from the central core area of the Delmarva Peninsula, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to Hartford and Wal-lingford, Connecticut, and Lewiston, Maine. The Commission made this grant on the basis of Newton\u2019s evidence of some ten shipments from the central core to these New England points, and on the basis of the \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Commission also granted Newton authority from Caribou, Maine, to New York, N. Y., and Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The Commission made this grant on the basis also of some ten shipments from Caribou to New York and Carnegie.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">It appears that with respect to transportation between the Middle Atlantic states and New England and the south the Commission greatly restricted its grant of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority compared to Newton\u2019s request. Therefore, it is important to analyze Newton\u2019s evidence which was deemed insufficient as a basis for the grant of further \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority. First, there was evidence of seven shipments in the latter part of 1958 and in 1959 from Caribou, Maine to Exmore, Virginia. As none of these shipments was made before the statutory date, they did not necessarily require the Commission to grant additional \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority. Besides, since Newton will be authorized to make such shipments in the future by combining the \u201cgrandfather\u201d authorities from Caribou to New York and from all points in New York to the central core area,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the carrier- cannot be greatly disturbed by this conclusion. A single shipment from Caribou, Maine to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1959 could rightfully have been rejected by the Commission as a basis for additional \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority. We thus find no acceptable basis for overruling the Commission\u2019s conclusion that \u201cno authority is warranted from Maine origins in addition to that granted * * *(98 M.C.C. 702, 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Newton also submitted evidence of three shipments from Watertown, Mass, and Hartford, Conn, to Philadelphia, Pa. and Houston, Delaware. Again, we must respect the Commission\u2019s judgment in denying further \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority on the basis of this evidence: \u201cThe only shipments shown to have been moved by applicant from Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>necticut and Massachusetts were one to Houston, Del., and two to Philadelphia, Pa., from Hartford, Conn., and Water-town, Mass., (split pickups), both after the critical date. These movements are insufficient to show operations on the critical date from this territory\u201d. (98 M.C.C. 702, 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Outbound from the Middle Atlantic states to New England, Newton produced evidence of one shipment from Landover, Md. and one from Pittsburgh, Pa. to Watertown, Mass., one shipment from Houston, Del. to Springfield, Mass., one from Exmore, Ya. to Warren, R. I., and two split loads from Seabrook, N. J. to Bangor and Pinepoint, Maine. Newton also has the \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority outbound to New England which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that \u201ctwo split loads to Bangor and Pinepoint, Maine, in 1956 are not demonstrative of continuous operations justifying a \u2018grandfather\u2019 grant\u201d (98 M.C.C. 702, 707) and that \u201cshipments to Watertown and Springfield, Mass., after the critical date, and to Warren, R. I., before the critical date, are insufficient to meet the statutory requirement of continuous service on and since the critical date\u201d. (98 M.C.C. 702, 708). The fragmentary character of these shipments justifies the Commission\u2019s conclusions. In addition, since Newton may combine its \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority within the central core and its \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority to New England points from Dover, Delaware,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we do not think that the Commission\u2019s denial of further \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority here should be upset by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The only evidence Newton introduced to support its application between the Southeastern states and the Middle Atlantic states consisted of split loads from Tampa, Florida to New York and Jersey City and from Plant City, Fla., to Charlotte, N. C., and Philadelphia and Altoona, Pennsylvania before the critical date, plus the \u201cfrozen foods\u201d authority set out in the margin <footnotemark>25</footnotemark>. Considering the totality of the record, we cannot disagree that such evidence is \u201cnot indicative of continuous operations from that territory for which \u2018grandfather\u2019 rights should be granted.\u201d (98 M.C.C. 702, 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Therefore, as to the second part of Newton\u2019s application concerning transportation between the Middle Atlantic states, on the one hand, and New England and the Southeast, on the other, we find sufficient basis not to overturn the Commission\u2019s action as being unduly limited. We recognize that Newton may have solicited business between these areas and that Newton, if it does not have authority to haul other products inbound, may be left primarily with an uneconomic one-way outbound service to New England. The decision which the Commission has made in the matter is, however, well within the bounds of its discretion. See Colonial Refrigerated Transportation, Inc. v. United States, 255 F. Supp. 999, 1003 (D.C.Ala.1966):</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">\u201cWe cannot say that, in weighing the specific evidence contained therein against the backdrop of the complexities of this transportation service, a process requiring the exercise of expert, empirical judgment, the Commission transgressed in imposing such geographical restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Finally, Newton requests authority to transport the frozen foods involved between the New England states of Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut and the Southeastern states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Florida. As Newton submitted no evidence whatsoever of shipments between these states, nor sufficient evidence of other pertinent factors, the Commission correctly denied any grant of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority for such transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Our ultimate conclusion, then, is that the Commission\u2019s grant of \u201cgrandfather\u201d authority to Newton may not be disturbed. We now consider whether additional rights should have been conferred in the extension proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Newton asserts in its third argument that the Commission erred in denying in its entirety the \u201cextension\u201d application under 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307(a). For a motor carrier to be granted relief under this section, it must bear the burden of demonstrating that the present or future public convenience and necessity will be served by the services sought. Newton has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">A basic ingredient in the determination of public convenience and necessity is whether the existing facilities are adequate to meet the present or future transportation requirements. Curtis, Inc. v. United States, 225 F.Supp. 894 (D.C.Colo.1964), aff\u2019d mem., 378 U.S. 128, 84 S.Ct. 1658, 12 L.Ed.2d 744 (1964). On this vital issue the Commission found (98 M.C.C. 702, 709):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-7\">\u201c[A]pplicant has failed to demonstrate with any reasonable degree of specificity that the service afforded by existing carriers is inadequate. Indeed, existing regular \u2014 and irregular \u2014route common carriers provide direct service for the transportation of frozen foods at virtually all points in the Middle Atlantic States and offer interline arrangements for movements between southern and New England states, and shippers admit their satisfaction with these services to the extent authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">The record amply supports the accuracy of the Commission\u2019s finding that there exists direct service and interline arrangements throughout the areas involved. Nonetheless, Newton attacks the Commission\u2019s finding as to the adequacy of that service. It asserts that the service of \u201cexisting carriers\u201d which the Commission found to be adequate included Newton\u2019s own service and for this reason the finding is unsupported under Nashua Motor Express, Inc. v. United States, 230 F.Supp. 646, 653 (D.C.N.H. 1964). However, evidence before the Commission, which included the protestants\u2019 operating authorities <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and testimony as to the satisfactory nature of the services of motor carriers other than Newton, fully justified its conclusion that the existing service was adequate and satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Nevertheless, Newton points out that when the shippers expressed their satisfaction with the existing service, exclusive of Newton\u2019s, they were careful to limit their approval to the services performed within the scope of the carriers' authorities. Transportation beyond the reach of the authority of a given motor carrier necessitated resort to joint-line transportation, i. e., the use of two or more inter-connecting carriers. Since the shippers with virtual unanimity expressed a preference for straight line rather than joint-line service for the transportation of frozen foods, Newton contends that the service offered by the other carriers was not satisfactory to the shippers, and that the finding of the Commission to the contrary is not supported by the evidence. The answer to this argument is found in the Commission\u2019s report (98 M.C.C. 702, 709):</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">\u201cA mere preference for single-line service, of course, is not sufficient to show inadequacy of joint-line service, in the absence of demonstrated service deficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">This conclusion is based upon judicial precedent from which there appears to be no dissent. Ayer v. United States, 139 F.Supp. 440, 443-444 <em>(D.C.Ga.1956); </em>Colorado-Arizona-California Express, Inc. v. United States, 224 F.Supp. 894, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>898 (D.C.Colo.1963); Curt\u00eds, Inc. v. United States, supra, 225 F.Supp. at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Although the Commission recognized that evidence of past services is a factor to be considered in determining whether a public need exists for the authority sought, Newton asserts that the Commission erroneously failed to consider its past services and the findings of the First Commission Report in that regard. This criticism is unfounded. The Third Report, in considering Newton\u2019s \u201cgrandfather\u201d application, carefully analyzed the prior services which Newton performed. Upon the basis of that analysis the Commission partially granted Newton\u2019s \u201cgrandfather\u201d application, not only with respect to certain point to point operations, but extensively as to a number of state-wide operating rights. In this latter respect, the Third Report contrasts sharply with the First Report which denied Newton any state-wide rights under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d application. The Commission, in discussing the \u201cextension\u201d application, said in its Third Report (98 M.C.C. 702, 710):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">\u201cThere are very few points or territories at which <em>any </em>service has been shown to have been provided by applicant which are not covered by our grant of authority in [the grandfather] proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The Commission concluded that this evidence of past operations by Newton did not warrant granting to Newton any \u201cextension\u201d rights. In view of the difference between the First and Third Report in the evaluation of the evidence as it related to Newton\u2019s \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights, it would have been pointless for the Third Report to have referred to the findings in the First Report as to Newton\u2019s past services.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Finally, Newton contends that as in <em>Nashua </em>the Commission incorrectly limited its consideration of public convenience and necessity to a determination of the adequacy of existing service. It is clear, however, that the Commission did not so limit itself, but concluded only that \u201cany claim of public need for the proposed service based on an asserted lack of satisfactory service must fail.\u201d (98 M.C.C. 702, 709). Congress intended to leave to the Commission administrative discretion to decide whether additional motor service would serve public convenience and necessity. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Parker, 326 U.S. 60, 65, 65 S.Ct. 1490, 89 L.Ed. 2051 (1945). Our conclusion, then, is that the Commission\u2019s denial of Newton\u2019s request for \u201cextension\u201d authority was a sound exercise of its administrative discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">As we find no cause for remand of these proceedings to the Commission, upon submission an appropriate order will be entered dissolving the temporary stay of the Commission\u2019s order and dismissing the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-11\">.

The Commission stated: \u201cIn determining the characteristics of the service which applicant has performed in the transportation of the \u2018grandfather\u2019 commodities here involved, it is significant, we believe, that applicant\u2019s operations have been performed principally for the two shippers which appeared in support of the application in the subtitled proceeding.
