The rules and regulations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>state medical board governing limited practitioners of medicine was also stipulated. A second stipulation was also made which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-4\">\u201cOn December 4, 1971, Rowena Clare Knight entered the office of Dr. James B. DeMido (Defendant) at 1666 North High Street, in the City of Columbus, County of Franklin, State of Ohio. Dr. DeMido examined the eyes of the said Rowena Clare Knight by use of a Phoropter. After said examination, he advised her that she no longer needed to wear her glasses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Defendant was found guilty and he appeals, raising two assignments of error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error Number One</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">\u201cA Doctor of Mechanotherapy is acting within the scope of his limited branch of medicine and surgery when he applies optical principles through technical methods and devices in the examination of human eyes for the purpose of ascertaining departures from the normal, measuring their functional powers and adapting optical accessories for the aid thereof, in that he is only using manual, physical or mechanical measures for the treatment of disease as outlined in Medical Board Regulation MB-1-05 (Gr); and a finding by the Court that he is practicing optometry without a license, constitutes reversible error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">\u201cAssignment of Error Number Two</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ad-dedup-0\">\u201cA Doctor of Mechanotherapy is a physician or surgeon practicing under authority of licenses issued under the laws of this state for the practice of medicine or surgery; and, therefore, his actions in examining eyes, diagnosing departures from the normal and adapting optical accessories are specifically exempt from the licensure requirement by the Board of Optometry: and the conviction by a Court under these circumstances is reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8D\">While defendant was charged with holding himself out as able to examine the eyes of any person for the purpose of fitting the same with glasses, in violation of R. C. 4725.02, the stipulation indicates that defendant examined the eyes of the patient and advised her that she did not need glasses. However, no issue is made by the assignments of error directly upon that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Bather, the assignments of error are somewhat over-broad and assume evidentiary matters not before the court. We shall consider the assignments of error without making the evidentiary assumptions not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">B. C. 4725.01 defines the practice of optometry as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201cThe practice of optometry is the application of optical principles, through technical methods and devices in the examination of human eyes for the purpose of ascertaining departures from the normal, measuring their functional powers and adapting optical accessories for the aid thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Defendant was charged with violating B. C. 4725.02, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">\u201cNo person shall engage in the practice of optometry or hold himself out as a practitioner of optometry, or attempt to determine the kind of glasses needed by any person, or hold himself out as a licensed optometrist when not so licensed, or hold himself out as able to examine the eyes of any person for the purpose of fitting the same with glasses, excepting those exempted under section 4725.14 of the Bevised Code unless he has first fulfilled the requirements of sections 4725.01 to 4725.14, inclusive, of the Be-vised Code, and has received a certificate of licensure from the state board of optometry, nor shall any person represent that he is the lawful holder of a certificate of licensure such as is provided for in such sections, when in fact he is not such lawful holder, or impersonate any licensed practitioner of optometry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Defendant was a licensed practitioner of the limited branch of medicine or surgery known as mechanotherapy. B. C. 4731.15 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">\u201c The state medical board shall also examine and register persons desiring to practice any limited branch of medicine or surgery, and shall establish rules and regulations governing such limited practice. Such limited branches of medicine or surgery shall include * * * mechanotherapy # * * <em>tf</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">The rules and regulations of the state medical board are pertinent. Bule MB-1-01 provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cThe Board had defined the work \u2018limited branch or branches of medicine or surgery\u2019 to mean those branches of medicine or surgery which provide for a single therapeutic system, appliance, application, operation or treatment for the relief or cure of a wound, fracture or bodily injury, infirmity or disease, which does not involve the use of drugs or major surgery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Such rule further classifies the limited branch of me-chanotherapy under what is called \u2018 \u2018 Group one. \u2019 \u2019 Rule MB-1-02(1) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">\u201cCertificates authorizing the practice of any limited branch or branches of medicine or surgery, under group 1, authorize the holders to examine and diagnose and to assume responsibility and care of patients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Rule MB-1-05(G) defines mechanotherapy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaF\">\u201cMechanotherapy is hereby understood to be \u2018the use of manual, physical, or mechanical measures for the treatment of disease.\u2019 Such physical or mechanical measures shall not include the use of X-ray or radium for therapeutic purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Furthermore, Rule MB-1-02(E) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">\u201cPractice must be confined to the limited branch or branches specified in the certificate and generally recognized as such.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">Rule MB-1-02(F) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-9\">\u201cA certificate authorizing the practice of a limited branch or branches of medicine or surgery will confer the right to use the title \u2018Doctor\u2019 or \u2018Dr.\u2019, provided that such use is qualified by the designation of the limited branch of the certificate holder and provided the school of graduation is empowered to confer the degree * * *. The certificate does not permit the holder to treat infectious, contagious or venereal disease nor to prescribe or administer drugs or to perform major surgery or the use of the title \u2018Physician\u2019 or \u2018Surgeon.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">Rule MB-1-05(G) further provides for the educational requirements of a mechanotherapist and for an examination which an applicant for a license must take. The examination is conducted by the state medical board \u201cin the subjects of anatomy, physiology, chemistry, bacteriology, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>pathology, hygiene, and diagnosis and before a special committee of licensed mechanotherapists appointed by the State Medical Board * * * in practice, symtomatology (sic), diagnosis, and therapeutics as applied to the practice of mechanotherapy. * * *\u201d (See also R. C. 4731.16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Unfortunately, neither the statute nor the rules of the state medical board are explicit in defining the practice of mechanotherapy. A licensed mochanotherapist is authorized \u201cto examine and diagnose and to assume responsibility and care of patients.\u201d (Bule MB-1-02 [I].) The practice consists of \u201cthe use of manual, physical, or mechanical measures for the treatment of disease.\u201d Bule MB-1-05(G). A mechanotherapist is precluded from treating \u201cinfecti-out, contagious or venereal disease,\u201d and from prescribing or administering drugs, or from performing major surgery. R. G. 4731.17 and Bule MB-1-02(F). The only other limitation upon the practice of mechanotherapy is that it must be confined to mechanotherapy \u201cgenerally recognized as such.\u201d Bule MB-1-02(E). Except for this provision, the rules add little to the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">From the foregoing, we conclude that, except with respect to the specific prohibitions set forth in R. C. 4731.17, and the rules of the state medical board, <em>supra, </em>it cannot be determined what does or does not constitute the practice of mechanotherapy without evidence as to what is \u201cgenerally recognized\u201d as the practice of mechanotherapy. In this case, there is no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">By the first assignment of error, defendant seeks a determination by this court that his conduct constituted the practice of mechanotherapy. In the absence of evidence so indicating, we cannot so conclude. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The second assignment of error poses a slightly different problem. B. C. 4725.14 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u201cSections 4725.01 to 4725.14, inclusive, of the Revised Code do not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">\u201c(A) To physicians or surgeons practicing under authority of licenses issued under the laws of this state for the practice of medicine or surgery * * V \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Defendant contends that he is entitled to an exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tion from the licensing reqnirments as an optometrist, pursuant to this section. The issue thus presented is whether or not a limited practitioner of medicine is entitled to the benefit of this exception. We conclude that to the extent that a licensed mechanotherapist is engaged in that limited branch of medicine he may do so without also obtaining a license as an optometrist. We conclude that the exemption of R. C. 4725.14 applies to limited practitioners of medicine, including mechanotherapists, to the extent that they are practicing under the authority of the license issued to them for the limited practice of medicine or surgery. As we indicated above, to determine whether or not the services rendered by defendant herein were included within the practice of mechanotherapy necessarily requires evidence as to what is generally recognized as the practice of mechanotherapy. In the absence of such evidence, there can be no conviction of a licensed mechanotherapist for a violation of R. C. 4725.02. Accordingly, for the reasons and to the extent indicated, the second assignment of error is. well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the first assignment of error is overruled, the second assignment of error is sustained, the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court is reversed, and final judgment is rendered dismissing the charge against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b28-6\">Troop, P. J., and Holmes, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b28-7\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At\">concurring. What may have been intended by the drafters of the language of the sections of law and regulations involved in this appeal, and the reasonable interpretation of such regulations and statutes, are seriously apart one from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">I must, with regret, concur with the majority herein, but in so doing I feel compelled to comment, as I did recently regarding the sections of law dealing with podiatry and podiatrists, that such laws appear to be in utter chaos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>producing results never intended by the General Assembly or the Ohio medical board.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">But, yet, such sections must be interpreted as they are presently constituted. The courts may not rewrite such sections of law to suit their own attitudes or positions as to what should be the extent of the professional jurisdiction of each of these practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">This is, of course, within the province of the legislature \u2014 not the courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
