Mitchell, appellant, is the beneficiary of a valid contract of life insurance issued by the \u201cAARP Life Insurance Program, New York Life Insurance Company\u201d (\u201cNew York Life\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellee. On September 17, 1999, after New York Life refused to pay appellant the death benefit of $15,000 allegedly due under the life insurance policy that he procured for his late father, George Mitchell,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant filed suit in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Montgomery County. Appellee subsequently moved for summary judgment on January '31, 2000, claiming that no life insurance coverage existed when George died, and therefore appellant was not entitled to the insurance proceeds. The trial court granted summary judgment to New York Life on March 28, 2000. On April 10, 2000, appellant filed a motion to alter or amend, which was denied on May 22, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Appellant, who is <em>pro se </em>here, as he was below, presents two questions for our consideration. We have combined and rephrased them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">Did the trial court err- in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">George, appellant\u2019s father, was bom on June 5, 1926. On February 12, 1999, appellant obtained a Durable Power of Attorney over the affairs of his seventy-three year old ailing father, who was then hospitalized due to his failing health. Over the next several days, appellant contacted several life insurance companies in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain life insurance for his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>According to appellant, the \u201cAARP New York Life Insurance Program had come to [his] attention during one of his visits with his father through a piece of their promotional literature, which advertised prompt insurance coverage after the applicant had met a simple three step process----\u201d Mitchell noted that the program was targeted for seniors, and was \u201cvery alluring.\u201d Mitchell asserts in his brief that \u201c[e]nrollment and coverage was advertised as almost instantaneous after completion of [the] three step process.\u201d Because appellee\u2019s life insurance plan seemed \u201cvery practical and commonsensical\u201d and was \u201cdesigned for the benefit of seniors, [with] a very low rejection rate ...,\u201d appellant and his father \u201cdesired immediate coverage.... \u201d On behalf of his father, appellant contacted New York Life by telephone on February 28, 1999, to obtain assistance with the application form, titled \u201cRequest for Group Insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Appellant alleged that he spoke with an agent of appellee about \u201cexpeditiously processing a policy of life insurance on his ailing father.\u201d He informed appellee\u2019s customer service representative that he was ready to complete the application \u201cright then,\u201d but needed assistance with the form. According to Mitchell, the insurer\u2019s agent helped him with the application, but appellant was unable to identify the particular person with whom he spoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The insurance application form contains a section labeled \u201cCoverage Amount Requested.\u201d Appellant initially sought $25,000 in coverage, the maximum amount offered. The \u201cinsurer\u2019s agent\u201d advised him, however, that the age of his father precluded George from obtaining life insurance in that amount. As a result, appellant selected coverage of $15,000, the highest coverage available to George, based on George\u2019s age. Appellant named himself as the sole beneficiary of the requested policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Section B of the Application is titled \u201cPayment Options,\u201d and contains two options for payment. \u201cOption 1,\u201d titled \u201cAutomatic Premium Payment,\u201d authorizes monthly or quarterly withdrawals from a bank account. \u201cOption 2,\u201d titled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u201cPeriodic Premium Billing,\u201d contains two more choices. In one, the applicant seeks to be billed, while the other indicates that payment is enclosed. Appellant selected Option 2 and checked the box that reads: \u201cSo coverage can take effect as soon as possible, I enclose a check for my first payment in the amount of__\u201d In the blank, the application contains the handwritten amount of $151.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Section D is titled \u201cStatement of Health.\u201d It asks the applicant if he or she has had \u201ctreatment for or consulted a physician about ... emphysema....\u201d On the form, the word \u201cemphysema\u201d is circled. Appellant also checked \u201cyes\u201d to a question asking if the applicant had been admitted to a hospital in the past two years, adding that George suffered from \u201cChronic Obstructive Lung Disease <em>&amp; </em>Tracheobronchitis,\u201d for which he had \u201cnebulizer treatments, intravenous fluids &amp; antibiotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Section E of the Application contains the following preprinted statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">I understand that insurance will be <em>effective on the date of the certificate, </em>provided my premium is received during my lifetime and within 31 days of such Insurance Date. <em>I understand that premium payment for insurance does not mean there is any coverage in force before the effective date as specified by New York Life, </em>and that benefits may be denied during the first two years if material facts have been misstated here. I represent that I am an AARP member, and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information on this request is true and complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">(Emphasis added). Appellant signed the application as follows: \u201cGeorge C. Mitchell/Curtiss Mitchell P.O.A.,\u201d and dated it \u201c2/20/99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">At his deposition on January 17, 2000, appellant said he believed the application constituted the \u201cCertificate\u201d referred to in Section E of the application. He explained that he \u201cfilled it out, sent [his] money ... and no one told [him] that this was not a certificate.\u201d He \u201cpoint[ed]\u201d to a number on the application, \u201c5189624,\u201d to support his assertion. Appellant also indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>cated at his deposition that the text of the application provided that the insurance would be effective \u201c[o]n the date of the certificate.\u201d At the summary judgment hearing, however, Mitchell acknowledged that he never received a certificate from appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Appellant claimed that, after completing the application, he asked appellee\u2019s customer service representative what he should do to assure immediate life insurance coverage for George. Mitchell contends that appellee\u2019s agent advised him to mail the completed application, along with a power of attorney and the premium payment, to appellee\u2019s corporate office. Accordingly, Mitchell mailed the application, a copy of the power of attorney, and a check dated March 4,1999, in the amount of $151.80, in payment of the first premium. It is undisputed that New York Life received the documents on March 9, 1999; the application is stamped \u201cMar 09 1999.\u201d Moreover, appellee deposited appellant\u2019s check on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">George died the next day, March 10, 1999, at approximately 6:30 a.m. At about 8:00 a.m., appellant contacted New York Life to advise of his father\u2019s death. At his deposition, appellant said that he \u201cnever asked for the $150,000 death benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">On March 11, 1999, appellant again contacted New York Life. He was informed that the application had not been processed or reviewed prior to George\u2019s death, and therefore the policy was not in effect at the time of George\u2019s demise. Several days later, appellee returned the premium payment of $151.80 to appellant, with a letter advising that appellee had not approved the insurance application prior to George\u2019s death, and thus appellant was not entitled to the death benefit under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, appellee submitted several documents, including: an affidavit from Daniel J. Rice, the Director of Underwriting for New York Life\u2019s AARP Operations, located in Tampa, Florida; a copy of the power of attorney submitted by Mitchell; excerpts from appellant\u2019s deposition; a copy of the insurance application completed by Mitchell; and an excerpt from New York Life\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Underwriting Guidelines. Rice averred in his affidavit that the Underwriting Department had not reviewed George\u2019s application by the time he died, nor had New York Life issued a conditional receipt or a premium receipt to George. Rice stated that, as a result, appellee did not approve coverage for George, and no insurance certificate had been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Appellant asserted in his opposition to the summary judgment motion that New York Life\u2019s brochure advertised an easy application process that would permit coverage at the \u201cearliest possible date.\u201d Moreover, he argued that, in his conversation with New York Life\u2019s agent, \u201cthe terms and conditions for a policy of Life Insurance on the beneficiary\u2019s ailing father\u2019s life were set out and mutually agreed upon, and those representations merged with the brochure\u2019s representations to form a binding temporary contract.\u201d Appellant also claimed that appellee\u2019s agent advised him that if he completed \u201cthe Enrollment Form, executed a Durable Power of Attorney, and made out a check for the first premium payment in the sum of $151.80, and mailed the documents to New York Life, he would have a contract for preliminary and temporary insurance coverage for his father.\u201d Accordingly, appellant followed the instructions, and the first premium payment of $151.80 was deposited by New York Life on March 9, 1999, one day prior to George\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Although appellant did not include an affidavit with his opposition, he signed it under oath. In further support of appellant\u2019s opposition, he submitted the New York Life brochure, his check for the first premium payment, and the first page of his letter of June 8,1999, to A. J. Goergen, a corporate vice president of New York Life, in which appellant described the events that took place. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-501(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On March 28, 2000, the court held a motion hearing. In granting summary judgment to appellee, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8i\">It is [appellee\u2019s] position in this case that summary judgment is appropriate to be granted by the Court for really three reasons, the first being that no insurance coverage existed at the time of George Mitchell\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>It is the position of [appellee] that the application was merely an offer and that coverage would not take effect until the [appellee] accepted the offer and that the [appellee] did not have the opportunity to accept the offer because of the unfortunate timing of [appellant\u2019s father\u2019s] death being within a day of the materials being received by New York Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">[Appellee] also argues that there is no situation of temporary insurance coverage because [appellant\u2019s father] did not meet any objective standard for insurability, and third, that even if he had met any objective standard for insurability, his application would have been rejected because he failed to meet three subjective requirements of [appellee].</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">This is all spelled out really in the paperwork that has been very well prepared by both sides in the case and is very complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">It is [appellant\u2019s] position that the coverage really took effect when the [appellee] received the application based on the language of the brochure, which he felt was an offer to provide immediate life insurance, and that acceptance of the offer was completed by the mere receipt of the application and the check, and he bases his position on statements that he alleges were made by an agent of [appellee] during a series of phone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">I have had an opportunity to review all of the citations which have been submitted by both sides in the case, and I cannot really distinguish this case from the case of <em>Heideman [v</em>.] <em>Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, </em>[546 N.W.2d 760 (Minn.Ct.App.1996)], which clearly indicates that the brochure is viewed as a solicitation for offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">This particular brochure said, \u201cYour coverage will take effect on the date shown on your certificate of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Therefore, I think it is clear that a certificate had to be issued by New York Life for them to have formally accepted the risk of this insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The case of <em>Heideman\u2019s </em>language in the brochure is nearly identical to what is in this case, which has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>interpreted by many Maryland court decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Special Appeals to support the position of [appellee].</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">So I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant summary judgment in this case in favor of [appellee].</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Maryland Rule 2-501 establishes a two-part test for summary judgment. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment ... the trial court must decide whether there is any genuine dispute as to material facts and, if not, whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 488, 665 A.2d 297 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 172, 669 A.2d 1360 (1996); <em>see Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118 (2000); <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737-38, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993). Similarly, in reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must determine \u201cwhether a genuine dispute of material fact exists and then whether the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 113, 753 A.2d 41 (2000); <em>see Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn of Bethesda, Inc., </em>335 Md. 135, 144, 642 A.2d 219 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">When the movant has provided a sufficient basis for summary judgment, the party opposing the motion must \u201cproduce sufficient evidence\u201d to show that there is a genuine dispute of fact, \u201cwhich is sufficiently material to be tried.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 115, 753 A.2d 41; <em>see Scroggins v. Dahne, </em>335 Md. 688, 691, 645 A.2d 1160 (1994); <em>Berringer v. Steele, </em>133 Md.App. 442, 470, 758 A.2d 574 (2000). A material fact is one that will \u201caffect the outcome of the case,\u201d depending upon how the factfinder resolves the dispute. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>see Faith v. Keefer, </em>127 Md.App. 706, 734, 736 A.2d 422, <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 191, 742 A.2d 521 (1999). All genuine factual disputes, and inferences reasonably drawn from the facts, are resolved in favor of the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>moving party. <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 94, 756 A.2d 963 (2000); <em>Dobbins v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>338 Md. 341, 345, 658 A.2d 675 (1995) ; <em>Green v. Brooks, </em>125 Md.App. 349, 365, 725 A.2d 596 (1999). Moreover, in resolving the motion, the trial court may not determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>Thacker v. City of Hyattsville, </em>135 Md.App. 268, 286, 762 A.2d 172 (2000). But, mere general allegations or conclusory assertions of disputed fact will not suffice. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Appellee included an affidavit with its motion for summary judgment. Appellant filed his opposition with an oath, but he did not include a countervailing affidavit. Maryland Rule 2-501(b) provides that the response to a summary judgment motion must \u201cidentify with particularity the material facts that are disputed.\u201d Further, the rule requires that when a motion is supported by an affidavit, the opposing party \u201cshall support the response by an affidavit or other written statement under oath.\u201d <em>Id.; see Imbraguglio v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., Inc., </em>358 Md. 194, 203-04, 747 A.2d 662 (2000) (recognizing that attachment of documents in a summary judgment proceeding, without affidavit, is not proper); <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assoc. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 263-64, 674 A.2d 106 (1996) (recognizing that a party opposing summary judgment must present admissible evidence of a factual dispute), <em>aff'd, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 70 (1996) . Appellee did not challenge the sufficiency of appellant\u2019s oath or appellant\u2019s failure to submit an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">As we observed, if there are no genuine disputes of material fact, then the reviewing court must determine if the trial court \u201creached the correct legal result.\u201d <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>126 Md.App. 609, 625, 730 A.2d 742 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>358 Md. 627, 751 A.2d 481 (2000); <em>see Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 204, 680 A.2d 1067 (1996); <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 42-43, 656 A.2d 307 (1995); <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 737, 625 A.2d 1005. In our review, we evaluate \u201cthe same material from the record and decide[] the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Lopata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 286, 718 A.2d 234 (1998). Appellate courts will generally uphold a grant of summary judgment \u201conly on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478, 659 A.2d 872 (1995); <em>see also Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 254 n. 3, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993); <em>Hoffman v. United Iron and Metal Co., Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 117, 132-33, 671 A.2d 55 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Appellant contends that the trier of fact should have decided whether a binding contract of life insurance was formed based on appellee\u2019s promotional literature, \u201ccoupled\u201d with the \u201ctelephone colloquy of February 20, 1999,\u201d between appellant and an agent of New York Life. According to appellant, his telephone conversation with an unidentified representative of New York Life, who assisted him with completion of the application, \u201chad the [ejffect of modifying and reforming the promotional literature and making a binding bilateral contract between the parties.\u201d Moreover, he observes that the promotional literature \u201csaid nothing about [appellee\u2019s] policy ... of not accepting applications by phone, and was silent about the condition precedent of the enrollment application approved by their underwriter for the insurance coverage to take effect.\u201d Thus, appellant maintains that, \u201cas the bargained exchange\u201d for returning the completed enrollment form, executing the power of attorney, and mailing the first premium payment to New York Life, appellee was obligated to provide immediate insurance coverage for his father, as the \u201cpromised consideration.\u201d Appellant states: \u201cThe alleged contract between the parties was a ... contract, its [sic] the fulcrum of this case, and should have been the primary focus of the trial court, steering its inquiry.\u201d Mitchell also claims the trier of fact should have determined whether appellee provided interim life insurance while George\u2019s application for insurance was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Appellee counters that no insurance coverage existed, because New York Life \u201chad neither processed nor reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>George Mitchell\u2019s enrollment application----\u201d Indeed, appellee observes that its policies and procedures do not permit applications to be processed and accepted by telephone. Therefore, appellee asserts that New York Life never accepted the risk of coverage. In addition, appellee contends that appellant \u201cfailed to meet his burden of proof to show that his father met New York Life\u2019s objective standard of insurability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Because the interpretation of an insurance policy is governed by the same principles generally applicable to the construction of other contracts, we begin our analysis with a review of basic principles of contract law. <em>See Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v. Maryland Yacht Club, Inc., </em>129 Md.App. 455, 467, 742 A.2d 79 (1999). A contract has been defined as \u201c \u2018a promise or set of promises for breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kiley v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Md., </em>102 Md.App. 317, 333, 649 A.2d 1145 (1994) (quoting Richard A. Lord, 1 Williston on Contracts, \u00a7 1:1, at 2-3 (4th ed.1990)), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 Md. 116, 656 A.2d 772, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 866, 116 S.Ct. 181, 133 L.Ed.2d 120 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The interpretation of a written contract is generally a question of law for the court, subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>363 Md. 232, 250, 768 A.2d 620 (2001); <em>Auction &amp; Estate Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, </em>354 Md. 333, 341, 731 A.2d 441 (1999). \u201c\u2018In Maryland, insurance policies, like other contracts, are construed as a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intentions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bushey v. Northern Assurance Co. of America, </em>362 Md. 626, 631, 766 A.2d 598 (2001) (quoting <em>Sullins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 508-09, 667 A.2d 617 (1995)). We utilize the law of objective interpretation to ascertain the intent of the contracting parties, provided that intention does not violate an established principle of law. <em>B &amp; P Enter. v. Overland Equip. Co., </em>133 Md.App. 583, 604, 758 A.2d 1026 (2000); <em>Ragin v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>133 Md.App. 116, 135, 754 A.2d 503 (2000). When the language of a contract \u201cis unambiguous, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>shall give effect to its plain meaning and there is no need for further construction by the court.\u201d <em>Wells, </em>363 Md. at 251, 768 A.2d 620; <em>see Painewebber Inc. v. East, </em>363 Md. 408, 414, 768 A.2d 1029 (2001). Moreover, \u201c \u2018[i]f only one reasonable meaning can be ascribed to the [contract] when viewed in context, that meaning necessarily reflects the parties\u2019 intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Labor Ready, Inc. v. Abis, </em>137 Md.App. 116, 128, 767 A.2d 936 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The question of formation of a contract is central to this case. \u201cA contract is formed when an unrevoked offer made by one person is accepted by another.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Silverman, </em>58 Md.App. 41, 57, 472 A.2d 104 (1984). An essential element with respect to the formation of a contract is \u201c \u2018a manifestation of agreement or mutual assent by the parties to the terms thereof; in other words, to establish a contract the minds of the parties must be in agreement as to its terms.\u2019\u201d <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Altman, </em>296 Md. 486, 489, 463 A.2d 829 (1983) (citation omitted); <em>see Kiley, </em>102 Md.App. at 333, 649 A.2d 1145. Thus, as with other contracts, the validity of an insurance contract depends upon the \u201ctwo prerequisites of mutual assent ... namely, an offer and an acceptance.\u201d 3 Eric M. Holmes, Holmes\u2019s Appleman on Insurance 2D, \u00a7 11.1, at 93 (1998) (\u201cAppleman\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">An \u201capplication for insurance standing alone does not constitute a contract upon which judgment can be recovered. It is merely an offer or request for insurance which may be either accepted or rejected by the insurer.... The offer must be unconditionally accepted for the contract of insurance to come into force.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.1, at 93-94. As a \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d then, there is \u201cno binding contract of insurance,\u201d even if the applicant makes a \u201ccontemporaneous payment\u201d of the initial premium when submitting an insurance application, unless \u201cthe insurer manifests its acceptance.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.1, at 95; <em>see also </em>Appleman, \u00a7 10.1, at 1 (acknowledging that a life insurance application is merely an offer to contract for life insurance, and that in order to create a binding contract of insurance, an insurer must accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>offer); 1 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance 3D (\u201cCouch\u201d) (1997) \u00a7 11:1, at 11-2 to 11-3; \u00a7 11:3, at 11-9 to 11-10; 43 Am.Jur. 2D <em>Insurance </em>\u00a7 201, at 283 (1982) (\u201cUntil the application is accepted, no contractual relationship exists between an applicant for insurance and the insurance company\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u201c[A]cceptance occurs when the insurer agrees to accept the application and to issue the policy,\u201d provided there are no condition precedents \u201cto the completion of the contract agreed upon.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.2, at 106.

To the contrary, an insurance company generally is entitled to determine the risks it considers profitable to insure. <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r of Md. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>268 Md. 428, 440, 302 A.2d 200 (1973); <em>American Casualty Co. v. Ricas, </em>179 Md. 627, 634, 22 A.2d 484 (1941). Put another way, \u201c \u2018it is purely voluntary on the part of the company as to whom it will insure.... The insurer is. at liberty to choose its own risks and may accept or reject applicants as it sees fit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edelstein v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>252 Md. 455, 462, 250 A.2d 241 (1969) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">As we noted, \u201c[t]here must be an actual acceptance by the insurer before it will be liable upon the risk.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.2, at 106. The question here is whether appellant made a valid offer on behalf of his father that was accepted by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Appellant argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that a valid life insurance contract was created based on all of the circumstances, including appellee\u2019s brochure, its deposit of the premium payment prior to George\u2019s death, and the representations of an unnamed New York life representative on February 20, 1999. Appleman recognizes that, when an insurer \u201cengages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the mass solicitation of business by mail,\u201d it is not uncommon for the \u201caverage person [to] believe that his or her response by sending the application and premium would be sufficient to consummate the contract.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.1, at 94-95. Yet, Appleman also asserts that \u201cthe insurer\u2019s physical acceptance of the submitted application] does not create the binding contract of insurance where the application and accompanying literature specifies that acceptance can only be made upon an investigation and determination of the applicant\u2019s insurability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95. As the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Simpson v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>227 Md. 393, 400, 177 A.2d 417 (1962), \u201ca life insurance company obviously has a sound business reason for wishing to be cautious before it fully commits itself by actually issuing a policy which is not readily cancellable.\u201d To protect against what might be perceived as an automatic acceptance, however, \u201cthe insurer must use clear and unequivocal language to demonstrate its intent to only provide coverage upon the satisfaction of various conditions pending its investigation of the application.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.1, at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In this case, appellant signed the application on behalf of his father, who was quite ill at the time. No information was presented below as to what George understood with respect to the application, as he did not complete or sign it; appellant did that for him, using his power of attorney. As the person executing the application, appellant was \u201clegally obligated to read it before executing it.\u201d <em>Benjamin v. Erk, </em>138 Md.App. 459, 481, 771 A.2d 1106 (2001). Indeed, persons who seek to obtain insurance have \u201ca duty to read what they sign, and their failure to do so will not relieve or allow them to avoid their contract.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.13, at 137. Similarly, a contract signatory is \u201c \u2018presumed to know the contents, signs at his peril, suffers the consequences of his negligence, and is estopped to deny his obligation under the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holzman v. Fiola Blum, Inc., </em>125 Md.App. 602, 629, 726 A.2d 818 (1999) (citation omitted). The application signed by appellant and appellee\u2019s promotional literature adequately advised appellant that submission of an application with the initial premium would not guarantee coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Appellant seems to overlook that the application that he executed clearly stated: \u201cI understand that insurance will be <em>effective on the date of the certificate, </em>provided my premium is received during my lifetime and within 31 days of such Insurance Date. I <em>understand that premium payment for insurance does not mean there is any coverage in force before the effective date as specified by New York Life.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Additionally, as we observed, appellant checked the box indicating that he enclosed the first premium payment. That box stated: \u201cSo coverage can take effect as soon as possible, I enclose a check for my first payment in the amount of $_.\u201d The plain import of that language served to alert an applicant that coverage is not effective immediately, merely because payment is enclosed. Rather, enclosure of payment merely <em>expedites </em>the matter of a decision by the insurer as to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Nor does the promotional literature on which appellant relies support his contention that a contract of insurance was effective immediately. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">Certificate of Insurance \u2014 with Up to 30 Days to Review</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACa\"><em>Once you are approved, you will be sent a personalized Certificate </em>of Insurance summarizing your benefits ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\"><em>Your coverage will take effect on the date shown on your Certificate </em>\u2014 normally about seven days after approval of your Enrollment Form \u2014 provided premiums are paid when due ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">(Emphasis added). This language is reiterated in the \u201cQuestion and Answer\u201d section of appellee\u2019s brochure, which said:</p>\n<p id=\"A7-\">Q. When will my coverage take effect?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">A. <em>Your coverage will take effect on the date shown on your Certificate of Insurance (normally, about seven days after we approve your Enrollment Form), </em>provided premiums are paid when due.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Appellant does not contend that appellee acted fraudulently, or that he acted under duress or otherwise lacked the capacity to read and understand whatever documents he executed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>reviewed. In the absence of \u201c \u2018fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, one who has the capacity to understand a written document who reads and signs it, ... is bound by his signature to all of its terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Golub v. Cohen, </em>138 Md.App. 508, 517, 772 A.2d 880 (2001) (quoting <em>Binder v. Benson, </em>225 Md. 456, 461, 171 A.2d 248 (1961)); <em>see Eureka-Maryland Assurance Corp. v. Samuel, </em>191 Md. 603, 609, 62 A.2d 622 (1948) (recognizing that \u201cthe language in the [life insurance] application was sufficient to put [applicant] on notice that [the insurance agent] alone could not make the policy effective without payment of the first premium or change the application from an annual basis to a quarterly basis\u201d). Furthermore, \u201cthe mere fact of the applicant\u2019s signature, when able to read and write, has been held conclusive proof, in the absence of fraud, that the applicant did so read it.\u201d Appleman, \u00a7 11.13, at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Rice said in his affidavit that when appellant notified New York Life that his father had died, appellee\u2019s Underwriting Department had not yet had an opportunity to review the application submitted on behalf of George; the insurance company only received the application one day prior to George\u2019s death. Accordingly, Rice averred that \u201cno decision had been made regarding whether the decedent would be offered coverage, and an insurance certificate had not been issued.\u201d Rice also asserted in his affidavit that \u201cNew York Life\u2019s policies and procedures do not allow an applicant to obtain insurance coverage through the AARP program over the telephone prior to the application being reviewed by New York Life Personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"><em>Simpson, supra, </em>227 Md. at 393, 177 A.2d 417, is instructive. There, an applicant for life insurance was killed in a motor vehicle accident shortly after he submitted his application and premium payment. The insurance company had already deposited the applicant\u2019s check, tendered by the applicant for the premium. Moreover, the insurance company\u2019s agent had given the applicant a \u201cconditional receipt\u201d issued by the insurance company upon payment of the first premium. After the insurer refused to pay the death benefit under the policy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>decedent\u2019s wife sued the insurer, claiming it had contracted to issue the policy. The Court of Appeals construed both the application and the \u201cconditional receipt.\u201d As the Court noted, the \u201ccrux of the case\u201d concerned \u201cwhether the terms of the receipt obligated the defendant insurance company to insure the life\u201d of the [decedent]. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 177 A.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The applicant received the \u201cconditional receipt\u201d contemporaneous with his completion of the non-medical portion of the life insurance application on August 23, 1958, and his payment of the premium. At that time, the agent said: \u201c \u2018When you give me the check for a payment on this insurance, you are covered. WTien I receive your check, you are covered as of then.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 177 A.2d 417 (citation omitted). The insurance company cashed the check the next day. <em>Id. </em>As part of the application process, a doctor examined the applicant on August 31,1958, and completed the medical portion of the application at that time. The results of the medical examination showed a \u201c \u2018trace\u2019 of sugar in the [applicant\u2019s] urine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>About a week later, the applicant was killed in a vehicular accident. Thereafter, on September 19, 1958, the insurance company notified the decedent\u2019s widow that the applicant did not pass the physical examination, no policy was ever issued, and the company was not obligated to pay a death benefit. It also tendered a refund of the premium. <em>Id. </em>The trial court directed a verdict for the insurance company, finding that the agent had no power to bind the company to \u201cimmediate coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">On appeal, the Court agreed with the trial court\u2019s decision as to the agent\u2019s lack of authority to bind the company. <em>Id. </em>at 398, 177 A.2d 417. It said: \u201cThe absence of such power was clearly set forth not only in the application, but in the receipt itself, upon which the plaintiffs claim must stand or fall.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398-99, 177 A.2d 417. Nevertheless, the Court reversed and remanded on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The Court had \u201cno difficulty\u201d in finding that a contract was created based on the conditional receipt issued to the applicant upon his payment of the premium. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 177 A.2d 417. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the insurer did not contest the agent\u2019s authority to issue the conditional receipt or to bind the company to the terms contained in the receipt. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 177 A.2d 417. Nevertheless, as to the insurer\u2019s liability, the Court determined that its obligations at that juncture were governed by the terms of the conditional receipt. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 177 A.2d 417. The Court explained that \u201cpayment in advance of the premium constituted consideration for whatever obligations the company assumed under the terms of its receipt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 177 A.2d 417. Based on those terms, the Court said: \u201cUnless the standard of insurability [was] met [by the applicant,] the terms of the receipt ... sets [sic] up a bar to recovery by the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 177 A.2d 417. The Court then proceeded to discuss insurability.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>Simpson </em>seems to suggest that an insurance company does not necessarily create a contract of life insurance merely by cashing a premium check before deciding whether to insure an applicant for life insurance. Moreover, the Court recognized the insurance company\u2019s legitimate interest in establishing standards of insurability and in investigating whether the applicant satisfies those standards. Although the Court determined that the insurance company was bound by the terms of the conditional receipt, that document did not necessarily obligate the company to pay the death benefit. As a result, the Court remanded for further proceedings with regard to whether the decedent met the standards of insurability.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In this case, unlike in <em>Simpson, </em>Mitchell did not receive a conditional, interim, or binding premium receipt from appellee. In general, such receipts provide either \u201cimmediate unconditional, temporary insurance,\u201d or insurance effective as of the date of either the applicant\u2019s medical examination or his payment, or insurance as of the date of application, if the applicant is later shown to be \u201ca satisfactory insurable risk ...\u201d as of that date. <em>Simpson, </em>227 Md. at 400, 177 A.2d 417. Consistent with the terms of New York Life\u2019s advisement on the application, a valid contract of life insurance was not created merely because appellee received the enrollment form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>and the premium payment just prior to George\u2019s death. Rather, the terms of the application provided that coverage was subject to approval by appellee; George died before appellee had an opportunity to consider whether to approve or reject his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><em>Heideman v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>546 N.W.2d 760 (Minn.Ct.App.1996), review denied, 1996 Minn. Lexis 377 (filed June 5, 1996), on which appellee and the trial court relied, is also generally consistent with the principles that we outlined above. There, an applicant completed a life insurance \u25a0 form entitled \u201cSPECIAL \u2018EASY ACCEPTANCE\u2019 OFFER TERM LIFE INSURANCE PLAN.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 762 (citation omitted). The promotional literature said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cThe MMA Group Insurance Program \u2014 is making an offer you won\u2019t want to miss ... All this protection is available to you on a special, easy acceptance basis. This means NO long forms to complete ... No complicated health questions to answer ... [T]his offer is good for a limited time only, so don\u2019t delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 762-63. Additionally, the application form stated: \u201cAcceptance into this Plan is easy as long as you are not already participating in the Plan and you can answer \u2018No\u2019 to the health question on the simplified application form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. The applicant mailed the form, along with the first premium payment, on October 24, 1994, and died a few days later. Unaware of the applicant\u2019s death, the insurance company approved the application, effective November 4,1994, and issued a certificate of insurance to the already-deceased applicant. The insurance company subsequently denied the wife\u2019s claim under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The widow brought suit, claiming that a life insurance contract was created because the application constituted a unilateral offer by the insurance company that was accepted by the decedent when he submitted the application and premium. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota rejected the wife\u2019s position. It acknowledged the general rule that \u201can application for insurance is an offer requiring the acceptance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>insurance company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 763. Moreover, the court was satisfied that the applicant knew that insurance company approval was required, because he signed the application, which contained the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cI understand and agree that no coverage shall take effect unless this application <em>is approved </em>by [the insurance company] and the first premium is paid during my lifetime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">I understand my coverage begins on the effective date <em>assigned by </em>[the insurance company].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Accordingly, the court concluded that the express language of the application foreclosed any assertion that the insurer was liable based on submission of the application, because the insurance company had not given its approval. The court stated: \u201cUnless otherwise provided for, an application for insurance is an offer by the applicant that must be assented to by the insurer during the lifetime of the applicant for a valid contract for life insurance to exist. Here no contract for life insurance ever came into being. [The insurance company] did not agree to insure [the applicant] before his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\"><em>Watts v. Life Ins. Co. of Ark, </em>30 Ark.App. 39, 782 S.W.2d 47 (1990), also provides guidance. In that case, an applicant for life insurance submitted an application on September 3, 1985, along with the first premium. The application stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">\u201cAfter the policy effective date, newly eligible persons may apply within 31 days after they become eligible, and individual insurance will become effective on the first day of the month next following the date the application is received. Eligible persons who do not apply either during the initial enrollment period or within 31 days after becoming eligible may thereafter apply, but <em>individual insurance shall not become effective until the first day of the month next following the date the application is approved by the Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>pany after submission of satisfacto'i'y evidence of insurability. </em>[Emphasis added.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 48-49 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Several days later, on September 18, 1985, the applicant died. Thereafter, the insurance company denied the beneficiary\u2019s death benefit under the policy, and returned the premium that had been submitted with the application. The beneficiary then filed suit, asserting that because the application did not specify the effective date, the applicant had a reasonable expectation that coverage would begin when the application was completed and the premium was submitted. The Court of Appeals of Arkansas disagreed, stating that \u201can applicant for insurance is afforded no coverage until the coverage becomes effective under the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. Moreover, it found that the terms of the policy were clear and unambiguous, with no provision for temporary coverage. Given the death of the applicant prior to the effective date of the policy, the court concluded that the applicant had no insurance coverage at the time of death. Accord <em>Wells v. United States Life Ins. Co., </em>119 Idaho 160, 804 P.2d 333 (1991) (concluding that, based on the language of the application, submission of application for life insurance, along with premium payment, did not create binding insurance policy on life of applicant, who disappeared 13 days later while in an airplane).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The out-of-state cases on which Mitchell relies are distinguishable from the facts in this case. For example, in <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 N.J. 520, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), the decedent\u2019s widow recovered based on the insurance broker\u2019s negligence; she did not recover from the insurance company. The <em>Brill </em>court recognized that the broker breached his duty to the insured to advise him regarding the option for a conditional receipt policy, which would have provided prompt coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Alternatively, we agree with New York Life that appellant presented no evidence to controvert appellee\u2019s evidence that George did not satisfy an objective standard of insurability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>We explain by returning to <em>Simpson, </em>227 Md. 393, 177 A.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Based on the premium receipt issued to the applicant in <em>Simpson, </em>the requested life insurance was to take effect at the time of the medical exam, if, under objective standards of insurability, the applicant was insurable at that time. <em>Id. </em>at 401, 177 A.2d 417. The Court stated that \u201c[t]he burden is ... on the plaintiff to show that the proposed insured met the objective test of insurability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 177 A.2d 417. Because the evidence of a \u201ctrace of sugar in the urine\u201d was not conclusive as to the insurability of the applicant, and the trial court never considered the issue, the Court determined that the plaintiff had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of insurability, and it remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>Peoples Life Ins. Co. v. Medairy, </em>255 Md. 534, 258 A.2d 429 (1969), is also helpful. In that case, the applicant completed the first part of a life insurance application on October 11, 1967, tendered the first premium, and received a receipt. On October 16, 1967, the insurance company\u2019s doctor examined the applicant and completed the second part of the application relating to medical information. The following day, the applicant suffered a fatal heart attack. When the insurance company refused to forward the death benefit to the applicant\u2019s wife as beneficiary, the widow brought suit. After a jury found in favor of the beneficiary, the insurer appealed. The Court determined that the beneficiary \u201cfailed to meet the burden of proof which rested upon her to show that the proposed insured met the objective test of insurability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 548, 258 A.2d 429, while the insurance company affirmatively showed the deceased\u2019s failure to meet the test. <em>Id. </em>at 549, 258 A.2d 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em>Cannon v. Southland Life Ins. Co., </em>263 Md. 463, 283 A.2d 404 (1971), also provides guidance. There, a father sought disability, accident, and sickness insurance for his 16-year-old son. On May 23, 1969, an insurance agent assisted the child\u2019s parents in completing the application. Two days later, the child was injured in an accident. Because the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>company received a check dated May 26, 1969, for the first quarterly premium, it issued a conditional receipt. Nonetheless, upon further review of the application, the company rejected the application, because its minimum age of insurability was 25. The applicant and his mother then brought suit against the insurance company. They argued that the agent had advised that the insurance would be effective \u201cimmediately,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 465, and the agent knew the son\u2019s age. Moreover, they argued that because the company occasionally insured applicants as young as 20 years of age, it had waived the standard of not insuring persons under 25. The trial court rejected those contentions and the Court of Appeals affirmed. It determined that the claimants failed to meet the burden of establishing that the son met the standard of insurability. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">Age is certainly ... an objective standard as a condition of health. There is nothing to the argument that because [the insurance company] had insured and would insure selected risks as young as twenty that it had abandoned or waived its age requirements. The applicants were all younger than twenty and would not have qualified even if Southland had lowered the general minimum of twenty-five to twenty before they made application. Appellants failed to meet the burden of proof which rested upon them to show that the applicants met [the insurance company\u2019s] honest objective standard of insurability and [the insurance company] proved that they did not. The judgment below properly was in favor of Southland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 470, 283 A.2d 404. Accord <em>Whitmire v. Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>172 Ga.App. 651, 323 S.E.2d 843 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee submitted its Underwriting Guidelines as an exhibit to Rice\u2019s affidavit. The document provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\"><em>Power of </em>Attorney\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">\u2022 Must provide legal copy of the papers. Papers should have raised seal or stamp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u2022 Papers <em>must </em>specify that the guardian has the right to obtain <em>life </em>insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u2022 We will offer only Guaranteed Acceptance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In his affidavit, Rice claimed that the Power of Attorney submitted by appellant did not meet appellee\u2019s Underwriting Guidelines. He said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">New York Life\u2019s Underwriting Guidelines related to the AARP Program require that in cases where a power of attorney is attempting to obtain an insurable interest on the life of the principal, the power of attorney \u201c[p]apers must specify that the guardian has the right to obtain <em>life </em>insurance.\u201d ... Because the power of attorney document sent in by [applicant] did not specify that he had a right to obtain life insurance on behalf of his father, New York Life would have rejected the application on this basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We agree with Rice that the Power of Attorney submitted by appellant failed to indicate that he had a right to obtain life insurance for George. Rather, it stated only that appellant may \u201cDO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: TO SELL, LEASE, GRANT, ENCUMBER, RELEASE OR OTHERWISE CONVEY ANY INTEREST IN MY REAL PROPERTY AND TO EXECUTE DEEDS AND ALL OTHER INSTRUMENTS ON MY BEHALF ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Further, Rice\u2019s affidavit provided that appellee would have rejected the application due to George\u2019s medical condition. Rice said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">[T]he decedent\u2019s medical condition would have also resulted in his application being rejected by New York Life. The decedent\u2019s enrollment application stated that he was suffering from emphysema and \u201cChronic Obstructive Lung Disease and Tracheobronchitis, nebulizer treatments, and intravenous fluids and antibiotics [sic].\u201d The decedent was also in the hospital at the time his application was completed. Moreover, the decedent failed to provide additional information requested in the enrollment application related to his medical condition under Section D of the enrollment application. As a result, the decedent\u2019s medical condition would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>have been classified as an unacceptable risk, and his application would have been rejected on this basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">George was at death\u2019s door when appellant submitted the application for life insurance. We cannot conceive of any life insurance company that would have issued a policy to George at that time. Undoubtedly, George\u2019s poor health explains why appellant never controverted Rice\u2019s affidavit as to the objective standard of insurability. Instead, appellant relied on his argument that his submission of the application and premium, appellee\u2019s deposit of the premium check, and the representations of appellee\u2019s agent combined to create a binding life insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We are amply satisfied that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee. By way of Rice\u2019s affidavit and exhibits, appellee satisfied its initial burden of \u201cpresenting] the material facts necessary to obtain judgment and demonstrate that there is no dispute as to any of those facts.\u201d <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>104 Md.App. 1, 48-49, 655 A.2d 1 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>342 Md. 363, 676 A.2d 65 (1996). The facts presented by appellee showed that appellee never accepted the risk of insuring George prior to his death, nor was George\u2019s insurability established.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Appellant\u2019s conclusory assertions were insufficient to overcome appellee\u2019s evidence. <em>See Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 676, 766 A.2d 617 (2001) (party opposing summary judgment <em>\u201cmust </em>produce sufficient evidence to the trial court [showing] that a genuine dispute of a material fact exists.\u201d); <em>Danielewicz v. Arnold, </em>137 Md.App. 601, 612-613, 769 A.2d 274 (2001) (stating that the nonmoving party <em>\u201cmust </em>submit evidence in which the [court] could reasonably find for\u201d the nonmoving party)(emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>365 Md. 65, 775 A.2d 1216 (2001); <em>Maryland Cas.
