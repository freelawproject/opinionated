The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed each of those offenses. This appeal involves appellant\u2019s challenges to the admissibility of that evidence and to Judge Turnbull\u2019s felony murder instruction. Appellant presents us with three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">I. Did the trial court err in declining to suppress evidence derived from conversations regarding the crime of robbery which were intercepted during a narcotics wiretap?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">II. Did the trial court err in declining to suppress appellant\u2019s statements to homicide detectives which were made after he had invoked his right to counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">III. Did the trial court err in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s requested instruction on felony murder?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">About 11:00 a.m. on February 7, 2000, appellant and three other men participated in a robbery at J. Brown Jewelers, a store located on Reisterstown Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bruce Prothero, an off-duty Baltimore County police sergeant, working as a security guard at the store, was fatally shot by one of the robbers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Approximately 30 watches, worth about $400,000, were stolen in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On the day after the robbery, appellant was arrested by Baltimore County detectives who were able to identify him as a result of telephone calls that he made to a telephone number that was the subject of a wiretap order issued by a judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On January 14, 2000, the monitoring officers had intercepted an incoming telephone call from an individual identified as \u201cFats\u201d (later identified as appellant) to Marcel Walton, one of the wiretap targets. During this call, \u201cFats\u201d discussed his participation in a \u201csmash and grab\u201d jewelry store robbery in Tysons Comer, Virginia, during which expensive watches had been stolen. On February 7, 2000, while \u201cworking\u201d the Walton wiretap, Detective Izaac Hester learned about the J.Brown \u201csmash and grab\u201d robbery and the murder of Sergeant Prothero.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Suspecting that \u201cFats\u201d might be involved in that robbery, Detective Hester immediately notified the supervising judge that the detectives monitoring Walton\u2019s telephone calls might overhear a discussion about the robbery. The supervising judge directed the officers to continue \u201cspot monitoring\u201d of incoming calls, in conformity with the \u201cminimization\u201d requirement of the wiretap order. The monitoring officers proceeded to intercept a series of calls between Walton and appellant. In one of the intercepted conversations, appellant informed Walton \u201cthat he had some Cartiers and Rolexes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Through the use of the court ordered surveillance equipment, the detectives were able to determine that \u201cFats\u201d made one of the calls from a phone located at 1013 North Ellamont Street in Baltimore City, and a surveillance was set up outside that address. At about 1:15 p.m. on February 8, 2000, appellant emerged from 1013 North Ellamont Street, walked in one direction, then in the other direction, crossed the street, looked into the surveillance van, and began running. After appellant was captured, the police searched the residence with the consent of its occupant, Rachel Potts (\u201cPotts\u201d). A search of the living room turned up a plastic bag containing watches. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The bag had been stuffed into a couch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On the day of his arrest, appellant initially invoked his right to counsel, but when Detective Phillip Marll advised him that he was being charged with first degree murder, he responded, \u201cHow can you charge me with murder? I didn\u2019t kill nobody.\u201d Appellant was presented with a statement of charges, and at this point stated that he \u201cwent in, broke a few display cases, stole some watches, but ... did not kill anyone.\u201d Appellant thereafter executed a written acknowledgment of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and waiver of his right to counsel. Eventually, he made a full statement, admitting that he \u201cplayed a part in it,\u201d but emphasizing that he did not have a gun and stated several times that \u201c[n]o one was supposed to get hurt.\u201d Appellant claimed that, at the time Sergeant Prothero was shot, he and Donald White had already \u201cpulled off the lot going to the rear of the store,\u201d and that he did not even know who fired the fatal shot until later that day, when he \u201csaw it on the news about the police officer,\u201d at which point \u201cTony (Richard Moore) told [appellant] that [Moore] had to shoot the man.\u201d Appellant also told the detectives where they could find the cars used in the robbery, where they could find the clothes he wore during the robbery, and where he purchased the mauls used to break the display cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Appellant argues that, even though his conversations were intercepted during the execution of a wiretap order that had been issued in strict compliance with all of the applicable Maryland and federal statutory requirements,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we must apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to the discovery of his identity and whereabouts because that information was derived from the interception of the telephone calls he placed on February 7, 2000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no merit in that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">According to appellant, because the wiretap order authorized only the interception of conversations involving violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act \u2014 and had not been amended at anytime thereafter \u2014 surveillance of appellant\u2019s conversations about the February 7th robbery violated his Fourth Amendment and statutory rights. This argument is based on the proposition that, because the monitoring officers intercepted prior conversations about robberies, there was nothing \u201cunanticipated\u201d about the phone calls he placed on February 7, 2000, and the information derived from the interception of those phone calls must be suppressed because the monitoring officers had failed to \u201capply\u201d as soon as practicable after January 14th for judicial authorization to intercept the now \u201cexpected\u201d conversations regarding the crime of robbery. Appellant argues in his brief that the police were required to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">apply \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d for judicial authorization to continue to listen to the now expected conversations regarding the crime of robbery. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1998 Repl.Vol.) Section 10-407(e); ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">... What would be \u201creasonable under the circumstances,\u201d then, would be for the police to follow both their strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>written minimization guidelines and the statutory mandate of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 10-407(e) and seek an amended court order authorizing the interception of robbery conversations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Even though Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., section 10-407(e) (and its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. 2517(5)) is of no consequence to the issue of whether a wiretap order should be <em>amended </em>to authorize the future interception of conversations pertaining to crimes that were not specified in the original wiretap order,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cwe have no difficulty discerning the precise nature of appellant\u2019s contention.\u201d <em>Sherman v. State, </em>288 Md. 636, 640, 421 A.2d 80 (1980). We must decide whether there is merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the State was required to petition for an amendment to the- wiretap order that would authorize interception of conversations relating to the crime of robbery..</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., section 10 408(e)(3), provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOL\">[e]very order and extension thereof shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this subtitle, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in 30 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The minimization requirement exists \u201cto prevent unnecessary intrusion into the privacy of the surveillance target ...\u201d <em>Ezenwa v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 489, 508, 572 A.2d 1101 (1990)(quoting <em>Poore v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 44, 64, 384 A.2d 103, <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 737 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In <em>State v. Mazzone, </em>336 Md. 379, 383, 648 A.2d 978 (1994), the Court of Appeals confirmed that compliance with the minimization mandate in an intercept authorization order is a \u201cpost condition,\u201d that is, an action \u201cthat must be taken after a valid wiretap order has been issued.\u201d Unlike violations of a precondition, which are evaluated under a \u201cstrict compliance\u201d standard and which require the suppression of all evidence derived from the wiretap, post conditions are evaluated under a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 648 A.2d 978. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">In the context of minimization, the substantial compliance standard is actually a reasonable compliance standard, which evaluates \u201cthe overall reasonableness of the totality of the conduct of the monitoring agents in light of the purpose of the wiretap and the information available to the agents at the time of the interception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 384, 648 A.2d 978 (quoting <em>Spease v. State, </em>275 Md. 88, 99, 338 A.2d 284 (1975)). The <em>Mazzone </em>Court \u201cemphasize[d] that minimization is not prohibition\u201d and stated that \u201cspot monitoring\u201d may be necessary to determine if a communication falls within the scope of the authorization order. <em>Id. </em>at 391, 648 A.2d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">When deciding a motion for suppression based on a \u201cfailure to minimize\u201d argument, the court must consider ten factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">(1) the nature and scope of the crime being investigated; (2) the sophistication of those under suspicion and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>efforts to avoid surveillance through such devices as coded conversations; (3) the location and the operation of the subject telephone; (4) government expectation of the contents of the call; (5) the extent of judicial supervision; (6) the duration of the wiretap; (7) the purpose of the wiretap; (8) the length of the calls monitored; (9) the existence of a pattern of pertinent calls, which the monitoring agents could discern so as to eliminate the interception of non-pertinent calls; (10) the absence of monitoring of privileged conversations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 648 A.2d 978. The <em>Mazzone </em>Court also noted that, even if a monitoring officer\u2019s actions are found to be unreasonable, \u201cthe sanction would not be to suppress all communications intercepted by the monitoring agents. The maximum sanction for violation of the reasonable compliance standard, in the circumstances of [that] case, would require suppression of only the conversations that were unreasonably intercepted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398, 648 A.2d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">It is well settled that the plain view doctrine is applicable when an officer executing a court authorized wiretap for drug related conversations overhears conversations related to other offenses. Appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated because, \u201ceven though inadvertence is a characteristic of most \u2018plain view5 seizures, it is not a necessary condition.\u201d <em>Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 130, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 2304, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990). <em>See also Sanford v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 23, 28-31, 589 A.2d 74 (1991), and <em>Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 89, 771 A.2d 389 (2001) (both holding that inadvertence is not a requirement of the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine). Neither the Fourth Amendment nor any applicable statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires law enforcement officers to avoid intercepting all nonrelevant conversations when conducting a wiretap investigation. <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136-143, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978). Efforts to minimize nonrelevant conversations must be \u201cobjectively rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>sonable\u201d in light of the circumstances confronting the interceptor. See <em>Scott, </em>486 U.S. at 137-40, 98 S.Ct. 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In <em>United States v. McKinnon, </em>721 F.2d 19 (1st Cir.1983), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected the contention that the appellant was entitled to suppression of intercepted conversations relating to federal firearms offenses because the Massachusetts law enforcement officers who intercepted those conversations were executing a state court-issued wiretap order that authorized the interception of only conversations relating to drug offenses. In its analysis of the \u201cminimization\u201d requirements found in 18 U.S.C. 2518(5), the <em>McKinnon </em>Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">We do not believe that evidence relating to crimes other than those specified in a wiretap warrant must be discovered \u201cinadvertently\u201d or take officers by \u201csurprise\u201d in order for a court properly to authorize the use of such evidence pursuant to section 2517(5). Congress intended that evidence relating to unauthorized offenses should be given retroactive judicial approval under section 2517(5) if the \u201coriginal [wiretap warrant] was lawfully obtained, ... was sought in <em>good faith and not as a subterfuge search, </em>and that the communication was in fact <em>incidentally </em>intercepted during the course of a lawfully executed order. (Emphasis supplied)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">... While an interception that is unanticipated is <em>a fortiori </em>incidental, the converse is not true: something does not have to be unanticipated in order to be incidental. Evidence of crimes other than those authorized in a wiretap warrant are intercepted \u201cincidentally\u201d when they are the by-product of a bona fide investigation of crimes specified in a valid warrant. Congress did not intend that a suspect be insulated from evidence of one of his illegal activities gathered during the course of a bona fide investigation of another of his illegal activities merely because law enforcement agents are aware of his diversified criminal portfolio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtV\">721 F.2d at 22-23. Our interpretation of the applicable Maryland law is entirely consistent with the <em>McKinnon </em>Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>interpretation of the parallel federal statute. The State was not required to amend the wiretap order as a condition precedent to monitoring appellant\u2019s February 7th phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">An evaluation of reasonableness \u201cmust be ascertained from the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d <em>Spease, </em>275 Md. at 99, 338 A.2d 284.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Judge Turnbull was not clearly erroneous in finding that substantial compliance with the minimization requirements was achieved in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After the January 14, 2000 conversation indicating that \u201cFats\u201d had participated in the Virginia \u201csmash and grab\u201d robbery, the monitoring officers informed the supervising judge that they had intercepted a communication regarding an unspecified offense. Thereafter, but prior to February 7, 2000, the monitoring officers presented the supervising judge with logs and reports of ensuing conversations between \u201cFats\u201d and Walton. Furthermore, on February 7th, after learning about the robbery and murder of Sergeant Prothero, the monitoring officer immediately contacted the supervising judge. Under these circumstances, we agree with Judge Turnbull that appellant was not entitled to suppression of the fruits of the Walton wiretap. <em>See Scott v. United States, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 135, 98 S.Ct. 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Appellant also challenges the denial of his motion to suppress his inculpatory statements to police. Appellant invoked his right to counsel more than once while in a holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>cell, before detectives arrived to interview him. Detective Phillip Marll testified that he therefore consulted with Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Ann Brobst, who agreed that there could be no interrogation because appellant\u2019s assertions of his right to counsel had been clear and unequivocal. The detective then prepared appellant\u2019s statement of charges and informed appellant that he was being charged with murder. At this point, appellant insisted that he had not killed anyone and that he wanted to tell the police what had happened. Although repeatedly advised that the officers could not talk with him because he had asserted his right to counsel, appellant declared that he understood his rights and that he wished to tell the police who killed the victim. Appellant was then advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and signed a waiver, confirming that he wished to speak to the officers. Appellant gave an oral statement, admitting that he participated in the robbery, but insisting that he had not carried a gun and that Tony Moore was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Appellant argues that the conduct of the police was designed to \u201cspark\u201d his statement, thereby rendering his waiver a nullity. See <em>Bryant v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 272, 431 A.2d 714, <em>cert. denied </em>291 Md. 782 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 2020, 72 L.Ed.2d 474 (1982), and <em>Wallace v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 235, 640 A.2d 749 (1994). From our independent review of the record, we hold that appellant\u2019s statement was admissible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u201cIt is established law that once a defendant, \u2018detained in a custodial setting, has asserted his right to counsel, all interrogation must cease until an attorney has been furnished to consult with him or he initiates further communication, exchange or conversations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 760, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996)(quoting <em>State v. Conover, </em>312 Md. 33, 38, 537 A.2d 1167 (1988), in turn citing, <em>inter alia, Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981)). Appellant argues that the conduct of the police in this case constituted an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d We are persuaded, however, that the police officers\u2019 conduct was not the functional equivalent of an interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">For purposes of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\"><em>Williams, </em>342 Md. at 760, 679 A.2d 1106 (quoting <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980)(footnote omitted in Williams)); <em>accord Argueta v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 273, 283-89, 764 A.2d 863 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, supra, </em>the defendant, who had been arrested for a robbery committed with a shotgun, was being transported to the police station. During the drive, the officers expressed their concern about the safety of handicapped children should one of them find the gun used in the robbery. Overhearing those comments, Innis led the police to a nearby field, where the shotgun was found under some rocks by the side of the road. 446 U.S. at 293-304, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The Supreme Court held that the officers\u2019 conversation about the children\u2019s safety was not the functional equivalent of interrogation. The <em>Innis </em>Court observed that the entire conversation \u201cconsisted of not more than a few offhand remarks\u201d rather than \u201ca lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect,\u201d that there was nothing to suggest that the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>were aware that Innis\u2019 conscience was peculiarly susceptible to an appeal concerning the safety of handicapped children, and that there was nothing in the record indicating that Innis was unusually disoriented or upset by his arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 302-03, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Informing a suspect of the charges or evidence against him is simply not \u2014 of itself \u2014 the equivalent of interrogation. <em>See Williams, </em>342 Md. at 760-61, 679 A.2d 1106 (comments which simply advised Williams that police had evidence, that they believed established his guilt in a double homicide, were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response); <em>Vines v. State, </em>285 Md. 369, 372-81, 402 A.2d 900 (1979)(displaying seized contraband and presenting copy of search warrant listing seized inventory did not constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In <em>Williams, </em>the Court of Appeals rejected the contention that certain words and actions of police officers were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses from a person who had asserted his right to counsel. Williams made one incriminating statement \u201cas the police officers began to gather their papers and told [him] to remove his earring,\u201d and another statement after one of the officers commented that \u201c \u2018[t]his is going to work\u2019 \u201d and reiterated that he was being charged with two murders. <em>Id. </em>at 761, 679 A.2d 1106. According to the Court of Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">[t]hese were routine procedures that the officers could hardly be expected to anticipate would prompt an incriminating statement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">These comments simply advised Williams that police had evidence they believed established Williams\u2019s guilt in a double homicide, and as a result he was being charged with murder. We cannot conclude that the trial judge erred in finding that these innocuous comments were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating responses from Williams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">We agree with Judge Turnbull that, by informing appellant that he was being charged with murder and by reading him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the statement of charges, Detective Marll did not engage in the functional equivalent of interrogation. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The State\u2019s case against appellant is a classic example of felony murder, when a victim is gunned down by one of the robbers to further the robbers\u2019 escape from the scene of the robbery. In his final claim of reversible error, appellant contends that Judge Turnbull erroneously refused to grant his requested instruction on felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The jurors received the following \u201cfelony murder\u201d instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">The defendant is charged with the crime of first degree felony murder. In order to convict the Defendant of the first degree felony murder the State must prove that the Defendant committed or attempted to commit a robbery, that the Defendant or another participating in the crime killed Sergeant Bruce Prothero, and three, that the act resulting in the death of Sergeant Prothero occurred during the commission, attempted commission, or escape from the immediate scene of the robbery.
