In this case, appellant, Jeffrey Fantle, voluntarily made overpayments of alimony to his former wife, appellee, Judy Fantle, and then, when his. financial circumstances deteriorated, reduced his payments to an amount less than that required by the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement and. ordered by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Five months after appellee demanded that appellant resume making the full payments originally ordered by the court, appellant filed a petition to modify alimony, and appellee countered by filing a motion to hold appellant in contempt for the underpayments of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In granting appellee\u2019s motion in part, the circuit court held that appellant could not lawfully apply overpayments in alimony to subsequent arrearages, as there had been no formal \u201ccourt order or agreement\u201d modifying the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement to \u201csatisfy a reduction in the amount of [appellant\u2019s] arrearage.\u201d It therefore entered a judgment in favor of appellee and against appellant in the amount of $16,400 in underpaid alimony. From that judgment, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Appellant presents the following issues, which we have reworded and reordered to facilitate our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in holding that appellant was not entitled to apply prior overpayments of alimony to later underpayments of alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">II. Whether appellee\u2019s agreeing to or acquiescencing in appellant\u2019s request to lower his monthly alimony pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ments precludes appellee from later claiming an arrearage during that period of acquiescence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">III. Whether appellee failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that appellant\u2019s excess alimony payments to appellee were \u201cgifts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">IV. Whether the circuit court erred in prohibiting appellant from testifying as to why he overpaid alimony from September 1995 through December 1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court because it erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that in the absence of a formal \u201ccourt order or agreement\u201d it had no discretion to apply prior overpayments of alimony to subsequent underpayments and because it erroneously prohibited appellant from testifying as to his reasons for making those overpayments. That testimony would no doubt have shed light on whether the overpayments were intended as a gift or otherwise. Because we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment on those grounds and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, we shall not address the remaining issues, except to the extent we believe it will be helpful to do so for the guidance of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Appellant and appellee were married on January 14, 1973, and separated seventeen years later on February 23, 1990. The parties subsequently entered into a property settlement agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d). That Agreement required appellant to pay appellee monthly alimony of $2,500 from March 1994 through August 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">On April 11, 1994, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted the parties a Judgment of Absolute Divorce. Their property settlement agreement was incorporated but not merged into that decree. Beginning September 1995, the Agreement reduced appellant\u2019s alimony payments to $2,000 per month for the remainder of appellant\u2019s payment obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Despite this reduction, appellant continued to pay appellee $2,500 per month from September 1995 through November 1997, resulting in an overpayment of $13,500.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to appellant, he had overpaid his alimony obligation because \u201cJudy needed the money, and ... [h]e was making enough money\u201d at that time to do it. At the hearing on this matter, however, appellant was denied the opportunity to expand on this explanation by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">According to appellant, his financial \"circumstances began to deteriorate in February 1997, and in August 1998 appellant requested that appellee permit him to reduce his monthly alimony obligation from $2,000 to $1,000. Appellant testified that appellee \u201cwas unhappy, but she agreed to [the reduction].\u201d Beginning August 1998, appellant reduced his payments to $1,000 per month.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">In a letter dated April 23,1999, to appellant, appellee wrote: I agreed to accommodate your cash flow needs for a period of time because you willingly paid me $500 more each month for a year or so shortly after the divorce to help me through a financially difficult time. So I extended the same courtesy to you. However, as I explained to you last week, I can no longer afford to do this because of the financial strain it is causing me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">In that letter, appellee demanded that appellant resume making alimony payments of $2,000 per month. Despite appellee\u2019s demand, appellant continued to pay only $1,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">On October 7, 1999, appellant filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a petition to modify alimony, and on December 13,1999, appellee filed a motion to hold appellant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>contempt for having failed to pay his $2,000 monthly alimony obligation since August 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">On June 2, 2000, after finding that appellant had suffered an \u201capproximately 60 percent\u201d reduction in income, the circuit court granted appellant\u2019s petition to modify alimony and reduced his monthly alimony obligation from $2,000 to $1,200. The court, however, denied appellee\u2019s motion to hold appellant in contempt, explaining: \u201cI do not find that Mr. Fantie\u2019s actions have been contemptuous. I think he showed good will in paying more money when he had it and feels that he did not have the money to maintain the $2,000.00, and I cannot find that that is contemptuous.\u201d Nonetheless, the court granted a judgment in favor of appellee in the amount of $16,400, representing the alimony appellant had underpaid from August 1998 through May 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in ruling that he was not entitled to apply overpayments of alimony to later underpayments of alimony. In so ruling, the circuit court stated that, in the absence of a formal \u201ccourt order or agreement\u201d modifying the parties\u2019 Agreement, appellant could not lawfully apply the overpayments to subsequent arrearages and that it lacked the discretion to find otherwise. The trial court further explained, \u201cunless there is a written agreement modifying [the parties\u2019 agreement], I think any payments over and above what appellant was required to make would not be recouped in this type of action.\u201d As the court did not believe it had the discretion to retroactively apply overpayments to past due underpayments of alimony, it did not consider the arguments advanced by appellant for doing so, namely, that appellee had either agreed to the reduction or at least acquiesced to it or had in effect waived her claim to the difference between the reduced payment and the court-ordered payment. Nor did the court consider, we should add, appellee\u2019s claim that the overpayments were intended as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>We begin our analysis by noting that this Court recently held that Maryland statutory law does not \u201cbar modification of alimony retroactive to a date preceding the filing of a request.\u201d <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>136 Md.App. 203, 222, 764 A.2d 378 (2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>363 Md. 661, 770 A.2d 169 (2001). And the retroactive modification of alimony is \u201ca matter for the trial court in the exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>Langston, </em>this Court considered whether Dr. Langston could, without a court order but allegedly in accordance with his separation agreement, unilaterally reduce his alimony payments to Mrs. Langston, because of a diminution in income. We also considered the larger question of whether Maryland law permits a court to modify retroactively alimony payments to a date preceding the filing of a request for modification. In that case, we held that the language of the Langstons\u2019 separation agreement contemplated court approval of any change in the amount of alimony. As for the trial court\u2019s right to reduce pre-petition alimony, we held that not only does Maryland law not prohibit such a reduction but in fact the trial court possessed the discretion to do so under Maryland Code (1984, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), \u00a7 11-107(b) of the Family Law Article. That provision provides that \u201c[s]ubject to \u00a7 8-103 ... the court may modify the amount of alimony awarded as circumstances and justice require.\u201d We further held that although the parties\u2019 separation agreement \u201cdoes not provide for modification of alimony retroactive to the date when [Dr. Langston] first sustained a decrease in income,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 227, 764 A.2d 378, the court may exercise its discretion and retroactively modify an alimony obligation. We cautioned, however, that because such a modification could \u201ccause extreme hardship to the payee spouse,\u201d for whom it was \u201ctoo late ... to cancel or adjust expenses already incurred,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 234-35, 764 A.2d 378, the trial court \u201cshould be wary of permitting\u201d retroactive modification of alimony. Indeed, we added that \u201cprinciples of equity require compelling circumstances to justify such a request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 764 A.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">As in <em>Langston, </em>there is nothing in the parties\u2019 Agreement that would prohibit a retroactive modification of alimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Paragraph 12(c) of the Agreement addresses the question of modification by simply stating that \u201c[a]limony as set forth herein shall be modifiable technically, but shall not be subject to extension.\u201d Nor, as we observed in <em>Langston, </em>is \u201cthe absence of the contract clause expressly permitting reduction of alimony retroactive to a date prior to the filing of a request ... dispositive____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 764 A.2d 378. Indeed, under F.L \u00a7 11 107(b), the court has the discretion to modify alimony retroactively \u201cas circumstances and justice require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Unfortunately, the court below did not have the <em>Langston </em>case before it when it ruled, as that case was decided six months later. It therefore erroneously held that it could not retroactively modify appellant\u2019s alimony obligation, notwithstanding its finding that appellant had suffered a substantial decline in income, constituting \u201ca material change in circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 764 A.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Nor, unaccountably, did the court consider whether the parties by words or deeds, impliedly or expressly, had modified the Agreement, reducing appellant\u2019s alimony obligation until appellee\u2019s letter of April 23rd demanding resumption of full monthly payments. It is well settled that parties to a written contract that is not governed by the Statute of Frauds may orally modify the terms of that contract even if the \u201c \u2018written contract provides that it shall not be varied except by an agreement in writing....\u2019\u201d <em>Hoffman v. Glock, </em>20 Md.App. 284, 288, 815 A.2d 551 (1974)(quoting <em>Freeman v. Stanbern Const. Co., </em>205 Md. 71, 79, 106 A.2d 50 (1954)); <em>see also Essential Housing Dev. Inc., v. Landev Invests., Inc., </em>No. 98-1563, 1999 WL 1134548, at *5, 1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 32480, at *18 (4th Cir. Dec. 13, 1999)(quoting <em>Freeman, </em>205 Md. at 79, 106 A.2d 50). Compounding this error, the circuit court prohibited appellant from explaining the reasons for his prior overpayments, as reflected in the following testimonial excerpt:</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">[MR. KANE]: And what was the purpose of the additional payment?</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">[MR. FANTLE]: She still needed the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>[MR. KANE]: Okay. And what was your intent with that\u2014 in paying her this additional money?</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">[MR. STEIN]: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">[THE COURT]: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We can only surmise that had appellant been permitted to testify, he might have presented sufficient evidence upon which the court might have found that appellee had either agreed to, acquiesced in, or waived the difference between the reduced and court ordered payments. In that event, the court could have, in its discretion, applied the overpayments to the arrearages without ever having to address the question of judicial modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">To establish waiver, for example, there must be a voluntary \u201crelinquishment of a known right, or such conduct as warrants an inference of the relinquishment of such right, and may result from an express agreement or be inferred from circumstances.\u201d <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Blumberg, </em>234 Md. 521, 531, 200 A.2d 166 (1964). However, the \u201cintention to waive must be clearly established and will not be inferred from equivocal acts or language.\u201d <em>Charles J. Frank, Inc. v. Associated Jewish Charities of Baltimore, Inc., </em>294 Md. 443, 449, 450 A.2d 1304 (1982) (citing <em>BarGale Indus., Inc. v. Robert Realty Co., Inc., </em>275 Md. 638, 644, 343 A.2d 529 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">As noted earlier, in her April 23, 1999 letter to appellant, appellee acknowledged that she had \u201cagreed\u201d to accept the reduced alimony payments to \u201caccommodate\u201d appellant because he had assisted her during a \u201cfinancially difficult time.\u201d In that letter, appellee wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">I agreed to accommodate your cash flow needs for a period of time because you willingly paid me $500 more each month for a year or so shortly after the divorce to help me through a financially difficult time. So I extended the same courtesy to you. However, as I explained to you last week, I can no longer afford to do this because of the financial strain it is causing me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Nor did she dispute at trial that she voluntarily cashed appellant\u2019s checks, as reflected in the following testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">[MR. KANE]: And then from August of 1998 through \u2014 do you have Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 10 [appellee\u2019s letter] in front of you?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">[MS. FANTLE]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">[MR. KANE]: What is the date you sent that letter?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">[MS. FANTLE]: April 23rd, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">[MR. KANE]: Okay. So, for the period of [August through April of 1999] \u2014 for a nine month period, you <em>voluntarily </em>cashed his $1,000 checks; did you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">[MR. STEIN]: Objection\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">[THE COURT]: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">[MR. STEIN]: \u2014 to the word \u201cvoluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">[THE COURT]: Well, I think she testified that \u2014 I am sure nobody held a gun to her head and made her cash them.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">[MR. STEIN]: And we don\u2019t object to the fact that she cashed the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">We further note that at the time of the reduction, appellant did not offer nor did appellee apparently request that he make up the difference at some later date. In fact, in appellee\u2019s letter of April 23rd to appellant, she demands that he resume making the full court-ordered payments but does not request he pay any arrearages. Given these facts, and perhaps others that appellant was prevented from testifying to, if the court had considered this issue it might have concluded that appellee voluntarily \u201crelinquished] a known right\u201d to the arrearages during this period. <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc., </em>234 Md. at 531, 200 A.2d 166 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">Alternatively, the court could have found from the evidence admitted and the unadmitted testimony of appellant that the parties had in fact modified the agreement themselves. It is well settled that parties to a contract \u201cmay agree to vary its terms and enter into a new [agreement] embodying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the changes agreed upon and a subsequent modification of a written contract may be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cole v. Wilbanks, </em>226 Md. 34, 38, 171 A.2d 711 (1961). Nor must that agreement necessarily be in writing or expressly stated. \u2018\u201cAssent to an offer to vary, modify or change a contract may be implied and found from circumstances and the conduct of the parties showing acquiescence or agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edell &amp; Associates, P.C. v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, </em>No. 00-2069, 264 F.3d 424, 440, 2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 19038, at *40-41 (4th Cir. August 24, 2001)(quoting <em>Cole v. Wilbanks, </em>226 Md. at 38, 171 A.2d 711). Moreover, once a party has accepted the performance of an oral agreement, \u201cneither consideration nor a writing is necessary.\u201d <em>Software Clearing House, Inc. v. Intrak, Inc., </em>66 Ohio App.3d 163, 583 N.E.2d 1056, 1061 (1990)(citing <em>Morrison v. Devore Tracking, Inc., </em>68 Ohio App.2d 140, 428 N.E.2d 438, 441 (1980)(\u201c[S]ubsequent acts and agreements may modify the terms of a contract.... \u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In sum, the court had before it, had it chosen to consider this issue, evidence from which it could have found an express or implied agreement to modify the alimony obligation of the Agreement: \u201cimplied\u201d in that the parties, without ever expressing it in words, may have had a tacit understanding that each would holp the other by either increasing or decreasing payments as circumstances warranted; \u201cexpress\u201d in that the April 23rd letter and oral communications between parties may have constituted a verbal modification of appellant\u2019s alimony obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We caution, however, that we are not suggesting that the court, after these issues have been fully presented on remand, will necessarily conclude that the appellee waived her claim to the alimony arrearages to the extent of the overpayment or that the parties had agreed to modify the Agreement to provide for a reduction in alimony during the period in question. In fact, on remand, the court may determine, as appellee contends, that the overpayments were a \u201cgift,\u201d and therefore appellant must pay the full amount of the arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>There are three elements of a gift: 1) donative intent, 2) actual delivery by donor, and 3) acceptance by the donee. <em>Dorsey v. Dorsey, </em>302 Md. 312, 318, 487 A.2d 1181 (1985). \u201cThe burden,\u201d however, \u201cis on the donee to establish every element of a gift\u201d by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To prove donative intent, \u201cit must be shown from the evidence that the donor clearly and unmistakably intended to permanently relinquish all interest in\u201d the gift. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Schilling v. Waller, </em>243 Md. 271, 276-77, 220 A.2d 580 (1966)). Once evidence is adduced establishing all three elements, a valid gift is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <em>Dorsey v. Dorsey, </em>302 Md. 312, 318, 487 A.2d 1181 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In support of her claim that the overpayments were a gift, appellee relies on the following statement in Paragraph 6 of appellant\u2019s petition for modification of alimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">The Petitioner\u2019s overpayment of the support obligations was neither done in error nor was it a miscalculation or misunderstanding; rather, the Petitioner made a conscious, benevolent effort to assist his former wife in a time when he enjoyed financial prosperity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">To rebut appellee\u2019s claim of a \u201cdonative intent,\u201d appellant produced at the hearing below his state and federal tax returns for the years 1995 through 1997. These returns listed the monthly overpayments made to appellee as alimony, not gifts. On remand, this issue and others will be before the circuit court for its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">JUDGMENT VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">COSTS TO BE PAID EQUALLY BY APPELLANT AND APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\">.
