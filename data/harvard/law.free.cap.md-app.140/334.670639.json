At the relevant time, the Caroline Center, Inc. (the \u201cCenter,\u201d the \u201cBorrower,\u201d or the \u201cCaroline Center\u201d), a private adult care facility, was in receivership, pursuant to proceedings initiated by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cthe Department\u201d), appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The Bank incurred attorneys\u2019 fees of almost $55,000 during a 15-month period when, as a secured creditor, it attempted to recover the monies owed by the Center. Although the terms of the loan obligated the Borrower to pay the Bank\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, the court only awarded Allfirst legal fees of $25,702.85, pursuant to an Order of July 26, 2000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Allfirst presents four questions, which we have consolidated, rephrased, and re-ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">I. Did the circuit court err or abuse its discretion in awarding partial attorneys\u2019 fees to appellant, based on its finding that the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Allfirst after the initial hearing were unnecessary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">II. Did the circuit court deny appellant due process by holding a prompt hearing on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, without prior notice, and without affording the Bank an opportunity to respond in writing or to present evidence in support of its claim for attorney\u2019s fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Department has moved to dismiss the appeal, claiming that appellant has not appealed from a final judgment. For the reasons that follow, we shall deny the motion to dismiss, vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The Caroline Center, a Maryland corporation, is a private adult care facility that was licensed in 1984 to house and care for developmentally disabled adults. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-338(c)(2) of the Health-General Article (\u201cH.G.\u201d). It is funded by the Department\u2019s Developmental Disabilities Administration. In 1999, the Center provided residential services to approximately 48 clients and day services to about 76 non-residential clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Addie Houston, the Center\u2019s Executive Director, resigned in 1994. Shortly thereafter, the Center hired Life Action Partnership, Inc. (\u201cLAP\u201d), a for-profit Maryland corporation, to manage the Center. Houston was President and sole stockholder of LAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">On May 6, 1997, the Center obtained a fine of credit from the First National Bank of Maryland, evidenced by a $350,000 Demand Business Purpose Promissory Note (\u201cthe Note\u201d) dated May 6, 1997, executed by the Center and payable to the Bank, along with a loan agreement of the same date. The loan was collateralized by a perfected first priority security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>interest and lien in almost all of the Center\u2019s non-real estate assets, under a Security Agreement dated May 6, 1997. Financing statements were also executed by the Center in favor of the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Paragraph 10 of the Note is relevant here. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">10. EXPENSES OF COLLECTION. Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Bank in collecting sums due under this Promissory Note, including without limitation the costs of any lien, judgment or other record searches, appraisals, travel expenses and the like. <em>In addition, if this Promissory Note is referred to an attorney for collection, whether or not judgment has been confessed or suit has been filed, Borrower shall pay all of the holder\u2019s costs, fees (including but not limited to, the holder\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, charges and expenses) and all other expenses resulting from such referral.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Several sections of the Security Agreement are also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">I. DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">F. Obligations. The term \u201cObligations\u201d means collectively the obligations of [Caroline Center] to pay to Bank: ... (iii) the expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling or otherwise disposing of or realizing on the Collateral, or of any exercise by Bank of Bank\u2019s rights <em>in the event of a default by Borrower or any Other Obligor, together with Bank\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses of collection, and court costs.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">11. GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">A. Collateral. As security for all Obligations of Borrower to Bank, and in consideration of advances from Bank to Borrower, [Caroline Center] hereby grants and pledges to [Allfirst] a continuing security interest in all of [Caroline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Center\u2019s] Equipment, Inventory and Receivables, together with all the Other Property of the [Caroline Center].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">VI. REMEDIES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">A. Specific Rights and Remedies. In addition to all other rights and remedies provided by law and the loan documents, [Allfirst], upon the occurrence of any default, may: (i) accelerate and call due the unpaid principal balance of any promissory note evidencing any of the Obligations, and all accrued interest and other sums due as of the date of default----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">B. Costs of Collections. Upon the occurrence of any default, [Allfirst] shall be entitled to recover from [Caroline Center] <em>attorneys\u2019 fees equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the unpaid balance of the Obligations at the time of default (to the extent not prohibited by law), plus court costs and other expenses which may be incurred by Bank in the enforcement or attempted enforcement of its rights hereunder, </em>whether against any third party, [Caroline Center], or any Other Obligor. Expenses recoverable from [Caroline Center] shall (to the extent not prohibited by law) include costs of collection including salaries, out-of-pocket travel, living expenses and the hiring of agents, consultants, accountants, or otherwise. <em>All sums of money thus expended, and all other monies expended by Bank to protect its interest in the Collateral (including insurance, taxes or repairs) shall be repayable by [Caroline Center] to [Allfirst] on demand, </em>such repayment to be secured as provided above in paragraph II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The Center acknowledges that it experienced a \u201cperiod of mismanagement and financial instability.\u201d On or about May 6, 1999, LAP notified the Department that it would be unable to meet the Center\u2019s payroll for May 21,1999, because Allfirst refused to release funds to the Center for that purpose. As a result, the Department provided the Center with funds to continue its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>After reviewing documentation submitted by the Center, the Department notified the Center and LAP on May 14, 1999, that it had reason to revoke the Center\u2019s license due to the Center\u2019s financial problems. Nevertheless, the Department sought to assist the Center with its management and financial problems, so that it could continue to provide services to its clients. To that end, appellees attempted to negotiate a forbearance agreement with the Bank, without success. Instead, on May 27, 1999, the Bank demanded immediate payment of the $350,000 due and owing under the Note, which was then in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">By letter of May 28, 1999, the Bank contacted the Center regarding the default, stating that the Center \u201chas been in default thereunder for a significant period of time. For these reasons, [Allfirst] is immediately entitled to exercise and enforce various rights, remedies and recourse under Loan Documents and applicable law ...\u201d Indeed, Allfirst immediately seized approximately $43,000 from the Center\u2019s checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">On the same date, May 28, 1999, the Department and the Center entered into a Consent Agreement, which incorporated a plan to restore financial stability to the Center. For fiscal year 2000, the Caroline Center expected to receive its first quarterly payment from the Department on July 1, 1999. Until then, pursuant to the Consent Agreement, the Department agreed to provide the Center with approximately $575,000 in operating funds, to enable it to provide services through June 30, 1999. The Department provided the Center with financing of $558,700 on June 3,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 19-334, the Department filed a \u201cPetition for Appointment of Receiver\u201d (the \u201cPetition\u201d) on June 2,1999, to allow the Center to continue to operate and furnish care to its disabled residential and non-residential clients in Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties and on the Eastern Shore, who ranged in age from 17 to 77. In the Petition, the Department averred that the Center was insolvent, in imminent danger of closing, and that a receiver was needed for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>welfare of the Center\u2019s clients. Further, the Department alleged that it wanted to \u201cprotect the consumers and assume the rights of all creditors,\u201d which required \u201ctime,\u201d due to the Center\u2019s many problems. In its brief, the Department explains that it filed the Petition \u201cto protect the remaining assets of the Caroline Center, preserve monies paid by the Department to support continuing operations, and to ... resolve other issues of management and finances.\u201d On the same day, the court appointed Maryland First Financial Services Corporation, Inc. as the receiver (the \u201cReceiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">On June 11, 1999, the Receiver moved to stay all actions against the Center, claiming that \u201ca stay is necessary to permit the Receiver to identify and assess the financial obligations of the Center, develop a plan for orderly administration of the Center\u2019s facilities, and ensure the health, safety and well-being of the clients of the Center without the distraction and expense of dealing with claims by creditors on an ad hoc basis.\u201d The Receiver sought to avoid payment to the Bank of the monies that had been advanced to the Center by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On June 17, 1999, Allfirst filed a discovery motion and a \u201cMotion For Order Directing Receiver to pay Indebtedness Pursuant to Maryland Code Health-General \u00a7 19-337(f)(l).\u201d The Bank claimed that the statute entitled it to immediate payment, in full, of its secured debt. The court held a hearing on the motion on June 28, 1999. Although we have not been provided with a transcript of that hearing, the parties seem to agree that the court assured appellant\u2019s counsel that the Bank would eventually obtain payment of its debt, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">By order of July 9,1999, the court denied Allfirst\u2019s motions, stating that \u201cimmediate repayment of the entire indebtedness of Caroline Center ... would place the Receivership in a precarious financial position and would place at risk the operations of the programs and the welfare of Caroline Center\u2019s clients.\u201d Nevertheless, the Court ruled that \u201cthe Receiver may pay to [Allfirst] on a monthly basis principal in the amount of $10,000, plus interest at the prime rate plus zero,\u201d and authorized the Receiver to apply to the court to alter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>amount of monthly repayment to the Bank. Additionally, the court \u201cprohibited\u201d the \u201ccommencement or prosecution of any actions\u201d against Caroline Center or its assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On September 22, 1999, the Receiver filed two petitions for approval of administrative fees and expenses. The first petition covered June 1999 and sought fees and expenses for the Receiver totaling $54,279.91, as well as payment to its legal counsel in the amount of $16,621.21. The second petition, for the period of July and August 1999, sought fees and expenses for the Receiver in the amount of $82,215.65, and attorneys\u2019 fees for its legal counsel in the amount of $7,191.05. Pursuant to a status hearing on September 22,1999, the court approved the Receiver\u2019s first fee petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On October 4, 1999, Allfirst filed a 25-page objection to the Receiver\u2019s second petition for fees and expenses, plus exhibits to support the objection, although it did not quarrel with the payment of legal fees for the Receiver\u2019s attorneys. Allfirst complained about \u201cinefficiencies\u201d and \u201cduplication\u201d and asserted that it would be \u201cimpossible to determine whether such fees are reasonable in many respects due to the format of the Receiver\u2019s bills and because the fees and expenses attributable to intra-office conferences and to the Receiver\u2019s travel are demonstrably excessive.\u201d Moreover, Allfirst alleged that, since its inception, the receivership sustained losses of almost $48,000, despite collection by the Receiver of significant fees and payment to the Bank of only $30,000 on the Center\u2019s debt. In its brief, Allfirst asserts that, in the first six months of the receivership, the Receiver lost approximately $61,000, almost twice the amount of loss sustained by the Center in the twelve month period prior to the receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On November 10, 1999, the Receiver refiled its second petition for fees and expenses. A hearing was held on January 3, 2000, at which the court approved the Receiver\u2019s petition, and ordered payment to the Receiver of $82,215.65 for its fees and expenses, and payment of $7,191.95 for its counsel fees. It cautioned the Receiver about the costs, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>On March 7, 2000, the Receiver filed a \u201cMotion for Approval of Sale of Property,\u201d with respect to the Center\u2019s woodworking facility in Denton. The Contract of Sale, dated January 14, 2000, provided for a sale price of $145,000. On March 16, 2000, Allfirst responded to the motion by asking the court to order payment to the Bank of the net proceeds of sale, $69,947.77, asserting that it had a first-priority duly perfected security interest and lien in the Center\u2019s non-real estate assets under H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f)(1), and was entitled to payment. After a hearing, the court issued an order dated March 20, 2000, approving the sale but denying Allfirst\u2019s request for recovery of the net proceeds of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On June 1, 2000, the Department and the Receiver filed a joint petition seeking a one year extension of the receivership and a delay of the obligation to repay the Bank (\u201cExtension Petition\u201d). They asserted that the Center\u2019s \u201cfinancial condition continues to be one in which revenues over the course of the fiscal year are barely equal to expenditures,\u201d and explained that the Receiver was \u201cin the process of having the properties of Caroline Center appraised and making other preparations to apply for a loan that would retire the Allfirst debt ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On June 8, 2000, Allfirst filed an objection to the Extension Petition, along with a request for a hearing. It opposed the requested extension on the ground that it would further deplete the assets of the Center. Relying on H.G. \u00a7 19-337(f)(1), the Bank also maintained that such a lengthy extension would be unfair. Instead, it requested a four-month extension of the receivership, arguing that in that time All-first\u2019s loan could be refinanced. A hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, July 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">On Monday, July 24, 2000, one day before the hearing scheduled with regard to the Extension Petition, the Receiver filed \u201cReceiver\u2019s Request For Approval To Pay Off Allfirst Loan and for Release of Allfirst Liens\u201d (the \u201cPayment Petition\u201d). The Certificate of Service is dated July 21, 2000 and the Payment Petition apparently was received by the Bank on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that date. The Payment Petition included a request that the Center and Allf\u00edrst pay their own attorneys\u2019 fees. As to the attorneys\u2019 fees, the Receiver stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">Allf\u00edrst also claims that Caroline Center is responsible for Allfirst\u2019s attorneys [\u2019] fees and expenses in the amount of $46,951.43. The majority of Allfirst\u2019s fees and expenses were incurred after this Court entered its Order directing how the Receiver should make payments on Allfirst\u2019s debt. Allfirst\u2019s repeated and costly efforts to better its position were both distracting and wasteful. They had the effect of causing Caroline Center to incur great expense to defend against Allfirst\u2019s unreasonable demands and preserve the payment schedule adopted by this Court and the only payment schedule that would allow it to meet its payroll obligations through the end of its fiscal year. Under these circumstances, it would be equitable for the Receiver to request that Allf\u00edrst reimburse it for the cost of defending against these wasteful proceedings. Rather than incur the costs associated with such an undertaking, the Receiver instead requests that this Court order Allf\u00edrst to bear its own costs and fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Counsel for the Center, the Department, and the Bank were present at the hearing on July 25, 2000, scheduled solely with regard to the Extension Petition. During the course of the hearing, the Center\u2019s attorney referred to the Receiver\u2019s Payment Petition, in which the Receiver sought permission to satisfy the Center\u2019s debt to the Bank. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">[THE CENTER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: We have filed, as Your Honor probably knows, three additional items yesterday that will speed this along in wrapping this up.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">THE COURT: And pay him off?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">[THE CENTER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Pay him off.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">THE COURT: How soon would that be?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">[THE CENTER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: We can give him a check for principal and interest today.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>THE COURT: That\u2019s all he wants. He\u2019ll shut up and go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">[THE CENTER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: That would be our fervent hope, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Bank\u2019s attorney immediately asserted; however, that the Bank also sought to recover its attorneys\u2019 fees of approximately $55,000. The Bank\u2019s attorney stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyA\">Your Honor, there are fees that are owed to the [B]ank. My attorney\u2019s fees, which we\u2019re entitled to collect under the documents, which they\u2019re refusing to pay for. That is, that the subject of one of the motions that was filed on Friday, which we have not responded to yet. We just got the motion. That\u2019s an issue that is going to need to be determined by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Allfirst continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">We have loan documentation, Your Honor, that specifically says we\u2019re entitled to collect our costs, expenses and fees resulting from the referral of this matter to my law firm. That\u2019s a binding document that Caroline is obligated to abide by. The receiver has offered to pay us principal and interest, but is not willing to pay our attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuP\">The Center\u2019s attorney responded that the loan document \u201cassumes an element of reasonableness in terms of the fees,\u201d and complained that the Bank\u2019s work was \u201cnot productive.\u201d An extensive discussion ensued concerning the proceedings that had transpired in the prior year. The Center\u2019s lawyer argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">Allfirst, in effect, brought about this receivership way back a year ago. In the interim this Court, when the receiver was appointed to protect the Caroline Center from the further collection actions of the [B]ank, this Court then ordered that the [R]eceiver could pay to the [B]ank $10,000 a month plus interest. The [R]eceiver has done that and, in fact, has brought that loan down to approximately half of its original size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">All of these trips to this court, Your Honor, have not changed that, have not been productive, have cost the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>receivership money, and so in that sense they are unreasonable. I\u2019m not talking about anything [appellant\u2019s counsel] did or was it too much time or anything like that. That\u2019s between him and his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">What I\u2019m saying is that it was unnecessary, it was unproductive and, in fact, it was counter productive in terms of the cost and amounts of time spent in responding to this, and that\u2019s the basis for arguing that [appellant\u2019s counsel] and his firm are not entitled to be paid by the Caroline Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Allfirst countered with its reasons for participating in the proceedings in the way that it had over the course of the year. The Bank\u2019s counsel stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">[initially we met with the [R]eceiver, we met with the State in an attempt to work this out before the receivership was filed.... Receivership was then filed. There was no provision for any payments to us early on in the case. There were no discussions about paying us anything until the initial hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">Ultimately we had filed pleadings in order to obtain some sort of payment, and ultimately at that first hearing they agreed to pay us $10,000 plus interest. That took the efforts of my firm to get involved in order to precipitate some payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">There were some fee applications that were filed, Your Honor, that we had some problems. Once again they were using our collateral to pay fees, to pay the expenses of the receivership. We had problems with those. I think Your Honor cautioned them to keep track of what they were doing and to hold expenses down to the extent they could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">Today we\u2019re here, Your Honor, on this particular proceeding today because they moved to extend this receivership for a year. When they filed the paperwork there was no loan in place. They have obtained the loan in between. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here today, because we viewed this as we could be here for another year, Your Honor. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In summarizing the Bank\u2019s position, Allfirst\u2019s attorney said: \u201c[E]verything that we\u2019ve done in this case, we\u2019ve done it to protect our interests ...\u201d Allfirst also asked the court-for \u201cthe opportunity to brief this issue,\u201d explaining that the \u201cpleadings [i.e., the Payment Petition] were just filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The court reminded Allfirst that, at the inception of the receivership, it had assured the Bank that it would eventually obtain payment. Therefore, the court ruled that it would only require the Receiver to pay attorneys\u2019 fees to the Bank up to and including the first hearing, when the judge assured the Bank that it would, in time, recover the monies owed by the Center. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m going to do. Pay for the first hearing that I presided over in courtroom 203, when I made it very, very clear what the process was going to be, and I made it very clear to the [B]ank you\u2019re going to get your money. The only question is when. That was the first hearing we had in courtroom 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The following colloquy is also noteworthy:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: So you\u2019re saying the fees up to that hearing is what you are saying?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">[THE COURT]: Absolutely. I\u2019m going to pay off including that hearing, to include that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Further, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">Let me suggest something here. I think that a case could be made that the [C]enter was poorly managed to a point that someone whose funds were being used in running that had a right to get involved to preserve its assets. The mere fact that the receivership came into being suggests that things had gone awry.

We believe we protected our rights. We had to do this. The [B]ank does this when we have to work out situation like this. <em>We monitor the cases, we protect our rights and do what we </em>think\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>[THE COURT]: <em>And run up your fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>We don\u2019t run up our fees.

That was the question I asked you a moment ago.</p>\n<p id=\"A3L\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>I think what I told you was we wanted to get our l[oan] paid off as quickly as possible, and we believe our efforts led to that. </em>We believe that\u2019s brought the [R]eceiver to a point where it refinanced the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"ATx\">[THE COURT]: I think they\u2019re refinancing this loan for another reason but I can\u2019t speak for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The Bank\u2019s attorney again asked for an opportunity to brief the matter, noting that the Receiver\u2019s Payoff Petition had just been filed. The following ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: I obviously oppose the entry of the order regarding payments of only principal and interest in the [B]ank and not attorney's fees. I again request that the Court give us an opportunity to brief that issue. I\u2019d ask we do it, that the Court allows us to do it promptly, and to the extent a hearing is necessary, the Court schedule one or rule on the papers.

There\u2019s been no determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">[THE COURT]: They can go ahead and pay everything they\u2019re scheduled to pay even if I don\u2019t grant the attorney\u2019s fees.

You\u2019re going to do this pro bono?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: I will do the brief pro bono, yes, to show this Court that we\u2019re not trying to run up the fees. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>take issue with that comment and, you know, basically we are trying to protect the client\u2019s interests here.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">[THE COURT]: I don\u2019t think that anyone said you\u2019re trying to run up fees. I don\u2019t think anyone has said that. I didn\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t recall the receiver saying that. So who said that?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">[THE COURT]: <em>I said in the past I think that you have cost us fees unnecessarily by coming to hearings that accomplished absolutely nothing for the [BJank and did not help protect the [BJank\u2019s money because the [BJank\u2019s money was already protected. </em>It was not an\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: Would Your Honor agree at least the first hearing we needed to be there? There was no provision on the table for paying the [B]ank. There was no provision whatsoever to deal with the [B]ank at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"ArI\">[THE COURT]: All right. First hearing justified. Now what?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: The next hearing were the attorney\u2019s fees and \u2014 excuse me, the [Receiver\u2019s fees. There was an 80 some thousand dollar bill that was before the Court and we came to the Court and tried to limit the expense associated with this receivership because once again our assets, the loans \u2014 we have loans that were being utilized to pay these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">[THE COURT]: Sir, hold on now. This [C]enter was being backed up by the State, was it not?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">[THE COURT]: There was a loan from the [B]ank to the [C]enter, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">[THE COURT]: These people are standing in the shoes of the State. The State is guaranteeing the existence\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"A1B\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, you have to understand at the beginning of the case, at the beginning of this case we negotiated with the State, negotiated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>parties that be [sic] of the [C]enter and they turned on us at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">[THE COURT]: What do you mean by the expression they turned on you? Did they say we\u2019re not going to pay you your money?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor, they didn\u2019t say that.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">[THE COURT]: <em>All night. Since the State is backing all of this up the [B]ank knew that it was going to get its money. The only issue was when. </em>And in the interim, for the use of that money they\u2019re being paid interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: What about the [Blank\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">[THE COURT]: And am I saying anything inaccurate?</p>\n<p id=\"Agc\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>You\u2019re saying nothing inaccurate. You\u2019re absolutely 100 percent correct, </em>but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">[THE COURT]: What was accomplished by all of the fees generated by the [B]ank\u2019s appearance at the hearings? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019m starting with the first hearing. With the first hearing we had no idea what was going to happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">[The COURT]: I gave you the first hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... <em>So I came to the first hearing before Your Honor, where we asked for payments, if Your Honor remembers, and that did result in a payment being made to us.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\"><em>The second hearing was on the fee application. </em>I think it was in October when we came. I\u2019m trying to remember\u2014 there was a <em>third hearing that dealt with the real estate. We asked that the excess proceeds of the real estate not be used for the [C]enter, but be used to pay us down, and they\u2019ve been escrowed until now. And this is the fourth hearing we\u2019ve come to, </em>Your Honor. Now, the [R]eceiver\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AtJ\">[THE COURT]: <em>I don\u2019t think anybody at all questions the first hearing. </em>If I were the [B]ank I\u2019d want to be there to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>see what\u2019s going on, how is this thing set up, does it look like I\u2019m going to get my money, am I being guaranteed my money. And I think <em>this Court made it clear at that first hearing the [BJank\u2019s going to get its money. </em>But the priority is going to go with preserving the Caroline Center. Now, if I\u2019m incorrect in any of this\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>No, Your Honor\u2019s correct in everything </em>you said. Your Honor, I\u2019m not disagreeing with you on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">[THE COURT]: So I think what I am talking about is what followed that. That\u2019s what I think I\u2019m talking about, what followed that.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">[BANK\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I reiterate for the Court that <em>the hearings we\u2019re talking about are, one, a hearing on a very significant fee application, which Your Honor cautioned the [RJeceiver to watch his expenses. The second was on the sale of real estate, </em>where we went to the [R]eceiver and said pay the excess proceeds to us and he said no. He said he wanted to hold on to it to operate the business with, but he had to use it, and there was a fight over whether the State had a lien [o]n those proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\"><em>And then the final hearing is today, </em>Your Honor, where at the outset they were looking to extend the receivership for a year, and our concern, Your Honor, and I think it was <em>a justifiable concern, was that this receivership would be extended for a year, the financing </em>\u2014 which the process of trying to get the financing started back in November, that that process would continue for another year. We would continue to be paid at $10,000 plus interest. That was a concern we had.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Accordingly, the court approved the Receiver\u2019s Payment Petition as to Allf\u00edrst\u2019s loan, and ordered Allfirst to release all hens against the Caroline Center upon payment. But, the court denied, in part, appellant\u2019s request for legal fees. Rather than awarding the Bank the requested amount of $54,161.49 in counsel fees, the court ordered payment to appellant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>$25,702.85 in attorneys\u2019 fees, and disallowed the remaining $28,458.64 of its request. In its Order of July 26, 2000, the court said, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">B. That, in addition, Caroline Center, Inc. shall pay to Allfirst attorneys[\u2019] fees and costs in the amount of $25,702.85, for services and expenses in connection with the collection efforts of Allfirst Bank through the hearing held before this Court on June 28, 1999 and that <em>all other attorneys fees and costs are disallowed; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">C. That Allfirst Bank <em>shall release all liens </em>and security interests with respect to the indebtedness upon receipt of Caroline Center, Inc.\u2019s <em>payment in full of principal and interest due and attorneys[] fees </em>and costs as set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">(Emphasis added). In a separate order of the same date, the court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to counsel for the Receiver, totaling almost $49,000, for invoices dated between October 1999 and April 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Preliminarily, we address the Department\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the appeal. The Department has moved to dismiss, claiming that the Bank has not appealed from a final judgment, because the receivership has not been concluded, nor has the circuit court certified the matter for appeal. The Department also claims that appellant may still file a proof of claim under Md. Rule 13-401(c), and is therefore not aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the Department,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>[t]he circuit court\u2019s order had the effect of setting the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be paid to Allfirst\u2019s counsel pursuant to the payment to Allfirst of principal and interest. Although not stated by the court,- it was implicit under the Md. Rules that Allfirst could still file a proof of claim with respect to the balance of the demanded attorney\u2019s fees. Rule 13-401(c). The circuit court\u2019s order should not be interpreted to bar such a claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Further, the Department relies on <em>Hohensee v. Minear, </em>253 Md. 5, 251 A.2d 588 (1969). There, the circuit court entered an order permitting limited attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by a trustee who conducted a foreclosure sale. The trial court expressly noted that the allowance of the attorneys\u2019 fees was \u201c \u2018subject ... to any exceptions that might be noted with respect to the auditor\u2019s report.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 251 A.2d 588 (citation omitted). On appeal, the Court declined to address the issue because it was not a final and appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Ordinarily, \u201c \u2018a party may only appeal from a final judgment, that is, a judgment that settles the rights of the parties <em>or </em>concludes the cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of District Heights v.

It also required appellant to release \u201call liens and security interests\u201d against the Center upon the final payment of fees set forth in the Order. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the Order is an interlocutory one, that does not necessarily bar the appeal. C.J. \u00a7 12-303(3)(v) is relevant. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u00a7 12-303. Appeals from certain interlocutory orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">A party may appeal from any of the following interlocutory orders entered by a circuit court in a civil case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>(3) An order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">(v) For the sale, conveyance, or delivery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">of real or personal property or the payment of money----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In <em>Simmons v. Perkins, </em>302 Md. 232, 486 A.2d 1192 (1985), the Court explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he history of \u00a7 12-303 ... indicates a legislative intent to allow interlocutory appeals only from those orders for the \u201cpayment of money\u201d which had traditionally been rendered in equity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 486 A.2d 1192 (quoting <em>Anthony Plumbing of Md., Inc. v. Attorney General, </em>298 Md. 11, 20, 467 A.2d 504 (1983)). The appealability of interlocutory orders for the payment of money has been held to include an order directing an assignee for the benefit of creditors in an insolvency proceeding to pay certain monies to a corporate creditor in order to discharge certain debts. <em>See Genn v. CIT Corp., </em>40 Md.App. 516, 392 A.2d 1135 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The \u201cpayment of money\u201d cases that are appealable on an interlocutory basis have a \u201ccommon thread,\u201d in that \u201ceach involves an order for a specific sum of money which \u2018proceeds directly to the person\u2019 and for which that individual is \u2018directly and personally answerable <em>to the court </em>in the event of noncompliance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anthony Plumbing, </em>298 Md. at 20, 467 A.2d 504 (quoting <em>Della Ratta v.

In other words, the order has the \u201ccharacteristics of a traditional equity order for the payment of money,\u201d rather than the characteristics of \u201ca typical judgment at law for the payment of money.\u201d <em>Anthony Plumbing, </em>298 Md. at 20, 467 A.2d 504; <em>see Simmons, </em>302 Md. at 235, 486 A.2d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In our view, the Order in question here, issued in the underlying receivership case, falls within the purview of C.J. \u00a7 12-303(3)(v), because the circuit court ordered the Receiver to pay a portion of the Bank\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the debtor\u2019s loan obligation. Therefore, we shall deny the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Appellant argues that the court erred in failing to award the Bank all of its legal fees. It contends that, pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan documents, the Bank was entitled to recover the legal fees that it incurred in its effort to obtain payment from the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The Department explains that Allfirst\u2019s demands for immediate payment of the Center\u2019s indebtedness led to the Bank\u2019s seizure of secured assets, and arguably \u201cthreatened the well-being of the developmentally disabled citizens entrusted to [the Center\u2019s] care....\u201d As a result, H.G. \u00a7 19-333 to <em>et seq. </em>authorized the Secretary of the Department to seek the appointment of a receiver to protect the vulnerable persons residing in or served by the Center, a private care facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Relying on the terms of the statutory provisions and the legislative history of H.G. \u00a7 19-333 to <em>et seq., </em>appellees contend that, in light of the receivership, Allfirst is not entitled to an award of counsel fees pursuant to the terms of its contract with the Center. Instead, they assert that the court had discretion as to the fee award, which was properly exercised. As they point out, the same judge presided at all four hearings and fully understood what had transpired. Appellees claim that, by limiting the award of legal fees to the period up to and including the first of four hearings, the court was mindful of the Bank\u2019s statutory right under H.G. \u00a7 19-337 to recover its secured debt, as well as the court\u2019s assurances to appellant that it would eventually recover both principal and interest with regard to the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">At the outset, we note that appellees have not challenged the court's award of attorneys\u2019 fees, in the full amount requested by appellant, for the period up to and including the first of four hearings held by the trial court in the receivership, even though appellant did not present any evidence to support how those fees were generated or calculated. Therefore, we will not review the propriety of the attorneys\u2019 fees awarded for that period. Instead, we shall focus only on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>court\u2019s unwillingness to award legal fees for services rendered after the first hearing held in the receivership proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Title 19 of the Health-General Article concerns \u201cHealth Care Facilities.\u201d Subtitle 3 is captioned \u201cHospitals and Related Institutions.\u201d We are concerned with Part V, titled \u201cReceivership of Nursing Homes and Community Programs,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 19-333 to 19-339.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The receivership provisions were first enacted in 1980 as Senate Bill 579. At its inception, the purpose of the receivership provisions was to ensure the safety and well being of dependent individuals living in private nursing home facilities. The Legislative Comment to Senate Bill 579 states that \u201c[t]his legislation would allow the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to petition for a court-appointed receiver who could take over the management of a nursing home for a specified amount of time <em>without taking the very drastic step of forced closure and the attendant problems of patient transfer trauma.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The legislation was amended in 1988, by Senate Bill 101, to include residential facilities for the developmentally disabled, <em>see </em>Fiscal Note to Senate Bill 101, and, in 1989, to cover facilities for disabled people in community day programs funded by the Developmental Disabilities Administration. <em>See </em>Senate Bill 168 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The general powers and duties of a receiver are set forth in Md.Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-414 of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cC.A.\u201d). <em>See also </em>Maryland Rules 13-101 through 13-703 (governing receivership proceedings). Pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 19-337(a), a receiver in the case <em>subjudice </em>has the same general powers as a receiver under C.A. \u00a7 3-414. But, H.G. \u00a7 19-333 <em>et seq. </em>also includes specific provisions pertaining to a receivership for private care facilities such as the Center, in which the receiver has special responsibilities for the safety and welfare of individuals in care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Under H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f)(1), a receiver is specifically directed to pay principal and interest to a secured creditor in regard to a receivership initiated under H.G. \u00a7 19-333 <em>et seq., </em>unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>secured party is the owner of the facility or is affiliated with the owner. Of significance here, it omits any reference to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to a secured creditor, pursuant to a contract or otherwise. Section 19 \u2014 337(f)(1) states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">(f) <em>Contracts. </em>(1) The receiver <em>shall </em>pay the principal of and interest on a mortgage or secured transaction unless the holder of the mortgage or the secured party is the owner or an affiliate of the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In addition, the statute provides for funding of the receivership estate by the State, either with previously designated funds, if available, or by petition to the Department of Public Works. H.G. \u00a7 19-338. Under certain circumstances, \u201cState funds used to operate a receivership ... shall be a lien on the community program and its assets____\u201d H.G. \u00a7 19-338(c). The lien \u201c[h]as priority over any lien or other interest that attaches after\u201d the requisite filings. H.G. \u00a7 19-338(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Appellees have not identified any cases for us that provide that, despite the contractual agreement between the Center and the Bank obligating the Center to pay the Bank\u2019s legal fees in the event of the Center\u2019s default, the Bank is not entitled to recover its legal fees because of the receivership. We conclude that the absence of an express statutory authorization for the award of attorney\u2019s fees does not defeat the Bank\u2019s contractual right to recover an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The principles of statutory construction provide the initial framework for our resolution of the issue presented here. \u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory inteipretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren v.

Ins. Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 535-36, 212 A.2d 311 (1965); <em>Dep\u2019t. of Econ. and Employ. Dev. v.

Moreover, when analyzing a statute, \u201cwe seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994); <em>see also State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7-8, 629 A.2d 731 (1993) (courts must reach a statutory interpretation compatible -with common sense).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Additionally, \u201c[t]he consistent construction by [an] agency responsible for administering a statute is entitled to considerable weight.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Asphalt Pavement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>292 Md. 75, 80, 437 A.2d 651 (1981). That deference is premised on the notion that the agency has particular expertise in the area governed by the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>846 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997). What the Court said in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>305 Md. 145, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986), is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">The weight to be accorded an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute depends upon a number of considerations. Although never binding upon the courts, the contemporaneous interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to great deference, especially when the interpretation has been applied consistently and for a long period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">Another important consideration is the extent to which the agency engaged in a process of reasoned elaboration in formulating its interpretation of the statute. When an agency clearly demonstrates that it has focused its attention on the statutory provisions in question, thoroughly addressed the relevant issues, and reached its interpretation through a sound reasoning process, the agency\u2019s interpretation will be accorded the persuasiveness due a well-considered opinion of an expert body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">In addition, the nature of the process through which the agency arrived at its interpretation is a relevant consideration in assessing the weight to be accorded the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>If the interpretation is the product of neither contested adversarial proceedings nor formal rule promulgation, it is entitled to little weight.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 161-62, 501 A.2d 1307 (internal citations omitted)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">In this case, as best we can determine, the Department does not have any particular expertise with respect to the narrow issue regarding the availability of attorneys\u2019 fees. Nor was its interpretation of the statute the product of adversarial proceedings or rule promulgation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Appellant contends that the statute\u2019s silence as to attorneys\u2019 fees in regard to recovery of a secured debt is not dispositive. According to the Bank, \u201c[t]he filing of a receivership ... does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>not vitiate a creditor\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d Relying on the terms of the loan documents, appellant maintains that the Center is contractually obligated to pay \u201cattorney\u2019s fees, expenses of collection, and court costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Department asserts that \u201can argument could be made that the absence of an attorney\u2019s fee provision [in the statute] deprived the circuit court of any power to award such fees.\u201d Indeed, as a matter of equity, it seems to contend that the trial court could have denied any award of legal fees, because of the need to conserve the estate for the benefit of the Center\u2019s clients. In the Department\u2019s view, \u201cthe circuit court took the moderate approach of awarding [legal] fees for Allfirst\u2019s legal actions taken before it [i.e., the court] had cautioned Allfirst, an approach within the sound discretion of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">For its part, the Center asserts in its brief that \u201c[w]hile a valid agreement for the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees may be enforceable, the <em>amount </em>of attorneys\u2019 fees is nevertheless subject to review by the court.\u201d It maintains that the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees was a matter for the court in the exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Appellees rely on the legislative history of \u00a7 19-333 <em>et seq., </em>which they claim \u201cshows the General Assembly\u2019s intent to protect dependent individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Department observes that, at the legislative session in 1979, Senate Bill 152 was introduced and, had it passed, it would have created a statute similar to the present version of H.G. \u00a7 19-333 <em>et seq., </em>but without the requirement for payment of secured creditors, now set forth in H.G. \u00a7 19-337. <em>See </em>Legislative Comment, Senate Bill 579. When the legislation was enacted in 1980, however, it contained a provision for payment of secured creditors. <em>See </em>1980 Md. Laws, ch. 272, adding Md.Code Ann., Art. 43, \u00a7 560 B(D)(7)(IV)(1); Legislative Comment, Senate Bill 579, Comment 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Appellees attach great weight to the fact that H.G. \u00a7 19-337 is silent as to the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees, while expressly directing a receiver to pay principal and interest to secured creditors. In their view, if the Legislature had intended to authorize payment of attorney\u2019s fees to a secured creditor, pursuant to a contract, \u201cit would have said so.\u201d Moreover, because the legislation assures payment to secured creditors, appellees maintain that this obviates the need for a secured creditor, such as Allfirst, to incur attorneys\u2019 fees to recover its debt. Thus, they maintain that H.G. \u00a7 19-337(f) \u201cunderscores the inappropriateness of Allfirst\u2019s legal efforts after the first hearing____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">As the Department stated in its motion to dismiss, H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f)(1) \u201crequires no proof of claim.\u201d But, the statute does not say how payment to a secured creditor is to be made or when it is to be made. Relying on H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f)(5), the Department asserts that a court has discretion to require installment payments of principal and interest with regard to a secured debt, which the court did in this instance. The Department does not explain why H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f)(5), which concerns rent, conferred discretion on the trial judge to permit payment of a secured debt by monthly installment. Indeed, if the court had required prompt compliance with H.G. \u00a7 19-337(f)(1), the Bank would not have had to incur legal fees to recover payment from the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Appellant refers us to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(b), the federal counterpart to H.G. \u00a7 19-337(f)(l), which expressly permits the recovery of legal fees by a secured creditor. Section 506 of the federal bankruptcy code states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u00a7 506. Determination of secured status</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">(b) To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, after any recovery under subsection(c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any <em>reasonable </em>fees, costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>or charges provided under the agreement under which such claim arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506 (emphasis added). Appellees counter that the express inclusion of \u201creasonable fees, costs, or charges\u201d in the federal law makes clear that the Maryland Legislature understood that it could have chosen to include a provision allowing for attorneys\u2019 fees in H.G. \u00a7 19-337(f)(l), and purposefully determined not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">To support its position that the Legislature intentionally omitted any authorization for attorneys\u2019 fees, the Department points to the inclusion of such provisions in other statutes. The absence of express language permitting recovery of legal fees does not necessarily bar such recovery, however. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel Congregation, </em>352 Md. 31, 44, 720 A.2d 912 (1998) (construing statutory authorization for recovery of \u201cdisbursements\u201d in Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act to encompass attorneys\u2019 fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In analyzing the text of \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f)(1), we are mindful that, under the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d the prevailing party is not permitted to recover litigation expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, as part of compensatory damages. <em>Hess Constr.

Mortgage Investors, a multimillion dollar real estate investment trust that made loans nationally to the real estate industry, had negotiated lines of credit with various banks, including the Citizens Bank and Trust Company of Maryland. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In 1974, Mortgage Investors borrowed a total of $1,000,000 from Citizens, pursuant to two promissory notes, each of which contained a provision for the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of a default by the borrower, stating: \u201c \u2018If upon our default, suit is instituted, we agree to pay all court costs and an attorney\u2019s fee of 15% of the outstanding balance at the time of the suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). When Mortgage Investors defaulted, Citizens instituted suit. A judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees was entered against Mortgage Investors, in the amount of $150,640.26, representing 15% of the balance due on the loans. But, pursuant to a contingent fee agreement with its lawyers, Citizens was actually obligated to its counsel for legal fees of $105,570.58. The question, then, was whether Mortgage Investors was required to pay Citizens $150,640.26, representing the stipulated amount, or, instead the actual amount of Citizens\u2019s legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On appeal, Mortgage Investors argued that a court \u201cshould not be insulated from determining the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s collection fee by the fact that the amount of the fee or the percentage which the fee is to be determined is stipulated....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 366 A.2d 47. The Court upheld the right to a stipulated fee award, stating that \u201cthe collection fee stipulated in the note is collectible if a valid judgment is entered, and is not subject to reversal on judicial review in the factual situation before us unless a term such as \u2018reasonable fee\u2019 is substituted for a fixed sum or a percentage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>amount recovered, or <em>unless the rights of other creditors of the debtor not paHies to the fee arrangement are involved.\u201d Id. </em>at 509-10, 366 A.2d 47 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). Because \u201cthe agreement [was] one of indemnity,\u201d however, Citizens was not entitled to collect from Mortgage Investors \u201can amount greater than the $105,758.58 which it was required to pay under its agreement with its attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510, 366 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Although the Court acknowledged that the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees could be described as \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the amount of work involved,\u201d it also recognized that Mortgage Investors was an \u201cinformed and sophisticated borrower. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the Court suggested that if parties with \u201cdissimilar knowledge or background\u201d contracted with one another, or there was \u201cclear evidence of overreaching,\u201d a fee arrangement could be disturbed. <em>Id. </em>It also stated that \u201ca fee might be denied in a case where the contemplated services were not rendered or where the amount stipulated was not paid to the creditor\u2019s counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We applied the reasoning of <em>Mortgage Investors </em>in <em>Noyes Air Conditioning Contractors, Inc., supra, </em>122 Md.App. 283, 712 A.2d 126. There, the agents of an apartment complex entered into a contract for the replacement of two air conditioning units. The terms of the contract expressly stated: \u201c \u2018Customer agrees to pay all <em>reasonable </em>collection fees, attorney\u2019s fees and court costs if such services are required and judgment is made against a customer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288-89, 712 A.2d 126 (citation omitted)(emphasis added). After a disagreement over payment under the contract, the contractor instituted suit against the apartment complex to recover the balance due. At trial, the court awarded damages, but refused to award prejudgment interest, attorney\u2019s fees, or court costs, despite the express provisions in the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 712 A.2d 126. On appeal, we considered the decision in <em>Mortgage Investors </em>and concluded that, \u201cabsent some identifiable misconduct such as fraud, overreaching, misrepresentation, or void as to other contractors,\u201d the trial court had discretion to decide the <em>amount </em>of the attorneys\u2019 fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>costs, but lacked the discretion to deny the claim completely. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 712 A.2d 126. Therefore, we remanded for a determination of the reasonable amount of fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As we see it, appellees\u2019 construction of H.G. \u00a7 19 \u2014 337(f) would effectively subvert the long standing legal principle permitting parties to contract with regard to legal fees, without any express statutory directive to that effect from the General Assembly. Appellees rely on the absence of any language in the statute authorizing the award of legal fees. We rely, instead, on the absence of a prohibition. In the context of these receiverships, if the Legislature wanted to bar the contractual recovery of legal fees by a secured creditor, it would have said so. The omission of such a prohibition indicates that the Legislature did not intend to relieve the debtor of an agreement to pay legal fees. Therefore, to the extent that appellant sought to recover its legal fees in accordance with its contract, it was not necessarily barred from such recovery on the ground that the Center was in receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In the absence of a clear statutory directive, or legislative history that establishes the Legislature\u2019s intent to supersede the parties\u2019 contractual agreement regarding legal fees, we apply the fundamental principle of statutory construction that disfavors judicial embellishment of a statute. <em>See In re Charles K, </em>135 Md.App. 84, 97-98, 761 A.2d 978 (2000) (stating that the Court is prohibited from \u201cembellishing a provision so as to enlarge its meaning\u201d); <em>Rouse-Fairwood Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>120 Md.App. 667, 688, 708 A.2d 19 (1998)(stating that the Court may not \u201cembellish a statute to expand its meaning\u201d); <em>Abington Ctr. Assoc. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Baltimore County, </em>115 Md.App. 580, 603, 694 A.2d 165 (1997) (stating that the Court is prohibited from \u201creading] into a statute a meaning that is not expressly stated or clearly implied\u201d; it may not \u201cembellish a statutory provision so as to enlarge its meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">This leads us to consider the amount of the fee award. The Note does not provide for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees or pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ment of attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount equal to an arbitrary percentage of the outstanding debt. Rather, it obligates the Borrower to pay \u201cthe holder\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d In contrast, although not discussed by the parties, we observe that the Security Agreement provides for attorneys\u2019 fees equal to 15% of the unpaid balance. It appears, however, that Allfirst sought to recover the actual amount of the fees that it incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Generally, when attorneys\u2019 fees are based on a \u201ccontractual right, the losing party is \u2018entitled to have the amount of fees and expenses proven with certainty and under the standards ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Dev. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>100 Md.App. at 453, 641 A.2d 977 (quoting <em>Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. v. Electro Enter., Inc., </em>287 Md. 641, 661, 415 A.2d 278 (1980)(emphasis added)); <em>see B &amp; P Enter. v. Overland Equip. Co., supra, </em>133 Md.App. at 624, 758 A.2d 1026. A \u201ctrial court\u2019s evaluation of a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees must be based on a record that includes information that sufficiently and competently supports the court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 458, 641 A.2d 977. Generally, a trial court enjoys discretion in regard to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees when an agreement obligates the losing party to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the prevailing party. <em>See Rauch v. McCall, </em>134 Md.App. 624, 636, 761 A.2d 76 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 Md. 625, 766 A.2d 148 (2001); <em>Holzman v.

As the Court recognized in <em>Mortgage Investors, supra, </em>278 Md. 505, 366 A.2d 47, even a fixed percentage for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees may give way in those situations involving \u201cthe rights of other creditors of the debtor not parties to the fee arrangement are involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510, 366 A.2d 47. This case presumably involves other creditors. But even more significant, an essential purpose of the receivership under H.G. 19-333 <em>et seq. </em>is to provide stability to a private care facility, like the Center, in order to protect the interests of the disabled individuals in its care. Because the lives of many disabled persons might be severely disrupted if the Center were to collapse, the receivership proceeding was instituted. A receiver has the power to perform all acts necessary to \u201c[c]orrect each condition on which the appointment of the receiver was based\u201d; \u201c[e]nsure adequate care for each individual in the nursing home or community program\u201d; and \u201c[p]reserve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>property of the owner of the nursing home or community program.\u201d H.G. \u00a7 19-337(a)(2). A secured creditor\u2019s right to be made whole must be balanced against this important issue of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><em>Rauch, </em>a domestic case, is also instructive. There, the parties\u2019 fee agreement did not provide for the award of legal fees equal to a fixed percentage, nor did it contain a limitation that the fees must be reasonable. In reviewing the legal fees, the Court noted that no appellate decision in Maryland addressed the question of whether a contractual duty to pay attorney\u2019s fees, without mention of the term \u201creasonableness,\u201d nonetheless implicitly required an analysis of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 761 A.2d 76. We were \u201cpersuaded that the trial judge must enforce the contractual standard set forth in the [parties\u2019] Agreement, but <em>from a reasonableness standpoint.\u201d Rauch, </em>134 Md.App. at 636, 761 A.2d 76 (emphasis added). <em>See also Brown &amp; Sturm v. Frederick Road Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>137 Md.App. 150, 181, 768 A.2d 62 (2001) (stating that, with respect to a contingent fee agreement, \u201c \u2018the fact that the client agreed to the [amount of the fee] does not relieve the attorney from the burden of showing that the amount agreed upon was fair and reasonable\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted) (alteration in original); <em>B &amp; P Enter., </em>133 Md.App. at 625, 758 A.2d 1026 (stating that after a claimant presents evidence to support an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, \u201cthe trial court must evaluate the reasonableness of the fees\u201d); <em>Maxima Corp., </em>100 Md.App. at 454, 641 A.2d 977 (stating that after the party seeking recovery presents the court with facts to support the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees, \u201cthe trial court must still evaluate the reasonableness of the fees\u201d; the party seeking recovery bears the burden \u201cto provide the evidence necessary for the fact finder to evaluate the reasonableness of the [attorneys\u2019] fees\u201d); <em>Walker v. Haywood, </em>65 Md.App. 1, 14, 498 A.2d 1198 (1985)(stating that the court will generally enforce a trust instrument that includes payment of attorney\u2019s fees in a specific amount or in percentage terms, unless \u201cthe amount designated is grossly in excess of any reasonable amount\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>See also </em>Rule 1.5(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (providing that \u201cA lawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">What the Court of Appeals said in <em>Plakatoris v. Bainder, </em>204 Md. 223, 229, 103 A.2d 839 (1954), in the context of a receiver\u2019s fee award, is also noteworthy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\"><em>One of the most delicate duties a court is called upon to perform is that of fixing the fees of the attorneys in cases in which they are entitled to be paid out of a fund or estate under the jurisdiction of the court. </em>There is no standard formula or specific guide for fixing the amount of the counsel fee to be allowed the attorney for a receiver. While the amount of the allowance for fees in a receivership lies in the sound discretion of the court in which the receivership proceedings occur, <em>the allowance should be reasonable according to the circumstances of the case. </em>The considerations which should control in fixing the counsel fee are the value of the property in controversy; the legal difficulties encountered; time, labor, and skill required and experience in the <em>proper performance of the duties imposed; </em>the fair value of the services measured by common business standards; the particular benefit derived from the receiver\u2019s attention and efforts in the interest of the estate; and the degree of integrity and dispatch with which the work of the receivership is conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">(Emphasis added); <em>see also County Corp. of Md. v. Semmes, </em>169 Md. 501, 527, 182 A. 273 (1936); <em>Great Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Empire Fire Ins. Co., </em>165 Md. 510, 517, 170 A. 165 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Based on the foregoing, we are of the view that the court did not err to the extent that it determined that appellant was entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, rather than <em>all </em>of its attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to its contract with the Center. On the other hand, we conclude that the court abused its discretion to the extent that it determined that appellant was not entitled to any legal fees after the first court hearing in the receivership proceeding, because the services were unnecessary and counterproductive in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the court\u2019s assurance that appellant would recover both principal and interest as to the Center\u2019s debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The Department observes that H.G. \u00a7 19-338(a) authorizes State funding for receiverships of the kind involved here, which \u201creflects the special role of the Department in encouraging enough private providers to continue to exist to serve the needs of the disabled....\u201d Nevertheless, the Department concedes that H.G. \u00a7 19-338(a) \u201cdid not guarantee that the Caroline Center would be able to pay off Allfirst notwithstanding the receivership....\u201d At best, the Department maintains that the statute \u201clent credence\u201d to the court\u2019s \u201cassurances to Allfirst at the first hearing that the [B]ank would be made whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The Department\u2019s concession leads us to conclude that we cannot quarrel with the Bank\u2019s persistent attempt to expedite and assure the collection of its debt. Moreover, at least some of the work of the Bank\u2019s attorney was directed to the receiver\u2019s fee petitions. Considering that the Receiver submitted several fee petitions for itself, while the Center was allegedly losing money and appellant\u2019s debt was still outstanding, it was not necessarily unreasonable for the Bank to contest the Receiver\u2019s fee petition. Nor was it necessarily unreasonable for the Bank to oppose the Receiver\u2019s Extension Petition, which might have further delayed payment of the Bank\u2019s debt, allegedly \u201csecured by fleeting assets of an unprofitable enterprise.\u201d Similarly, had the Bank opted not to attend the hearing on July 25, 2001, scheduled with regard to the Extension Petition, the Receiver might have prevailed in its request in the Payment Petition to avoid payment of any legal fees to Allfirst.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In short, it was not unreasonable for the Bank to keep abreast of developments, attempt to expedite recovery of the money it was owed, or maintain a watchful eye on the Receiver\u2019s conduct, given its status as a secured creditor with a statutory entitlement to payment of its debt, when the statutory provision had not yet been met. Indeed, the Bank\u2019s efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>culminated in a decision by the Receiver to satisfy the Bank while also seeking to extend the receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Although the Bank was not obligated to sit back and do nothing, as the court seemed to think, given its \u201cassurance\u201d that the Bank would eventually collect its debt, we agree with appellees that the court was not required to accept \u201cuncritically\u201d Allf\u00edrst\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. If that were the case, an unscrupulous attorney might file unnecessary motions, objections, or requests for hearings merely to better his or her own position, or the debtor might be forced to bear expenses generated because the attorney was unfamiliar with the area of law. Therefore, the court must be satisfied of the reasonableness of the fee request, in light of the nature of the receivership proceeding, the legal issues, and the extent to which other creditors have an interest in the debtor\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Accordingly, we shall vacate the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the court may take into account the amount of its prior fee award. Our opinion should not be construed to suggest that we believe the court is required to accept as reasonable the full amount of fees incurred by Allfirst.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In view of our resolution of the case, we need not consider the Bank\u2019s due process contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY VACATED.
