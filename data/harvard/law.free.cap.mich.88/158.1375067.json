Respondent Crockard returns that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201c On the 7th day of May, A. D. 1890, the proceedings of the jury to determine as to a private road hereto-annexed, marked \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 was all that was filed in my office relating to said private road of Herman Holstinski, until the 16th day of June, A. D. 1890, when the application for said private road which is hereto annexed, marked \u2018Exhibit <em>B,\u2019 </em>was filed in my office by Nicholas Pettit, highway commissioner, which Exhibits A and B are true copies of all the records and files on file in my office at this date pertaining to said private road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Exhibit A, referred to in said return, is signed by the-jury, and is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201c We, the undersigned, a jury selected to determine as to the necessity of laying out a private road as hereinafter described, and to assess the damages therefor, having been duly cited to appear pursuant to a citation issued by Nicholas Pettit, commissioner of highways of said township, met at the residence of Herman Holstinski, in said township, on the day of the date hereof, and, having been duly sworn by said commissioner) as required by law, and having viewed the premises, do hereby certify that we have determined that it is necessary that a private road should be laid out, running as follows: Commencing at the quarter stake on the.west side of section thirty-two, and running east to the south-east quarter of the north-west quarter of said section thirty-two, to be one rod wide, and to be on the north side of the quarter line running east and west through section thirty-two, being over the lands owned and occupied by James H. Hall; and that we appraise the damages to said James H. Hall by reason of the laying out of said road over his land at the sum of ten dollars. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201cGiven under our hands, this 7th day of May, A. D. 1890.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The following is a copy of Exhibit B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201c.To the commissioner of highways of the township of Dwight, county of Huron: The undersigned, a freeholder of the said township of Dwight, does hereby make application to you to lay out a private road in part of said township not included within the corporate limits of any city or village, and respectfully ask that you .will proceed to lay a private road as follows: Commencing at the quarter stake on the west side of section thirty-two, and running east to the south-east quarter of the north-west quarter of section thirty-two, said road to be one rod wide, and to be on the north side of the quarter line running east and west through section thirty-two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201cHerman Holstinski.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201c Dated the 23d day of April, 1890.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201c Eeceived for record and recorded this 16th day of June, A. D. 1890.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The record is clearly insufficient to sustain the proceeding. The petition for the road contains no averment that the petitioner has no other access to his lands, and the record contains no 'evidence that a showing of that character was made. No proof of service of notice appears therein. The statute provides for notice in writing to the owner or occupant. The service under the statute must be personal, unless the land is non-resident, and the owner does not reside in the county. Here the owner resided in the county, but was absent from the State. The land was occupied, and no notice was served upon the occupant. The record contains no recital that IS disinterested freeholders were selected, or that 6 names were struck off, or that a citation was issued by the commissioner to such freeholders, or that the jurors were sworn by the commissioner, or that the commissioner proceeded to lay out the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The statute requires that the commissioner shall cause a record to be made in the clerk's office, which shall be signed by the commissioner, and recorded by the township clerk. Nothing having the semblance of a.record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>appears in the clerk\u2019s office. The record must show a compliance with the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The proceedings must be quashed, with costs against respondent Nicholas Pettit.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
