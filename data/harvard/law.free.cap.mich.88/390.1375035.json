The measure of damages for the breach of a contract by which the plaintiff was made sole agent in certain territory for the sale of mineral water of which the defendant was the sole proprietor, and which it agreed to furnish to the plaintiff at an agreed price, is the profits which the plaintiff might have realized on sales if the defendant had performed the contract; citing <em>Loud v.

There never was any contract binding upon either party, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-14\">a \u2014 There was no mutuality.

No proof was offered of any advertising; hence the only allegation to be considered is the one regarding the profits on the sale of the water, and these were wholly speculative; citing <em>Fitzsimmons v.

In October, 1887, defendant wrote to plaintiffs intestate the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cWaukesha, Wis., Oct. 3, 1887.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8y\">\u201cMr. J. C.

Of course we will not credit your account with the $40 for\u2019 advertising until the sales shall have reached the necessary $500. We believe, if you spend $40 in judicious advertising, that you will have no trouble in bringing up your sales to $500 a year, and thereby make the Bethesda business a profitable one for you as well as for ourselves. If you accept this offer, please advise us by return mail, and this letter will be our agreement with you, as soon as we receive your acceptance of it.

There is no treachery about it. We were not doing the business in Detroit that we should do, and could not induce you to push the water, or handle our water in one-half gallons, so we thought it for our interest to make a change; and you, as a business man, know that it is for the interest of every concern to do all the business they can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cYery truly, B.

That the contract, as modified by defendant\u2019s letter of October 12, 1887, was never accepted by Mueller. This objection is untenable. Mueller entered upon the agency at once, and acted in that capacity until May, 1888, when defendant appointed another sole agent in Mueller\u2019s stead, giving as a reason therefor that Mueller was not pushing the sale of the mineral water.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">2. That the contract was void for want of mutuality. Neither is this objection well taken. The company appointed Mueller as its sole agent for Detroit and vicinity, agreeing that, if he would take the agency, it would sell him the water at a certain figure, allow him $40 on his advertising bill in case his purchases reached a named amount, and that it would ship no plain water to any other person within certain territory. Mueller had been handling these goods, and the appointment was made in response to a proposition on Mueller\u2019s part, referred to in defendant\u2019s letter of October 3, 1887, to act as agent of the company. He agreed to act as sole agent of the company for the sale of these goods at Detroit. By the acceptance of that agency he agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>do all that its acceptance implied, viz., to hold out the goods to the public, and to further the interests of his principal. One who receives goods on commission does not usually expressly agree to do anything, but there is in this class of cases an implied agreement, sufficient to support the promise and contract. If the interest of defendant here had been neglected, defendant was entitled to show that upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Plaintiff called as a witness, Arthur Bassett, one of the members of the firm to which defendant had transferred the agency, and sought to show by him how much of the water had been disposed of by that firm from May 9, 1888, to October 12, 1888, but the court excluded the testimony. This was error. It was shown that, while this water was sold in bulk by the gallon, yet it was sold largely by the glass from a fountain as an incident of the retail drug business; that the best season for its sale was just opening when the agency was taken away from plaintiff's intestate. The measure of plaintiff's damages was the profits which Mueller might have realized if defendant had performed its contract. <em>Loud v. Campbell, </em>26 Mich. 239; <em>Leonard v. Beaudry, </em>68 Id 312. While it may be true that Mueller would not have disposed of as much of the article as this firm did, yet the amount of their sales, while not conclusive upon defendant, was competent evidence to go to the jury upon the question of plaintiff's damages. It would have been proper to draw out upon cross-examination what special effort had been made by this firm to introduce and push this commodity, but the sales for the season named may have been greater than for the previous season because of a demand created by what Mueller did, rather than by any special effort by this firm. Here was a commodity of which defendant was the sole proprietor, and for which Mueller was made sole agent. All of this commodity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>reaching the territory named came from defendant directly to Mueller, and through his agency. The agency of the firm of Bassett &amp; L\u2019Hommedieu succeeded that of Mueller. They took it up where he left off, and continued it for the five months for which he was to enjoy its fruits. Proof as to the amount actually sold by them for that five months cannot be said to be speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">After the court excluded this testimony plaintiff rested, and on defendant\u2019s motion the court directed a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
