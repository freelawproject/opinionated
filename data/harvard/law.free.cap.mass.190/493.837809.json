W. Killorin.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">The roller was delivered in the early part of April, 1904. On June 25 of the same year the defendant wrote that he \u201c bought this roller to be a 52\" wide the width of wheels so I might roll stone between tracks of regular gauge. Mr. Hines told me that it is only 52\" wide but according to my measure it is 54\" wide which makes it 2\" too wide to do the work which I bought it to do,\u201d and he finally refused to pay for it on the ground that it was fifty-four inches wide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">At the trial the defendant offered to prove the following facts: 44 Mr. Moran. \u2014 The agent came there, and there was talk between them. My client said,4 My particular work is building street railways. I have got a roller for doing road work, and I don\u2019t need another one; but, from the picture you show me there, that roller looks as though it would be a good roller to roll between rails of tracks, and of course if it can do that work I will purchase it. I have one roller that will do road work now as I have been doing it, take a three-wheel roller, and one of the wheels will ride the track, and the other runs between. Now, if you say it can do that work, I will buy that roller.\u2019 4 Now, how wide had that roller ought to be \u2019 \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court. \u2014 Who said that, 4 How wide ought it to be ? \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">44 Mr. Moran. \u2014 Mr. Hines said, 4 How wide ought it to be ? \u2019 Mr. Killorin said it should be not more than fifty-two inches; 4 the tracks are fifty-six inches, and in our tracks there are a great many guard rails; those guard rails are between two and three inches wide, and in going around curves there would have to be an inch or so to spare, so that in order that that roller could be used by me it should not be more than fifty-two inches; so if you say that you can furnish that kind of a roller for me, I will take it.\u2019 He says,4 That is just the kind of roller that we have; we will furnish such a roller for you; we will produce it for you ; we will have that roller for you built so you can use it in track building if you purchase of us.\u2019 Some time later he made a statement in the presence of the defendant, in talking about this roller \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201c The Court. \u2014Afterwards ? .What does that mean, after the written instrument was made?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-3\">\u201cMr. Moran. \u2014 After the contract was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">\u201c The Court. \u2014 Anything said then wouldn\u2019t be competent anyway, unless it was an admission of what he said before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">\u201c Mr. Moran. \u2014 The question came up of how the roller was liked; I think he was exhibiting it at the time, and he said, \u00a3 Mr. Killorin has got a good roller; he has got the only roller that can roll between the two rails of tracks. I sold him the roller for that particular purpose. That is the only roller manufactured that can do that.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">\u201c That is all the evidence as stated. If your Honor rules that out, there is nothing further for the jury to decide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">\u201c The Court. \u2014 The only suggestion I have to make about that is this: That can\u2019t be considered as in the nature of what would be called a false and fraudulent statement. That is, admitting all you say is true, that is only a promissory statement, a statement of what it will do. He says, <em>\u2018 </em>What do you want, Mr. Killorin ? \u2019 Mr. Killorin says,\u00a3 I want a roller fifty-two inches wide,\u2019 or a certain width. Mr. Hines says, <em>\u2018 </em>Well, that is the kind we make; we have got it; we will furnish it.\u2019 Now that is not what would be called a false and fraudulent statement. If your client wished some specific kind of roller, he should have it inserted in the contract. I can\u2019t allow parol evidence to go in to modify a written contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-8\">\u201c Mr. Moran. \u2014 He pointed to a photograph that he had of a roller which they made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-9\">\u201cMr. Poland. \u2014 Not of this weight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-10\">\u201c Mr. Moran. \u2014 They had no roller in existence, a ten-ton roller fifty-two inches wide, and he knew it. He showed him this photograph and told him it would be a ten-ton roller like that; that they were all fifty-two inches wide.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-11\">Upon this the presiding judge made this ruling: \u00a3&lt; Assuming that to be true, that he had promised to furnish it, that is promissory in its nature. It seems to me that would be opening the contract to allow the evidence to go in; it would be inserting something into that contract that wasn\u2019t agreed upon by the parties. More than that, it seems to me that the duty was imposed upon Mr. Killorin when the machine arrived to examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>it and find out what its condition was and whether it did fulfil the terms of the contract. If he did not see fit as to that, and kept it two or three months the vendors ought not to be harmed; he had no right to keep it in his possession two or three months without saying something, if any such agreement was made. I am only assuming the most favorable view of the defendant\u2019s case. I think under those circumstances I shall have to exclude that testimony.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-3\">To this ruling the defendant took an exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-4\"><em>A.
