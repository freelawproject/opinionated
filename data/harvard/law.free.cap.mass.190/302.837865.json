The defendant demurred to the first and third counts. Its demurrer was overruled in the Superior Court by <em>Mason, </em>C. J. The defendant also filed a plea in bar to all the counts alleging that the plaintiff had brought a previous action against the defendant for the same cause of action in which judgment was entered for the defendant as appeared by the records of the Superior Court and the Supreme Judicial Court. The case was heard by <em>Sherman, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-3\">It appeared by the records that the former action was brought on May 23,1899, and was tried before <em>Maynard, </em>J., who ordered a verdict for the defendant. Exceptions alleged by the plaintiff were overruled by this court in a decision reported in 180 Mass. 145. The decision was on the ground that the plaintiff was not exercising the care of a prudent adult, and that there was no evidence of due care on the part of her parents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\">In the new action the declaration alleged wilful negligence on the part of the defendant and wanton and reckless conduct on the part of its servants and agents which would make the defendant liable although the negligence of the plaintiff and of her parents might have contributed to her injuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">The judge sustained the plea in bar and gave judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-6\"><em>W.
