Crowley by said board as aforesaid.) \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">The publication alleged in the second count was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">\u201c \u2018 Frank B. Dow, (meaning the plaintiff) could not select in the entire city a person who is better adapted for the purpose of robbing the taxpayers than \u201cBob\u201d Crowley. (Meaning said Robert E. Crowley.) From Dow\u2019s standpoint (meaning the plaintiff\u2019s standpoint) he will make an ideal superintendent of streets.\u2019 (Meaning that the plaintiff had used his influence to secure the election of a man who would rob the taxpayers as superintendent of streets, and that the plaintiff is a man lacking in integrity and honesty.) \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">The publication alleged in the third count began with the heading: \u201c Send Crowley to City Farm,\u201d and contained, with other matter, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">\u201cIf the concurrence of the common council in the election of Robert E. Crowley as superintendent of streets can be bullied or bought by the police-rum combine, it will be accomplished.

Armed with the power which goes with the office of superintendent of streets his ability to raid the treasury would be correspondingly increased and he would be a greater menace than ever to the public purse. If Crowley must be provided for at the public expense, it would be cheaper to send him to the city farm at once.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">\u201cThe election of Crowley, as pointed out by the Telegram months ago, means the placing of additional power in the hands of the police-rum combine, at the head of which stands Frank B. Dow.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\">The defendant demurred to the declaration and set forth as causes of demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-12\">\u201c First: For that there is not set forth in said declaration or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>in either count thereof that which is by its natural import libellous or that furnishes legal ground for an action for libel or is actionable on any ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">\u201c Second: For that the matter set out with the accompanying averments and innuendoes in either count thereof is not libellous as to the plaintiff nor does it appear that the matter set out relates to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">\u201c Third: For that in Counts 1 and 8 of said declaration the alleged libellous matter that appears in the copies annexed thereto does not relate to the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and gave judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-8\"><em>N. D. </em>Pratt, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-9\"><em>J. J. </em>Pickman, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-10\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axv\">The defendant argues that the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration fails to state any cause of action because the alleged defamatory matter is not libellous, and because it is not averred that the alleged libels were published \u201c concerning the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The first count is somewhat inartificially drawn; but in our opinion it sufficiently appears that the first articles averred therein to have been published are set out merely by way of inducement, and that the libel relied upon is contained in the short article appearing at the end of this count. With reference to the last cause of demurrer relied upon, the declaration expressly avers that this alleged libel is published \u201cof and concerning the plaintiff \u201d and his conduct in his office; and this is a sufficient averment that the publication was made of and concerning the plaintiff. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>144 Mass. 38. <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Fall River Daily Herald Publishing Co. </em>138 Mass. 334. <em>Chenery </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>98 Mass. 224. \u201c When the words are alleged to be spoken of the plaintiff, no innuendoes are necessary to apply them.\u201d Devens, J. in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Cook, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">A more important question is whether the alleged publication is libellous when taken in connection with the previous averments of this count. These averments are in substance that the plaintiff was a member and chairman of the board of police of the city of Lowell; that one Robert E. Crowley was a' candidate for the office of superintendent of streets of said city; that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>superintendent was chosen by the concurrent vote of the board of aldermen and the common council; that said Crowley had been elected to said office on the part of the board of aldermen, and the question of his election was pending in the common council; that the defendant then published the article stated in the count and headed: \u201c Send Crowley to City Farm,\u201d and the shorter articles which immediately follow it. The count then avers that the defendant published the alleged libel \u201cof and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning his aforesaid office, and of and concerning his conduct in his said office, for the purpose of procuring his removal from said office, and with reference to the candidacy and election of said Robert E. Crowley to said office of superintendent of streets as aforesaid, and with reference to the articles aforesaid.\u201d The defendant does not argue that this alleged libel, construed in connection with the other publications averred, would not tend to subject the plaintiff to public ridicule and contempt and to injure seriously his reputation both as an individual and in his official capacity; and, unless the averments of the declaration show a sufficient occasion and justification for what the defendant is alleged to have done, this is enough to constitute a cause of action. <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>174 Mass. 586. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Clinton Printing Co. </em>169 Mass. 512. <em>Call </em>v. Hayes, 169 Mass. 586. <em>Twombly </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>136 Mass. 464. The defendant does not dispute this general principle, but rests his defence upon the ground that the declaration shows that the election of a superintendent of streets was pending in the city council of Lowell; that Robert E. Crowley was a candidate for this office; that the alleged libels were statements made in his newspaper with reference to that election, the fitness of Crowley for the office, and the action of the plaintiff in seeking to bring about Crowley\u2019s election; and he contends that the matters discussed by him were of public interest and general concern in Lowell, and so were protected and cannot be made the ground of action. And it is true that comments fairly made with reference to the action and attitude concerning public matters of a person seeking or holding public office are not to be treated as libellous. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>16 Gray, 251. <em>Bodwell </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>3 Pick. 379. <em>Wason </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>L. R. 4 Q. B. 73, 93, 94. And doubtless a more difficult question would be raised if this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>had been brought by Crowley for the statements made concerning him in these alleged publications, although it is to be observed that even in such a case, as is pointed out by Holmes, J. in <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Advertiser Newspaper Co. </em>154 Mass. 238, 242, it is criticism and not statement that is protected, and if one takes upon himself to allege facts otherwise libellous, \u201c he will not be_ privileged if those facts are not true.\u201d See the cases there cited, pp. 243, 244. But this action is not brought by Crowley. The declaration charges that the defendant, after statements which import that Crowley was utterly unfit for the office which he sought, that he had endeavored to further every scheme which had been put forward \u201c to tap the city treasury,\u201d and that the plaintiff sought Crowley\u2019s election to increase his ability \u201cto raid the treasury\u201d and to put \u201cadditional power in the hands of the police-rum combine,\u201d at the head of which stood the plaintiff, and after making what a jury might find were charges that this \u201c combine \u201d and the plaintiff were seeking to procure Crowley\u2019s election by unfair means and perhaps by bribery, directly states that $5,000 had been placed in the hands of the plaintiff \u201c to be distributed judiciously for the election\u201d of Crowley. It seems manifest to us that, whatever might be the findings of a jury, it cannot be said as matter of law that this count does not set forth a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The second count may be considered more briefly; for the decision upon it involves only the general principles already stated. It is doubtless manifest that the words \u201c robbing the taxpayers \u201d do not necessarily import a charge of felony. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>16 Pick. 1. The words are to be construed as they would be naturally and ordinarily intex\u2019preted by the general reader. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Met. 473, 481. The innuendo cannot extend the sense of the words beyond the natural import. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Davis, ubi supra. McCallum </em>v. <em>Lambie, </em>145 Mass. 234. <em>Brettun </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>103 Mass. 37. But this action is for libel, not slander, and it is immaterial whether or not participation in any criminal conduct is charged. <em>Atwill </em>v. <em>Mackintosh, </em>120 Mass. 177. <em>We </em>think that the jury well might find that the defendant charged the plaintiff with being such a man that from his standpoint one who would unlawfully and improperly spend the public money was his ideal superintendent of streets, and that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tiff supported Crowley because be was such a man; and we cannot say that this is not an actionable libel. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Clinton Printing Co. </em>169 Mass. 512. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Journal Newspaper Co. </em>168 Mass. 327. <em>Twombly </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>136 Mass. 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">For the reasons already stated the demurrer must also be overruled as to the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Accordingly the judgment of the Superior Court must be reversed and the demurrer overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
