The answer of the libellee denied all of the allegations of the libellant, charged him with desertion, and alleged condonation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">In the Superior Court the case came on to be heard before <em>Bond, </em>J. on May 31, 1905. The counsel for the libellant read to the judge and filed in the case the following statement of the libellant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">\u201c The libellant being unable to secure the attendance of indispensable witnesses at this present sitting of this court, (if the case cannot be continued,) consents that his libel be dismissed, without prejudice, for want of prosecution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">The judge inquired of the counsel for the libellant whether he had prepared or was ready to prepare an affidavit stating the facts the absent witnesses would testify to if present as the basis of the request for a continuance of the case. To this inquiry the counsel replied that he had not made or filed an affidavit, and that he could not himself make it, as he did not know what the witnesses would testify to, and did not know where they were, and that his client was away. Thereupon the judge ordered that the libel be dismissed generally, and declined to order the libel dismissed without prejudice. The libellant appealed from this order, and alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-13\"><em>C.

See <em>Hollingsworth &amp; Vose Co. </em>v. <em>Foxborough Water Supply </em>District, 171 Mass. 450; <em>Carpenter </em>Sons <em>Co. </em>v. <em>New York, New </em>Haven, <em>&amp; Hartford </em>Railroad, 184 Mass. 98. This in substance he asked to have done. The entry actually made by the judge was \u201cLibel dismissed.\u201d The force and effect of this entry is stated by Knowlton, J. in <em>Bradley </em>v. Bradley, 160 Mass. 258, in the following language: \u201c The entry * Libel dismissed,\u2019 without the addition of the words \u2018without prejudice,\u2019 purports to be a final judgment upon the merits. It is a bar to any further proceedings upon the cause of action set out in the libel. In collateral proceedings it is not conclusive by way of estoppel, or as evidence, except upon matters actually tried and determined; but as a final disposition of that for which the suit was brought, it is, like a judgment by default, conclusive as well in regard to the matters which might have been pleaded as those which were formally put in issue,\u201d citing <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>1 Gray, 412; <em>Borrowscale </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>5 Allen, 377, 378; <em>Durant </em>v. <em>Essex Co. </em>8 Allen, 103, 108; <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>99 Mass. <em>39; Foye </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>132 Mass. 105, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">It is argued by the libellee that the paper filed by the libellant shows that the entry in this case was in accordance with the consent of the libellant as indicated in the paper, but we do not think that this clearly appears in the record. The fair interpretation of the record is that the judge did not intend to make the entry to which the libellant assented, but to make an entry of a different nature and to dismiss the petition generally. This the judge could not properly do against the objection of the libellant. The entry should have been \u201cLibel dismissed without prejudice, for want of prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
