Sheehan.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b605-8\">Suffolk.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AEa\">November 23, 1905. \u2014</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_l\">March 2, 1906.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b605-9\">Present: Knowlton, C.

L. c. 173, \u00a7 106, and Rules 47 and 29 of the Superior Court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-13\">Tort against a constable of the city of Boston for the alleged conversion of certain goods and chattels attached by him. Writ dated June 10, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-14\">At the trial in the Superior Court in October, 1903, before <em>Gashill, </em>J. the jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff reduced to writing a bill of exceptions and filed it with the clerk of the court within twenty days after the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-15\">The defendant moved to dismiss the bill of exceptions because no notice of the filing was given to him. At the hearing on the motion it appeared that within the required time after the filing of the bill of exceptions the attorney for the defendant received through the mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the bill of exceptions without signature of counsel, but that there was no letter accompanying the copy, and no memorandum or statement as to the filing thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-16\">The plaintiff requested the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-17\">First, If the court finds that the exceptions in the case at bar were properly reduced to writing and a copy of such exceptions so reduced to writing was delivered by the plaintiff to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>fendant within the time required for filing'such exceptions, and for giving notice thereof to the adverse party, then the delivery of such copy amounted to the giving of a sufficient notice by the plaintiff to the defendant of the filing of such exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\">Second, On all the evidence before the court a sufficient notice of the filing of the bill of exceptions in question was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">The judge refused to rule as requested and allowed the defendant\u2019s motion. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-7\">S. <em>R. Cutler &amp; H. W. James, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-8\"><em>P. B. Kiernan, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b606-9\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmH\">The exceptions were duly filed, and the only question is whether \u201c notice thereof \u201d was given as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">\u201c Exceptions shall be reduced to writing and filed with the clerk, and notice thereof shall be given to the adverse party . . . within twenty days after the verdict is rendered.\u201d R. L. c. 178, \u00a7 106. Rule 47 of the Superior Court. The notice \u201c shall be in writing.\u201d Rule 29 of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">A sending to the adverse party by mail of a copy of the bill of exceptions, without any signature of counsel, without any accompanying letter and without any \u201c memorandum or statement as to the filing thereof,\u201d plainly comes far short of a notice that any bill, much less any properly signed bill, has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
