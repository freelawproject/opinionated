Monaghan was placed in custody about 8.30 this evening, and was soon bailed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">\u201cAccording to the allegations of the complainant, Chief of Police Kingsbury, Monaghan received pay for work he did not perform. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\">\u201c The charges are that Monaghan, during the five or six years he served as an assistant engineer of the town, kept a pair of horses in readiness to attach to hose 3 and to drive that piece of apparatus in response to a fire alarm. If he did not answer on the first alarm, and there was no second, he received remuneration, but not as great as though hose 3 had answered the first call.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\">\u201c It is alleged that Monaghan charged the town for a hitch of the latter character on March 23 that he did not make, but for which he was paid. The amount involved, it is understood, is less than $100. Whether any attempt to name any other date will be made on the part of the government is not stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-8\">\u201cMonaghan is a stone mason and resides on Walnut St., near Lower Falls. He is about 45 years old, married, and has always lived in Wellesley. He has been prominent in town affairs and 1ns arrest has aroused expressions of surprise on the part of his friends.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-9\">\u201c During Monaghan\u2019s service as assistant engineer, which duties he relinquished this year as he failed of re-appointment by the selectmen, his salary was $75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-10\">\u201cThe case will come up for trial in the District Court at Dedham on Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-11\">The answer required proof that the libel was published of and concerning the plaintiff; it then alleges \u201c that the same was made in good faith, without malice, expressed or implied, toward the plaintiff or any one, from reliable information, fully verified, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>same being published as news matter by it, believing the same to be true.\u201d It further alleges the truth of the statements, that it was a fair report of a judicial proceeding, and that within the time required for an answer it offered to publish the following as a retraction:</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">\u201c Was not Arrested:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">\u201cGlobe\u2019s Report of Suit Against Mr. Monaghan Inaccurate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">\u201cAs there appeared in a publication of the Globe Newspaper of July 1, 1902, in an article relative to the charge against Job Monaghan of Wellesley, for larceny and taking money that he did not work for, from the town, the statements that said Monaghan was arrested at Wellesley, that he was placed in custody about 8.30 in the evening and was soon bailed, were not true, the said Monaghan not being arrested but being cited or summoned to appear and answer to the charge of larceny for trial, as .the article otherwise states.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">\u201cAlthough nearly a year and a half after the publication, on being informed of the incorrectness of this statement, the Globe immediately offered to publish a retraction or correction of anything that was wrong, but the offer not being accepted by the said Monaghan or his attorney, the Globe now publishes this retraction or correction of the circumstances in connection with Monaghan\u2019s trouble,\u201d and that this offer was not accepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-9\">At the trial the defendant rested on the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The plaintiff testified in his own behalf, and read the answers of the defendant to interrogatories filed by the plaintiff giving the circulation of the defendant\u2019s paper and stating that the libel was written by one Bentley, \u201c who received his information from the police station or police officials at Wellesley as a news item.\u201d It was agreed that the retraction set forth in the answer was duly offered and declined. On cross-examination of the plaintiff the defendant put in the complaint and warrant hereinafter more fully stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-10\">The plaintiff testified that he was a brick mason and plasterer; that he was connected with the fire department of Wellesley for six years; that he saw the publication complained of; that a great many of his friends spoke to him of it; that it troubled him, and that his business declined in the year following. On cross-examination he testified that he kept a pair of horses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>readiness as stated in the publication, and that he received more remuneration if his horses were used on the first alarm; that he attended court on a summons without being arrested. The complaint and warrant put in evidence were dated June 28, 1902. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff \u201c did steal money of the value of less than one hundred dollars of the property of the town of Wellesley.\u201d The return of arrest on the warrant is dated July 2, 1902. By it the officer states: \u201cI have arrested the within-named defendant, Job Monaghan, and have him before the District Court.\u201d The plaintiff testified that July 2 was the date of the hearing which he- attended on the summons testified to by him, and that he was summoned in the evening of July 1, that is to say, in the evening of the day on the morning of which the libel was published, and the day after the date of the libellous statement. The plaintiff also testified that the case was appealed from the District Court to the Superior Court, and was disposed of in the latter court a short time before the date of the writ in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\">The defendant asked for the following rulings:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\">(1) Upon all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">(2) If the jury believe that the defendant published the statements alleged as a news item, without malice, and that the same are substantially true, their verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">(3) If the jury believe the defendant published the alleged libel without malice, as news matter, and that the same is a fair and impartial report of the facts, they are to regard the same as privileged, and will find a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">(4) If the jury find that the offer pleaded by the defendant in its answer was a sufficient offer to retract all that part of the original libel not proved by the defendant to be true, then they shall find a verdict for the defendant, as no actual damage has been pleaded or proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\">(5) If the jury shall find that the offer pleaded by the defendant was not a sufficient offer of retraction, then the same shall not be taken to be an admisssion against the defendant of the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-10\">(6) Upon the facts in this case the plaintiff was placed under arrest by the officer June 30,1902;</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The judge instructed the jury in substance that if the defendant proved the truth of the statements published by it it would be a defence unless the plaintiff proved actual malice, and that in the case at bar there was no evidence of that; also that the proprietor of a newspaper is permitted to publish the fact that a complaint and warrant had been issued and to publish \u201c the facts which actually transpired under those proceedings, but when the paper goes beyond the publication of just those facts, when it undertakes to publish things which do not appear in these papers and in these proceedings, then the fact of the complaint and warrant would not justify the paper for those things which are outside of the complaint and of the warrant. Now, the complaint against this plaintiff is that he did steal money of the value of less than $100, of the property of the town of Wellesley. The complaint is not in terms as stated in the article. That Monaghan charged the town for a hitch of the latter character on March 23d which he did not \"make, but for which he was paid. The article does not give that which actually appeared in the complaint, and of course you will see that the complaint might be supported by \u2014 it is a possibility it might be supported by very many other things than this particular charge that is made in the article alleged to have been libellous. The warrant issued upon that simply recited the fact that it was on complaint this day made on oath before said court for larceny.\u201d The judge left it to the jury to say whether the evidence proved the truth of the allegations contained in the article. The fifth ruling asked for was given with this qualification, \u201c that the proof of the offer of retraction has no effect in the case excepting as it may be shown in mitigation of damages. It has no other bearing on the case.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">The defendant took exceptions to the refusal to rule and to the rulings given.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-7\"><em>C. T. Gallagher, (T. E. Grover </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-8\"><em>W. R. Bigelow, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b418-9\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7e\">[After the foregoing statement of the case.] The rulings were sufficiently favorable to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">1. The case made out in evidence was not one which called for a ruling that it was enough to prove that the things written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>were in substance true, as laid down in <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Standard Publishing Co. </em>183 Mass. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">2. The defendant was not entitled to a ruling that the libellous statements were as matter of law proved to have been substantially true. All that was proved to be true was that a complaint had been lodged against the plaintiff, charging him with larceny of less than $100 from the town of Wellesley, and that a warrant had issued on that complaint. The defendant did not prove the truth of the statements (1) that the plaintiff had been arrested; (2) that he was accused of taking town money for work he did not do; (3) that he was placed in custody about 8.30 this evening [i. e. on the evening of June 28] and was soon bailed; (4) that according to the allegations of the complainant (Chief of Police Kingsbury) Monaghan received pay for work he did not perform; (5) that \u201c It is alleged that Monaghan charged the town for a hitch of the latter character on March 23 that he did not make, but for which he was paid. The amount involved, it is understood, is less than $100. Whether any attempt to name any other date will be made on the part of the government is not stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">3. The statement offered as a retraction was as matter of law not a retraction of what we have already pointed out to have been libellous statements not proved to be true. It is not necessary to consider what would have been the consequences if the statement which the defendant offered to publish had been a retraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
