Robinson, and afterwards assigned to the plaintiff, with the assent of the defendant, insuring the Pigeon Cove House at Roekport in the sum of $6,000 for the term of one year beginning August 29, 1902.

It is a part of the consideration of this policy and the basis upon which the rate of premium is fixed that the assured shall maintain insurance on the property described by this policy to the extent of at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>eighty per cent of the actual cash value thereof, and that failing so to do the assured shall be an assurer to the extent of such deficit, and to that extent shall bear his, her or their proportion of any loss that may happen to said property. Attached to and made a part of policy No. 636, Phenix Insurance Company. J. Judson Dean, Agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-3\">The plaintiff purchased the property, which consisted of the hotel building and furniture, a stable and about one acre of land, on December 23,1902, from the heirs of Ellen S. Eobinson for the sum of $15,500, and on or about December 26, 1902, she procured insurance on the hotel building in several companies, to the amount of $12,500. These policies were then and at the time of the fire valid insurance upon the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-4\">On January 3, 1903, while this other insurance was on the property, the policy in suit issued by the defendant was assigned to the plaintiff, and on the same day the assignment was assented to in writing by the defendant through its local agent. There was then, including the policy issued by the defendant, $18,500 of insurance upon the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">On January 29, 1903, the property was totally destroyed by fire, and the defendant received notice of the loss on February 3, 1903. The value of the property at the time of its destruction was $17,400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">The plaintiff requested the judge to rule:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">\u201c That the rider containing the Eighty Per Cent Clause attached to this policy does by necessary implication authorize additional insurance without other consent, and that there was no violation of the policy by the additional insurance placed on the property by the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">The judge refused to make this ruling. He found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-9\">C. <em>A. Sayward, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-10\"><em>F. W. Brown, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-11\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am7\">This clause called the \u201c Standard Guarantee to maintain eighty per cent insurance \u201d is of recent origin, but it does not entirely supersede the clause providing that the policy shall be void in case of additional insurance without the consent of the company. The two clauses are not necessarily inconsistent, and, to a certain extent at least, can stand together, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>each having its due scope. As stated by Hamersley, J. in a similar case, \u201c If, as the plaintiffs claim, the adoption of the [guaranty] clause imposes on the insured an obligation to procure such additional insurance as may be necessary to keep the total amount of insurance equal to 80 per cent of the changing actual value of the property covered by the policy, and therefore impliedly gives permission to procure, or waives the provision against, such insurance, it must follow that such permission or waiver is limited by the necessity from which it is implied.\u201d <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>70 Conn. 566, 572. See also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>German American Ins. Co. </em>123 N. Y. 6. In the present case the additional insurance carried the total insurance to a sum greater than the entire value of the property. Applying the principle above stated, the result is that this policy was avoided by such additional insurance. In so far as the cases of <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Mechanics\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>91 Wis. 530, and <em>Catoosa Springs Co. </em>v. Linch, 18 Misc. (N. Y.) 209, cited by the plaintiff, are inconsistent with this view, we cannot follow them. The ruling requested was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
