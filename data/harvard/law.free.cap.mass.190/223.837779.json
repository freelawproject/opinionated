Roach, the testator, was born in Ireland in 1846 and died in Essex County in this Commonwealth on November IT, 1908, leaving a will made in Wisconsin, dated June 15, 1901, which was allowed by the Probate Court for the county of Essex on February 9, 1905, containing the residuary clause quoted in the opinion of the court; that the plaintiff had in his hands and possession, as administrator with the will annexed, about $10,000 deposited in banks; that the testator left no real estate; that the defendant, James Roach, was the only brother of the testator alive at the time of the making of the will and at the time of the death of the testator; that the testator left three sisters, Julia Wilcox, Sarah Varley and Mary Size, the latter two living in Ireland; that the testator had had a brother, Patrick Roach, and a sister, Margaret O\u2019Brien, both of whom were dead at the time of the making of the will; that six children of Patrick Roach, and six children of Margaret O\u2019Brien, were living at the time of the testator\u2019s death; that the will was drawn by the testator and was in his handwriting.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-7\"><em>H.

It per stirpes, </em>then the three Roach children take one third, James Roach one third, and the O\u2019Brien children one third; if <em>per capita, </em>then each of the legatees takes one eighth. At the time of the testator\u2019s death there were other children of the testator\u2019s brother Patrick Roach and of his deceased sister than those named. The clause in question distinctly describes the legatees by their respective names, and plainly says that the property shall be equally divided between them; and we see nothing in the method of division into paragraphs, or in the other framework of the clause, to indicate that this language is to be taken in any other than its ordinary meaning. It is plain that the legatees take <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
