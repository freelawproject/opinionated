Evidence.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b406-9\">In an action against a street railway company for personal injuries, the defendant contended that the plaintiff was injured while attempting to get on a moving car when he was intoxicated. The plaintiff\u2019s wife, when cross-examined as to what she had said in reference to the accident to a woman who kept a grocery, denied telling the woman that her husband had gone down the harbor with two fellows from Everett or telling her that he had been drinking. The woman who kept the grocery was called by the defendant as a witness and was asked in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s wife \u201cDid she tell you where her husband had been!\u201d This was objected to by the plaintiff and admitted by the judge as competent to affect the credibility of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, if she said anything inconsistent with her statements on the stand, and ruled that the statement was \u201cmaterial if she testified as to her husband\u2019s condition.\u201d The plaintiff excepted to the ruling. The witness answered: \u201c She came in again, and said I should trust her again, without her old bill being paid, because he went away yesterday without leaving any money, and he was drinking, and he was hurt, and she couldn\u2019t find any money in his pocket.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, even treating the question as not a merely preliminary one, it was competent to ask the witness where the plaintiff\u2019s wife said that her husband had been, for the purpose of impeaching the wife\u2019s credibility as a witness, and that the answer, which was not responsive, was not in question, no objection having .been made to it and no motion having been made to strike it out.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained \u25a0while the plaintiff was a passenger on a car of the defendant.

His contention was that while riding on the running board he was thrown off through the negligence of the conductor. The defendant\u2019s contention was that he was injured in attempting to board the car when he was intoxicated and while it was in motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that he left home at six A. M. on the day of the accident, and she did not see him again until she found him at the hospital the next day, Thursday. On cross-examination she testified that her husband had been paid off the day before the accident, and in answer to the question \u201c He had a good deal of money when he left the house that morning?\u201d she answered, \u201c Ho, he didn\u2019t have much.\u201d She further testified on cross-examination that she had had no conversation with \u201c Mrs. Symonds, who keeps a grocery,\u201d with reference to the accident to the plaintiff; at least she did not remember that she had; and in answer to the question \u201c Do you remember telling her your husband had gone down the Harbor with two fellows from Everett?\u201d she said \u201cHo; I didn\u2019t know he went down the Harbor.\u201d She also testified that she did not tell Mrs. Symonds that he had been drinking. The defendant called Mrs. Symonds and asked her this question: \u201c Did she tell you where her husband had been ? \u201d This was objected to by the plaintiff and was admitted as \u201c competent to affect the credibility of \u201d the plaintiff\u2019s wife, \u201c if she said anything inconsistent with her statements on the stand,\u201d and that \u201c the statement is material if she testified as to her husband\u2019s condition.\u201d To this ruling the plaintiff saved an exception. Mrs. Symonds then testified that \u201c She came in again, and said I should trust her again, without her old bill being paid, because he went away yesterday without leaving any money, and he was drinking, and he was hurt, and she couldn\u2019t find any money in his pocket.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-o\">The defendant had a verdict, and the case is here on this exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>James J. </em>MoCarthy, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-5\"><em>J.
