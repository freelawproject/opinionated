Avila-Trujillo argues that (1) the district court plainly erred because the condition delegates a judicial function to a probation officer and (2) is unconstitutionally vague and over-broad. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Avila-Trujillo was found in a residence that was raided as part of a joint federal and state narcotics investigation. He admitted to an officer that he had illegally re-entered the United States after he was deported in 1997 and had a counterfeit alien registration card. He pleaded guilty to possession or use of a counterfeit alien identification card, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), and illegal re-entry into the United States after deportation, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">The district court sentenced Avila-Trujillo to ten months of imprisonment followed by one year of supervised release. The district court adopted the Pre-Sentence Investigation report that assessed a criminal history category of III because of Avila-Trujillo\u2019s three prior convictions for assaulting his common law wife. As part of Avila-Trujillo\u2019s supervised release, the district court imposed Standard Condition Thirteen, which requires that \u201cas directed by the probation officer, the defendant shall notify third parties of risks that may be occasioned by the defendant\u2019s criminal record or personal history or characteristics and shall permit the probation officer to make such notifications and to confirm the defendant\u2019s compliance with such notification requirement.\u201d Avila-Trujillo did not object to this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Avila-Trujillo argues that the district plainly erred because Standard Condition Thirteen impermissibly delegates a judicial function to a probation officer and is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We review the terms of a supervised release for abuse of discretion, but where the defendant fails to object at the district court, we reverse only for plain error. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1088 (11th Cir.2003). We review constitutional issues <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for plain error where the defendant fails to object at the district court. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>59 F.3d 1196, 1198 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">The district court did not plainly err when it imposed Standard Condition Thirteen. \u2018We have upheld conditions of su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>pervised release that unequivocally impose a requirement on the defendant, but subject the defendant to the \u2018approval\u2019 or \u2018direction\u2019 of a probation officer.\u201d <em>United States v. Nash, </em>438 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2006). Standard Condition Thirteen is indistinguishable from the condition of supervised release we upheld in <em>Nash. See id. </em>at 1306. Standard Condition Thirteen does \u201cnot relegate the \u2018ultimate responsibility of determining [Avila-Trujillo]\u2019s sentence to the unfettered discretion of the probation officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Standard Condition Thirteen is also not unconsitutionally vague and overbroad. \u201cConditions of supervised release are not vague and overbroad when they are \u2018undeniably related\u2019 to the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307 (quoting <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>338 F.3d 1280, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2003)); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Standard Condition Thirteen is \u201cundeniably related\u201d to Avila-Trujillo\u2019s refusal to comply with immigration orders and his multiple convictions for assault. <em>See Nash, </em>438 F.3d at 1307. Notification to third parties of these prior convictions would protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Standard Condition Thirteen of Avila-Trujillo\u2019s supervised release is</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
