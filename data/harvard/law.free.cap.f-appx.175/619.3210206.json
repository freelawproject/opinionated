Brown argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), commonly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), requires the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment on any person who is convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) and who \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony,\u201d as is relevant here, as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... is burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Brown acknowledges that he has two qualifying predicate convictions and a third conviction for burglary. He maintains, however, that the burglary conviction should not be counted for purposes of the ACCA because South Carolina, the state where the conviction was obtained, classified the offense as \u201cNon-Violent.\u201d J.A. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The reference in the ACCA to the crime of \u201cburglary\u201d refers to \u201cgeneric burglary,\u201d namely, a burglary \u201ccommitted in a building or enclosed space ... [but] not in a boat or motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). In determining whether a prior conviction was for a generic burglary, the district court may consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the charging documents. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). The district court did so here, and determined that Brown had been convicted of entering a business at nighttime with the intent to commit a crime therein. This is the very definition of a generic burglary. <em>See id. </em>at 598-99, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The district court therefore did not err in sentencing Brown as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Brown\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
