On January 16, 2002, the Government moved the district court pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b)(2) to reduce appellant\u2019s sentence based on appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance.\u201d On January 27, 2003, the court, after hearing from the parties, granted the motion and reduced appellant\u2019s prison sentence to a term of 150 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">On June 8, 2005, the Government again moved the court pursuant to Rule 3(b)(2) to reduce appellant\u2019s sentence. The court granted the motion on June 13, 2005, reducing appellant\u2019s sentence to 144 months. \u201cTaking into account all of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe new sentence of 144 months was the appropriate sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">On June 24, 2005, appellant moved the court to reconsider its June 13 ruling, contending among other things that his assistance to the Government warranted a reduction of more than six months and that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the court was free to disregard the Sentencing Guidelines and to consider the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court construed appellant\u2019s motion as seeking a further reduction of his sentence (as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>as reconsideration of its previous decision). After considering the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and appellant\u2019s arguments, the court concluded that a sentence of 144 months imprisonment was appropriate and, on July 7, 2005, entered an order denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Appellant now appeals that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied </em>544 U.S. 988, 125 S.Ct. 1872, 161 L.Ed.2d 749 (2005). Our examination of the district court\u2019s order of July 7, 2005 in light of the relevant record convinces us that the court acted well within its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration. The court carefully considered and properly rejected every argument appellant presented in support of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-16\">. As stated in the concluding paragraph of his motion, appellant moved the court to reduce his sentence \u201cpursuant to\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K1.1 and 5K3.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
