Pyne was sentenced to imprisonment for 144 months. We find no error and affirm Pyne\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Pyne contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He maintains that his apartment complex\u2019s parking garage was curtilage, thereby requiring the Government to obtain either a search warrant or his consent prior to searching it.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">We review the factual findings underlying the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and the legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>400 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 134, 163 L.Ed.2d 133 (2005). The evidence is construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-19\">The Fourth Amendment protects a residence\u2019s curtilage if \u201cthe area harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987) (internal quotations omitted). In determining whether curtilage rises to this level, we consider \u201c \u2018the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Breza, </em>308 F.3d 430, 435 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. 1134).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-20\">The parking garage at issue was used by other tenants, contained multiple parking spaces, and was located at the bottom level of a multi-level apartment complex. Though the garage had a security gate, uncontroverted testimony established that it was, at best, unreliable. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>der these facts, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in its determination that the parking garage was not curtilage subject to Fourth Amendment protections. <em>See United States v. Stanley, </em>597 F.2d 866, 870 (4th Cir.1979) (holding that a common area parking lot was not within the curtilage of a mobile home).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Additionally, Pyne argues that the officer\u2019s use of a drug detection canine was a warrantless search requiring suppression of the evidence. The Fourth Amendment is not implicated when Government action does not \u201ccompromise any legitimate interest in privacy.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 408, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005). Because \u201cany interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed legitimate, ... governmental conduct that <em>only </em>reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Law enforcement officers, who were properly in the complex\u2019s parking garage, performed a canine scan of a vacant, parked vehicle. Due to their surveillance, officers had a reasonable suspicion to believe that the vehicle contained contraband substances. Once the canine alerted to the vehicle, officers obtained a search warrant. In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the canine search was proper as the protections of the Fourth Amendment were not implicated. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Pyne\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Pyne also contends the district court improperly denied a hearing under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In order to establish that a <em>Franks </em>hearing is warranted, a defendant must show \u201c(1) \u2018that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit,\u2019 and (2) that the statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffus, </em>22 F.3d 554, 558 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 2674). \u201cThis showing must be more than conclusory and must be accompanied by a detailed offer of proof.\u201d <em>United States v. Colkley, </em>899 F.2d 297, 300 (4th Cir.1990) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Pyne has failed to meet this burden. His statements are conclusory and fail to demonstrate that the challenged portions of the affidavit are anything more than the result of negligence or innocent mistake. <em>See Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674 (a challenger\u2019s attack must be more than conclusory and allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient). Therefore, the district court properly denied Pyne\u2019s motion for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Accordingly, we deny Pyne\u2019s motions to file a pro se supplemental brief and for correction of alleged errors and omissions in the district court\u2019s docket report and affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
