Marker appeals his convictions and sentence for 17 counts of mail and wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. We affirm Marker\u2019s convictions. However, because the district court imposed a sentence greater than that allowed by the facts found by the jury alone, we vacate his sentence and remand <em>for </em>resentencing. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-19\">Marker was arrested on December 17, 2003, and he was later indicted on numerous charges related to his operation of a fraudulent investment scheme. Following his arrest, the Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office was appointed to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">In March 2004, Marker moved to dismiss appointed counsel, claiming that counsel possessed neither the training nor ability to handle a case this complex. Although the district court denied the motion, Marker renewed his objections following a dispute with counsel over the release of certain records to a receiver, who had been appointed in a related civil matter. As a result of that disagreement, Marker claimed that he no longer trusted his attorney and could not work with him. The district court granted Marker\u2019s renewed motion but warned him of the perils of proceeding pro se and offered to appoint substitute counsel. An impasse was reached when the district court would not allow Marker to interview prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>counsel and, despite statements that he would move to have certain seized funds released so that he could hire counsel, Marker ultimately represented himself at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">At a status conference on June 10, 2004, four days before his trial was to begin, Marker indicated that he was not prepared and complained that he did not have access to a law library, a printer, and other items. On June 14, 2004, when his case was called for jury selection and trial, Marker renewed his complaints about not being prepared and not having access to materials. Once it became evident that the district court would not grant a continuance, Marker announced that he had \u201chad it [and would] not ... participate\u201d in his trial. J.A.247.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">As promised, Marker did not participate. He made no opening or closing statements, presented no evidence, called no witnesses, offered no objections, and conducted no cross-examination. As a result, the Government presented evidence of Marker\u2019s fraudulent investment scheme unopposed, and the jury convicted Marker on all 17 counts. The jury thereafter returned a special verdict finding that $857,000 was forfeitable to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">At sentencing, the Government produced evidence demonstrating that Marker had used mass-marketing techniques in promoting his fraudulent investment scheme, had removed and concealed documents, and had made fraudulent investment presentations to various foreign nations seeking investments totaling hundreds of millions of dollar\u2019s. Based upon this evidence, the district court calculated the loss attributable to Marker\u2019s actions to be at least $800 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Although Marker\u2019s base offense level was six, this loss finding resulted in an enhancement of 26 levels. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2S1.1(1)(l) (2001) (directing that the offense level for money laundering is the offense level for the offense from which the laundered funds were derived); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(a) (setting forth a base offense level of six for fraud offenses); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(N) (providing for a 26-level enhancement for loss greater than $100 million). The district court assessed an additional five offense levels because (1) Marker\u2019s offense involved more than ten victims and was committed through mass-marketing, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(A); (2) Marker was convicted under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1957 (West 2000), see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2S1.1(b)(2)(A); and (3) Marker obstructed justice, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. The resulting total offense level of 37, combined with Marker\u2019s criminal history category of I, produced a guideline range of 210-262 months imprisonment. However, the court granted Marker\u2019s motion to depart on the basis that the offense level overstated the seriousness of the offense and reduced the offense level to 31, producing a guideline range of 108-135 months. The district court sentenced Marker to 110 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">We have reviewed Marker\u2019s challenges to his convictions and find them to be without merit. We therefore consider Marker\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Marker argues, and the Government concedes, that the sentence imposed by the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights because it exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict alone. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. Because Marker objected below based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his <em>Booker </em>claim is reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>2006). By our calculations, the facts found by the jury authorized an offense level of 21 and a guideline range of 37-46 months. This is, obviously, far less than the sentence actually imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Marker\u2019s conviction but vacate and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
