Tanzymore pleaded not guilty. During trial, the district court rejected Tanzymore\u2019s justification defense as a matter of law. Tanzymore argued that he possessed the firearm because he feared for his safety and that of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-25\">Tanzymore then entered a guilty plea during trial conditioned on his right to appeal the justification defense. The court accepted the conditional plea and sentenced Tanzymore to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-26\">Disposition of this appeal is controlled by our decision in <em>United States v. Bundy, </em>392 F.3d 641 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Bundy, </em>we held that a conditional guilty plea that attempts to preserve non-case-dispositive issues for appellate review is invalid. An issue is case-dispositive only if a ruling in the defendant\u2019s favor would require dismissal of the charges or suppression of essential evidence, or a ruling in the government\u2019s favor would require affirming the conviction. \u201cIn short, there should be no trial after the specified issues are resolved by the court of appeals.\u201d 392 F.3d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-27\">In this case, Tanzymore\u2019s conditional guilty plea attempted to preserve for appeal a non-case-dispositive issue. If we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>were to find that Tanzymore was entitled to present a justification defense, the case would be returned to the district court and proceed to trial. As in <em>Bundy, </em>we conclude that \u201cthe presence of one non-casedispositive issue in this conditional plea renders the entire plea invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And as in <em>Bundy, </em>we therefore vacate the judgment of conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
