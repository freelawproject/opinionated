First, he asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. We reject this assertion, as Lane has failed to show that a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>961 F.2d 1169, 1173 (5th Cir.1992). We find unpersuasive his arguments that (1) a firearm discovered by police did not link him to the crime and that (2) certain witnesses were not credible. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Likewise, we reject Lane\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based upon facts that were not determined by the jury. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
