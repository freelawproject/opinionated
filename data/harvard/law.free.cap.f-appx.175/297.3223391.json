They contend that Ms. Bryant was attempting to kick the officers and succeeded in kicking one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">The district court examined the officers\u2019 use of force under the framework outlined in <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872-73, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989), which holds that the Fourth Amendment is violated when an officer\u2019s use of force is \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding such use. The district court concluded that a factual issue existed whether Ms. Bryant was actively and physically resisting the officers\u2019 attempts to search her and fingerprint her after her arrest, and thus whether the officers acted reasonably in \u201ctaking her down.\u201d We agree that this disputed factual issue precludes summary judgment for the officers on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The district court also held that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity \u201cat this time\u201d for their actions. State actors sued in their individual capacities for actions taken as part of their official duties are entitled to qualified immunity if their conduct does not violate clearly established rights. <em>Smith v. Mattox, </em>127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir.1997). The officers here are entitled to this immunity unless the law as it stood on the day of Ms. Bryant\u2019s arrest would compel, not merely suggest, the conclusion that the officers\u2019 conduct in taking her down would violate the plaintiff\u2019s rights. <em>Hudson v. Hall, </em>231 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">To determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, the court must first determine whether the officer has violated the plaintiffs rights. <em>See id. </em>If the officer has not violated the law at all, he could not possibly have violated clearly established law. <em>Id. </em>The district court determined that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the officers violated Ms. Bryant\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the court concluded that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue, but we note that the court may revisit the issue of qualified immunity if the jury finds (for example, through special interrogatories) that Ms. Bryant was actively and physically resisting arrest and trying to kick the officers during the booking process. <em>See Smith, </em>127 F.3d at 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\">. Ms. Bryant filed a motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. We deny this motion, as we have jurisdiction at this stage in the proceedings to review the district court\u2019s denial of the officers' qualified immunity defense. <em>See Jackson v. Sauls, </em>206 F.3d 1156, 1164 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Smith v. Mattox, </em>127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-17\"><em>. </em>Ms. Bryant also asserted state-law claims against the officers, and the district court denied the officers\u2019 motions, based on state-law official immunity, for summary judgment on those claims. The officers do not appeal these denials, and we express no opinion on them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
