The district court sentenced him as a career offender to a 262-month term of imprisonment. Robinson appeals his sentence, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and asserting that he should be resentenced under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Robinson also has filed a motion to remand for resentencing. We grant the motion to remand, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">Robinson contends that the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, not advisory. Because Robinson raised a timely objection at sentencing based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), he has preserved his claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415-16 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, we review Robinson\u2019s claim for harmless error, which places \u201cthe burden ... on the <em>Government </em>to show that such an error did <em>not </em>affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. Our review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing leads us to conclude that the Government has not met its burden to show that the error is harmless. The district court\u2019s silence on how it would apply the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005) in ascertaining a proper sentence for Robinson must be construed in Robinson\u2019s favor. <em>Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416. Thus, we conclude that Robinson is entitled to be resentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">Accordingly, we vacate Robinson\u2019s sentence, grant Robinson\u2019s motion to remand, and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker </em>and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-11\">. In light of our vacatur for statutory <em>Booker </em>error, we need not decide whether, as Robinson also contends on appeal, the district court committed Sixth Amendment error in sentencing him as a career offender. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-18\">. \"We of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of [Robinson's] sentencing.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
