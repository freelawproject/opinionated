Evans\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Evans has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Evans claims that the district court erred when it designated him an armed career criminal. A defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) qualifies as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony. The definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d includes any felony that has as an element the use of physical force or involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Evans has three prior convictions for violent felonies. In 1997, Evans was convicted in North Carolina of felony assault with a deadly weapon on a law enforcement officer. In 2002, Evans was convicted in North Carolina of common law robbery. <em>See State v. Herring, </em>322 N.C. 733, 370 S.E.2d 363, 368 (1988) (holding that the crime of common law robbery consists of taking property of another by means of violence or fear). In 2002, Evans was convicted in North Carolina of felony flight to elude arrest after he drove recklessly in an attempt to elude a police traffic stop. <em>See United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387 (4th Cir.2003) (finding failure to stop for a blue light constitutes a violent felony.) The district court correctly determined that Evans was an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Evans\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
