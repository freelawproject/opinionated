Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Singh fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Singh cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">We also uphold the IJ\u2019s finding Singh failed to establish eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
