His complaint contains federal constitutional and Florida statutory claims against Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart employees involved in his apprehension. Given the presence of the federal constitutional claims, the defendants removed the case to the district court, pursuant to 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and filed a motion to dismiss complaint for failure to state a claim for relief. Appellant responded by moving the court to remand the case to state court on two grounds: (1) the defendants had not asserted a basis for removing the case, which, in his view, contains only state law claims, and (2) their removal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The district court denied appellant\u2019s motion to remand, concluding that the case was removable because some of appellant\u2019s claims appeared to be based on federal constitutional law. At the same time, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant now appeals the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We instructed the parties to address the following issue in their briefs: \u2018Whether the district court properly denied [appellant\u2019s] motion for remand to the state court?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">A defendant may remove to federal court a civil action brought in state court provided that the federal court has original jurisdiction over the action. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). District courts \u201chave original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">To decide if a complaint states a claim \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\u201d the district court must consider the way that the complaint is drawn. <em>See Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 681, 66 S.Ct. 773, 775, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). \u201cFor to that extent the party who brings a suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon, and does determine whether he will bring a suit arising under the (Constitution or laws) of the United States by his declaration or bill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). Therefore, where a complaint \u201cis so drawn as to seek recovery directly under the Constitution or laws of the United States,\u201d the district court maintains jurisdiction unless (1) \u201cthe alleged claim under the Constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction\u201d or (2) \u201cwhere such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681-83, 66 S.Ct. at 776. \u201cUnder the latter <em>Bell </em>exception, subject matter jurisdiction is lacking only if the claim has no plausible foundation, or if the court concludes that a prior Supreme Court decision clearly forecloses the claim.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 1998) (quotations omitted); <em>see also McGinnis v. Ingram Equip. Co., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir.1990) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cThe test of federal jurisdiction is not whether the cause of action is one on which the claimant can recover. Rather, the test is whether the cause of action alleged is so patently without merit as to justify ... the court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The federal constitution does not protect against injuries by purely private individuals\u2014that is, individuals who cannot be considered as acting for state or local government. <em>See, e.g., Lyes v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>166 F.3d 1332, 1348-49 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause ... is a guarantee of protection against unjust <em>state </em>action; it does not reach the conduct of private individuals.\u201d); <em>Jeffries v. Ga. Residential Fin. Auth, </em>678 F.2d 919, 922 (11th Cir.1982) (explaining that \u201cthe fourteenth amendment proscription against deprivations of property without due process of law reaches only government action and does not inhibit the conduct of purely private persons in their ordinary activities.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>In the complaint before us, the defendants appear as purely private actors; hence, nothing they allegedly did could have constituted a violation of the federal constitution. Appellant\u2019s constitutional claims are insubstantial and frivolous; consequently, the district court lacked original jurisdiction over his case. <em>See Bell, </em>327 U.S. at 682-83, 66 S.Ct. at 776; <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>138 F.3d at 1352. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with the instruction that the court enter an order remanding the case to the Circuit Court of Volusia County.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\">. The court granted appellant leave to file an amended complaint, but he chose not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
