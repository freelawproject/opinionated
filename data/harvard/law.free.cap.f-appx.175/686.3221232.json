California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Gonzalez-Valverde filed a motion to remand, which we treat as an untimely response to the <em>Anders </em>brief. Our independent review of the brief, the record, and Gonzalez-Valverde\u2019s untimely response discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is granted, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Gonzalez-Valverde\u2019s separate motion seeking appointment of counsel on appeal is denied as Gonzalez-Valverde has not demonstrated incompatibility with his counsel or other most pressing circumstances. <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Plan under the Criminal Justice Act, \u00a7 5; <em>see also United States v. Route, </em>104 F.3d 59, 65 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-21\">MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
