McKellar\u2019s attorney on appeal has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in his opinion there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising as potential issues whether the district court erred in denying McKellar\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. McKellar filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">A defendant who seeks to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing must demonstrate a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal of the plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). A \u201cfair and just\u201d reason is one that essentially \u201cchallenges the fairness of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceeding\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>or \u201cchallenges the fulfillment of a promise or condition emanating from the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1889, 1394 (4th Cir.1992). A court should closely scrutinize the Rule 11 colloquy and attach a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding if the Rule 11 proceeding is adequate. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996). After reviewing the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding no fair and just reason for the withdrawal of McKellar\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We note counsel also raises the issue of whether the district court fully complied with Rule 11, but identifies no error in the Rule 11 proceeding and concludes that there was full compliance with the Rule. Our review of the record similarly discloses full compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Next, we find McKellar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in his pro se supplemental brief are not properly raised on direct appeal. Claims of ineffective assistance are not cognizable on direct appeal unless conclusively established on the record. <em>United States, v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). We find no evidence in the record conclusively establishing trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">With regard to the remaining issues raised in McKellar\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, we find his claims to be without merit. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McKellar\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
