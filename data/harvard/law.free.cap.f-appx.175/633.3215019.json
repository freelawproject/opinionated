Coaxum\u2019s attorney on appeal has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that in his opinion there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising as a potential issue whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. Coaxum filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (noting after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts should determine the sentencing range under the guidelines, consider the other factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum). However, in determining a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546^17. We have further stated that \u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 219 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Indeed, \u201ca sentence imposed \u2018within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 687 (7th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1455, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2006 WL 271816 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">We find that the district court properly calculated the guideline range and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Coaxum only after considering and examining the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Based on these factors, and because the court sentenced Coaxum within the applicable guideline range and the statutory maximum, we find that Coa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>xum\u2019s sentence of 12 months and one day of imprisonment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We find the issues raised in Coaxum\u2019s pro se supplemental brief to be without merit. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Coaxum\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
