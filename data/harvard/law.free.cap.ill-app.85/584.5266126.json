Thereafter, on the same day, appellee brought replevin in the Superior Court of Cook County against appellant for the same property. Appellant recovered judgment before the justice, from which the appellee in this court took an appeal to said Superior Court. In the Superior Court the two causes were consolidated and tried as one cause by the court, without the intervention of a jury, and separate judgments entered; in the replevin case, that appellee retain the property replevied, with one cent damages and costs against appellant, and in the distress case a judgment for costs in favor of appellee and against appellant. From these judgments the appeal in this case was taken.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-5\" pgmap=\"595\">The trial in the court below was had upon an agreed statement of facts, viz.:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\" pgmap=\"595\">\u201cIt is admitted that the McKim Gasket and Manufacturing Company was the owner of the goods and chattels in question on October 31, 1896.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-7\" pgmap=\"595\">\u201c It is admitted that the replevin writ was issued Monday morning, November 2, 1896.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-8\" pgmap=\"595\">\u201c It is admitted that the McKim Gasket and Manufacturing Company moved some of its ma chinery and fixtures October 31, 1896.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-9\" pgmap=\"595\">\u201c It is further admitted that the Dauchy Iron Works, to prevent the McKim Gasket and Manufacturing Company from moving the balance of the goods and chattels here in question, ordered the elevator stopped at 12.30 p. m. Saturday afternoon, and that the elevator did not run from that time till 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, when it recommenced to run, and continued to run during the rest of the afternoon.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-10\" pgmap=\"595(31) 596(54)\">\u201cIt is admitted that the McKim Gasket and Manufacturing Company had, since about the 20th day of July, 1896, been in the possession of the premises known as the sixth floor of the building, numbers 84 to 88 Illinois street, Chicago, Illinois.

It is admitted that the October rent, at the rate of $40, was paid on October 5, 1896.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\" pgmap=\"596\">\u201c It is admitted that a written lease for the premises in question for the term of one year, commencing August 1, 1896, and ending July 31, 1897, at a monthly rental of $40 a month, payable in advance, was drawn by the lessor, the Dauchy Iron Works, and left with the officers of the McKim Gasket and Manufacturing Company to be signed; and that said draft of lease was not signed at the time of delivery by the Dauchy Iron Works, and was not signed by either party at any time.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\" pgmap=\"596\">\u201c It is admitted that the Dauchy Iron Works, as lessor, caused the distress warrant in question to be levied by its agent, Edward A. Rhodes, on Monday morning, November 2, 1896, about nine o\u2019clock; that afterwards, and on Monday, November 2, 1896, a writ of replevin was served upon said Edward A.

Greeley, attorney for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-5\" pgmap=\"597\">Kraft &amp; Bust, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b597-6\" pgmap=\"597\">Mr. Justice Wiitdes</author> <p id=\"A_J\" pgmap=\"597\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b597-7\" pgmap=\"597\">From the statement of facts preceding this opinion it appears that the tenancy of appellee was, at most, a monthly tenancy at $40 per month as rent, without any other agreement between it and appellant as to when .the rent was payable. The first rent was paid on September 1, 1896, which was for a part of the month of July, and for the months of August and September, 1896. Appellee went into possession on the 20th of July, 1896. Bent for the month of October, 1896, was paid on October 5, 1896. The written lease which was prepared by appellant and left with the officers of appellee, was not signed, nor does it appear that any of its terms were assented to by appellee. Under such circumstances, and in view of the manner in which the rent was paid, it can not be said that any time was agreed upon as to when the rent was due, except that it was to be paid monthly.</p> <p id=\"b597-8\" pgmap=\"597\">When there is no agreement that monthly rent shall be paid in advance, it is not due until the end of the month. Wood\u2019s Landlord &amp; Tenant, Sec. 450, Taylor\u2019s Landlord &amp; &amp; Tenant, Vol. 1, Sec. 391; Dixon v. Nicolls, 39 Ill. 372.</p> <p id=\"b597-9\" pgmap=\"597\">The rent for the whole of the month of October having been paid, there was no rent due to appellant on the 2d day of \u00a1November, 1896, when it distrained. It follows that the judgment in the distress case was correct.</p> <p id=\"b597-10\" pgmap=\"597\">The evidence shows no right of appellant to retain the property replevied except by virtue of the distress. The right of distress failing, for the reason that no rent was due, it follows that the judgment in the replevin suit was also correct.</p> <p id=\"b598-5\" pgmap=\"598\">If we are correct in the foregoing conclusions, it is unnecessary for us to consider in this opinion, and we do not therefore refer to, the several contentions and authorities cited by appellant\u2019s counsel.</p> <p id=\"b598-6\" pgmap=\"598\">The judgments of \"the Superior Court are therefore affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
