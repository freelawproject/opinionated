A replication was filed to this answer.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-4\" pgmap=\"485\">The question presented by the pleadings was whether or not the deed of conveyance from appellant to appellee was intended as an absolute conveyance, or merely a mortgage to secure a debt.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\" pgmap=\"485\">The evidence discloses that prior to September 4, 1897, appellant owned the premises in question, consisting of 100 feet of land and a small cottage; that the property was incumbered by a first mortgage for $2,500, and a second mortgage for $249.33, and that there were several special assessments due, amounting to about $250. The mortgage indebtedness was about to become due. Appellant was anxious to obtain a new and larger loan, to enable her to pay off all these various indebtednesses. To that end she applied through her agent, E. A. Birch, to the agents for the first mortgage. They refused to renew their loan of $2,500 for the increased amount, viz., $3,000, but were willing to renew it for $2,500. She then sought a loan of $500 upon a second mortgage, with which she might pay off the second mortgage of $249.23 and the $250 of assessments. Birch, her agent, took her to appellee, who had at some time sustained the relation of a business partner to Birch. As to what occurred between appellant and appellee, in the transactions following upon the application for a loan of $500, is a matter of conflict in the evidence. Birch has since died. Appellant tells one story and appellee another. Neither is corroborated, except by the facts and circumstances of and following the transaction.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\" pgmap=\"485(67) 486(84)\">A warranty deed, absolute in form, was made by appellant to appellee, conveying the land, subject to the $2,500 and the $249.23 mortgages, and also subject to all taxes of 1897 and thereafter. The expressed condition of the deed was $3,250. No money was paid by appellee to appellant, save $500, which was delivered to her agent, Birch, and expended largely upon the property conveyed. Appellee testified that the money was expended as follows: $125 paid upon first mortgage; $260.48 paid upon taxes; $15 paid upon second loan; $99.52 paid as commissions on extension of loan. Of the money paid for taxes, all except $65.26 was paid for taxes upon the property in question. The first mortgage was extended. It was arranged to extend the second mortgage of $249.23 for one year. At the time of the execution of the warranty deed there were also executed the following other instruments:</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\" pgmap=\"486\">\u201c Chicago, Illinois, Sept. 1, 1897.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\" pgmap=\"486\">J.

Benniitt.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\" pgmap=\"487\">There was also then executed a lease made by appellee as lessor, to appellant and her son as lessees, purporting to demise the premises in question for eight months from September 1, 1897, at a monthly rental of three dollars, payable in advance at office of E. A. Birch &amp; Co.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-12\" pgmap=\"487\">All the arrangements for the extension of the two mortgages were made by the appellant, partly before and partly after the agreement between appellant and appellee was entered, into. Appellee testified :</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-13\" pgmap=\"487(42) 488(127)\">\u201c At the date this warranty deed attached to the bill of complaint was executed, I told Mrs. Bubo if it was executed and the contract, and they got the extension of those loans, that I would buy the property with $2,749.27, about $2,750, against it\u2014that was the amount of the mortgages\u2014and pay her $500 for it, and give her an option to purchase it within one year for $1,000. She said she thought she could sell it for $4,500 or $5,000. I didn\u2019t think she could. She said they had arranged with the loan people for the first loan. The second loan, I believe, at that time had not been arranged for, and thought the_y could get Mr. Haskamp. I believe he was a friend of Mrs. Rubo, or an acquaintance of her husband, living at Evanston. Mr. Birch said he would talk to him and get that extended. Those papers were executed with the understanding that that should be done, and it was afterward done.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\" pgmap=\"488\">After the executing of the deed and other papers the following transactions and circumstances occurred relating to the matter in question: Appellant obtained extension of the second mortgage of $249.23. Appellant remained, and ever since has been, in possession of the premises. Mo rent has been paid by her and no rent'demanded by appellee. After the making of the deed on September 4, 1897, appellant executed extension notes for the first mortgage loan, and paid two of such notes, amounting to $75 each, in the year 1898. On August 22, 1898, she paid the taxes of 1898 upon the property, amounting to $63.08. She also made repairs and paid for insurance upon the cottage.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\" pgmap=\"488\">Evidence as to value of the premises is conflicting. The estimates of experts called as witnesses vary from $35 to $60 per front foot. The agent of the first mortgagee estimated the value in making the loan at $5,000 for the land and $700 for the cottage. Appellee also paid some interest on the mortgage loans after September 4, 1897, the date of the warranty deed, the amount so paid by him being $87.50. He testified that he had not paid the other interest after receiving the deed because \u201c it was paid each time when I got there,\u201d and that he believed that Mrs. Rubo (appellant) had paid it. In September or October, 1898, appellee bought the second mortgage notes, amounting then to $240 and some interest, and he testified that he now holds them for his wife\u2019s mother, with whose money he claims to have bought the notes.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-3\" pgmap=\"489\">The evidence as to the conversation between the parties, at the time of the execution of the deed and other papers, is limited to the testimony of appellant and appellee. Appellant testified:</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-4\" pgmap=\"489\">\u201c Afterward I met him when I was trying to get a loan. I went to Mr. Birch and he told Mr. Bennett to let me have it\u2014$500. I went back and forward with Mr. Birch to Mr. Bennett\u2019s office, and at last he said : \u2018 I think I can let you have \u2014\u2014.\u2019 He came again to my place. He said, I think he will let you have $1,000; he said I should go to Mr. Bennett\u2019s office to receive it. My taxes were due and a mortgage was near due. I took my tax book along; I thought when I received the money I would pay my taxes right away. So Mr. Birch, when I got there\u2014\u00cd don\u2019t know exactly the date\u2014the first time I was there, I guess, was the 4th of September, 1897.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\" pgmap=\"489\">\u201c Mr. Birch wasn\u2019t there. As I came in Mr. Bennett asked, me if I knew what I was there for. I said Mr. Birch told me he intended to let me have $1,000. He says,6Well, if you don\u2019t understand it, 1 want nothing to do with you.\u2019 He knew my taxes were due and everything else, and that I was looking for money. He said I ought to have somebody there to attend to it. I says, I thought I had Mr. Birch there to attend to it; to get the money for me. Finally he told me how he would do; he would lend me $500 for one year, and instead of $500, I should pay him $1,000 back. \u201d* * * I signed the papers that he had drawn up for the money.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\" pgmap=\"489\">And further, upon cross-examination:</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\" pgmap=\"489\">\u201c In place of $500 I wanted $1,000; he wanted $500. He said he would lend me $500 and in place I should give him $500; he wanted $1,000 back in one year. I was saying that was too much. He said .it wasn\u2019t too much, because he would be responsible for what came in; that I wouldn\u2019t pay the taxes there or anything; he would pay that.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\" pgmap=\"489\">\u201c What did you say then % A. I thought it wasn\u2019t so very much, if he would pay that up for me. I thought it wouldn\u2019t come so very high, but there was nothing paid, that was all he said; he said he wouldn\u2019t do more than that, and that Mr. Birch should get those papers to rent the place, and the money should go for the interest, and he should save the money for me\u2014Mr. Birch should. Mr. Bennett told him so at \"the same time. I guess that is all that was said there.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">\u201c Q. Why did you think it was necessary for you to make this arrangement with Mr. Bennett at this time ? A. I wanted to pay my taxes, and this interest renewed\u2014this mortgage renewed.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">\u201cI have heard the testimony of Mr. Bennett. Mr. Bennett, in conversation with me at the time the deed was signed, did not ever say to me that he was going to buy the property. The word \u2018buy\u2019 was not used in that conversation.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490\">Appellee testified :</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\" pgmap=\"490\">\u201c When she first came to my office in 1897, relating to the transaction in question in this suit, she said in reference to the deal, \u2018You know my property on Maple avenue is encumbered and the encumbrance is nearly due, and my taxes are nearly due, * * * and I have got to do something about the property or the mortgage will be foreclosed.\u2019 Previous to that time I had learned that this property was encumbered; I knew it at that time. She said she had attempted to make loans, * * * and that they wouldn't make her a new loan, and she wanted me to help her out on her encumbrance. She would like to make a loan of money, a third loan of money, until such time as she could sell the property. I told her the property was encumbered nearly all it was worth, being then encumbered for something like $3,100, and that I wouldn\u2019t consider a loan under any circumstances. The loan was previously spoken of, and I had answered it in one word that I wouldn\u2019t contemplate the subject for a minute\u2014for a third loan, all of them due and the taxes due, and a tax sale about to start. ..</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-9\" pgmap=\"490(167) 491(23)\">\u201c Those things were all talked over. We talked of how much the encumbrance was in a general way; we couldn\u2019t get at the exact figures; we couldn\u2019t get at the taxes and assessments, and 1 didn\u2019t know how much the interest on the first mortgage was; I think it was stated to be $87.50, which it afterwards proved to be. There had to be an extension of the loan and the commissions would carry the encumbrance up to what I considered the value of the property. She said she was going to lose it, because if the mortgage was foreclosed she could not afford to redeem it; she hadn\u2019t the money. Mr. Birch, who was with her, told me he had been her agent for several years. I said I th ought the property was encumbered for nearly all it was worth, and I didn\u2019t want to bother with it. She asked me if I could possibly do something to help her out until she could get a chance to sell it. She said it would be a great favor. I think the woman almost wept. * * *</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-4\" pgmap=\"491\">\u201c Q. After this conversation did you say to Mrs. Eubo that you would put a second mortgage on the property'?</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">\u201cA. I did not. * * * I often stepped into Mr. Birch\u2019s office, and she was frequently there. I saw her several times. I don\u2019t know whether between these dates or not. I don\u2019t really remember the exact date this deal was made and the papers drawn up, but I think the 4th of September, 1897. I don\u2019t remember the exact date. The date is on that deed.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\" pgmap=\"491(385) 492(25)\">\u201c Q. State what took place at any other conversation relating to this transaction on the 4th of September, 1897, when the deed attached to the bill of complaint was executed by Mrs. Eubo ? A. I was sitting at my desk when Mrs. Eubo came in. She said, \u2018Is Mr. Birch here?\u2019 I said, \u2018Ho.\u2019 She said, \u2018He made an appointment to meet me here this morning.\u2019 She said she was anxious to see him. She waited, 1 guess, twenty minutes or fifteen minutes, and she said she was anxious to go and would like to sign the papers and go, and not wait for Mr. Birch, because he might not come. I had in the meantime told Mr. Birch that I would purchase it for $500. Mr. Birch had evidently told her and she came in. I had drawn up the deed and contract in evidence here and she said she wanted to sign it. I had the stenographer come in and read the contract to her. This document now shown is the contract, to the best of my knowledge and belief. I saw Mrs.Eubo sign it in September, 1897. It was read to her before she signed it. At the date this warranty deed attached to the bill of complaint was executed, I told Mrs. Eubo if the deed was executed and the contract, and they got the extension of those loans, that I would buy it with the $2,749.27, about $2,750, against it\u2014that was the amount of the mortgages\u2014and pay her $500 for it, and give her an option to purchase it within one year for $1,000. She said' see thought she could sell it for $4,500 or $5,000. I didn\u2019t think she could. She said they had arranged with the loan people for the first loan; the second loan I believe at that time had not been arranged for. * * * 1 told her I cared nothing about the property in the matter of rents as long as she intended to take advantage of the option. She said she would like to have her son live in it. I said, \u2018You and Mr. Birch take care of the property and get all you can out of it, and pay it on the taxes; I have nothing to do with it until you have either bought it or get out of it under that agreement.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what she said about it.\u201d ;</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\" pgmap=\"492\">The trial court, after hearing in open court, upon bill, answer and replication, entered a decree dismissing the bill for want of equity.</p><attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-6\" pgmap=\"492\">Dennis &amp; Rigby, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-7\" pgmap=\"492\">The line between mortgages and conditional sales is very narrow; the decision of the question usually depends not alone or even chiefly on the form of the document or the express declaration of the parties, but rather on the circumstances surrounding the entire transaction; in other words, it -is a question of intention, and the intention of the parties must be gathered rather from their acts and circumstances than from express declarations. Miller v. Thomas, 14 Ill. 428, 430; Bearss v. Ford, 108 Ill. 16, 23; Workman v. Greening, 115 Ill. 477, 479, 480; Peugh v. Davis, 96 U. S. 332, 336, 338, 24 L. Ed. 775; Montgomery v.

A. 58.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\" pgmap=\"492\">The question being really whether a debt was created or not, and being one of intention, as stated above, the following indicia of intention have been held important as pointing to the existence of debt, and thus that the transaction was in the nature of a mortgage.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\" pgmap=\"492\">First. That interest or an increased consideration was to be paid to the grantee for the use of his money. 15 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 781.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-10\" pgmap=\"492\">Second. That there had been, when the deed was executed, negotiations pending for a loan. Horn v. Keteltas, 46 N. Y. 605; Fiedler v. Darrin, 50 N. Y. 438, 442; Davis v. Demming, 12 W. Va. 246, 283.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-11\" pgmap=\"492\">Third. That the parties by their acts did not treat it as a sale, but the grantor remained in possession as. owner. Clark v. Finlon, 90 Ill. 245, 246, 247.</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-12\" pgmap=\"492\">Fourth. The character of the transaction must be determined by what it was at its inception. \u201c Once a mortgage always a mortgage.\u201d 15 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 782.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-13\" pgmap=\"492(8) 493(22)\">Fifth. Inadequacy of consideration is a valuable, though not conclusive evidence of mortgage. Perce v. Robertson, 13 Cal. 116; Morris v. Nixon, 42 U. S. 118; 11 L. Ed. 69.</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\">Sixth. Mrs. Eubo\u2019s own valuation is important upon the question of intention, as proving that she never would have consented to a sale upon the terms of the one claimed by Bennett to have been made. Jasper v. Hazen, 4 No. Dak. 1; 23 L. R. A. 58, 65.</p><p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\" pgmap=\"493\">Seventh. The acts of the parties after the execution of the deed are important as showing their understanding of the transaction immediately after its conclusion. Jasper v. Hazen, supra, 4 No. Dak. 1; 23 L.

Pbesiding- Justice Seabs</author> <p id=\"AoA\" pgmap=\"494\">delivered the- opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b494-7\" pgmap=\"494\">But one question is presented upon this appeal, viz.: whether, upon all the evidence, the deed in question, though absolute in its form, should be held' to be in fact a mortgage. The statute, section 12, chapter 95, Revised Statutes, provides that \u201c every deed conveying real estate, which shall appear to have been intended only as a security in the nature of a mortgage, though it be an absolute conveyance in terms, shall be considered as a mortgage.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">The decisions of our Supreme Court are uniform in holding that where it clearly appears from the evidehce that the parties to a deed absolute in form have intended that it should operate as a mortgage only, to secure a debt, then the courts should hold it to be in effect a mortgage. Miller v. Thomas, 14 Ill. 428; Smith v. Cremer, 71 Ill. 185; Heald v. Wright, 75 Ill. 17; Clark v. Finlon, 90 Ill. 245; Bearss v. Ford, 108 Ill. 16.</p> <p id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">And there is a long line of decisions, from Pitts v. Cobb, 44 Ill. 103, to Story v. Springer, 155 Ill. 25, in which, while it has been held that under the peculiar facts presented in the respective cases the deed should be held to be absolute in its effect according to its terms, yet the well established rule is not departed from, but asserted\u2014-that if it appear clearly and from satisfactory evidence that the intention of the parties was that the deed should have the effect of a mortgage only, that intention Avill be carried out by the courts.</p> <p id=\"b494-10\" pgmap=\"494\">It is also held that a deed absolute in its terms should not be given a different effect unless the evidence is clear and satisfactory to Avarrant it.</p> <p id=\"b494-11\" pgmap=\"494(10) 495(123)\">The rule of law governing is well settled. The question presented and determinative of the case is one of fact only. The weight accorded to the findings of fact by the trial judge, who has seen and heard the witnesses, is also to be considered in passing upon the question here presented. With due consideration for this, we have examined the evidence in the case with great care, and from it all we are compelled to reach a conclusion different from that of the learned chancellor who entered the decree. It is true that there are but two witnesses to the controlling facts; but one of them has testified to a state of facts inherently improbable, and the other is corroborated by all the surrounding and subsequent circumstances of the transaction.</p> <p id=\"b495-4\" pgmap=\"495\">If the account of the transaction given by appellee is true, then this woman has deeded to him her property, worth at the least estimate of the witnesses, $4,200, and at the highest estimate $6,700, subject to $2,750 of indebtedness, for the sole consideration of $500, which sum of $500 and nearly a hundred dollars additional, the vendor at once proceeded, under agreement with appellee, the purchaser, to expend upon the property which she had sold.</p> <p id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495\">Mere inadequacy of price is not alone good ground for holding this deed to be a mortgage. Story v. Springer, 155 Ill. 25. But where no consideration whatever moves to the grantor, except money advanced to be expended upon the land, it is a fact tending very strongly to show that there was no sale.</p> <p id=\"b495-6\" pgmap=\"495(120) 496(125)\">Aside from the matter' of adequacy of consideration for the deed, all the circumstances surrounding the transaction and the conduct of the parties subsequent thereto, lead to the conclusion that the parties intended the deed as security for the repayment of the $500 expended upon the land by appellee, together with an additional $500 for forbearance money. The undisputed evidence shows that at the time of the negotiations appellant was seeking a loan, not a purchaser; that she valued the land at much more than the sum made up by the $500 and the encumbrances, and, according to appellee\u2019s own statement, still expected to realize such sum by a sale in the future; that appellee said to her that he cared nothing about the property in the matter of rents as long as she intended to take advantage of the option; and that he had nothing to do with the property until she should either \u201c have bought it or got out of it under that agreement;\u201d that appellant obtained the extension of mortgages after the alleged sale and executed interest notes thereon; that she paid certain of these notes, and that she paid for insurance and taxes. We are inclined to think that appellee, while exercising his skill as a lawyer to give the transaction all the indicia of an absolute sale, yet did not himself regard it as constituting anything but security. In his examination as a witness, the following occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">\u201cQ. You wanted $500 for the use of your $500 for a year, is that the idea %' A. Ho, assuming the risk.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b496-6\" pgmap=\"496\">All of these admitted facts are wholly inconsistent with the theory that appellant had parted with, and appellee had acquired, both the legal and equitable ownership of the \u2022land. It is clear that, according to the ostensible transaction, the mortgages were assumed by appellee as part of the purchase money. The amount of the mortgages and the $500 together make $3,200, the expressed consideration of the deed. If the transactions were in reality a sale, appellee and not appellant thereafter bore the obligation to pay these mortgages and the interest notes for interest thereon. Such would be the obligation arising, as a matter of law, from the mortgage indebtedness being treated as a part of the consideration. And as a matter of fact, appellee testifies that he did assume these mortgages. In answer to the question, \u201c What is the amount you assumed ? \u201d he testified \u201c $2,745.27.\u201d And yet appellant proceeds thereafter, with the apparent acquiescence of appellee, to care for the extension and payment of interest upon this indebtedness assumed by appellee.</p> <p id=\"b496-7\" pgmap=\"496\">The testimony of appellee, that an absolute sale was intended, is, as we view it in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, incredible.</p> <p id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496(23) 497(24)\">If the testimony of appellant be taken as true, as we think it should be in view of all the facts and circumstances proved, then appellee could have enforced the payment of his loan of $500 (without the usurious interest contended for) in an action at law.</p> <p id=\"b497-4\" pgmap=\"497\">While, perhaps, no one of these facts, inconsistent with the theory of an absolute sale, would be sufficient of itself to constitute the clear and satisfactory showing which the law requires, yet each is entitled to consideration, and together they present a strong case.</p> <p id=\"b497-5\" pgmap=\"497\">The fact that negotiations for a loan were pending when the deed was made, is to be considered. Fiedler v. Darrin, 50 N. Y. 437; Morris v. Nixon, 1 How. 118; Davis v. Demming, 12 W. Va. 246.</p> <p id=\"b497-6\" pgmap=\"497\">The fact that the grantee retained possession of the premises is to be considered. Clark v. Finlon, supra.</p> <p id=\"b497-7\" pgmap=\"497\">We do not regard the existence of a lease, which neither party ever treated as operative, as affecting the fact of possession by appellant.</p> <p id=\"b497-8\" pgmap=\"497\">The circumstances of appellee leaving appellant to bear the burden of loan extensions, interest payments and insurance, are all entitled to consideration. Miller v. Thomas, supra, wherein the court said: \u201c In cases of this sort the real character of the arrangement may as often be gathered from the nature of the transaction and character of the circumstances as from the express declaration of the parties.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b497-10\" pgmap=\"497\">Inadequacy of consideration, though not alone controlling, is to be considered. Story v. Springer, supra.</p> <p id=\"b497-11\" pgmap=\"497\">And in case of doubt existing from all the surrounding circumstances, a court of equity will lean to the holding that it is a mortgage rather than a sale. Conway v. Alexander, 7 Cranch, 218.</p> <p id=\"b497-12\" pgmap=\"497\">In that case it was held that the facts established an absolute sale; but the court held, as a rule applicable to the determination, that \u201c the want of a covenant to repay the money is not complete evidence that a conditional sale was intended,\u201d and \u201c doubtful cases have generally been decided to be mortgages.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b497-13\" pgmap=\"497(11) 498(14)\">The decision in Clark v. Finlon, supra, is very much in point, and also the decision in Jasper v. Hazen, 23 L. R. A. 58.</p> <p id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">While each case of this class, where it is attempted to be established that a deed absolute in form is in reality only a mortgage, must of necessity be determined by the facts of the individual case, measured by the rule of law that th\u00bf evidence must be clear and satisfactory to warrant a court in holding the facts established, yet the cases above cited are enough alike in the facts presented, to be especially applicable to the case here considered.</p> <p id=\"b498-6\" pgmap=\"498\">We hold, therefore, that the findings and decree of the trial court are manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b498-7\" pgmap=\"498\">The decree is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
