Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we previously vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Bonilla (\u201cBonilla </em>7\u201d), 137 Fed.Appx. 240 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). After a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>sentencing hearing, at which the district court heard argument on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed the same sentence, which was at the lowest end of the Guidelines range Bonilla faced. In this appeal, Bonilla again challenges his 108-month sentence for possessing with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1903(a),(g) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii), and conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.CApp. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). On appeal, Bon-illa argues that: (1) his sentence was unreasonable, and (2) the district court\u2019s statement of reasons under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) was inadequate. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), after members of the United States Coast Guard intercepted two go-fast vessels, the occupants of which were seen dumping bales of suspected contraband overboard, the Coast Guard fired warning shots and signaled for the go-fast vessels to stop. One of the boats complied. The Coast Guard then approached the other go-fast vessel, which had become disabled, and observed four men in the water approximately 25 yards from the disabled vessel. The crew members had covered themselves and the boat in gasoline. The Coast Guard removed the four men from the water, one of whom was Bonilla, and retrieved from the water 44 bales of cocaine weighing a total of 1100 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">Bonilla was the owner and captain of the second go-fast boat. In a post-arrest statement, Bonilla stated that he and the crew had been fishing, but did not have drugs on the vessel, and had jumped in the water after the Coast Guard shot at them. Bonilla also stated that he had no knowledge concerning the other go-fast vessel. Later, however, Bonilla agreed to the facts as outlined in the indictment and the Notice of Filing Factual Basis for Plea, and accepted responsibility for his involvement. He also cooperated with the government in connection with its cases against six co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">The PSI recommended a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), which is applicable to a defendant convicted of a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1), based on the 1100 kilograms of cocaine the crewmen were transporting. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (Nov.2003) (assigning base offense level of 38 where quantity of cocaine is 150 kilograms or more). The PSI recommended the following adjustments: (1) a two-level upward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(2)(B), because Bonilla was the captain of the vessel; (2) a two-level safety-valve reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6); and (3) a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a criminal history category I and an adjusted offense level of 35, Bonilla faced a Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the initial sentencing hearing, the government moved for a substantial-assistance departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, based on Bonilla\u2019s cooperation and assistance in the government\u2019s prosecution of six co-defendants. After the district court granted a four-level departure, Bonilla faced a Guidelines range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on an adjusted offense level of 31 and a criminal history category I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">The district court imposed concurrent 108-month terms of imprisonment, followed by four years of supervised release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>After sentencing Bonilla, in anticipation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court proposed, an alternate sentence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWJ\">It is unlikely that I would have given a sentence exactly equal to that of the sentencing guidelines, but ... the closest I might have come in light of [Bonil-la\u2019s] cooperation would have been 96, which would be eight years in light of his cooperation and his family obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-5\">So if I were sentencing him, I would have sentenced him to 96 months, subject always to the realization that since we don\u2019t know how we\u2019re sentencing, neither of you perhaps is as vigorous in trying to influence that sentence, you\u2019ve not made as complete a case as you would have, had we known for sure what law would ultimately govern Mr. Bonil-la\u2019s sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">In <em>Bonilla I, </em>we vacated and remanded Bonilla\u2019s sentence after finding <em>Booker </em>constitutional error based on the district court\u2019s suggestion that it would have sentenced Bonilla differently if it had not been confined to the Guidelines range. In our remand opinion, we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6I5\">the district court correctly determined the Guidelines range for Bonilla\u2019s conviction. We have considered Bonilla\u2019s challenge to the two-level enhancement for his role in the offense, and note that the district court did not err factually by applying the enhancement based on its conclusion that he was captain of the vessel that was transporting the cocaine. On remand, pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>the district court is required to sentence Bonil-la under an advisory Guidelines scheme, and, in so doing, must consider the Guidelines range and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, <em>see </em>[18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\"><em>Bonilla I, </em>137 Fed.Appx. at 242 n. 1 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">At Bonilla\u2019s resentencing \u2022 hearing, the court reviewed with Bonilla the two counts to which he pled guilty and stated that it would determine a sentence in accordance with the advisory Guidelines scheme and <em>Booker. </em>The district court invited \u201ccounsel for the United States and the defense to call to [its] attention any matter under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 or otherwise that ought to be considered in arriving at a final and reasonable sentence.\u201d Neither side had any objections to the PSI\u2019s factual statements, which the district court adopted. Bonilla then restated his objection to the two-level enhancement for his status as the captain on the boat, arguing that his conduct in steering and owning the vessel was not enough to qualify him for the enhancement. He also pointed to the following factors in support of a lower sentence: (1) he was willing to provide additional assistance to the government, but his imprisonment at Fort Dix for two years had prevented him from doing so, and he had no more information to offer; and (2) while in prison, he had attempted to take advantage of classes and benefits available to him, including English classes, but had been unable to do so due to overcrowding. The government resubmitted its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and requested that the court follow its actions from the first sentencing hearing and grant a four-level departure. The government also argued that Bonilla\u2019s 108-month sentence was fair in light of the significantly higher sentences his co-defendants had received. The government urged that the sentence adequately reflected credit for Bonilla\u2019s assistance to the government and met the \u00a7 3553 factors, and that a lower sentence would be a \u201cwindfall\u201d for Bonilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">The district court overruled Bonilla\u2019s objection to the 2D1.1(b)(2)(B) enhancement and granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>downward departure motion, thereby decreasing Bonilla\u2019s offense level by four levels. The court then stated that pursuant to the Guidelines and <em>Booker, </em>Bonilla would be re-sentenced at the bottom of the range to 108-months\u2019 imprisonment as to both counts, to run concurrently, followed by four years of supervised release. The court also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-4\">I am satisfied that this sentence is consistent not only with the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s announced policies and guidelines, but that it accords with the array of factors specified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and adequately reflects the seriousness of the offense, being neither \u2014 the sentence being neither greater nor lesser than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">Bonilla challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that: (1) the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a); (2) he played a limited role in the offense, as a pilot for the go-fast vessel, and was compensated only $3,000 for his participation; and (3) he was a first-time, non-violent offender. Bonilla also argues that his 108-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court suggested at his initial sentencing hearing that a 96-month sentence would have been imposed if the Guidelines had not been in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentence, imposed after consulting the Guidelines and considering the factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a), for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264-65, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). Some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential\u201d and focuses on whether the sentence imposed fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, we recognize that a range of reasonable sentences exists from which the district court may choose. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">Prior to imposing sentence, the district court heard Bonilla\u2019s mitigating circumstances and considered his apology. These items all concerned \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(1). In imposing sentence, the district court expressly noted the seriousness of the offense, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2) (discussing factors including the need for the sentence imposed \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense\u201d). Finally, the parties\u2019 arguments and the PSI\u2019s calculations outlined \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d as discussed in \u00a7 3553(a)(3), and the government noted that Bonilla was receiving a much lower sentence than his co-defendants had, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6) (enumerating need to avoid sentencing disparity). In short, we cannot say that Bonilla\u2019s sentence is outside the range of reasonable sentences from which the district court could choose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>the imposition of Bonilla\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of several of the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a), including the advisory Guidelines range, Bonilla\u2019s sentence is reasonable. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">We likewise are unpersuaded by Bonilla\u2019s suggestion that the district court\u2019s statement of reasons for its sentence was deficient under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question of whether a district court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>even if the defendant did not object below. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), a district court is required to state, in open court, the reason for its particular sentence, and if the sentence \u201cis of the kind, and within the range [recommended by the Guidelines] and that range exceeds 24 months, the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1); <em>Williams, </em>438 F.3d at 1274. Based on our careful review of the record, with particular attention to the sentencing transcripts and the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we are satisfied the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence complied with the requirements of \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">The district court gave the parties the opportunity to make arguments on any \u00a7 3553(a) factors implicated in the case and heard Bonilla\u2019s statement of remorse. In imposing a sentence at the lowest end of the Guidelines range Bonilla faced, the district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-10\">I am satisfied that this sentence is consistent not only with the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s announced policies and guidelines, but that it accords with the array of factors specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and adequately reflects the seriousness of the offense, ... the sentence being neither greater nor lesser than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-11\">As we held prior to <em>Booker, </em>\u201ca sentencing court should \u2014 when stating its reasons for imposing a particular sentence as required by \u00a7 3553(c) \u2014 tailor its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate, given the factors to be considered as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1572 (11th Cir.1990). Thus, both before and after <em>Booker, </em>we have disapproved the imposition of sentences with no consideration or mention of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Williams, </em>438 F.3d at 1274 (vacating and remanding sentence for compliance with \u00a7 3553(c)(1), based on district court\u2019s failure to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>any reason for life sentence); <em>Veteto, </em>920 F.2d at 824, 826-27 (remanding for compliance with \u00a7 3553(c)(1) because the trial court explained its sentence with the \u201ctruism\u201d that the chosen punishment \u201cseemfed] right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-3\">However, the requirement of \u00a7 3553(c)(1) \u201cdoes not mean that a sentencing court must incant the specific language used in the guidelines which applies to each reason given, nor does it mean that a court must state that a particular factor is not applicable in a particular case.\u201d <em>Parrado, </em>911 F.2d at 1572 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, <em>nothing </em>in this Circuit\u2019s precedent or <em>Booker </em>requires the district court, in its explanation of sentence under \u00a7 3553(c)(1), to articulate its consideration of each individual \u00a7 3553(a) factor, particularly where, as here, it is <em>obvious </em>the court considered many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 again, these factors included the circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, \u00a7 3553(a)(1); the seriousness of the offense, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); the kinds of sentences available, \u00a7 3553(a)(3); and the need to avoid sentencing disparity, \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>See Parrado, </em>911 F.2d at 1573 (holding that district court adequately explained reasons for imposing life sentence and concluding, based on review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing, that \u201cwhat transpired, taken together with the court\u2019s closing remarks noted above, provides a sufficient statement of the court\u2019s reasons for imposing a sentence at the top end of the range\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Wivell, </em>893 F.2d 156, 158 (8th Cir.1990) (record of entire sentencing hearing considered in evaluating district court\u2019s reasons for imposing particular sentence; reviewing court will not rely exclusively upon court\u2019s summary statement at close of sentencing hearing))); <em>cf. United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (holding, in connection with challenge to reasonableness of sentence, that district court\u2019s statement that it had considered defendant\u2019s sentencing arguments and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) \u201calone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Simply put, we can discern no error in the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasoning for imposing Bonilla\u2019s low-end sentence, nor can we find anything unreasonable in the imposition of a 108-month sentence for this drug conspiracy involving some 1100 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">. The fact that the district court suggested a 96-month sentence as an alternative at the first sentencing hearing is irrelevant in assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>ing the reasonableness of Bonilla\u2019s sentence because in <em>Bonilla I, </em>we vacated the district court's initial sentence and any reasoning behind that sentence and directed the district court to resentence Bonilla.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2), which concerns an explanation of reasons for a departure from the Guidelines, the court is required to give \"the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). Since Bonilla was sentenced <em>within </em>his Guidelines range and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) clearly requires an explanation of reasons for a <em>departure </em>from the guidelines, \u00a7 3553(c)(2) is inapplicable to Bonilla\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">. In <em>Williams, </em>we rejected the government\u2019s argument that by not objecting in the district court, a defendant abandons his claim under \u00a7 3553(c)(1) and our standard of review is for plain error only. We cited our <em>pre-Booker </em>decision in <em>United States v. Veteto, </em>920 F.2d 823, 826 (11th Cir.1991): \u201cCongress has specifically proclaimed that a sentencing court shall state 'the reason for imposing a sentence [exceeding 24 months] at a particular point within the range.' ... When a sentencing court fails to comply with this requirement, the sentence is imposed in violation of law ....\" <em>Williams, </em>438 F.3d at 1274 (quoting <em>Veteto, </em>920 F.2d at 826) (alterations in original) (emphasis removed).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
