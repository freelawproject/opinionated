S. Ruthven purchased the same of Lewis Hetzler, and took the deed in blank, for convenience in making a transfer of the same, and sold the said land to your petitioner, and delivered the said deed to him, with like instructions to fill up the same with his name or any other he might sell to ;\u2019\u2019 that defendant was solvent when so employed, but had since become insolvent; that defendant had not sold said land, and plaintiff feared, if he should sell said land, he, plaintiff, would not be able to obtain the purchase money from him ; that plaintiff had demanded said deed from defendant, and he refused to return it.

It was not his paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">A deed delivered to another, with instructions to sell and fill up the grantee\u2019s name, when such sale and delivery was made, would be valid.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b381-7\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXs\">It is objected to the judgment, that the plaintiff has shown no cause of action, because it appears by his averments, that the deed was left blank as to the name of the grantee. In Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, it is said, \u201c If a blank piece of paper be. signed, sealed and delivered, and afterwards an instrument be written over the signature, it is no deed, as there was nothing of substance in it. But a deed executed with blanks, and after-wards filled up and delivered by the agent of the party, is good. The blanks must not, however, be filled up after the acknowledgment.\u201d (4 Bacon, Abr. 212.) Whether the deed, upon the filling of the blank with the name of the grantee, would have been valid as a deed or not, it was of value to the plaintiff. For if so filled up and afterwards acknowledged by the grantor, it would have been good. And in a suit for specific performance by the plaintiff against his grantor, it would be admissible evidence of the contract of sale, though not operative as a deed. (Miller v. Alexander, 8 Tex. R. 36.) Upon proof of payment of the purchase money, and that the instrument was delivered to evidence a transfer of the title; with authority to fill the blank with the name of the grantee, the Court would decree a\u201d title. We are of opinion that the action was well maintained, (1 Wils. 106; 2 T. R. 708; 1 Bing. 45; 4 Taunt. 865; 16 Vermont, 697,) and that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
