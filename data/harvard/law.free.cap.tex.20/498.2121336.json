The State.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b506-5\">Where the bond was for appearance to answer a charge of \u201c betting at a game called Faro,\u201d and the <em>scire facias </em>recited the forfeiture of a bond to answer a charge of \u201c playing cards for money,\u201d and judgment went by default, it was held, on appeal, that the variance was fatal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b506-6\">A recital in the entry of final judgment, without a jury, on <em>scire facias, </em>on a forfeited recognizance, after default day, that the attorney for the defendant \u201cis allowed to file an answer,\u201d without reciting that the defendant came in person or by attorney, and no answer appearing in the transcript, does not import an appearance by the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">Appeal from Guadalupe. The transcript did not state who presided in the Court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">The bond was for the appearance of Henry Trammell to answer an indictment for \u201c betting at a game called Faro.\u201d <em>Scire facias </em>for Trammell returned not found. The <em>scire facias </em>for Bailes, the surety, recited the forfeiture of a bond for the appearance of Trammell to answer an indictment for \u201cplaying cards for money;\u201d returned served. The entry of final judgment, commenced as follows: The attorney for the security, Bailes, is allowed to file answer, and on motion of the District Attorney the cause is dismissed as to defendant Trammell, and judgment final asked against his surety Bailes. It is therefore considered, &amp;c.; judgment against Bailes for $200, the amount of the bond. The Court commenced on the 3d of November and this entry was made on the 11th.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-9\"><em>J. Ireland, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJM\">The variance between the bond and <em>scire facias </em>is fatal. (Dangerfield v. The State, 4 How. Miss. R. 658.) Besides, \u201c playing cards for money\u201d is no offence, without statement of place.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-10\"><em>Attorney- General, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIT\">Though the <em>scire facias </em>may have been defective, it was cured by the appearance of the party, and the leave obtained to answer. His answer does not appear in the record, but this cannot alter the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0qq\">There manifestly is a fatal variance between the recognizance and <em>scire facias </em>as respects the offence. And we do not think the recital in the entry of judgment sufficient to warrant the Court in holding the objection to have been waived, when it nowhere appears that the defendant was in Court, or that he was represented by any attorney, who undertook to appear and make defence for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
