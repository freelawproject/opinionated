Sloan, to set aside an order of the County Court granting an allowance for a year\u2019s support, to said minors, out of the estate of said Thomas E. Sloan, their father.

Dig. Art. 1153) is too plain and explicit to admit of doubt or question. It declares that when the widow and children have separate property adequate to their maintenance, the allowance provided for that purpose shall not be made. The present was a case plainly within the prohibition. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
