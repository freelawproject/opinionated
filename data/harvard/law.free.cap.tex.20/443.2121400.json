Both parties claimed under Edward Hughart, to whom the land was originally granted June 19th, 1832. The plaintiff gave in evidence a deed from said Hughart to himself, bearing date 30th June, 1840, and \u201c duly proven and recorded,\u201d in the language of the statement of facts. The statement of facts then read as follows: The defendants offered in evidence a deed from Malkijah Williams, as Sheriff, to one Stephen Smith, for the land in controversy. Here followed a document on paper of the third seal, for the years 1834 and 1835, in the form of an execution, directed to the Sheriff of the jurisdiction of Gonzales, department of the Brazos, from Ezekiel Williams, Judge of the first instance of the munity, dated in.the town of Gonzales, this 16th --1834. It commanded the Sheriff \u201c to seize the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of Edward Hughart, or so much thereof as may be sufficient, to satisfy a judgment entered on my docket, bearing date the 16th day of October, 1834, amount $165 08-J, with costs of suit; and you will expose to public sale,\u201d &amp;c., to be returned in 30 days.

It ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>peared, however, from authentic documents on file, that the land in controversy was partitioned among the heirs of Stephen Smith in 1849; that some of the defendants were of said heirs, and the others claimed under them by purchase. The Court instructed the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">The title introduced by defendants is a good deed and sufficient title, and you should find for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">Verdict and judgment for defendants. It appeared by bill of exceptions, that the ground on which the admission of the deed from Malkijah Williams, as Sheriff, to Stephen Smith, was objected to, was that no judgment was shown.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-7\"><em>A. J. </em>Hamilton, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqX\">It was error to admit the execution in evidence; for if it were admitted that it was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of facts properly recited in it, it does not recite a judgment. (Voorhees v. Bank U. S. 10 Pet. R. 449.) The Sheriff\u2019s deed is wanting in the same essential prerequisites. It describes no judgment; and if it did, would make no proof of such judgment; for it cannot be pretended that it is a judicial act. The judge simply certifies to the performance of the ministerial act of the Sheriff. The same facts are required to be proved, in proving title acquired at judicial sales under the Spanish civil law, that are required under the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">The question therefore is, could a Sheriff\u2019s deed be sustained at Common Law, by producing in its support an execution as uncertain as the .one we are now considering, with a judgment equally uncertain ? The following authority will show what is required at common law: 12 Wend. 74 ; 16 Id. 563 ; 4 W. C. C. R. 624; 7 Johns. R. 535; 3 W. C. C. R. 546; Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes to Phil. Ev. Part 2d, p. 1070\u20141081; 12 Johns. R. 213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-9\">No aid is acquired by the advertisement to the execution or deed; in no case can an advertisement prove any other fact, than that such advertisement was made. As an isolated fact, it is worthless. It adjudicates nothing, and can never supply the absence of judicial matter. (Hartley v. Beaum, 2 Barr. R. 165.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-10\">The 2d assignment of error relates to the charge of the Court to the jury. The charge is short and pungent, to such a degree, that it may be said to be refreshing. Although the title papers offered by defendants had been permitted to go to the jury in evidence, they ought to have been left to find a verdict upon the facts without compulsion. And the charge was wrong as a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>elusion of law arising upon the facts. The Sheriff\u2019s deed was not even an authentic act; (1 Partidas, 222;) and if it were, could only prove what it recites.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\">Lapse of time will not aid the defect, for there is nothing recited in favor of which a presumption can be indulged. And the party who it is assumed was the judgment creditor, being the purchaser, will charge him with knowledge of every defect and irregularity. (2 Black. R. 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-6\"><em>F. W. </em>Chandler, also, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-7\"><em>Parker &amp; Nichols, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqL\">It is too late now for the plaintiff in error to except to the instructions given to the jury in the Court below. His exceptions should have been taken at the time the charge was given. (Houston v. Jones, 4 Tex. R. 170 ; Jones v. Thurmond\u2019s Heirs, 5 Id. 318; Converse &amp; Co. v. McKee, 14 Id. 20.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-8\">Admitting that the judicial deed was properly read in evidence, there was no error in the charge of Court below; the plaintiff in error, after the reading of the said judicial deed, having abandoned his case.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-9\">The Civil Law, under which this judicial deed was executed, required the Judges of the first instance in the colony or munity, to carry into execution his own decrees and sentences, being partially assisted by the \u201c Subaltern Sheriff,\u201d who was also an officer for the tribunal. (See Laws of Coahuila and Texas, p. 255, Art. 6 ; Id. 256, Art. 20 ; Id. 259, Art. 41, 42, and 43.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-10\">Thus executed, the deed in question became a muniment of title to the purchaser at the sale, as perfect as could be conveyed by the sovereign of the soil, it being in its nature a judicial and not a ministerial act. It was not a Sheriff\u2019s deed, for such an instrument was unknown to the law governing at that place at the time this bill of judicial sale was executed. (Laws of Coahuila and Texas, p. 268, Art. 128; Febrero Mexicano, p. 45, 48 ; Land Laws, vol. i. p. 297, Sect. 2.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-11\">By the laws of the country, the deed or bill of judicial sale in question was as perfect a record, and as authentic as the judgment itself, and as conclusive and binding as a grant from the Government. It furnishes in and of itself a complete record of all it purports to do and in the form prescribed by law. As such it should have been, as it was, admitted as evidence. (M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>C. Partidas, Law 52, vol. 2, page 698 ; 1 Partidas, 222 ; 6 N. S. 268; 3 Mart. R. 115 ; 5 Id. 382; 6 Id. 404; 11 Tex. R. 61; Id. 328 and 325 ; 11 La. R. 283 ; 10 Per. P. 449\u2014474 ; 1 White Recop. 396; 3 Id. 390.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-4\">Under the Spanish laws, any public act, and <em>a fortiori </em>any judicial act, proves itself; and a beneficiary under such act cannot be expected to support it, until it is attacked by evidence impeaching it for fraud, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-5\">It would seem, if a change of Government could not deprive him of title to his lands, such a change of Government could certainly not destroy the evidences of his title.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-6\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_-\">As respects the validity of the deed of the 23d of December, 1834, the present cannot be distinguished from the case of Lee v. Wharton. (11 Tex. R. 61, 75.) The deed is not, like a Sheriff\u2019s deed at Common Law, the mere act of the ministerial officer of the Court, It was executed before the Judge upon whose judgment the execution issued. It was executed with the sanction and authority of the Judge. It was as much a judicial act as the judgment it recites; and being such, there was not the same necessity that the judgment should be produced as in the case of a Sheriff\u2019s deed, which is the act of a merely ministerial officer, and consequently is of no validity unless the judgment and execution from which the officer derived his power is produced. It appears that the deed in question was filed in the office of the Judge of the First Instance in De Witt\u2019s colony, and, upon the change of Government, transferred to the office of the County Clerk of the proper county, where it has remained of record, unimpeached, for nearly a quarter of a century. The purchaser was more immediately interested in its preservation, and it has been preserved; while it is not improbable that the docket of the Primary Judge may have been lost or destroyed, or placed beyond the reach of parties interested in his judgment, by some of the casualties consequent upon the revolution and change of Government and officers to whom the law confided its custody. To require the production of the judgment at this day, when the act of sale under it has remained thus long of record, unimpeached, and title has been claimed under it, would be to defeat the rights of purchasers, justly acquired, without any legal necessity, and in favor of those who, if they ever had rights, have been so slow in asserting them, as not to entitle them to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>regarded with any degree of favor. The deed being a judicial act, and having remained of record as evidence of title claimed under it, since before the change of Government, we are of opinion the Court did not err in admitting it in evidence without the production of the judgment, and holding it valid and effectual to divest the title of the plaintiff\u2019s vendor. And the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
