C.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-10\">In the copy in the transcript, there was the usual blank for the seal of the Court, in the margin, to the left of the attestation of the Clerk, but nothing to represent a seal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-11\">The <em>scire facias </em>was returned served on Davidson and Emison. At Fall Term, 1854, the District Attorney, by leave of the Court, amended the <em>scire facias </em>so as to make it recite the date of the judgment <em>nisi, </em>as the 25th, instead of the 26th, November, 1853 ; and said defendants failing to answer, final judgment was rendered against them by default. Defendants brought the case up by writ of error, giving bond so as to obtain a supersedeas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b662-12\"><em>Cunningham </em>and <em>Jones, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuD\">The pretended <em>scire facias </em>is a mere nullity. It is void, because the judgment <em>nisi </em>was several (not joint) against each of the appellants, for the amount for which each was liable, and a <em>scire facias </em>was ordered to issue against each, and the writ in question is a joint writ against both. It is void, because it contains none of the requisites of a <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-13\">It is contended by the Attorney-General, that the matter in the transcript, from page 17 to 25, should be taken as a part of this writ. The writ itself forbids such construction. They are as independent of each other as the first and last process. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>is a proceeding for a penalty, or forfeiture, and nothing can he taken by intendment in favor of the forfeiture..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b663-5\"><em>Attorney-General, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGC\">I. There can be no tenable objection to the form of the writ of <em>scire facias. </em>It is more prolix than was necessary. All the proceedings on which it rested are fully set forth, and the defendants are fully apprised of what they are required to answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-6\">If it be meant that a separate writ should have issued to each defendant, there is no validity in the objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-7\">II. The amendment was of a mere clerical mistake. The recitation (afterwards amended) was as it originally stood, immaterial, and might have been so treated. But there can be no doubt of the power to amend. (14 Tex. R. 456; 5 Iredel, 12, 203; 12 Ala. 363; 8 Id. 297.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-8\">III. The counsel for plaintiffs in error argues that the writ of <em>scire facias </em>on which the judgment was rendered, is set out fully on page 26 of the record. This, I apprehend, is a mistake; the proceedings, recited upon several pages preceding this, are evidently a portion of the writ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b663-9\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aien\">If the <em>scire facias </em>contained sufficient matter of substance, intelligibly presented, and was <em>properly </em>tested, it would not be a fatal objection that it contains irrelevant matter and is informal. But it is scarcely intelligible, and must have appeared quite unmeaning to defendants, who may not be supposed to know what it ought to contain. It does not apprise the defendants that they are required to show cause why judgment final should not be rendered against them, or what, in particular, they are required to answer. It is a joint <em>scire facias, </em>against two, upon two several judgments. It ought to follow the judgment. It recites a judgment rendered on the 26th, whereas it was rendered on the 25th of the month. The omission of a seal may be a clerical error in making up the transcript. But the <em>scire facias </em>is so irregular, informal and unintelligible, that no judgment ought to be rendered upon it. The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
