Caldwell, at Indianola, on the 9th of same month; Caldwell transferred it by delivery to one Buck, and Buck transferred it in same manner to plaintiff, at Victoria, where plaintiff resided and did business, on the 24th of the same month. Plaintiff caused said bill to be presented to the drawees for payment on the 27th of November, and the same was protested for non-payment, for want of funds of the drawers; of which all the parties had due notice.

The law of Louisiana, as to days of grace, was not proved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b709-5\"><em>W. S. Glass, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH-\">I. By the law merchant, bills of exchange drawn at sight are entitled to the days of grace, and must be presented for acceptance to fix the time of payment. (Story on Bills of Exchange, 273 &amp; 274.) It is the law of Louisiana, where the draft was made payable. (The Commercial Bank of Natchez v. Robt. Perry, 10 Rob. R.) It is also the law of Texas by express statute, (Hart. Dig. Art. 2533,) and by it the liability of the defendant is to be determined. (Raymond v. Holmes, 11 Tex. R. 54.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqAC\">II. There is no time fixed within which a bill of exchange, drawn at sight, must be presented for acceptance. The rule is that it must be presented within a reasonable time, and what is a reasonable time must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. The rule is subject to one qualification; and that is, it must be put in circulation. In this case the plaintiff kept the bill locked up from circulation more than a month, when he had agents in New Orleans, to whom he might have transmitted it for presentment by mail, at any time, in six days. Can it be said that the plaintiff used due diligence to collect the bill, when his failure to forward it by the usual channel of communication caused the protest ? It would have been honored if transmitted by the 1st, 2d or 3d mail after he received it. In view of the length of time it had been drawn, and the other facts, I think the delay was unreasonable. To hold the defendant liable under such circumstances, is to destroy all confidence in negotiable paper. (Story on Bills, p. 276.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b709-7\"><em>A. S. Cunningham </em>and <em>J. J. Holt, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmB\">We do not believe that bills payable at sight, are required to be presented for acceptance. There is some conflict of authority as to whether or not bills payable at sight are entitled to days of grace. (Chitty on Bills, 409 and 10 and note.) We believe the weight of authority is in favor of such bills being payable on presentation. Days of grace are different at different places, being regulated by positive law or by the usage or custom of the place, and the Court could not judicially know what was the law or usage and custom in the State of Louisiana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b710-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The hill being one which might be put in circulation, not being payable on a particular day, the amended petition was clearly sufficient and the ruling of the Court correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b710-6\">II. The only rule established as to bills payable at sight, or at so many days after sight, is, that the holder must present the bill in a reasonable time; that due diligence is the only question, whether the bill be foreign or domestic; and that is a question for the jury to determine. (Chitty on Bills, 302, 3, 4 and note.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b710-7\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvV\">With respect to the time when a bill payable at sight should he presented for acceptance, in the absence of any determinate usage of trade, fixing a definite time, the only rule is that it must be presented within a reasonable time. (Chit, on Bills, 247; Story on Bills, Sec. 231.) And what will be a reasonable time must depend upon all the circumstances of each case. (Ib.) \u201c If (says Story) the bill is kept in circulation, and not held by any one holder, through whose hands it passes, an unreasonable time, it seems difficult to assign any particular time in which it ought to be presented for acceptance; in respect to foreign bills, the conveniences, if not the necessities, of trade seem to require, that a very liberal allowance of time, both for the transmission and presentation of bills, should be allowed to every successive holder.\u201d (Ib.; 20 Johns. 176, 146; 4 Mass. 336.) In the case of a foreign bill, payable at sight, it has been decided, that it is no laches to put it into circulation before acceptance, and keep it in circulation without acceptance, as long as the convenience of successive holders may require; and it has even been held, that if a bill, drawn at three days\u2019 sight, were kept out in that way for a year, this would not be laches. (Chit, on Bills, 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">It appears by the evidence, that the bill, in suit, was put in circulation and indorsed by the defendants, without having been presented for acceptance, before it came to the hands of the plaintiff, and that a little more than a month elapsed before he presented it for payment; and that this was according to usage. The usage fully justified the delay that occurred in the presentation of the bill. The purchasers of bills, drawn in other States and thus put in circulation here, receive them on the credit of the indorsers, who put them in circulation in this State; and they ought to be held liable to make them good to the holder, unless he locks them up from circulation, and keeps them in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>possession an unreasonable length of time, considered in reference to usage and the circumstances of the case. It was very properly left to the jury to decide whether there had been reasonable diligence in presenting the bill, considering the usage of trade; and their verdict was well warranted by the evidence. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
