Tried below before the Hon. A. W. Terrell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-12\">Suit by William E. Pinckney against James L. Davis and wife, in a Justice\u2019s Court, to May Term, <em>1856, on an </em>account, the debit side of which amounted to $122 70, and the credit side to $23 95; the credits consisted of corn got by the bushel from time to time; cash, $11; and account at Floyd\u2019s, $7 70; the entry on the Justice\u2019s docket stated that the suit was brought on \u201can open account in the sum of $98 75, dated Oct. 18th, 1854.\u201d There was a jury trial and a verdict for the plaintiff, July 19th, 1856, for $98 75, \u201cwith interest at eight per cent, from the date of the account, and all costs of suit.\u201d This verdict was entered on the Justice\u2019s docket, but there was no further entry of judgment. The account did not show the date at which it was rendered. The oldest charge was dated Oct. 18th, 1854, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>most recent January 13th, 1855. Accompanying the transcript from the Justice\u2019s Court was a bill of costs amounting to $72 88. (The exact date of bringing the suit did not appear.) Defendant obtained a certiorari, alleging the verdict as above stated, and that judgment was rendered thereon by the Justice. The bond given by defendant, for the certiorari, was in the sum of $220. At the return Term plaintiff moved to dismiss the certiorari, on the ground that the bond was not \u201c in double the amount of the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court and costs;\u201d and that said bond Was \u201cfor $220, and the amount of the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court and the costs of said Court amount to $150.\u201d Same Term, to wit: Fall Term, 1856, motion to dismiss sustained, and time given defendant until next Term to file a new bond. There being no Spring Term, 1857, of said Court, at the Fall Term, 1857, plaintiff again moved to dismiss the certiorari, on the ground that defendant had failed to give a new bond, and the motion was sustained, \u201c the defendant having failed to file a new bond in accordance with the order of this Court of a previous Term.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-5\"><em>G. W. </em>Jones, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADQ\">The bond is required to be in double \u201cthe value of the amount in controversy.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 1753.) The \u201cmatter in controversy\u201d is the judgment of the Justice\u2019s Court. (King v. Longcope, 7 Tex. R. 236.) The judgment is for ninety-eight dollars, and the bond is for two hundred and twenty dollars; more than double. An account cannot draw interest, and interest having been found by a jury is invalid: is in fact no part of the judgment, and could not be added to the amount in controversy to increase the amount of the bond. Again, the cost is not a part of the matter in controversy\u2014it is an incident of the litigation\u2014a something growing out of it\u2014the price of justice\u2014and could not have been intended to be included in the \u201c value of the matter in controversy.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-6\"><em>Hancock &amp; West, </em>also, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVB\">There is another objection to this judgment, that we deem conclusive of the whole matter. Had the District Court jurisdiction of the subject of certiorari at all? By reference to the transcript it will be seen that the original indebtedness was $122 70; and the party should have brought suit on his original cause of action in the District Court. (Bankenship v. Adkins, 12 Tex. R. 536.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>C. C. &amp; A. D. McGinnis, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoRZ\">The judgment was for $98 75, with eight per cent, interest from the date of the account, making principal and interest $112 58, and costs of three Terms of <em>Justice\u2019s Court </em>$92 68; so that we see, that the judgment recovered by appellee against appellants in the Justice\u2019s Court, was two hundred and five dollars. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1740, 1753.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">In the case of King v. Longcope, 7 Texas, this Court held it was sufficient for the certiorari bond to be in double the amount of the. judgment; but we contend the bond given in this case is not for double the amount of the judgment in the Justice\u2019s Court, exclusive of $92^%- costs, which we contend is part of the judgment recovered. The judgment is for $112 58, without the costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-6\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAqK\">The suit was upon an account exhibiting debits and credits, showing the balance claimed to be within the jurisdiction of the Justice. The suit was therefore properly brought in the Justice\u2019s Court. The language of the Opinion in Blankenship v. Adkins, (12 Tex. R. 536,) referred to by counsel, might seem to favor the supposition that because the debit side of the account exceeded the Justice\u2019s jurisdiction suit should have been brought in the District Court. But by reference to the facts of that case, it will be seen that the decision was upon a very different state of case from the present. The Opinion must be understood in reference to the case before the Court, and so understood, it is not an authority for denying the jurisdiction of the Justice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AD_D\">In King v. Longcope, (7 Tex. R. 236,) we held that a bond in double the amount of the judgment sought to be reversed, was a substantial compliance with the provision of Article 1753 of the Digest. The costs of the litigation constitute no part of the \u201c amount in controversy,\u201d and there is no authority in the statute or any decision of the Court, for requiring that the bond be in double the amount in controversy or judgment and costs. The bond was sufficient in amount, and the Court erred in dismissing the case. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"AGv\">Rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b350-9\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">When the judgment in this case was pronounced, some days since, it escaped our attention that the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ment of the Justice embraced interest upon the demand of the plaintiff. Including the interest as found and required to be computed by the verdict in the Justice\u2019s Court, the bond was not in a sufficient amount, by the criterion adopted in King v. Longcope. (7 Tex. 236.) The judgment heretofore rendered in the case at this Term must therefore be set aside and the judgment of the District Court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
