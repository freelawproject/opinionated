Tried below before the Hon. Fielding Jones. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-10\">Suit by defendant in error against plaintiffs in error, on two promissory notes, expressed to be in consideration of negro hire \u201c for the farm.\u2019\u2019 Amendment alleging that the farm was the separate property of the wife, that the debt was incurred for its benefit, &amp;c. The defendants had been served with citation and copy of the original petition; the amendment being filed after-wards. The entry of judgment commenced, \u201c This cause being called, the defendants made default,\u201d &amp;e., and concluded with the words, <em>\u201c </em>and it is agreed between the parties that execution shall be stayed until the first day of the next Term of this Court.\u201d The transcript was filed by defendant in error on the 12th of November, which was three days before the day assigned for causes from that district. There was no assignment of errors, and plaintiffs in error moved the Court for leave to withdraw the transcript, for the purpose of assigning errors. The motion was in writing, but the date of filing was not indorsed. The transcript contained only twelve pages of manuscript.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-11\"><em>I. A. &amp; G. W. </em>Paschal, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9N\">This record was made out for the plaintiffs in error, and they had till the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>15th to bring it up and file it. (Hart. Art. 2937.) The assignments of error were required to be attached to, but not incorporated in the record before taken from the Clerk\u2019s office. (Hart. Dig. 2940.) The plaintiffs in error could not assign their errors, as the record was taken out by defendants before the time had elapsed. The record is under the control of the plaintiff in error, and the appeal may be dismissed to assign errors. (Miller v. Jasper, 10 Tex. R. 513.) The plaintiffs in error are not deprived of this right by the defendant in error bringing the record and filing it before he was authorized to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">But should the record not take this course, then we contend the judgment must be reversed on the authority of Whetmore v. Woodhouse, 10 Tex. R. 33.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-6\"><em>Parker &amp; </em>Nichols, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-7\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHn\">The motion cannot be granted. If the appellants had filed their assignments of error in due time, upon finding that the appellee had prematurely taken out the transcript, they might have obtained another transcript of the record with their assignments of error annexed thereto, and filed the same in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The motion being disposed of, we are asked to reverse the judgment without an assignment of errors, because there is no cause of action presented in the original petition, and there was no service of a copy of the amended petition which presents a new cause of action. It is very much doubted whether this judgment could be sustained, having been entered as a judgment by default in form, if it did not sufficiently appear that the parties were in Court and recognized the proceedings by taking the benefit of a stay of execution. In the conclusion of the judgment it is recited that \u201c it is agreed between the parties, that execution shall be stayed until the first day of the next Term of this Court.\u201d This entry evidences the presence of the parties and their recognition of the judgment, sufficiently to cure any defect in the proceedings, from the want of notice of the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
