It was alleged in the petition to establish exceptions, that on December 24, 1901, the case was heard on its merits by <em>Barker, </em>J., who gave the original plaintiffs, Benjamin and Jennings, until January 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>1902, at 12 M. to redeem. On January 17, 1902, the First National Bank of Yarmouth was allowed by the court to become a party and was given until February 19, 1902, at 12 m. to redeem. At 9.30 A. M. on February 19, 1902, Benjamin, Jennings and the First National Bank of Yarmouth asked the court to be allowed to amend the bill. The motion was denied by <em>Morton, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">The exceptions were disallowed by <em>Morton, </em>J. as follows: \u201c I do not think that the matter is one to which an exception lies and I therefore disallow the exceptions. If the matter is one to which an exception lies by the parties, or either of them, then the bill is in proper shape in form and substance and should be allowed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-6\"><em>JS.
