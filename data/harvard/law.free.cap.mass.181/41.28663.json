It was agreed, that the patent should be assigned to the plaintiff to be held by him in trust and assigned by him \u201c to a corporation now organized or to be organized whenever the parties may deem it advisable for the purpose of carrying on the business,\u201d and that the capital stock of the corporation to which the patent should be assigned should be divided in equal shares between the plaintiff and the defendant, but that the amount to be contributed by each to be sold for working capital should be fixed by the plaintiff. No other details were agreed upon by the parties. It further appeared, that in accordance with the agreement the defendant executed and delivered to the plaintiff an assignment of the patent, and thereafter wrongfully obtained possession of it and mutilated it by tearing off the signature and seal, thereby preventing the plaintiff from having the assignment recorded at the patent office, and thereafter refused to recognize his agreement as binding. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to relief; that the provision that the plaintiff should assign the patent to a corporation \u201c whenever the parties may deem it advisable for the purpose of carrying on the business <em>\u201d </em>did not give the defendant the right to terminate the whole arrangement at any time he saw fit; that, when the defendant had transferred the patent to the plaintiff, the plaintiff was under an obligation to furnish within a reasonable time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>capital needed and the defendant under a corresponding obligation to give him a reasonable time to do so; that the defendant, wrongfully having mutilated the assignment, should execute it anew, and, upon his doing so, the plaintiff either must assign the patent to an existing corporation reasonably fitted for the purpose, or must organize such a corporation as was reasonably proper and furnish such capital as was reasonably necessary, the plaintiff and defendant having equal shares in the capital stock of the corporation whether existing or to be formed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b64-5\">Since St. 1877, c. 178, this court has had full equity jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">Bill in equity, filed January 19, 1901, to compel the defendant to execute anew and deliver to the plaintiff an assignment dated June 5, 1900, by the defendant to the plaintiff of certain letters patent issued by the United States to the defendant for an improvement in brake mechanism for railway cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">The case was heard by Loring, J., who, being of opinion that the question of the plaintiff\u2019s remedy ought to be determined by the full court before further proceedings were had, ordered a stay of proceedings, and reported the case for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">The report contained the following findings of fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">The agreement in writing hereafter printed was executed and delivered on June 5, 1900, and on the same day the assignment in question was made and delivered to the plaintiff in pursuance of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-10\">The plaintiff rendered services and advanced money in pursuance of the agreement, and both parties deemed it advisable that the letters patent should be held by the plaintiff in trust under the agreement until certain clouds on the title of the letters patent should be removed, and a second assignment was executed and delivered to the plaintiff on August 9, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-11\">. While the plaintiff was proceeding in good faith under the agreement, and was seeking to have the clouds removed, the defendant, on August 27, 1900, in the absence of and without notice to the plaintiff, wrongfully possessed himself of the written assignments of June 5 and August 9, and mutilated the assignments by tearing therefrom the signatures and seals, and thereafter refused to recognize the agree'ment as binding, stating to the plaintiff that he was \u201cdone.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">By reason of the fact that the plaintiff and defendant deemed it advisable that no steps should be taken until the clouds mentioned above had been removed, the defendant, by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>wrongful mutilation of the assignments, deprived the plaintiff of time and opportunity to carry out the agreement of June 5, and thus by his acts prevented further performance of the agreement by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The justice found that, by the making and delivery of the assignment of June 5,1900, the title to the letters patent vested in the plaintiff as trustee, but the plaintiff\u2019s title was rendered imperfect by the wrongful acts of the defendant in preventing record of the assignment, and by the mutilation, whereby recording became impossible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">The defendant introduced testimony to show that rights of third parties had so intervened as to prevent a decree to restore the rights of the plaintiff, or for specific performance of the contract, but the justice did not find that there were any intervening rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">On these findings, the plaintiff contended that he was entitled to a decree for a new execution of the assignment of June 5,1900, and submitted a decree, but the justice ruled, that the agreement was too indefinite to admit of specific performance, and further ruled, that if specific performance of the whole agreement could not be decreed a decree should not be made for a new execution of the assignment, and refused to enter the decree. The defendant contended, that he was at liberty to end all arrangements between himself and the plaintiff, and that when he mutilated the assignments on August 27, he was exercising a right to which he was entitled under the agreement. The justice was of opinion that this construction of the agreement was not correct, and that the case should be sent to a master to assess the damages suffered by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">The agreement was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-9\">\u201c This Agreement made this fifth day of June A.

W. Kittredge 3? H. A. </em>Jordan, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-7\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQq\">We are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to a re-execution of the assignment of the letters patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">By the true construction of the contract the defendant gave to the plaintiff an equal interest in the patent in question and in any future improvements made by him on the invention covered by it\u2019; and in payment for that half interest the plaintiff agreed \u201c to furnish capital as needed.\u201d At that stage of the adventure it was not possible to go into details, and the parties agreed that the patent should be assigned to the plaintiff \u201c to be held by him in trust \u201d and \u201c to be assigned \u201d by him \u201cto a corporation now organized or to be organized whenever the parties may deem it advisable for the purpose of carrying on the business aforesaid.\u201d It is provided that the capital stock of the corporation, to which the patent is assigned, shall be divided in equal shares between the plaintiff and the defendant, but that the amount, to be contributed by each to be sold for working capital, shall be fixed by the plaintiff. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>other details were agreed, upon by the parties. It was not specified who was to decide the question, whether an existing corporation should be availed of or a new one organized, and in case a new one were organized, who was to decide the many questions, which necessarily will arise in that connection. Neither was it specified how long a time should be allowed for this purpose, or for the plaintiff to furnish the capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The defendant argues, from this failure to deal with these details in the agreement, and from the clause, that the letters patent were to be held by the plaintiff \u201c in trust during such time as to the parties hereto it may seem advisable,\u201d and from the further clause, that the letters patent were to be assigned by the plaintiff to a corporation \u201c whenever the parties may deem it advisable for the purpose of carrying on the business aforesaid,\u201d that the defendant had the right to terminate the whole arrangement at any time he thought fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">But we do not think, that that is the true construction of the contract. Taking the contract as a whole we think that the plaintiff came under an absolute obligation to furnish the capital needed and the defendant came under a corresponding obligation to afford him time to do so. The contract contemplates that the invention is to be exploited by a corporation and that a corporation will be formed, that the capital will be furnished by the plaintiff and that the letters patent will be assigned by the plaintiff to that corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">When the defendant had transferred the letters patent to the plaintiff, the plaintiff was bound to furnish the capital within a reasonable time, and the defendant was bound to give him a reasonable time within which to do so. The various questions as to what corporation should be utilized, or, if a new one were organized, what, and how, it should be organized, not having been agreed upon, must be determined by what is reasonable under all the circumstances. As the plaintiff is to furnish the capital and is to decide upon the amount, which is to be contributed by each to be sold for working capital, we think that he should take the initiative in the matter of utilizing an existing corporation or organizing a new one, and that any reasonable course adopted by him must be accepted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The defendant, having wrongfully mutilated the assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>to the plaintiff, should re-execute the same; upon his doing so, if the plaintiff does not within a reasonable time do one of these two things, namely, either assign the patent to an existing corporation which is reasonably fitted for the purpose, or organize such a corporation as is reasonably proper and furnish such capital as is reasonably necessary, he will commit a breach of his contract for which the defendant may have his action of damages. Whether an existing corporation or a new corporation is used, the plaintiff and defendant are to have an equal share in the capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We think that the ruling made at the hearing was wrong, that since the whole contract could not be specifically enforced by the court the defendant would not be compelled to re-execute the assignment. The amended bill in this suit in its final form, is not a bill seeking specific performance, but a bill to compel the defendant to restore to the plaintiff evidence of the assignment to him in.order that among other things it may be recorded in the patent office. The mutilation of the assignment did not revest the title in the defendant, but it prevented the plaintiff from perfecting the title which as between the parties had already vested. The re-execution of lost instruments is a separate and ancient head of equity jurisdiction. <em>Bennett </em>v. Ingoldsby, Finch, 262. <em>Simmons Creek Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>142 U. S. 417. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>42 N. H. 109, 112. <em>Lancy </em>v. <em>Randlett, </em>80 Maine, 169. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Church of St. Michael, </em>136 N. Y. 10. The case of an instrument which has been wrongfully mutilated comes within that rule. Since St. 1877, c. 178, (Pub. Sts. c. 151, \u00a7 4; R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 1,) this court has had full jurisdiction in equity. <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>156 Mass. 203. <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Mass. 205, n. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>159 Mass. 356, 361. <em>Nathan </em>v. <em>Nathan, </em>166 Mass. 294. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>172 Mass. 53. <em>New England Ins.
