Newhall as a member of the sixth class of the order in good standing, which tender the defendant refused to accept, contending that $9.60 was the amount due the defendant, instead of $24, the amount tendered. The tender of $24 was made on the basis that the plaintiff was entitled to $5,000. The $9.60 claimed to be the amount due by the defendant was upon the basis that the plaintiff was entitled only to $2,000. The plaintiff paid to the defendant the $9.60 demanded, the plaintiff saving her rights to collect the $5,000 if entitled to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-3\">Due proof of the death of Newhall was filed with the defendant, and a proper tender was made of the benefit certificate to the defendant, and proper demand made for the sum of $5,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">In August, 1900, a further by-law was passed by the defendant, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">\u201c An emergency fund of five per cent of the aggregate face value of all outstanding benefit certificates, as recognized by the by-laws of the order, is hereby established, to be created, collected, maintained and disbursed in conformity with the laws of the State of Massachusetts; and that for the establishment of said fund there be charged against the certificate of each member of the order, five per cent of the by-laws value (reduced or otherwise) thereof, provided, however, that if upon the decease of any member, any part of said charge shall remain unpaid by the member to said fund, the same shall be deducted' from the amount payable to the beneficiary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">It was agreed, if material, which the plaintiff denied, that the several amendments to the by-laws mentioned and quoted were enacted in good faith, and necessitated by the condition of the order at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">Upon the facts, if the court should find the foregoing amendments to the defendant\u2019s by-laws valid and operative upon the plaintiff, the judgment was to be for $1,700 and interest from the date of the writ; if the finding should be that the by-law reducing the amount of the death benefit was operative, but the by-law requiring the deduction of five per cent for an emergency fund was inoperative, then the judgment was to be for $1,800 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>and interest; if the court should find that the changes in the \u2022laws were invalid and inoperative upon the plaintiff, the judgment was to be for $4,800 and interest, and if the finding should be that the first named by-law was inoperative, but the last named by-law was operative, then the judgment was to be for $4,500 and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-3\">The defendant had sufficient money in its emergency fund to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_J\">This is an action on a certificate of membership issued by the defendant to Eben D. Newhall and promising to pay the plaintiff $5,000 upon certain conditions which have been performed. The defendant sets up that since issuing the certificate it has changed its by-laws and cut down the highest amount to be paid upon any benefit certificate to $2,000. The plaintiff denies the power of the defendant thus to diminish a member\u2019s rights under his contract. The promise is made \u201cin consideration of the full compliance with all the by-laws . . . now existing or hereafter adopted,\u201d but the conditions attached to the promise refer to the by-laws only so far as to require payment of assessments and the deduction of advances for sick or disability benefits in accordance with them. Subject to these conditions the promise is absolute. Upon these facts we are of opinion that the plaintiff is right and is entitled to recover the larger sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">If the plaintiff\u2019s rights stood simply upon the by-laws in force at the time when the certificate was issued, as was the case in <em>Pain </em>v. <em>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St. Jean </em>Baptiste, 172 Mass. 319, the question would be raised whether such a change of by-laws, if necessitated by the condition of the society, was permissible as against her, or was unreasonable and an abuse. See <em>Messer </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge United </em>Workmen, 180 Mass. 321; <em>Smith </em>v. Galloway, [1898] 1 Q. B. 71; <em>Fugure </em>v. <em>Mutual Society of St. </em>Joseph, 46 Vt. 362; <em>Fullenwider </em>v. <em>Supreme Council of the Royal </em>League, 180 Ill. 621; Niblack, Voluntary Societies, (2d ed.) \u00a7 25. But the plaintiff\u2019s rights do not stand upon the by-laws alone. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>stand also upon express contract. The promise to pay $5,000 is conditioned by the by-laws only to the extent that has been stated. Even if the \u201c full compliance with all the by-laws \u201d which is mentioned as a consideration for the promise is not interpreted and limited by the more specific provisions of the express conditions, \u201c compliance \u201d in this connection means doing what, the by-laws may require the member to do, not submission to seeing his only inducement to do it destroyed. The case is not like <em>Daley </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Building, Loan, &amp; Savings Association, </em>172 Mass. 533, and <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Union Fraternal Accident Association, </em>103 Iowa, 424, where the promise to pay a fixed sum was qualified by reference to a fund from which the payment was to come and which might turn out inadequate from causes over which the defendant had no control. Stating our opinion in a different form, whatever compliance with bylaws may be construed to mean, it does not mean absolute submission to whatever may be enacted in good faith, and it does not extend to permitting a direct deduction from the sum which, on the face of the certificate, any ordinary man would be led to suppose secure. With reference to him the by-law is a plain abuse. <em>Gaut </em>v. <em>American Legion of Honor, </em>107 Tenn. 603. <em>Langan </em>v. <em>American Legion of Honor, </em>70 N. Y. Supp. 663, 665. <em>Knights Templars\u2019 &amp; Masons\u2019 Life Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Jarman, </em>44 C. C. A. 92, 99. <em>Pokrefky </em>v. <em>Detroit Firemen's Fund Association, </em>121 Mich. 456. <em>Wist </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge A. O. U. W. </em>22 Ore. 271, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">Another by-law undertakes to deduct five per cent from the face value of certificates for an emergency fund. Whatever may be the right to assess for this purpose, it follows from what we have said that the attempt to cut down the amount to be paid by the defendant under its contract must fail. St. 1899, c. 442, \u00a7 12, is not to be construed as attempting to impair the obligation of existing contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\n<em>Judgment for $4,800.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
