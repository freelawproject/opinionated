Wells, the testatrix, was a single woman who died in 1886 and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>will was proved and allowed in that year. The will was dated May 18, 1874. It was as follows: \u201c My will is that all my just debts and funeral charges be paid out of my estate as soon after my decease as may be found convenient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">\u201c 2.

I do give and bequeath the sum of one hundred dollars to the trustees of the Lowell Cemetery the same to be held by them and their successors in office, and the income thereof, or such part of the income of said sum as may be necessary, is to be used and expended in keeping my lot in said cemetery in proper condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">\u201c John Davis of Lowell appointed executor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">The property of the testatrix had been kept invested by the executor, and at the time of the hearing it amounted to about $8,000. The heirs at law contended, that the petitioner should be instructed to devote only a portion of the property in his hands as executor to fitting up the burial lot of the testatrix and erecting a monument thereon, and that the rest of the fund should be distributed among the heirs at law and next of kin.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-8\"><em>Gr.

The testatrix gives \u201c all \u201d the residue of her estate \u201c for the use and to the purpose following, viz.: the same [i. e. all the residue] to be converted into money . . . and to be expended in fitting up the burial lot owned by me in the Lowell Cemetery, and in erecting a suitable and proper monument thereon.\u201d The express requirement is that all the residue be spent for the. purpose or rather the purposes mentioned, and this requirement is not cut down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>by describing the intended monument .as suitable and proper. The literal meaning of the words is confirmed by the fact that the testatrix evidently did not mean to die partially intestate. Very likely when she wrote her will she did not expect to leave so large a sum as she did, but that is a speculation. Furthermore, if a single woman not otherwise distinguished should be minded to prolong the remembrance of her family name by a beautiful monument over her grave, we could not pronounce it unsuitable or improper as matter of law. Cases like <em>Matter of </em>Luckey, 4 Redf. Surr. 95, as to what would be suitable in the absence of more special directions do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
