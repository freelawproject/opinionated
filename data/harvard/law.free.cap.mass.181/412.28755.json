Both contained restrictions requiring that no building should be erected or maintained within ten feet of Calumet Street. The restrictions in the defendant\u2019s deed were to remain in force for fifteen years from June 1,1894. The houses both of the plaintiffs and the defendant projected into the restricted space and in a similar manner. The plaintiffs did not know this until after the filing of their bill. The plaintiffs built in 1893, and the defendant in 1900, his house being nearly completed when the bill was filed. In both cases the architects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>and builders were instructed to erect the houses ten feet back from the street, and in both cases the violation of the restriction was unintentional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-3\">The judge signed a statement of the facts found by him, and made a decree dismissing the bill; and the plaintiffs app\u00e9aled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-4\"><em>W.

In view of these circumstances, the kind and degree of the respective violations and the short time remaining of the -life of the restrictions, it would be plainly inequitable to compel the defendant to move or alter his building at the request of the plaintiffs, the situation of whose building, so far as respects the restrictions, is nearly, if not fully, as objectionable as that of the defendant. See <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>179 Mass. 396, and authorities cited therein as to the principles which should govern in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
