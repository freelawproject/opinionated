M. Hume.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-3\">The invoice of September 1, 1898, named in the contract contained in the list of assets the item \u201c Bills owing us, $54,943.58.\u201d The bill alleged, that these bills were not only for carriages actually sold, but also for carriages that had been consigned for sale, and out of said $54,943.58 bills owing the Hume Carriage Company, $38,253.94 were bills thus owing for carriages that had been consigned for sale; and that such consignees were properly considered as the purchasers, subject only to the understanding that they were neither the owners of the carriages consigned nor liable to pay for them until they had succeeded in finding a purchaser, inasmuch as the consignees had a right to sell as principals in their own name, to such parties, at such prices, and on such terms as they saw fit, and the carriages so consigned were invoiced to such consignees at fixed prices, and on a sale by the consignee the consignee himself became the purchaser and principal debtor for the carriages so consigned; that accordingly in the agreement and sale of October 6, 1898, these bills were treated as bills owing the company.; that if the. carriages that had thus been consigned had been treated as carriages of the Hume Carriage Company, and the five per cent reduction allowed thereon, the amount due the defendant would and should have been several thousand dollars less than agreed; and if the carriages thus consigned had been treated as carriages of the Hume Carriage Company, and included at practically cost price, as were all carriages included as such, the amount due the defendant would and should have been many thousands of dollars less ; that they were not so treated, and no attempt was made either on September 1, or on October 6, to ascertain what carriages so consigned had or had not actually been sold by the consignees respectively; that on the contrary, for the purposes of the invoice of September 1, and of the agreement and sale of October 6, all the carriages so consigned were treated as in effect sold and the whole account in every instance as an outstanding bill; and that such treatment was in effect a part of the agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff, and alleged that the defendant was estopped to deny the validity of such treatment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The bill further alleged, that on July 17, 1899, one Gilbert, doing business under the firm name and style of the Gilbert Carriage Company, failed, owing a comparatively large amount on one of the outstanding bills of the Hume Carriage Company ; that the plaintiff immediately gave the defendant notice of the failure, and afterwards, at the request of the defendant and on the defendant\u2019s agreement to pay half the expense, caused to be replevied certain carriages that had been consigned to the Gilbert Carriage Company for sale and were found in the possession of that company ; that while, under the contract and agreement of October 6,1898, the consignees were treated as purchasers and the accounts as outstanding bills, nevertheless the parties, especially in the provision allowing the last payment to remain an open account without interest for one year as security against losses, took into consideration that the sale to and liability of the consignee was not absolute, but conditional upon his finding a purchaser, and it was not the intention of the parties to change the sale into an absolute sale, or the liability of the consignee into an absolute debt, but rather that the right to replevy the carriages should be preserved in order that the loss might thus be reduced in case of failures; that no provision, however, was made or express understanding had as to how such replevied carriages should be disposed of or the amount of the loss ascertained in case of any such failure and consequent replevin; that hence out of the failure of the Gilbert Carriage Company and the replevin of the carriages there had arisen a complication and controversy which the defendant and the plaintiff had been unable to adjust amicably, and such that the rights and equities of the parties could not be adequately and completely protected and adjusted in an action at law, but only in equity, permitting a sale of the replevied carriages under the order and direction of the court, and the ascertainment of the net loss on the Gilbert Carriage Company-bill, one half of which the defendant agreed to stand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">The bill also alleged that, as the plaintiff was informed and believed, the defendant by mistake erroneously stated the amount of the defendant\u2019s net interest in the firm, as shown by the invoice of September 1, 1898, to be $29,300.50, and further failed to take out in any form the five per cent on finished carriages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>as agreed; that the plaintiff, being unfamiliar with the figures, and knowing that the defendant was familiar with them, believed the figures to be as stated by the defendant; that it was only recently, and after the making of the payments named, that the plaintiff discovered the mistake, and that the plaintiff had accordingly overpaid the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\">The bill also alleged, that the defendant had brought an action at law against the plaintiff on the- contract, which action was pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\">The bill prayed, (1) for an accounting, (2) that the replevied carriages might be sold under order of the court and the plaintiff from the proceeds reimbursed for the expenses of replevying the carriages and the balance divided, (3) that the defendant might be ordered to return the amount overpaid by the plaintiff by reason of the defendant\u2019s failure to deduct five per cent on finished carriages, <em>(4) </em>that an injunction might be issued to restrain the defendant from further prosecuting his action at law on the contract, and (5) for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-7\">The case was argued at the bar in November, 1901, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-8\"><em>G. H. </em>Hanson, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b572-9\"><em>W. H. Hiles, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b572-10\">Holmes, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYr\">This bill is not like those where there has been a mistake in settling partnership accounts and a note given for the balance. The plaintiff alleges no mistake either in the substance of the contract or in the invoice, and he seeks no reformation of either document. On the contrary he says that it was part of the understanding that carriages in the hands of commission houses, although not sold, should be included in \u201c bills owing us.\u201d No note has been given and no mistake of any kind is alleged, except that in estimating the amount due to the defendant under his contract and invoice as agreed they forgot to deduct five per cent as stipulated on finished carriages. If the plaintiff is right, that sum will be deducted from the amount remaining due under the contract. The plaintiff alleges in the bill that this is matter which may be proved by paroi, and this may be true, because the express statement of the mode of computation and the invoice must make the mistake in the figured- total apparent; but at all events no reformation is asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The real grievance is something which the plaintiff himself alleges to have been contemplated when the contract was made. The plaintiff and defendant have had to replevy from commission men carriages which are charged for under \u201c Bills owing us.\u201d This, the plaintiff says, was contemplated and was to be counted as a \u201c loss \u201d under the contract. If so, it will be allowed for in the defendant\u2019s suit for the balance alleged to be due to him. The bill prays among other things for an account but discloses no need of equitable relief on that ground. Taking the bill on demurrer, we must assume that it expresses the plaintiff\u2019s case as he is content to leave it. He has not asked to amend, and the bill has been dismissed. It is only fair that he should be held exactly to his pleading, and, as the case stands, we are not prepared to say that the judge of the Superior Court was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
