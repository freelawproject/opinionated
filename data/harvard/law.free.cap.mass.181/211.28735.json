At the request of the parties the judge reported the case for the determination of this court. If on the evidence and law the judge was authorized to find for the appellant, the finding and judgment were to stand; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\">St. 1889, c. 446, now incorporated in R.

R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 23, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">We are of opinion that they are not. They were not leased to the city of Boston in any proper sense. They were used in the appellant\u2019s business, and were owned and controlled by it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the performance of its contracts, and these contracts required that the articles should be kept in use for the benefit of the city, but the city did not hold them as a lessee. The contracts under -which the appellant used them were, in their principal parts, contracts to render service, and the furnishing of gas and the furnishing and using of these lamps and other articles were only parts of an important general undertaking whose object was to secure for the inhabitants of the city of Boston well lighted streets. Without dealing further with the details of the contracts, we are of opinion that the ruling of the judge of the Superior Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
