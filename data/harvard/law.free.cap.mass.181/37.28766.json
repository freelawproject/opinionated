The respondents asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>for a ruling, that on the whole evidence the petitioner was not entitled to an allowance.

The amount of the allowance, if any was to be made, is not raised by the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The power to make an allowance to a widow from the personal estate of her deceased husband is given by the Pub. Stsl c. 135, \u00a7 2, and is-to be made \u201c having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The only possible grounds on which it can be urged that the widow was not entitled to an allowance are the fact that she had lived apart from her husband for some years, and the delay in filing her petition. As to the first ground it is settled that a separation continued down to her husband\u2019s death makes no difference. <em>Slack </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>123 Mass. 443. See also <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>168 Mass. 228, 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Nor is a delay in filing the petition necessarily a bar. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>117 Mass. 27, where there was a delay of two years. <em>Lisk </em>v. <em>Lisk, </em>155 Mass. 153, where there was a delay of two years and eight months. In the present case there was a delay from July 9, 1899, until December 21, 1900. This delay was accounted for by the fact, as testified to by the petitioner, that negotiations between her and the heirs of her husband\u2019s estate, for a compromise, were pending. See <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>161 Mass. 161, 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
