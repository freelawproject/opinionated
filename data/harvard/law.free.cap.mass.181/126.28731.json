We are of opinion that on the evidence the plaintiff and Frank Tuxbury are to be taken to have been partners, as they were assumed by the presiding judge to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">The defendant asked for the following ruling: \u201c If the whole or part of the consideration of the note was for intoxicating liquors sold by the plaintiff to maker of the note and the plaintiff had no license to sell such intoxicating liquors, then the sale was illegal, consequently the consideration of the note was illegal and the defendant is not liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201c For this purpose I instruct you that if two men are interested in a saloon, one may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>sell out to the other without violating the liquor laws of this Commonwealth and therefore, if that is the fact, that it is not a legal defence to the note ... I will add that element, . . . two parties being interested in the business, but the license being in the name of one of them only. . . . The one selling not having the license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We are of opinion that the ruling given was correct. On that point <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Pomphret, 137 Mass. 564, is decisive. In our opinion that case went one step beyond <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>102 Mass. 144; in the earlier case there was nothing more than a partition of liquor owned in common; but we do not think that the later case was intended to be confined to the case of a club, where each member on paying for a drink was merely appropriating to himself his share of liquor owned in common but in unascertained proportions, in pursuance of a previous arrangement between the members, but was intended to apply to all sales by a club to its members of liquor owned in comr\u00f1on by the club. And this view of the opinion is confirmed by St. 1881, c. 226, Pub. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 45, providing that in towns in which the inhabitants vote that licenses shall not be granted, \u201c all buildings, places or tenements therein, used by clubs for the purpose of selling, distributing or dispensing to their members or others, intoxicating liquors, shall be deemed common nuisances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
