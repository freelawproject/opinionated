This order was irregular. Where the default of the party has been taken under a notice of motion served upon him, the moving party is entitled to no greater relief than that asked for in his notice, and, unless it is stated in the notice that he will ask for costs, he is not entitled to have them where the motion is granted by default. Costs cannot be granted upon a default under a notice of motion which asks for other and further relief. Crippin v. Ingersoll, 10 Wend. 603; Northrup v. Van Dusen, 5 How. Prac. 134. The motion, therefore, to resettle the order granted upon default should have been granted for the reason, stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The order denying that motion, therefore, must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
