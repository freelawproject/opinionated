Upon the return day of the summons, and upon the filing of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the defendant filed an affidavit with the justice, setting forth that the justice before whom the cause was pending \u201cis a material witness for this deponent in the said cause, and that he cannot safely proceed to the trial thereof without the testimony of the said Justice G. R. Jacobson.\u201d \u201cAnd this deponent further says that he expects to prove by the said justice the following facts and circumstances [to wit]: That on the 2d day of February inst., and at the time of the issuing of the summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>in this cause or proceeding, he (the said Oscar Bronson, plaintiff!) acknowledged and said to said justice that this deponent did not owe l)im anything, and he did not expect to recover, and that he had paid him in full, but he (this deponent) had acted unfairly, and he (the said plaintiff) meant to make him suffer for it, and that he sued him to make costs and trouble; and deponent further says that he is unable to prove the said admissions by any other person than the said justice.\u201d This affidavit was subscribed and sworn to by the defendant. Notwithstanding the filing of this affidavit, the justice proceeded with the trial of the action, the defendant not participating therein. The trial resulted in the rendition of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and against the defendant. In the view that is taken of the case by this court, it is unnecessary to state any facts relating to the merits of the case.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b514-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

At the time the case of Young v. Scott, 3 Hill, 32, was decided, the statute provided for an affidavit similar to that now required, and provided that, upon filing of such an affidavit, the case should be discontinu\u00e9d, \u201cif the justice shall be satisfied that he is a material witness for the defendant, and that without his testimony he cannot safely proce\u00e9d to trial, and not otherwise.\u201d Under that'law, the court held that, while the justice could judge of the sufficiency of the affidavit, yet he could not refuse a discontinuance, upon the ground that he did not recollect the facts which the defendant expected to prove by him. The words of the present statute, \u201csatisfactory proof,\u201d mean practically the same thing as the words \u201cif the justice shall be satisfied,\u201d in the'former; and it seems to me that the same construction should be given to the present statute as was given to the former one, and he now has, as'the court decided he then had, the power to pass upon the sufficiency of the affidavit,\u2014that is, whether it contains the statutory requirements, and whether the facts and circumstances which he specifies as those he expects to prove by him constitute him a material witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">In this case the justice did not pass upon the sufficiency of' the affi davit. If he had, his action could be reviewed upon appeal. He disposed of the matter by simply saying the affidavit was false. The return says: \u201cThe court, knowing the statement was not true, denied the motion.\u201d If an affidavit can be disposed of in that way, then the question is beyond review. The appellate court has no means of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>termining who tells the truth, and the justice will then have it in his power arbitrarily to defeat a defendant\u2019s application, deprive him of a necessary witness, and not have his action in that respect reviewable upon appeal. The power to pass upon the sufficiency of an affidavit does not mean the power to determine as to its truth or falsity. That is not the test of sufficiency. If there is any issue of veracity between the justice and the defendant, that issue cannot be tried before such justice, and upon his unsworn statement opposed to the defendant\u2019s affidavit, but before another magistrate, where both testify as witnesses under the solemnity of an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In Hopkins v. Cabrey, 24 Wend. 264, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cThe justice had no right to interpose his private knowledge or recollection as an answer to the affidavit. Doing so would enable a. justice to defeat the application, and at the same time to put the point beyond the reach of review, even on the facts which he may assume to know or to have forgotten. Here, it is true, he states them, but not under his oath as a witness. That the defendant has a right to require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In the case before us, as we have seen, the justice simply pronounces the defendant\u2019s affidavit false. That is not a determination of its sufficiency. I think the affidavit was sufficient, and that it was the duty of the justice to transfer the case. The fact that the defendant, in his affidavit, asked that the case should be dismissed, instead of transferred, is not material. Upon filing the proper affidavit, the statute makes it the duty of the justice forthwith to transfer the trial and determination of the cause to another magistrate; and because the defendant mistakenly asked for a dismissal, instead of a transfer of the action, makes no difference as to the magistrate\u2019s duty, nor cures the error in his proceeding in violation of the statute, and for that error the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Judgment of the county court and of the justice\u2019s court reversed, with costs to the appellant in both courts, together with the costs and.' disbursements of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
