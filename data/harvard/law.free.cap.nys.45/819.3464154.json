The verdict for six cents and the judgment must be set aside, however, on the ground of inadequacy of damages. McDonald v. Walter, 40 N. Y. 551; Kelly v. City of Rochester (Sup.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 29. In an action for damages for slander, malicious prosecution, and such like, a jury can find six cents damages, but in an action like the one at bar, and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the evidence presented, when once the jury determine in favor of the plaintiff, the measure of damages must be based on-the evidence, and not on outside speculation. The evidence was that the plaintiff had spent in repairing the wagon $61.25, and that the actual damages, all told, were between the sum of $75 and $100, and that he was deprived of the use of the wagon a month or a little more. The jury must find for some sum based on the evidence. This they did not, and the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">VAN WYCK, C.
