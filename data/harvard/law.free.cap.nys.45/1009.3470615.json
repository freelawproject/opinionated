As matter of defense, the defendant alleged in his answer, and proved upon the trial, that the plaintiff extended the time of payment of such indebtedness, and, to that end, accepted defendant\u2019s several notes, the face value of which aggregated the amount of defendant\u2019s indebtedness; and that not one of such notes had matured at the time of the commencement of this action.* The action was therefore prematurely brought. Martens-Turner Co. v. Mackintosh, 45 N. Y. Supp. 275, handed down May 7th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
