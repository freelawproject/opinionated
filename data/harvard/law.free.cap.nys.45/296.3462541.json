This appeal must be determined upon the provisions of the Code as they existed prior to the amendments to sections 382 and 3017 by chapter 307 of the Laws of 1894. Under the law as it then was, no action could be .brought upon a judgment of a justice\u2019s court after the expiration of six years from its rendition by the justice. Dieffenbach v. Roch, 112 N. Y. 621, 20 N. E. 560. The appellant contends that, the statute of limitations having run against said judgment so as to prevent the commencement of an action thereupon, the judgment has become dead, and ineffective, and that there is no authority to issue an execution thereon. It has heretofore been held that the statute of limitations acts simply upon the remedy, but does not impair the obligation. Waltermire v. Westover, 14 N. Y. 16; Johnson v. Railroad Co., 54 N. Y. 416-424. It follows from that that the statute of limitations prohibiting the commencement of an action upon such a judgment after the expiration of six years does not impair the obligation of the judgment, and is only effectual to cut off that remedy, and does not interfere with any other remedy to enforce the obligation thereof. Accordingly it has been repeatedly held that courts may, by an order, permit an execution to be issued upon the judgments of courts not of record after the expiration of six years from their rendition. Townsend v. Tolhurst, 57 Hun, 40, 10 N. Y. Supp. 378; Bolt v. Hauser, 57 Hun, 567, 11 N. Y. Supp. 366, 368; Anderson v. Porter (Com. Pl.) 27 N. Y. Supp. 646; Agar v. Curtiss, 8 App. Div. 337, 40 N. Y. Supp. 815, and cases cited. This practice has been too long settled by the courts to warrant our interfering with it now, and the order appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
