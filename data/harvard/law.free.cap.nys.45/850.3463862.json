Though such an order is reviewable by this court, and we might, on an original application, have been more exacting as to the reasons for judicial action, there is not enough in the record to establish a case \"where the discretion has been abused to a degree that calls for interference by an appellate tribunal. The order was made upon chapter 748 of the Laws of 1896 (amending section 1367 of the consolidation act), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-18\">\u201cThe court or any justice holding the same, may at any time, upon motion made upon such notice as. the justice may direct, open any default, and set aside, vacate or modify any judgment entered thereon, and set the cause down for pleading, hearing or trial, as the case may require, upon such terms and conditions as the court or justice may deem proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>The act also requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">\u201cAn order of a justice opening a default and setting aside * * * a judgment entered thereon * * * shall recite and contain the grounds for the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">As the power to malte the order appealed from is derived from this statute, it must appear from the order made that the statute has been strictly complied with. In this instance the order does not recite and contain the grounds for the order, and they are left to mere inference or conjecture. For this reason the order appealed from must be reversed, with costs, and the cause remitted to the district court for the entry of the proper order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
