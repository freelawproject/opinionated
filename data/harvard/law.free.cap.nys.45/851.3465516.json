Defendant testified that she acted only as agent for her husband; that the bank account was in her name for convenience only; and that she executed the chattel mortgage in the absence of her husband as his agent. The goods were charged on the seller\u2019s books to the husband, in whose name the hotel business was conducted shortly before the sales in question. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence sustained a finding that the sales were made to defendant personally, and not as agent for her husband.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b877-12\">Appeal from Eleventh district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b877-13\">Action by George B.

The issue in the case was whether the wife was the husband\u2019s agent, or he her agent, under the circumstances disclosed; and we think that there was ample evidence in support of the justice\u2019s finding that the wife, this defendant, was the principal in the matter of the request for and delivery of these goods. Plaintiff\u2019s assignors, th\u00e9 sellers, conducted a grocery business, and their representative called regularly at the hotel conducted by the defendant (or her husband, as she claims), and received orders for groceries, which were accordingly delivered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Prior to the 15th of December, 1896, goods so delivered had been' paid for by the defendant\u2019s husband, but after that date the checks received in payment were those of the defendant, who apparently had charge of the hotel, and to whom the grocer\u2019s representative was referred for instructions and orders by the servants upon the premises. The testimony also shows that the grocer\u2019s clerk was referred to the defendant by her husband, upon an occasion when he sought to have an order of the bartender approved by the husband, who stated that defendant \u201chad all to do with the orders.\u201d It was made to appear, further, that Mrs. Rohde, the defendant, executed a chattel mortgage of the fixtures of this hotel, as mortgagor, shortly before the period in question, and also that negotiations were had with the plaintiff\u2019s assignors by her, apparently in her individual capacity, touching an extension of time for payment for the goods in suit, her promise being that payment would be niade. Against this the defendant testified that she acted solely as agent for her husband; that the bank account was in her name for convenience only, her husband\u2019s night duties about the hotel being such that his' early rising in time for the payment of certain bills was inexpedient; that the chattel mortgage was executed by her in the absence of her husband, as agent (but this was not expressed in the instrument); and that her negotiations with the grocers were had in her husband\u2019s behalf. To us it appears that there was ample evidence in support of the fact that the defendant was the party to whom the credit in this transaction was given by the plaintiff\u2019s assignors, and that the reliance upon her apparent capacity as principal, rather than as agent, was justified by the facts. It is true that the account in question was carried in the name of the husband upon the books of this firm of grocers, but this was not controlling upon the rights of the parties, if the actual debtor\u2014the party whose credit was relied upon\u2014was in fact some one other than the person named upon the books (Adolff v. Schmitt, 13 Misc. Rep. 623, 34 N. Y. Supp. 930; Foster v. Persch, 68 N. Y. 400); and the justice was authorized in finding upon this conflict of evidence that credit was actually given to the defendant, or that she was .the true principal in the matter, undisclosed at the time, but properly sued when discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
