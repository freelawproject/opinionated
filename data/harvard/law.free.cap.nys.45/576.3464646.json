The notice of appeal also contains a notice that the appellant \u201cwill bring up for review the order entered herein, made on February 1,1897, directing the undersigned to pay over the money therein referred to&gt; and from each and every part of said order.\u201d The order to which such notice refers is a judge\u2019s order in supplementary proceedings, and cannot be reviewed on an appeal to this court. Such an order can-only be reviewed in the first instance by the court out of which the execution was issued upon a motion to vacate or modify it. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2433. Nor can the court, on the appeal from the order adjudging the appellant guilty of contempt in failing to obey the judge\u2019s order directing him to pay over certain moneys, inquire whether the latter order was improvidently or erroneously granted. The supreme court justice who made the order had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the parties. ' The order, therefore, was not void. If it was erroneous, appellant\u2019s remedy was by way of a motion to vacate or modify it, but so long as it remained in force it was his duty to obey it, and the duty of the court to enforce obedience to it.

E. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
