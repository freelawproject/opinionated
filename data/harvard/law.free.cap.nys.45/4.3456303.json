The evidence was clearly sufficient to support the verdict which the jury rendered for the defendant, and this seems to be conceded. Our attention is called only to alleged errors in the charge, and the admission and exclusion of evidence. It was charged that: \u201cThe omission of the driver to stop the car on the request of the plaintiff would not justify or excuse the act of the plaintiff in attempting to alight from the front platform of the car, while the car was in motion, and the horses on a trot, if you find from the evidence that was the fact.\u201d To this the plaintiff excepted. It is claimed that the jury were here instructed that, if the plaintiff in fact attempted to get off the car while it was in motion, this was, as matter of law, contributory negligence. We do not concur in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>this construction of the charge. It had previously been charged, with great clearness and distinctness, that it was for the jury to say whether the plaintiff was negligent in getting off when he did, if they found that the car was then in motion. The charge above quoted merely supplemented this by an instruction that such negligence, if found, was in no manner excused by the driver\u2019s failure to stop at request. This charge was perfectly correct. It did not conflict with the former, and the jury could not have been misled. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel also asked the court to charge \u201cthat, even if the passenger knew there was a rule that he must wait until the car crosses the street, that, if the jury believed the driver stopped the car, so as to enable him to alight, before he crossed, he was justified in getting off the car.\u201d The court said: \u201cI leave it to you, gentlemen,1 to say whether, under all the circumstances of the case, it was an act of a prudent man to get off as he did, as I have before charged.\u201d The modification was proper. The car might have slowed up, and yet not sufficiently to make it safe for the plaintiff to alight. It was for the jury to say whether, under all the circumstances, his conduct was reasonably careful and prudent. .</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The car in which the plaintiff was riding was going across town, in an easterly direction, on East Broadway. One of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, who had a store on the corner of East Broadway and Pike street, where the accident occurred, was asked on cross-examination whether cars did hot always stop on the east corner of Pike street when proceeding east. This was objected to, the objection overruled, and an exception taken. The witness answered in the affirmative. There was also introduced in evidence, over the plaintiff\u2019s exception, an order of the superintendent of police, issued in 1882, directing all drivers of cross-town cars going east to stop at easterly crossings. This evidence was properly admitted. It was the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff attempted to get off even before the car reached the westerly crossing, and that he gave no notice of his intention. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that he asked the conductor to stop at the westerly crossing; that the latter acquiesced, and slowed up; and that he suddenly started up again before the plaintiff was able to get off. The regular practice and custom, which the evidence in question tended to establish, to stop at the easterly corner, was certainly competent to show the greater probability of the defendant\u2019s theory, and the testimony in support of it. The testimony last above quoted does not depend for its admissibility upon the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, or presumed knowledge, of the custom. That is, in fact, quite immaterial. Whether the plaintiff knew of the custom or not, he was not justified in trying to get off of the car if it did not, in fact, stop, but was proceeding at a rate of speed which made it dangerous to attempt to alight. This disposes of an exception taken by the plaintiff to the refusal to charge, otherwise than had been already charged, that the plaintiff was not bound by the rule of the superintendent of police unless he had knowledge of it. All that was necessary had been already said on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>subject, and the request as made was misleading. Whether or not the plaintiff was bound by the rule in question, he was certainly bound not to get off the car while it was proceeding at a dangerous rate. The request tends to indicate that, if the plaintiff had a right to think the car would stop at the near crossing, he might try. to get off there, whether it did or not. So far as this is not the tendency of the request, it is entirely irrelevant and immaterial. '</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">At the trial a roundsman and police officer, who were present at the scene of the accident shortly after it occurred, testified that the plaintiff admitted that he got off while the car was in motion, and that he alone was to blame. It also appeared incidentally that the driver was arrested. At the defendant's request, it was charged that the jury were not to consider this fact at all. This amounted to a refusal to charge an immediately preceding request of the plaintiff\u2019s that the fact was to be considered in determining whether the testimony given as to. the plaintiff's admissions was true. Concededly the evidence was not competent on the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence, and we do not think it had any legitimate bearing on the particular head pointed out. It was not for the police officers to pass upon the question of who was to blame. It was a proper subject for judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">None of the other questions presented seem to require special mention. We think the judgment is right, and should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
