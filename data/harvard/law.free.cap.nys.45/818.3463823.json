The appellant contends that, because it is not alleged that the note was payable at a specified time, the complaint' is insufficient. The absence of siich an allegation raises the presumption that no time of payment was specified in the note. Where no time or place of payment is specified in a promissory note, it is payable immediately, and payment thereof may be demanded of the maker at any time and place where he can be found. The judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">McCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
