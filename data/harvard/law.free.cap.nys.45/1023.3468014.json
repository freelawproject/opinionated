The plaintiff alleges in his complaint \u201cthat, prior to the commencement of this action, the said Mary 'Corner duly assigned and transferred to this plaintiff the said claim and demand for the said rent,\u201d and the writing objected to is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-21\">\u201cI hereby authorize and direct E. L. Hartley, of the city of New York, to ask, demand, sue for, and receive, and collect from Kate Mullane and Erank P. Roberge, of the city of New York, any and all rent that may be due or accrued from the premises occupied by them or either of them, 1731 Broadway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>New York, and hereby assign and transfer to said F. L. Hartley any interest I may have in said rent aforesaid,\u201d\u2014signed \u201cMary Corner,\u201d and witnessed by F. H. Gray.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">It is further alleged in the complaint that one Adelaide C. Fitzpatrick, the original landlord of the defendant, had transferred the premises 1731 Broadway to plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and the action was brought to recover the rent of the premises for the months of November and December, 1896, and January and February, 1897, during which time the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was the owner of the property. We are unable to discover wherein the assignment offered in evidence fails to conform to the one described in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">The only other exception taken by the defendant appears at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. After the plaintiff had rested, the defendant made a motion in the following words: \u201cWe move to dismiss on the usual grounds.\u201d We are unaware of any such grounds being a ground for the dismissal of a complaint, and know of no such grounds for dismissals of complaints generally. The motion having been denied, the defendant offered no evidence, and did not even think it worth while to except to the direction of the verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The appeal is without merit, and the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
