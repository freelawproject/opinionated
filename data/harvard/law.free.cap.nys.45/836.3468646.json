While we do not hold that there may not have been sufficient cause other than that, to permit the surrogate to make the order, it cannot be seen that such fact did not have some, or a controlling, influence upon'the result. And as we determined upon review of the surrogate\u2019s decree in the accounting proceeding that the executor was not required to account for such profits, the order appealed from, so far as it revokes his letters testamentary, should be reversed, without prejudice to the right of the respondents to renew the application for the revocation of them. Let the proceeding be remitted to the surrogate\u2019s court to proceed therein. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
