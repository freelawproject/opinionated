An action to foreclose the lien referred to was begun, and judgment was finally entered therein by which it was adjudged that the lienors acquired a valid mechanic\u2019s lien upon and against the land and premises referred to; that it was a valid and continuing lien against such land and premises until it was discharged by the filing of a bond (being the same bond as that upon which this action is brought). It is now objected by the defendant that he is not liable upon this bond, because the judgment entered in the foreclosure action does not contain any provision for the enforcement of the lien against the property; that that judgment merely declares that the lien was a valid lien, discharged by the giving of the bond; that, the bond being conditioned only for the payment of \u201cany judgment that may be rendered against said property in any proceeding to enforce the foregoing lien,\u201d the condition of the bond differs from the provision of the judgment, and therefore there is no liability on the surety\u2019s contract. The point is not a new one in this court, and is not well taken. It involves simply the question of the construction of the condition of the bond, and that construction was given by this court in the case of Ringle v. Matthiessen, 10 App. Div. 274, 41 N. Y. Supp. 962. It is only necessary to repeat here what was declared in that case, viz. that, if the construction contended for by the defendant were to be maintained, the lien of the plaintiffs would be destroyed, and in its place be substituted a bond, the condition of which could never be broken, because after the giving of the bond no judgment can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ever be rendered against the property itself. Therefore, to repeat again what was said in Morton v. Tucker, 145 N. Y. 248, 40 N. E. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cThe sureties in the bond intended, and must be understood as undertaking, to pay the amount which it should be adjudged was due and owing to the plaintiffs, and which was chargeable against the property by virtue of their notice of the lien. In other words, the condition was for the payment of any judgment which might have been rendered against the property had not the bond been given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
