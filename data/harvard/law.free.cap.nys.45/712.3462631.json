The ground of the defendants\u2019 demurrer is that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. As the facts are alleged in the complaint, the consequences may be deemed to have been the proximate result of the negligence of the defendants\u2019 testator. Scott v. Brown, 24 Hun, 620. It.is, however, urged and argued at length by the learned counsel for the defendants that the alleged cause of action did not survive the death of the defendants\u2019 testator. We are unable in this respect to distinguish this case, in principle, from that of Cregin v. Railroad Co., 75 N. Y. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Upon the authority of that case, the judgment must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Defendants may have leave to appeal to the court of appeals, if they so elect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
