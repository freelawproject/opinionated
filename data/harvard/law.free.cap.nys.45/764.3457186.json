The evidence of the plaintiff is: That he rendered services as a doctor for the defendant\u2019s husband in his lifetime. That, upon one of his calls, defendant\u2019s husband paid him $1. After the husband\u2019s death, the plaintiff presented his bill for such services to the defendant. She paid him $5, and offered to pay him $20 in settlement of the bill, saying to him that he had better take $20 or nothing. No evidence was given upon the part of the defendant. The .justice rendered judgment against the defendant. The defendant appealed to the county court. The county court affirmed the judgment, and from such judgment of affirmance the defendant appeals to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b790-13\">Argued before PARKER, P.

We do not think the facts proved are, under the circumstances of this case, sufficient to establish an account stated between the parties. The plaintiff\u2019s own evidence shows that all the services rendered by him were for the defendant\u2019s husband personally. There is no pretense that the defendant ever employed him, or in any way suggested or requested that he attend her husband. There were never any dealings between the plaintiff and \"defendant prior to her husband\u2019s death. There was no legal or equitable claim upon the defendant by the plaintiff, and hence there was nothing upon which an account could be stated. Field v. Knapp, 108 N. Y. 87, 14 N. E. 829. The judgment should therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Judgment of the county court and of the justice\u2019s court reversed, with costs and disbursements of this appeal, and with costs and disbursements of the county court and of the justice\u2019s court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
