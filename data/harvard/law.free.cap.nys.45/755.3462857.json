Upon the last-named day it appeared that the justice had on April 28th filed a return, in which it is stated that the action is for goods sold and delivered, and the answer a general denial, and that the trial resulted in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $26.16, and $4.50 costs. The justice further returned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">\u201cThe stenographer being absent, I refused to try the case; but, upon the consent of counsel for both parties, the matter was tried before me, and judgment rendered upon the evidence taken. I do not now remember any part of the evidence given at the trial, no notes having been taken by me at the trial; consequently, have nothing in my possession to refresh my memory. The exhibits offered in evidence are hereunto annexed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">It was admitted by the respective counsel that neither had taken any notes of the evidence; so that no copy of the evidence could be furnished to the justice for his guidance, and they would have to rely entirely upon their memories for a statement of what occurred, respecting which they seem unable to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The presumption is always in favor of the judgment, and, where a return or case on appeal does not contain the evidence, it will be inferred that the evidence warrants the judgment. Norton v. Matthews, 11 Misc. Rep. 711, 31 N. Y. Supp. 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Baylies, in his work on New Trials, at page 174, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">\u201cAn appellate court presumes nothing In favor of the party alleging error, and if compelled, through imperfection in the statement of facts contained in the appeal book, to resort to presumptions, will adopt such only as will sustain the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">See, also, Carman v. Pultz, 21 N. Y. 547; Smith v. Newland, 9 Hun, 553, 554; Phillip v. Gallant, 62 N. Y. 256, 265; Tomlinson v. Mayor, 44 N. Y. 601; Hughes v. Hughes, 10 Misc. Rep. 180, 183, 30 N. Y. Supp. 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Hence the rule that an appellant, in order to prove error, must insert in his case, or cause to be inserted in the return, the evidence necessary to establish the error upon which he relies. The appellants having failed to observe this rule, they have not procured the return to be filed for which the adjournment was granted, and have not, therefore, excused the default which existed at the time of hearing the motion originally. It is unnecessary in the present instance to point out the remedy of an appellant where such a return is made, for it is sufficient for present purposes to hold that as the appellants were in default when the motion was heard, and have not in a satisfactory manner excused it, the motion must be granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
