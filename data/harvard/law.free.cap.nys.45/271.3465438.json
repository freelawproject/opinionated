This is not seriously disputed, but it is urged by the respondent that the rule granting the preference was made for the benefit of the defendant, and that, unless the latter moves, the plaintiff, not being injured, has no right to take advantage of the rule. The language employed, however, is not susceptible of any such construction. It defines under what conditions the trial of tire action shall be preferred, and, when the conditions are present, the benefit of the rule is as much available to the plaintiff as it is to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">As the court was therefore in error in construing the rule, the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a preference granted, with $10 costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
