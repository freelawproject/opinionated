The action is brought to recover damages for personal injuries occasioned by the negligence of the defendant. The question as to its negligence and of freedom from contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff has been properly submitted to the jury by the charge of the justice presiding at the trial, and the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>verdict is fully sustained by the evidence set forth in the case on appeal herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The appellant lays great stress upon the fact that some witnesses testified that, \u201cwhen the horse which was being driven by the plaintiff stepped on the west track,\u2014that is to say, the track upon which the accident occurred,\u2014the car upon that track was but five feet away from the plaintiff,\u201d and that that constitutes contributory negligence, as a matter of law; but, reading that portion of the testimony in connection with the other above referred to, that particular matter is not established as an absolute uncontradicted and conclusive fact, either by positive proof or by necessary inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The defendant\u2019s exception at folio 123, to the refusal of the court to charge \u201cthat there is no evidence of pleurisy, and the jury may not consider pleurisy, as it has not been pleaded,\u201d is not available, because the physician testified, without objection, that, when he first examined the plaintiff, he had pleurisy, and the court allowed the physician to explain what pleurisy was, which was perfectly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">The defendant further objected to the consideration of pleurisy because it had not been pleaded. The complaint further contains this general allegation: \u201cPlaintiff suffered severe bruises and pains for a time, by reason whereof he became swollen, etc., and was made sick, sore, and disabled.\u201d Under this general allegation, proof of pleurisy was allowable. Ehrgott v. Mayor, etc., 96 N. Y. 264, 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">The exception at folio 115 is not available. The defendant had called one Eeely in its behalf, and he testified that he was assistant claim agent of the Third Avenue Eailroad Company; that he served a certain witness Pollatchek with a subpoena to attend as a witness; that Pollatchek was in court at the time of the trial; and that at recess time he let him go away. The defendant\u2019s attorney asked him the question, \u201cWhy did you let him go?\u201d General objection called, stating no ground was raised. Objection sustained, and exception taken by the defendant. Defendant could not ask that question for a motive. The plaintiff, on cross-examination, could have done it. Furthermore, the motive of this assistant claim agent was not competent. The question is too insignificant to base a reversal upon its exclusion, because it is too evident that the jury did not base their verdict on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">The exception taken at folio 123 is not available. Defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge \u201cthat there is no evidence of permanent injury, and they may not find anything for permanent injury, if they find at all.\u201d The court said: \u201cI instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not claimed, in his complaint, damages upon an injury, but I submit the evidence as to his present condition to the jury for what it may be worth.\u201d The jury could not have been misled by this instruction, as it was substantially that no damages for permanent injury was claimed, and that they were not to consider any in that respect, but that, in regard to the injury sustained by the plaintiff, he would submit the whole evidence to them to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">The defendant further objected to the following question addressed to the physician, \u201cFrom the condition that you found this man in, and the subsequent treatment you gave him, could you state with reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>able certainty what the injuries he received came from?\u201d and took exception to its admission. The question called for an answer of \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cHo.\u201d The defendant did not move to strike out the answer as not being responsive, and the answer was certainly not prejudicial to the defendant, and the jury undoubtedly did not base their verdict upon this answer, because it is competent to ask a physician to tell from what causes the injured condition of a person may have resulted.

Supp. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">There appearing no reversible error, the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">O\u2019DWYER, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
