An order of arrest under the subdivision and section of the Code referred to cannot be granted before the existence of a complaint, inasmuch as the Code prescribes the remedy only in cases \u201cwhere it is alleged in the complaint that the defendant was guilty of fraud,\u201d and it is difficult to see how the court can learn what is alleged in the complaint when there is no complaint.
