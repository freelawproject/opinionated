The complaint sets forth a cause of action for use and occupation of part of a store, fixtures, mirror, and show case. It alleges that the plaintiff, as tenant of the superior landlord, was in the possession of the store and its appurtenances at Ho. 947 Broadway, and let part thereof to the defendants by a lease in writing, at an agreed-rent; that, beyond the parts of the store thus let, the defendants entered and took possession of the following parts and appurtenances of said store and premises during the following period (enumerating both), for use in the business carried on by them, and further alleges the reasonable value of the occupation and use of the premises and fixtures. In short, the complaint shows that plaintiff, owning the whole store, let part of it to the defendants, and, being the owner of the whole, the defendants used and occupied some portion of that. The defendants de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>mur, on the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The rule of law applicable to the question is \u201cthat possession and beneficial enjoyment of real property, with the permission of the owner, is ordinarily sufficient to sustain an action upon an implied, agreement for use and occupation.\u201d Preston v. Hawley, 139 N. Y. 296, at page 300, 34 N. E. 906, at page 908. But, where the use and occupation of real estate are under such circumstances as to show that there was no expectation of rent by either party, a contract to pay rent will not be implied. Preston v. Hawley, 139 N. Y. 301, 34 N. E. 906. This fact is, however, a question of proof at the trial, and, if the evidence is then adduced on that point, it becomes a question for the jury to determine. Collyer v. Collyer, 113 N. Y. 442, 21 N. E. 114; Lamb v. Lamb, 146 <em>N. </em>Y. 323, 41 <em>N. </em>E. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The complaint is a good pleading, and order and judgments appealed from are affirmed, with costs of each appeal, with leave to the defendants to answer on payment of all costs up to this time. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
