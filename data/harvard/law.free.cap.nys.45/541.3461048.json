It was brought to foreclose a bond and mortgage. We are of the opinion that under the provisions of section 757 of the Code of Civil Procedure the executor of the deceased was entitled to the order of continuance he applied for. The delay in making the application should not have prevented the granting of his motion, especially in the absence of any proof on the part of the defendant that his defense had been prejudiced thereby. Green v. Martine, 21 Hun, 136, 84 N. Y. 648; Holsman v. St. John, 90 N. Y. 461. The fact that the deceased party had omitted to pay the costs awarded against him on his application to reopen the case was not, under the provisions of section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a ground for denying the application to continue the action. Clute v. Emmerich (Sup.) 2 N. Y. Supp. 874. The executor\u2019s motion was not, we think, a proceeding in the action, .within the meaning of section 779, supra. It was a motion to substitute a living for a deceased party, in order that proceedings in the action might be taken. If, after the substitution of the executor as a party plaintiff, he proposes to proceed, the defendant may properly raise the objection that he should be stayed until the motion costs, if any are due,\u2014as to which we do not decide,\u2014are paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-17\">We conclude that the order should be reversed, and motion granted, without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to take such action as he may be advised to, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
