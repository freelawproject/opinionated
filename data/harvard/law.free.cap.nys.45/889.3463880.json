We are compelled to reverse the judgment entered upon this verdict, and order a new trial, by reason of an error committed by the trial judge in his instructions to the jury in regard to the elements which they could consider in assessing the plaintiff\u2019s damages. A physician, who made a physical examination of the plaintiff on the day before the trial, testified that he found him suffering from a hernia or rupture on the left side of his body. There was absolutely no evidence in the case from which it could be inferred that this rupture was caused by the accident which befell the plaintiff when he was lmocked down by the defendant\u2019s car. The plaintiff did not testify himself, and there was no testimony from any other person showing that the hernia did not exist prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">Upon this state of proof, the learned trial judge evidently entertained considerable doubt whether he ought to leave any question. concerning the hernia to the jury.. In the course of his charge, however, he referred to it in such a way as to convey the idea that its nonexistence before the accident might be inferred from the testimony to the effect that the plaintiff was then apparently in good health. At the close of the charge, he was asked by counsel for the defendant whether he had withdrawn from the consideration of the jury the question of rupture or hernia, to- which he responded, \u201cI think that is out of the case, practically.\u201d If the matter had rested here, there would have been no reversible error; but subsequently, after some remarks by the counsel for the plaintiff, the learned court, although again declaring that there was not any proof of the absence of hernia before the accident, said: \u201cI will not withdraw it entirely. I will leave it for the jury to consider in the light of all the evidence.\u201d The defendant\u2019s exception to this statement was well taken. All question concerning the hernia, as an element of damage, should have been withdrawn from the consideration of the jury by the trial judge. In view of what was said on the subject, it can hardly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>doubted that the jury; did consider it, and that the recovery in behalf of the plaintiff was thereby increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\">An error was also committed in the course of the trial in admitting testimony, against the objection of the defendant, to the effect that the plaintiff had been committed to the almshouse. We cannot perceive any purpose for which this evidence was introduced except to show that the plaintiff was a poor man, and thus excite sympathy in his behalf, and enhance the amount of damages which should be awarded by the jury. Evidence of this kind is not admissible. The amount of damages recoverable in a negligence suit cannot properly be affected by the poverty of the plaintiff. Shea v. Railroad Co., 44 Cal. 414; Mannion v. Hagan, 9 App. Div. 98, 41 N. Y. Supp. 86. As it turned out that the plaintiff remained in the almshouse only one day, it may be that the error in receiving this testimony could be disregarded, as harmless; but we think best to call attention to it, so that a similar mistake may not be made when the case comes to be tried again.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
