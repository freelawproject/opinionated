J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO7\">The receiver\u2019s motion was made under the provision of the Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-14\">\u201cIn case of a transfer of interest or devolution of liability, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court directs the person to whom the interest is transferred, or upon whom the liability is devolved, to be substituted in the action, or joined with the original party, as the case requires.\u201d Code, \u00a7 756.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">The city court denied the application of the receiver, on the ground that the attorney for the plaintiff had a much larger interest in the prospective recovery in the action than the plaintiff or its receiver, and that the interference of the receiver, whose appointment it was believed the defendant\u2019s attorney was instrumental in effecting, might be injurious to the interest of the plaintiff. As the granting or refusing of the motion for substitution seems to be discretionary with the court, there is nothing to review on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">It is argued, however, by appellant, that, while it may be within the discretion of the court to refuse substitution where the transfer of interest is voluntary, the right to substitution is absolute where the devolution of interest is by law, as in the case of the appointment of a receiver and the transfer of all the plaintiff\u2019s property to him. The Code makes no such distinction, nor is any case to be found which observes it. On the contrary, the section quoted requires that the action shall proceed in the name of the original party unless the court orders otherwise. The case is not the same as where, by the death of a party, the action abates until revived against the heirs or personal representatives, because no person is before the court to prosecute or defend, as in Requa v. Holmes (cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>by the appellant) 16 N. Y. 193. This corporation plaintiff is still in existence; the receiver not having been appointed in a proceeding to dissolve it, but in a proceeding to sequestrate its property to satisfy a creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Platt v. McMurray, 63 How. Prac. 149, and Vieller v. Brown, 1 Law Bul. 49, are relied upon by the appellant; but the former went no further than to hold that it was not improper to substitute an assignee in bankruptcy as a party, and in the. latter no opinion appears to have been written. In cases of bankruptcy of the party, the substitution of his assignee in bankruptcy is invariably granted, as without him the action becomes thereby defective. Requa v. Holmes, above, and cases cited. I find no authority for holding that the rule in cases of bankruptcy applies to a party and his receiver in cases of sequestration under the Code. The substitution of one receiver for another is not indispensable, but the case may proceed in the name of the original plaintiff. Hegewisch v. Silver, 140 N. Y. 420, 35 N. E. 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
