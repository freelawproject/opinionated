J.</author>\n<p id=\"AobE\">The complaint is upon a promissory note of $257, made by defendants. The answer specially admits every allegation of complaint except nonpayment of the note, and affirmatively alleges that plaintiffs, through their attorneys duly authorized, after commencement of action, made a proposition in writing to settle for $50 cash, and balance to be paid in monthly installment\u00bb of $50 each, which was accepted by defendants through their attorneys in writ- ' ing. Appellants contend that this is not an allegation of an agreement between the parties to extend the time of payment of a debt ad- \u00b0 mittedly due and owing, but of a stipulation in writing of the attorneys of record in the action, and binding on the parties thereto, although without consideration, but concede that such an agreement made by the parties themselves before action would have no \u2022binding force, unless a consideration therefor was alleged. The al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>legation is not of a stipulation by attorneys, but of an agreement between the parties by their attorneys. He who acts through another acts himself. An agreement by a creditor to extend time of payment of debt admittedly due must be supported by a consideration. This rule is not changed because such agreement was made by the creditor after service of summons on the debtor, who admits that the debt is due and owing. Of course, it would be otherwise if the debtor disputed the claim, or contended that it was not due. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">FITZSIMONS and Hc'CARTHY, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
