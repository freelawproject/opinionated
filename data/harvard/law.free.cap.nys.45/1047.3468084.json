Menton, as a contractor, against the property described in the complaint. Subsequent to the filing of this lien the defendant Menton had the same discharged by the giving of a bond pursuant to the statute in such cases made and provided, with the defendants Catherine Tewkes and Christopher J. Sullivan as sureties. The case shows that on the trial, with the consent of all the attorneys for the parties hereto, a jury was impaneled to determine and render a special verdict on the question of fact arising out of the contract, and alleged in the fourth paragraph of the complaint. The question was submitted to the jury, and they rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. At the close of the trial, defendants\u2019 attorney moved for a new trial, which was denied, but, as no order was entered denying the motion, we cannot consider the facts on this appeal. Gibson v. Denton, 4 App. Div. 198, 38 N. Y.
