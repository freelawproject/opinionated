Such bonds, and not less than 80 per cent, of the stock, shall be divided among the subscribers hereto each month, as advances are made, pro rata, according to the amounts advanced.\u201d The agreement also provided \"that after the subscribers to the fund herein provided for shall receive the amounts they each have actually paid in, together with interest thereon, and after the payment of all debts and expenses incurred in the prosecution of the work, the balance remaining shall be divided pro rata amongst all the subscribers to the fund.\u201d The subscribers to the agreement advanced to the railroad company $270,000, being the $250,000 subscribed, increased by a further call of 8 per centum. Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark advanced $144,500. For what sum the railroad company should execute its mortgage was not stated in the agreement, but it afterwards did execute it for $375,000, and made its bonds for a like amount, with interest coupons annexed thereto. The railroad company placed all the bonds in the hands of one Camp, as custodian, and for proper distribution. Camp issued the bonds to each subscriber as called for, to an amount equal to the amount paid by him, up to $252,000 in the aggregate; the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company receiving $144,500 in bonds. The rest of the bonds, except $15,500, were held for the unpaid subscribers, or used by the railroad company as collateral; $15,500 were never issued to any one. When Camp delivered the bonds to each subscriber to-the syndicate agreement, the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company among others, or to a creditor as collateral, he cut therefrom the past-due coupons, and retained them. The coupons which Camp thus cut off and retained amounted to $26,325. The Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company pledged all of the bonds which it received to its creditors as collateral, and of these it pledged to the respondent the American Exchange National Bank $39,000 of the bonds of the railroad company, with coupons thereafter to 'mature; and the bank surrendered the coupons of these bonds as they matured to the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, upon its request. Neither the railroad company, nor the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company or firm, paid any of the coupons; but the latter company asked for and received them of the bank, the company\u2019s purpose being to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>protect the credit of the railroad and the credit of the bonds as collateral, and its own credit, as the owners of the bonds, from the injury which the default in payment of the coupons would cause. Clark, through whom these coupons were thus taken up, was president of the railroad company, and member of the firm of Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark, and of the corporation successor of such firm, the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, and also its treasurer. The case states that, in like manner, the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company pledged other railroad bonds to its other creditors, and took up the coupons, never paying anything upon them, except once, when the company paid the creditor the maturing coupons held by him, in the sum of $812, and took them up. The total coupons thus obtained by the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, and which came to the hands of its receivers, amount to $17,040, whereof $812 are the paid-up coupons.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The receivers claim: (1) That the $17,040 of coupons should be admitted to participation in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property; (2) that under the contract of August 21, 1889, they are entitled to have distributed to them a dividend upon their pro rata share of the $15,500 of bonds which were never issued; (3) and, in like manner, upon the $26,325 of the past-due coupons which Camp, the custodian, cut from all the bonds before he issued them.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">It is a sufficient answer to the second and third claims that these bonds and coupons were never issued to anybody by the railroad company, and therefore never had an inception as obligations. The railroad company, by the agreement of August 29, 1889, did not undertake to issue any more bonds than would be necessary to complete and equip its railroad and pay its debts; but it did undertake to issue stock, and let the subscribers to the agreement have 80 per cent, of it, in addition to an amount of bonds equal to their respective advances; and it is no doubt with reference to the unissued 20 per cent, of stock that the provision in the contract respecting' the division of the balance among the subscribers refers. Besides, it does not appear that the debts of the railroad company are paid. Only the mortgagor, mortgagee, and lienors are parties to this action. The railroad company was not a party to any agreement among the subscribers to divide this surplus of bonds among themselves. As to the coupons to the amount of $812, the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company paid them, to give further credit to the bonds. The company did not buy them. They were canceled on their face. As to the party receiving the payment the coupons cannot be revived. As to every other bondholder the payment still exists, and the company has no equity against him to insist that it shall not continue. Its remedy is against the railroad company; and thus these coupons must be excluded from participation in the distribution. Union Trust Co. v. Monticello &amp; P. J. Ry. Co., 63 N. Y. 311; Hollister v. Stewart, 111 N. Y. 644-663, 19 N. E. 782; Wood v. Trust Co., 128 U. S. 416, 9 Sup. Ct. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>As <em>to </em>the balance of these coupons, $16,228, they were surrendered to the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company by its several pledgees. How many of them the American Exchange National Bank surrendered does not appear. But, whatever the amount, it would be inequitable that they should now be used to deplete the amount distributable upon the bonds from which they were taken. The Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company retired them to protect and prolong the security afforded by such bonds; and for the pledgor who did so with that intent to use them to impair the security still remaining with the pledgee would be in violation of the contract implied by the transaction and the equities resulting from it. It certainly never entered the. mind of the pledgee when it surrendered the coupons (and the pledgor did not intend that it should) that in parting with the coupons he was creating a charge against the principal of the bond. Cases above cited; Haven v. Depot Co., 109 Mass. 88; Railway Co. v. Gest, 34 Fed. 628. But we do not see how this transaction between the pledgor and a single pledgee can inure to the benefit of any other pledgee, not a party to it or influenced by it (Ketchum v. Duncan, 96 U. S. 671), nor how the American Exchange National Bank can take any benefit from the like transaction between the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company and any other pledgee, in the absence of evidence that the bank was influenced by it. The coupons in the hands of the receivers are still the unpaid obligations of the railroad company, and they may insist upon their payment against every other holder of the railroad bonds than those who were led to take them from the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, or to extend time of payment, upon the company\u2019s assurance, express or implied, that it had retired, or would retire, such coupons as they matured; and it does not appear that any creditor was influenced by any other transaction with the company than his own. It is conceivable that, if any of the coupons had gone to protest, all of the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company\u2019s pledgees would have taken alarm, and would have refused to extend further credit without further security. But this is too conjectural to support a finding of fact to such effect. As the record stands, we have no sufficient evidence upon which to extend to any other pledgee of the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company the like relief extended to the American Exchange National Bank. As the appellants, the receivers of the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, are entitled to participate in the dividend with respect to $16,228 of their coupons, the bondholders should, in the new distribution, be permitted to add their past-due coupons to their bonds. We understand that this was not done in the distribution under review, because, all the coupons being excluded, the result would be about the same as if the coupons had been added to the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">The judgment and order should be modified by admitting the appellants\u2019 coupons to the amount of $16,228 to participation in the distribution, except as against the American Exchange National Bank in respect to the coupons surrendered by the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, with costs to the appellants out of the fund; and the case is sent back to the referee for a further report. The method of computation accompanies this opinion. All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Method of computation: As the bank Is entitled to one rate per cent, against the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company, and a smaller rate against the other distributees, first compute the amount due all the distributees as if all were equal. Then compute the amount due the bank at the rate allowed the bank against the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company. Find the difference between the two dividends thus computed upon the bank\u2019s claim. Take this difference from the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company\u2019s dividend, thus reducing the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company\u2019s dividend by the sum that the bank\u2019s dividend is increased. Thus, suppose the sum to be distributed is $100,000, and the total claims $484,000; then rate per cent, would be 100As4 per cent. Suppose the bank returned to the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company $4,000 of their $16,230 of coupons; then the bank\u2019s rate against the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company would be 100,000/480,000, or i <em>oo/4 </em>g0 per cent. Say the bank claims $40,000; then the bank\u2019s actual dividend is 100/48o per cent, thereof, or $8,333.33; and i\u00b0\u00b0/4S4 per cent, is $8,264.46,\u2014difference, $68.87, which take from the Moffett, Hodgkins &amp; Clark Company\u2019s dividend, computed at 100/484 per cent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
