The judgment was obtained on default of the defendant in pleading. The affidavit of service contained in the judgment roll proves a personal service of the summons on the defendant. The judgment itself, as entered on October 7, 1896, recites the following facts: \u201cThe summons and complaint in this action having been personally served on the defendant,\u201d etc. It does not appear that the defendant\u2019s default was ever opened or excused, nor the judgment vacated or set aside or interfered with in any manner, and it therefore stands as a valid record and adjudication. The order in the supplementary proceedings recites all the necessary jurisdictional facts, and is fully supported by the proofs contained in the affidavit on which it was granted. The defendant, Theresa Unger, in her affidavit, denies that she was personally served with the summons, and testifies that she never saw it until it was shown her by her husband. Her husband, Robert Unger, in his affidavit, states \u201cthat the summons and complaint were not personally served on Ms wife, but was left with Mm in her absence by a clerk,\u201d etc. Upon this conflict of evidence in regard to the service of the summons upon the defendant, and considering that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>the defendant never moved to open the default or vacate the judgment, we think the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
