The defendant, a common carrier, received from the plaintiff a bicycle, which it undertook to deliver to her at Sussex, in the province of New Brunswick, dominion of Canada, at the same time taking from her what was called an \u201cinvoice,\u201d which was a statement as to the* value of the bicycle, signed by the plaintiff, and which was required to import this bicycle into the dominion of Canada. The bicycle was never delivered to the plaintiff at Sussex. No tender of it was ever made to her there, and it has never been transported by the defendant to Sussex; the defendant having entirely failed to comply with its contract. The plaintiff promptly notified the agent of the defendant at Sussex of the shipment of this article, and that it had not been delivered to her, and she demanded its delivery. No effort appears to have been made by the defendant to comply with its obligations; and later, in July, a letter was written by Mr. Davenport, as representing the plaintiff, stating the loss of the bicycle, and demanding payment of its value; and it was not until the 7th day of August\u2014just two months after the delivery of the .bicycle to the defendant for transportation\u2014that the defendant seems to have made any effort to comply with its contract. It then wrote a letter from Boston, Mass., to Miss Mitchell, at Sussex, New Brunswick, stating that they had on hand a bicycle addressed to her, but could not forward it without an invoice from the party who shipped it, and requesting her to cause the shipper to fill out \u201cthe inclosed declaration,\u201d in which case it would be shipped to her. The evidence is that this notification to her came so late that the delivery of the article to her at Sussex would be of no use to her at that time; that the object for which she had purchased the bicycle was to use it during her vacation in Canada; that the bicycle itself was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>of no value to her in New York or Brooklyn, where she resided; and that in consequence thereof the bicycle had become valueless to her because of the neglect of the defendant to to comply with its contract. Upon this the court gave the plaintiff a judgment for \u00a750 as the value of the bicycle, and it is from that judgment that the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">The defendant admits that it failed to perform its contract to deliver this article to Sussex, that such a failure was the result of its own negligence, and there can be no doubt of the defendant\u2019s liability for the damages sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of such negligence. The defendant, however, claims the right to deliver this bicycle, not to the plaintiff at Sussex, but to the plaintiff wherever it could find her months after. We agree with the court below in the conclusion at which it arrived,\u2014that the delivery of this bicycle to the plaintiff in New York or Brooklyn in November was not a compliance with its contract to deliver the bicycle to the plaintiff at Sussex, New Brunswick, in June. The plaintiff having the right to demand delivery of the bicycle in Sussex in June, and having made such demand, which the defendant refused to comply with, she had a right to insist that there had been a conversion of the property by the defendant, and maintain an action for such conversion. The plaintiff, having thus the right to sue for a conversion of the bicycle, commenced this action on the 19th day of November, 1896. At that time, although the defendant had been notified of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, no tender of the bicycle to the plaintiff, or any one on her behalf, had been made, and no effort appears to have been made by the defendant to perform its obligation to the plaintiff, except the writing, of this letter on August 7th. The subsequent tender of the bicycle to the plaintiff would not affect the legal rights of the parties, or take away from this plaintiff a right to sue for a conversion of the bicycle. We think, therefore, that the action was properly brought; that the failure of the defendant to deliver the bicycle in pursuance of its agreement to the plaintiff at Sussex, New Brunswick, was a conversion of the bicycle, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover as for a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The amount of damage awarded to the plaintiff as the value of the bicycle was entirely proper, under the circumstances. The only evidence as to its value was its cost price, it having been purchased immediately before the delivery to the defendant, never having been used, having been in the package from which it had been purchased from the manufacturer. As this is the only evidence as to the value, the court was justified in adopting this purchase price as the value of the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">We agree, therefore, with the court below that the judgment appealed from was sustained by the evidence, and affirm the judgment, with costs. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">RUMSEY, O\u2019BRIEN, and PARKER, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1113-9\">PATTERSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAo\">I concur in result, for the reason that this is not a proper case in which to allow the carrier on a trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>action to tender the goods to the plaintiff, and thus reduce her claim to one for nominal damages only. The ordinary rule in cases of conversion should be applied here under the special facts of the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
