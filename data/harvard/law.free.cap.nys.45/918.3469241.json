Proc. \u00a7 2231, subd. 2) is premature where the notice was served on December 29th and the petition was verified on January 2d following, since January 1st, on which the three days expired, being a holiday (Laws 1895, c. 603, \u00a7 1), was excluded from the computation by Laws 1892, c. 677, \u00a7 27, as amended by Laws 1894, c. 447, and therefore the tenant had the whole of January 2d in which to make the payment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b944-11\">Appeal from Sixth district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b944-12\">Summary proceedings by Charles A.

At the trial the tenant made a motion for the dismissal of the proceedings because prematurely brought, in that the statutory three days of notice had not expired at the date of the petition, and, this motion having been denied, the tenant went into no evidence upon the merits, but consistently objected to any proof on behalf of the landlord tending to show an actual previous demand for the rent. Upon the plaintiff\u2019s evidence a final order was rendered in his favor, and the point presented by this appeal is solely as to the sufficiency of the allegations of the petition to give the district court jurisdiction of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-17\">To our minds, the appellant\u2019s position appears to be well taken, since the petition clearly failed to satisfy the statutory requirements; and, in view of the objections interposed, there was no consent by the tenant to the trial of issues other than those presented by the allegations. Summary proceedings for nonpayment of rent may be founded either upon an actual demand for the rent or upon an alternative notice of three days, such as was here alleged (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>2231, subd. 2); and the petition must state the facts upon which the matter is thus based (Id. \u00a7 2235), failing a proper statement of which it is insufficient to give jurisdiction (People v. Kateltas, 12 Hun, 67; People v. Platt, 43 Barb. 116). Here the notice was served upon the 29th day of December, 1896, and the petition was verified the 2d day of January, 1897. . The statutory construction law (Laws 1892, c. 677, \u00a7 27, as amended by Laws 1894, c. 447) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-5\">\u201cA number of days specified as a period from a certain day within which or after or before which an act is authorized or required to be done means such number of calendar days exclusive of the calendar day from which the reckoning is made. Sunday or a public holiday, other than a half holiday, must be excluded from the reckoning if it is the last day of any such period. * * * The day from which any specific number of days, weeks or months of time is reckoned shall be excluded in making the reckoning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Excluding the day of service, the three-days notice in question expired with.the 1st day of January, 1897, but this day was a public holiday (Laws 1895, c. 603, \u00a7 1), and, accordingly, the tenant had the whole of the succeeding day, January 2d, in which to make the payment. Upon that day, however, the petition which was the foundation of the proceeding was made, and this was before the landlord\u2019s right to dispossess the tenant, as alleged, accrued under the statute. Therefore the petition did not comply with the act (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 2231, 2235), and presented no ground for the maintenance of the proceeding (cases, supra). The fact that the precept was issued upon January 4th does not aid the respondent, since the jurisdiction of the justice depended upon a statement in the petition of the proper jurisdictional facts, one of which was the tenant\u2019s default after the expiration of the three-days notice, and upon its face the petition was defective in this regard, the default being an impossibility at the date of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Final order reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
