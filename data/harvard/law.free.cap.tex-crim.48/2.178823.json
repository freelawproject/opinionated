There was testimony that deceased did not fire a shot and also testimony on part of the State\u2019s witness that deceased admitted that he fired at defendant. The evidence that deceased was armed at the time of the\" homicide was uncontradicted. There was also proof that his pistol had been fired. The defendant testified that deceased fired the first shot at him, whereupon he fired. His statement was substantially as follows concerning the difficulty: \u201cWhen I got home Mrs. Kersh was sitting on the front gallery with her arms around Hillendahl (deceased). 1 said, T don\u2019t want any sparking around here.\u2019 I did not swear or curse and I was not angry at all. I gave my horse to Ed. Allen to put up, and went into the house. Mrs. Kersh followed me in saying that she had given so much credit to Ed. Allen. * * * I told her that was too much, etc. About that time Ed. Allen came in and I told him I wanted my money, etc. He became angry and cursed and abused me, calling me a black bastard and son of a bitch, etc. I told him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>get out of the store. He was drunk and wanted to fight me and told me to come outside and he would whip me, using vile language and called me a Dutch son of a bitch at the time. So, Mr. Hillendahl stepped up\u2014he came from the outside. * * * And when he came in he said, \u2018Let me pay the son of a bitch * * * and threw $2 in the center of the counter. I was putting my matches on the shelf. He said, \u2018Here is your damned money, I will pay for the nigger all right.\u2019 I said, \u2018I did not-ask you for the money,\u2019 and by that time this nigger, Ed. Allen, came up at the end of the counter and had an open knife in his hand * * * and an iron-handled quirt in the other hand and said, \u2018You G\u2014d damn Dutch son of a bitch, you have got your money now, G\u2014d damn you, come out here and I will fix you.\u2019 I was right up in front of Hillendahl, pretty near the center of the counter. So I turned to the nigger and I said to him, \u2018G\u2014d damn you, don\u2019t you curse me like that, you get out of here,\u2019 and I made a move for my pistol, and when I moved close to the pistol, the nigger stepped back\u2014he was right at the end of the counter, not more than a foot from the end, no more than three feet from the pistol\u2014the nigger stepped back toward the center of the room, that is, towards the entrance ; he moved back about three feet from the end of the counter, close to the ice box, and he hollered, \u2018Will, kill him!\u2019 \u2018Will, kill him!\u2019 So I turned from him to Hillendahl. * * * When I did this, Hillendahl drew that gun right in my face, and I threw up my hands * * * and he shot, and the shot powder burned my face; then I grabbed my pistol and shot him. * * * My shot wounded him, so he could not fire at me a second time; he tried, but could only cock his pistol and it went off into the floor in front of the counter. The negro ran out of the store.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-7\">On cross-examination defendant among other things testified: \u201cQuestion: Why didn\u2019t you shoot at the nigger? Answer: He ran as soon as Hillendahl shqt, before I shot. Ques.: What did you want to shoot Hillendahl for; the negro was there, if you had nothing against Hillendahl ? Ans.: When Hillendahl shot, the nigger run out the back way; when he seen me grab my pistol, the nigger ran out the back way. Ques.: The negro knew where your pistol was, he could not keep from seeing your pistol ? Ans.: Why sure. Ques.: It was right there where everybody could see it ? Ans.: Yes, sir! Ques.: You never shot at the negro at all? Ans.: I didn\u2019t have any chance; the negro ran out before I got my gun.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-8\">The State\u2019s witnesses, Kersh and Allen, both testified that neither the deceased nor Allen cursed or molested defendant, that when the latter asked Allen to pay him for the beer he owed him, Allen replied he would, but did not have the money then, that deceased then said he would pay it and put down the $2 on the counter, when defendant without provocation reached for the pistol and shot deceased, who fell helpless into the woman\u2019s .arms, and that defendant fired one or two more shots, blew out the lights, and reloaded his pistol, etc. They also tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tified that deceased did not fire at all. There was some discrepancy between the testimony of these witnesses as to the number of shots fired and the language used by the parties to the difficulty but as to the facts of the homicide they corroborated each other. Allen denied making an attack upon defendant with a knife and quirt, but admitted that he had a quarrel with him about his account with defendant. The sheriff found a bullet under the floor which apparently had been fired through the floor and which fitted the pistol of deceased and was larger pistol was a 44 and deceased\u2019s a 45 caliber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-3\">The bullet found in the wall of the house behind the counter seemed to be smaller than the one that went through the floor. Defendant\u2019s pistol was a 44- and deceased\u2019s a 45-caliber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-4\">The charges of the court on self-defense was as follows: \u201cIf you should find from the evidence that the defendant did shoot and kill the said William Hillendahl with a pistol, but you should find that at the time he did so shoot and kill him the said Hillendahl, the said Hillendahl had shot at and was then and there attempting to shoot the defendant with a pistol with the intent then and there to kill or do 'serious bodily injury to, or, that it then and there reasonably appeared to defendant that said Hillendahl was then and there attempting to kill or to do serious bodily injury to him the said defendant, then and in that event you will find him not guilty. You are instructed that in judging the defendant and as to the danger or apparent danger to him, he must be judged from his standpoint and as the same reasonably appeared to him; and it would make no difference if the danger was real or not, if the danger was reasonably apparent to him. If there was an attempt by the said Hillendahl to shoot said defendant and thereby kill him or do him serious bodily injury, he would not be bound to retreat to avoid killing Hillendahl, and he would have the right to act so long as the danger was apparent to him.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b22-5\"><em>A. C. Van Velzer, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoc\">It is impossible to distinguish the attack by Allen from the attack by deceased, as it was all one event, or res gestae. That Allen sought defendant\u2019s life is seen in the manner of the attack, the weapons used and in his words to Hillendahl, \u201cWill, kill him.\u201d It is impossible to draw any other conclusion from the acts and words of Allen other than he sought the life of defendant. To our minds his part therein is inconsistent with any other purpose than a menace to the life of defendant. Defendant testified that deceased fired the first shot\u2014that shot was fired immediately upon the words being spoken by Allen, \u201cWill, kill him.\u201d There were no other persons present in the room other than the deceased, defendant and Allen, and the first shot was fired by deceased at defendant.

If the court is in doubt whether to so charge, the charge should be given. Halbert v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 656; Robles v. State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 346; Jones v. State, 33 Texas Crim.

App., 360.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">The fact that this is a clear case of self-defense, according to defendant\u2019s theory, does not lessen the \u201csudden terror\u201d or \u201cadequate cause.\u201d That a man under such circumstances would ordinarily be incapable of cool reflection does not affect his right of self-defense.

App., 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">In our motion for a new trial and in our assignments of error we have pointed out that the general charge on self-defense was upon the weight of evidence, and that it was more onerous upon defendant than the law requires. For instance, the court charged the jury that if deceased first fired at defend\u00e1nt and if deceased caused defendant to fear for his life or to fear serious bodily harm then defendant had the right to protect himself. Defendant\u2019s right of self-defense is made to depend at all events upon the belief or finding that deceased fired the first shot. Such is not the law. Defendant\u2019s right of self-defense depended upon the appearance of danger and not upon whether Hillendahl fired the first shot. The court seems to have attempted to apply the language in his charge to the facts of the case, but in so doing misdirected the jury in this fundamental respect. It rvas a disputed point as to who fired the first shot, the two State\u2019s witnesses testifying that defendant fired first while defendant testified that deceased fired first. With this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>conflict of evidence, to require defendant to await his self-defense until he is fired at once by deceased is not the law, and the court in requiring the jury to find both that deceased first fired at defendant and also that defendant was in danger before he shot deceased went beyond any requirement of- the law that we have become familiar with. The right of self-defense arose from the appearances of danger alone and not from the fact alone that Hillendahl fired first, nor from a finding that Hillendahl fired first when considered with any other fact. But the court told the jury that Lenz had a right to defend himself only in the event that Hillendahl had already fired at him and appeared to be still in danger.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-5\"><em>Howard Martin, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-6\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AXF\">Appellant was convicted of murder in the second degree, and his punishment assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for a term of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">We will discuss the errors assigned in the order in which they are stated in appellant\u2019s brief. The first complaint is, that the court erred in not charging upon the right of defendant to defend himself against deceased and one Allen, claiming that the testimony shows that both parties were making an assault upon appellant at the time of the fatal shot. After a very careful review of the testimony we do not think this contention i\u00ae. correct. Allen had run away from the scene of the homicide at the time the shot was fired, according to the testimony of appellant himself; and certainly could not have been in the attitude of making an assault upon appellant, while fleeing from the scene of the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Appellant\u2019s second insistence is that the court erred in not charging on the law of manslaughter. From the State\u2019s testimony the issue of manslaughter is not presented. Appellant\u2019s testimony makes out a case of perfect self-defense; while the State\u2019s testimony shows an unprovoked killing upon grossly inadequate cause: in fact no cause at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Appellant also criticises the charge of the court on self-defense. The charge taken as a whole is correct. It tells the jury in substance that appellant could defend against real or apparent danger, viewed from his standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">The fourth insistence of appellant is that the verdict of the jury is not supported by the evidence. We believe the evidence amply warrants the finding of the jury. Ho error appearing the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">[Motion for rehearing overruled without written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
