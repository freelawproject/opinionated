I walked right in the saloon and he walked right in behind me. He said something to me. \u2018He was kind of afraid, something on his mind.\u2019 He said something to me, some word, I cannot explain myself just like he said to me; something on his mind, something happened at his place before that was all .he said.\u201d Defendant objected at the time it was offered, for the reason it was introduced by the State for the purpose of showing a confession on the part of Bollen (defendant).. The facts show that witness was an officer, and that defendant, while not under actual arrest, was under surveillance at the time, by a man whom he (defendant) knew to be an officer. .That the statement was not made after the statutory warning; and further the statement was vague and indefinite, and does not show to have been made with the alleged robbery in mind at the time. The court approves the bill with the following explanation: \u201cThe above statement, \u2018is vague and indefinite and does not show to have been made with the alleged robbery in mind at the time,\u2019 if given as a reason is not now remembered by the court.\u201d That the same is vague and indefinite a casual inspection will disclose. As to whether the witness states anything is left more or less in doubt. The bill fails to show appellant was under arrest, nor is there anything in the bill showing he was under surveillance of an officer at the time. While it is true appellant urges these as grounds of objection, still the bill does not show them to be facts. As we glean from the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the substance of what the officer testified is, that defendant appeared to be frightened. This is legitimate testimony; the condition and appearance of one immediately after a crime is committed, is legitimate proof on his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">By another bill, appellant complains that prosecutor Hammel was permitted to testify to the following: \u201cSo we went back there and had a couple of more drinks, and Murphy claims that I called him a son of a bitch.\u201d Defendant objected on the ground that it was irrelevant, immaterial to any issue, and highly prejudicial. The State had failed to show any conspiracy between the parties defendant, and that the statement made by defendant Murphy could not have been introduced, and defendant was not bound thereby; that the mere presence of defendant at the time and place of the alleged conversation, when it is not shown he participated in the conversation, would not make it admissible. For ought the bill shows the testimony may have been quite material. It is true appellant objects to the same on the ground that no conspiracy is shown between Murphy and appellant; but the bill does not show the judge certifies this to be a fact, but merely that appellant urged this as a reason for excluding the testimony. Could we revert to the statement of facts, the testimony would be clearly admissible, since the statement occurred immediately before Murphy and appellant robbed witness Hammel.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Appellant also complains in another bill that witness Ramon Gonzales, a policeman, was permitted to testify: \u201cI was coming down Mesa Avenue, right about the corner there, when I saw a party come out of the saloon, stand and look up and down the street and go right back in the saloon. I did not know the party.\u201d Appellant objected on the ground that the witness did not identify the party looking up and down the street; that this was some time prior to the alleged robbery. How and in what way, this testimony could have injured appellant, does not appear. As appears by the bill, it is not connected with any testimony. Witness states he did not know the party, and hence we do not see how appellant could be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In motion for new trial appellant insists that the court failed to fully instruct the jury as to the law, in this: that the charge as given does not define an assault or assault and battery. The charge shows that the court copied the statute on assault but did not copy the statute defining assault and battery. We think this was sufficient in view of the fact that the indictment charged robbery by an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Complaint is also made of the charge on principals on the ground that it tells the jury that all parties would be principals whether in point of fact all were actually bodily present on the ground when the offense was actually committed or not. This charge is erroneous, as appellant insists, under the repeated decisions of this court; but it could not have injured him because his own testimony as well as that of the State shows he was present. There was no testimony that he was absent from the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>After defining principals, the court charged the jury: \u201cOf this the\" jury are to judge from the surrounding circumstances in proof\u2014such as companionship of parties and the conduct of the defendant at, before and after the offense was committed.\u201d Appellant insists this charge was on the weight of the evidence. The evidence both for the State and defendant shows that appellant and prosecutor were together and companions at the time of the alleged robbery, and consequently the charge of the court was not that character of error as was calculated to injure the rights of appellant, and under article 733, Code Criminal Procedure, we will not reverse the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">No reversible error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">April 26, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">BROOKS, Judge.\u2014The judgment was affirmed at the recent Dallas term, and is now before us on rehearing. Appellant insists that the court erred in failing to pass upon and sustain appellant\u2019s eighth assignment of error, which complains that the court below erred in not submitting to the jury defendant\u2019s theory of defense to the theory of the case upon which he offered proof. Appellant\u2019s defense as insisted, was that his companion assaulted prosecutor, and that he (appellant) merely intervened to prevent his companion injuring or inflicting injury upon prosecutor; that he had no knowledge of or part in the robbery. The court should have charged the jury on this distinct issue. However, in the charge of the court we find this language: \u201cThe mere presence of a party at the time and place where a crime is committed, does not constitute a party a principal; he must be present at the time and place with a knowledge of and participation in the offense. Of this the jury are to judge from the surrounding circumstances in proof, such as companionship of parties and the conduct of defendant at, before and after the offense was committed.\u201d This latter clause is on the weight of the evidence. The first clause is a-pertinent presentation of the law, but it should have gone farther and told the jury that if appellant grabbed prosecutor, or interfered to prevent an assault being made upon prosecutor, and this, alone was his intent, or if the jury have a reasonable doubt as to this being his intent, then they should find him not guilty. Furthermore, we notice as appellant insists the court does not tell the jury that the taking of the money must be fraudulent. It is true, the court copied the statute on assault to rob which contains the word \u201c fraudulent,\u201d but in the application of the law to the facts, he does not tell the jury that the taking must\" be fraudulent. Believing that we were in error in affirming the judgment, on the points herein stated the motion for rehearing is granted, and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
