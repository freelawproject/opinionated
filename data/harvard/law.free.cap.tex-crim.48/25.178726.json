Gradually, by statute and liberal construction of courts, the rule has been so extended as to include almost any kind of a structure used either for purposes of a dwelling or as a place of storage. But we have yet to find a case in any jurisdiction, where a mere box, without doors, windows or place of entrance or egress, into which it was never contemplated an \u201centry\u201d should be made by any one, not even the owner, without tearing it down, was judicially held to be a house within the burglary law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-14\">The peculiar sanctity given by law to a \u201chouse\u201d proceeds from the theory that the breaking is into a place into which alone the owner has the right of entry and from which he has the right to exclude the world. \u201cBut we submit that if the owner should build a mere box under his open shed, of equal dimensions with the house in the case at bar, and some one should break into this box and steal an insignificant piece of harness, this would not be \u201cburglary,\u201d because clearly none of the elements of a \u201chouse\u201d existed and yet the box would clearly be a \u201cstructure\u201d as well as the barn in the case at bar. Burglary is an offense against the security of the dwelling house\u2014it is the possession that is invaded and not the house itself as \u201cmere property.\u201d Possession not flowing from ownership but from occupancy.\u201d 76 Am. Dec., 602.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-16\">If occupancy by any person is impossible from the nature of the structure itself, then it lacks that essential ingredient to constitute burglary and the offense is against the property alone and not against the sanctity of the house. An examination of our statute develops that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the law contemplates the house must be so constructed as to have some door, window or opening of some kind through which an unlawful entry'might be made and through which it is contemplated that a lawful entry might be made by those entitled to make such entry. We find that breaking might be constituted by \u201clifting the latch of a door that is shut,\u201d by raising a window, the entry at a chimney or other unusual place,\u201d etc. Thus a usual place of entry, a door, latch, window, etc., to the house is contemplated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-4\">Again we find \u201centry\u201d is defined as every kind of entry \u201cexcept by the free consent of the occupant,\u201d etc. Thus it appears that the law contemplates an actual occupancy of the burglarized house as distinguished from a mere ownership of property. We do not mean that the house must be actually lived in by some one, for we recognize that this is not the law. But we do mean that the \u201chouse\u201d must have some place through which it is contemplated an entry might be made by those entitled to enter or in other words, by the occupants.

The testimony of the prosecuting witness shows that the property in question was taken from a log barn, shedded on one side. There was a hallway between the two parts of the barn and a roof over the entire barn. About the time the harness was taken the barn was boxed up, and the hall was boxed up even with the two log cribs. The driveway was boxed with plank, but it was not solid on the east side, but was solid on the west side. The witness testified that in order to get to the buggy where the harness was, he would have to take off the planks which were nailed. The boards used in boxing up the end of the shed where the buggy was extended a little higher than a man\u2019s head, pretty near even with the loft. There was not room enough be-o tween the planks nailed to the end of the shed for a man to get through; nor was there any other entrance to the buggy shed, except through these planks, unless they were torn down. The only question we deem necessary to review is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction. Appellant insists that the evidence does not show the structure entered was a house within contemplation of the burglary statute. We think the evidence does show that the same was a house within contemplation of law and the statute. The mere fact that one would have to pull off the planks in order to get,to the buggy where the harness was: in other words, that there was no door entering the buggy shed, would not change the fact that the same is a house within contemplation of law. If the absence of a door would prevent a successful prosecution of appellant for entering the house, then if the door in any house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>were nailed up, it would preclude a prosecution for burglary on the theory that there was no natural or easy mode of ingress and egress. The mere fact that the prosecuting witnesses\u2019 testimony is seriously controverted by the defense testimony would not authorize a reversal. Talcing the State\u2019s testimony as true, it shows that the buggy shed had been entirely closed by nailing up one of the cuts with plank which reached nearly to the joists of the house, and that no one could enter said shed without pulling off the planks nailed thereon. If this be true, and the jury have so decided, the same would constitute a house within contemplation of law. The charge of the court is correct. <em>No </em>error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
