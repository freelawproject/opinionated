S. Ray intoxicating liquors, without specifying the character or kind, in violation of the local option law. The alleged purchaser testified, that he \u201cbought two bottles of beer from him (appellant) and paid him 25 cents for the' same.\u201d He further stated that he bought the beer for some women because they desired him to do so. These women were strangers to witness. Appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence does not show a violation of the law, in that it fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>to establish that the beer bought was intoxicating liquor, is well taken.
