The defendant did not testify. The district attorney in opening his argument before the jury, used the following language: \u201cThe defendant in this case is surrounded by a chain of circumstances (and here turned to the defendant, and waved his arm toward defendant, and continued) which he has not explained, and which he cannot explain.\u201d That after having turned and waved his arm toward defendant as stated, he remained in that position until the statement above quoted was completed. That one of the attorneys for defendant arose and asked the court to instruct State\u2019s counsel to make no such references, to instruct the jury to disregard the same; and stated he desired a bill of exceptions. The court thereupon told the district attorney he should be careful in making his references, and said to defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cI shall give you your bill,\u201d and that the jury would not be instructed to disregard said language or any part of it, even though a written instruction properly framed, requiring same to be disregarded should be requested. That the district attorney, then said, \u201cThat I repeat that the defense has offered no explanation of his conduct, and that they cannot explain away the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d Thereupon appellant\u2019s counsel urged the same objections to the statement of the district attorney and made the same request of the court. Thereupon appellant\u2019s counsel presented to the court, the following special instruction, which was refused by the court to wit: \u201cAt the request of the defendant, you are instructed that you shall not consider the statement made by the district attorney, in opening the argument to the jury, that\u2014\u2018The defendant in this case is surrounded by a chain of circumstances which he has not explained, and which he cannot explain.\u2019 And the statement immediately following: \u201cThat I repeat that the defendant has offered no explanation of his conduct, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>he cannot explain away the facts and circumstances of this case/ \u201d Under the decisions of this court this was an allusion to the failure of the defendant to testify, and the judgment must be reversed. Washington v. State, 8 Texas Ct. Rep., 944; Hanna v. State, 10 Texas Ct. Rep., 40; Wallace v. State, 81 S. W. Rep., 966. The Legislature has seen fit to pass this statute inhibiting the district attorney from commenting upon or alluding to the failure of the defendant to testify, and there seems to be no discretion with the court in passing upon the probable injury of such allusion. This being true we have no alternative except to reverse. The judgment is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
