G. Cross, and he, the said W. P. Fuller, did then and there unlawfully and wilfully display a certain deadly weapon to wit: a certain club of wood in a manner calculated to disturb the parties who were then and there assembled and resorted for purposes of business,\u201d etc. Motion is made to quash the complaint and information, presenting various reasons. Article 334, Penal Code, denounces a punishment against those who \u201crudely display any pistol or other deadly weapon in a manner calculated to disturb,\u201d etc. It will be noted that the information charges appellant \u201cwilfully and unlawfully\u201d displayed a deadly weapon. \u201cWilfully\u201d is not synonymous with \u201crudely\u201d; nor does it convey the same meaning. The instrument could be displayed \u201cwilfully\u201d or \u201cunlawfully\u201d without coming within the terms of this statute. We are also of the opinion that the club is not a deadly weapon within the contemplation of this statute. A club may or may not be a deadly weapon. It was the evident purpose of the Legislature to confine the deadly weapons mentioned to pistols, guns, or weapons of like \u25a0 character, usually understood to be deadly. The evidence shows that the club was a hickory stick, a little longer than an ordinary walking stick, weighed eleven ounces, and could hardly be termed a deadly weapon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>within the purview o\u00ed this statute. The manner o\u00ed it being displayed, is thus described: \u201cThe defendant attempted to strike with said stick and displayed the stick in this manner (witness here took the stick by the small end and made three or four motions up and down as if to strike some object).\u201d The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
