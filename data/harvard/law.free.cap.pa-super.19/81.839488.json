If the testimony of the accomplice his manner of testifj\u2019ing, his appearance upon the witness stand, impress a jury with the truth of his statement, there is no inflexible rule of law which prevents a conviction. In such case it is for the trial judge who also heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the witness, noticed his manner and appearance upon the stand and who can judge equally with the jury as to his credibility, to say whether he is satisfied with the verdict.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b116-5\"><em>Appeals </em>\u2014 Harmless <em>error </em>\u2014 Evidence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b116-6\">An appellant must not only establish the existence of an error in the proceedings below, but that the error tended to his injury.

Because one of the members of the grand jury who found the bill was disqualified, to wit: Horace Barner, for the reason that he had, before the meeting of the court, and after he had been summoned as a grand juror, been actively \u00e9ngaged in assisting the prosecution of the defendants by aiding and securing evidence for the commonwealth, and was a member of an association organized for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">2. Because, before the meeting of the grand jury he had contributed time, effort and money to employ detectives and attorneys in the effort to secure the indictment and conviction of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">3. Because, before the meeting of the grand jury he had frequent conferences with detectives, witnesses and members of the association with which he is connected, as aforesaid; was the secretary of said association, received reports from said detectives, and was the custodian thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-10\">After a hearing had been begun on the motion to quash the indictment the following statement was made to the court by-counsel for the defendants:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-11\">I present to the court the subpoena and proof of service of same upon Mr. Roat, the d\u00e9tective, requiring him to be present in court this morning to support the averments made in the motion to quash and represent to the court that he is an.important witness; that he lives at Harrisburg, eighteen miles distant; that he will show to the court that his agents- were employed to furnish information to the association, of which Mr. Barner, a grand juror, is secretary; that it was furnished; that written reports were sent to him, and this for the purpose of showing that Mr. Barner was disqualified to sit as a juror, and that this information was gathered for the purpose of being used at the present trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-12\">Mr. Beltzhoover: This offer is objected to because Mr. Roat last evening was examined by the district attorney and associate counsel in the presence of Mr, Barner, and he admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>there that he probably did not send any written reports and that he probably had them at home; that he had no knowledge about the case of any kind of a personal character, and never did know anything about the case except what had been told him by Mr. Naugle and Mr. Smith, to persons whose whereabouts he did not then know. Mr. Barner, in the presence of Mr. Roat, said he had never gotten any written reports of any kind, and Mr. Roat did not insist that he had ever sent them, but admitted that he must have forgotten to send them or they must have miscarried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">Lastly, that both admitted that they never had in any way, communicated anything of any kind to the district attorney or the commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">Judge Sadler: It is understood that these applications are made in the four cases pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The Court: We have just listened to a full examination of Horace Barner in relation to the matters averred in the motion to quash, and after careful consideration are of the opinion that we would not be justified in delaying the trial of these cases until Mr. Roat, who does not live in this county, can be brought here. The motions to quash are overruled and an exception noted for defendants in each case.

It might relate, therefore to sales of other chickens which were perfectly legitimate. It is incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-12\">The Court: We think the testimony should be admitted.

What is your best recollection, if you have any, in regard to that ? A. My best recollection is that I bought chickens from him the last year he lived on the farm, but as to the exact month or date I can\u2019t give it to you for I have no record, and I kept no record. Q. Have you any recollection as to the amount of chickens ? A. Indeed I have not; no, sir, I could not say. Q. Have you no recollection as to the time of year it was ? A. Well, no, I can hardly fix the time of year. Q. Do your books show? A. No, sir, I kept no record of the stuff we bought in on that line. Q. Can\u2019t you tell us about the month or year? A.

To the best of my recollection it might have been in the fall or spring of 1899 or 1900, before the barn was burned, but how long before I can\u2019t tell you. Q. Did you tell me about how long before the barn was burned? A. I could not fix the time before the barn was burned. Q. Didn\u2019t you tell me how long before it was burned? A. I may have said it might have been.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-9\">Judge Sadler: The commonwealth in this case having failed to show in chief the exact date in January on which the larceny was committed, the information in the case is offered, which states that it was on January 12 or 18, 1900, for the purpose of aiding the jury in determining when the larceny was actually committed, that matter having been left in doubt by the commonwealth\u2019s testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-10\">Mr. Beltzhoover: Objected to, first, that the information is an ex parte statement by an officer of the law, Mr. Housholder, who does not appear to have any. personal knowledge of the facts, and must have sworn from information and belief. This paper cannot therefore be evidence of anything. Second. The best evidence of what Mr. Housholder can swear to of his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>knowledge would be himself; he is sitting here, and the gentleman can call him and ascertain, if he can tell, when this larceny was committed. Third.

Nicholson also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>denied that he had been promised any reward for his confession in the case.\u201d This testimony is therefore offered for the purpose of contradicting the statements made by Nicholson when upon the stand and to show bias and interest in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">Mr. Beltzhoover: Objected to, first, that the alleged conversation with Nicholson was whether he had said, in the presence of Washington and others, that he ought to be out; that he had been promised to be out and they were going back on him. They do not propose to show by whom he had been promised anything, or by whom he had been promised his discharge from jail, and therefore any such promise would be irrelevant and ineffective in any way as evidence for the defense. Second. The witness\u2019s testimony not having been relevant directly the gentlemen were concluded by his answers and cannot contradict him. Third.

This for the purpose of showing, first, bias and interest in this case, and secondly, to contradict the witness and affect his credibility before the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\">Mr. Beltzhoover: Objected to, first, that the inquiry made of Samuel Nicholson was of such a character that, the testimony elicited was incompetent and irrelevant, and therefore the gentlemen cannot contradict him ; they were concluded by his answers. Second, it is not pretended that Nicholson said he was promised immunity or discharge from prison by anyone authorised to so promise him. Any admission or statement therefore o\u00a3 Nicholson that he had been promised by some irresponsible person would be incompetent to affect the case in any way, because it could not in any way avail Mr. Nicholson. Third, the gentlemen are bound by Mr. Nicholson\u2019s answers, and the testimony is incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-9\">The Court: The matter on which it is proposed to contradict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Mr. Nicholson is one plainly not material or relevant to the issue, and it is therefore not admissible.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">1. This prosecution was commenced in June, 1901. The indictment was returned a true bill on September 10, and on the following day the defendants made a motion to quash the indictment based on the ex parte affidavit of Craig. He alleged certain facts tending to show that Samuel Barner, one of the grand jurors, was disqualified by reason of bias, also that \u201c he had no knowledge of the same \u201d until the day the affidavit was made. But he did not allege, nor was there any evidence given on the hearing of the motion, that the defendants had made any investigation as to the qualifications of the grand jurors before the day of their meeting, or that they had not had opportunity to do so. Nor is it apparent that the facts could not have been learned by reasonable diligence. All that the court had before it relative to the defendants, prior knowledge of the objection to the grand juror, and their diligence in raising it, was the allegation above referred to of the affidavit. This ex parte affidavit had served its purpose when it was received by the court as ground for entertaining the motion; the court was not bound to treat any of its allegations as verity in the disposition of the motion. Therefore, the only evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>before the court below upon the motion to quash, and the only evidence properly before us for consideration in that connection, is the testimony of the grand juror himself. This fails to establish the more serious allegations contained in the affidavit. In reviewing its action in overruling the motion, much weight is to be given to the judgment of the court below in whose presence the grand juror appeared and by whom his manner and conduct as well as his language were scrutinized. Nothing short of palpable error in its decision would justify a reversal of it. Moreover, it is well settled that a grand juror may be challenged for cause, but it is not the law that what might have been ground of challenge as to a particular grand juror is, iinder all circumstances, ground for quashing the indictment. When the objection to the grand juror was known, or might have been known by the exercise of reasonable diligence, and might have been interposed by challenge, but was not, we think it clear, both upon principle and authority, that a refusal to quash the indictment for the same cause is not reversible error. In Holland v. Commonwealth, 82 Pa. 806, 322, the objection to the two grand jurors was as serious as that disclosed by the testimony of the grand juror in this case, but the court held, that while it might have been a ground of challenge, it was not ground for quashing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">2. The assignment that the court erred in refusing to arrest the judgment must be overruled for the obvious reason that no ground for the arrest appears of record. The depositions taken in support of the motion are not part of the record: Alexander v. Commonwealth, 105 Pa. 1; Commonwealth v. Bradley, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">3. In Alexander v. Commonwealth, supra, it was declared that it was not the intendment of the act of 1874, allowing exceptions in criminal cases, \u201c that decisions which have always rested in the sole discretion of the court where the cause was tried should be made subject to exception and review.\u201d Among the rulings therein expressly referred to by the court are, a refusal to postpone the trial, and a refusal of an application for an attachment for an absent witness. We do not say that in a plain case of abuse of discretion the action of the court in such matters might not be subject to review. Be that as it may, we do not think such a case is presented by the third and fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>assignment of errors, which, relates to what took place in the hearing of the motion to quash. The defendants declared in their affidavit that they were prepared to prove their allegations, and asked leave to call their witnesses for that purpose. Leave was granted, and they entered upon the hearing without suggesting that they were not prepared. After they had examined the grand juror, they asked for an attachment for an absent witness who lived in another county. In such circumstances, the refusal to suspend the hearing of the preliminary motion, and thus delay the trial of the case, is not ground for reversal. ' See Commonwealth v. Dietrich, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">4. It is well settled in Pennsylvania, that although the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice should be received with caution, yet there is no rule of law forbidding a conviction upon his evidence alone: Carroll v. Commonwealth, 84 Pa. 107; Kilrow v. Commonwealth, 89 Pa. 480; Ettinger v. Commonwealth, 98 Pa. 338; Cox v. Commonwealth, 125 Pa. 94. As was said in Ettinger v. Commonwealth, the principle which allows the testimony of an accomplice to go to the jury for their consideration necessarily involves the right to believe and act upon it. Hence, no error was committed in refusing the defendant\u2019s first point (fifth assignment) in which they asked the court not merely to advise, but to charge the jury to acquit. It is the duty of the court to admonish the jury of the danger of convicting upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, and it is common practice for the courts to advise them not to do so. But no set form of expression in which such admonition and advice must be given has been prescribed. In this case the defendants presented seven points, all of which were unequivocally affirmed, excepting the first, which for the reasons above given could not be affirmed. All of these points were well calculated to impress upon the jury the duty to exercise great care in weighing the testimony and to give to the defendants the benefit of every reasonable doubt, and the second was directed expressly to the caution that ought to be observed in accepting and acting on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. It was as follows: \u201c The evidence of Nicholson and Battles, who are self-confessed participators in the crime charged in this indictment, coming as it does from a polluted source, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>should be received with great caution and closely and doubtingly examined by the jury.\u201d The trial judge did not stop with a merely perfunctory affirmance of the point, but emphatically reiterated the essential parts of it in his answer. After a very careful examination of the evidence, we see no reason to doubt that the jury gave due heed to the instructions. One of latest, if not the latest, utterances of the Supreme Court upon the subject is contained in the opinion of Chief Justice Paxson in Cox v. Commonwealth, 125 Pa. 94: \u201cA jury may believe an uncorroborated accomplice, and if his testimony produces in their minds a conviction of the defendant\u2019s guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt, they may convict. If the testimony of the accomplice, his manner of testifying, his appearance upon the witness stand, impress a jury with the truth of his statement, there is no inflexible rule of law which prevents a conviction. In such case it is for the trial judge who also heard the witness, noticed his manner and appearance upon the stand, and who can judge equally with the jury as to his credibility, to say whether he is satisfied with the verdict. If both the jury and the court are satisfied that he has told the truth, there is no reason why the verdict should not stand. If we lay down an inflexible rule in regard to corroboration, there may be instances when criminals will escape although both jury and court are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of their guilt.\u201d Here the defendants evidently appreciated the difficulty in the way of an affirmance of their first point and framed their second point to meet the contingency of a refusal of the former. Having obtained from the court the caution to the jury which they asked for, we are of opinion that they have no reason to complain that the court did not go further.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">5. The chickens were stolen on a Saturday night in January, 1900. According to the testimony of one of the accomplices, they were put in bags which were taken by Craig with the declaration that he would sell them on Monday. He testified further that on Monday afternoon Craig paid him part of the price he had received. In view of this testimony we cannot say that it would have been wholly irrelevant to show that Craig sold two bags of chickens early on a Monday morning in January, 1900. But the commonwealth failed to prove the fact alleged. Hence we cannot see that the overruling of the objection, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>is the subject of the sixth assignment, even if erroneous, harmed the, defendant. The appellant must not only establish the existence of an error in the proceedings below, but that the error has tended to his injury. It is not sufficient, as a general rule, to show that an improper question, either in form or substance, had been put to a witness; it must appear that an answer was received which tended to injure the case of the appellant: Commonwealth v. Kay, 14 Pa. Superior Ct. 376. See also Philadelphia v. Reeder, 173 Pa. 281. It is very clear that no evidence was given by the witness, Fickes, which could by any possibility have harmed the defendants. The failure of the commonwealth to make good its offer would more probably operate with the jury in the defendants\u2019 favor. Moreover, no motion was made to strike it out, nor was the court asked to instruct the jury to disregard it, as might have been done upon the ground that it did not come up to the offer. See Commonwealth v. Bell, 166 Pa. 405. In any way that the assignment may be viewed, we think it should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">6. If the constable who made the information upon which the warrant was based had been called as a witness and had fixed the date of the larceny differently, the information might have been admissible in evidence to contradict him. But we are of opinion that it was not admissible, either on the part of the commonwealth or the defendants, as primary evidence, of the date of the larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">7. It is urged in support of the eighth and ninth assignments, that where, on cross-examination, a party denies the making of statements which tend to show his bias or interest, witnesses may be called by the opposing party to contradict him and thus affect his credibility with the jury. As was said in one of the cases cited by the appellants\u2019 counsel (Geary v. People, 22 Mich. 220), if the witness Nicholson had expectation of immunity depending on defendants\u2019 conviction, or on his giving testimony to incriminate them, it was proper that the jury should know it; and if satisfied on that point, they might not regard his testimony just as they would if no such interest existed. But, to say nothing of the vagueness of the offers, the manifest objection to them is that the statement denied by Nicholson and offered to be proved by the defendants was not in terms, or in effect, that he had been promised or expected immunity if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>testified against the defendants. To be more explicit, the states ment that \u201c he had been promised,\u201d by some unnamed person, \u201c to be left out at court,\u201d coupled with the statement, \u201c that he believed they were going back on him,\u201d would tend to show that he had no expectation based on the promise that had been made. But aside from that, there is nothing in the statement to show that his being \u201cleft out at court\u201d was in any way dependent upon the conviction of the defendants or the testimony that he might give against them. If, therefore, the testimony had been admitted, it would not have shown that the witness was affected by bias or interest; and it is well settled that in order to impeach a witness by proof of contradictory statements made by him, it is essential that such statements have reference to some matter which is relevant and material to the issue on trial. The ruling in Hester v. Commonwealth, 85 Pa. 139, at p. 157, fully sustains the ruling of the court below upon these, offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">8. It is legitimate cross-examination of an ordinary witness, who has testified in chief that what purports to be his signature, was not written by him, to call upon him to write, in order that such writing may be compared with the disputed writing for the purpose of contradicting him. The same must be true in the case of a defendant in a criminal' case who has offered himself as a witness, unless, as has been suggested, he is at liberty to stop at any point he chooses. But this latter doctrine is contrary to the great weight of authority. A defendant in a criminal case cannot be compelled to testify, and under our statute no inference can be drawn from, nor comment be made on, his failure to do so. But by consenting to take the stand and swearing to tell the truth and the whole truth, he waives his constitutional privilege, and may be cross-examined in the same manner as any other witness. There is this difference, however, between an ordinary witness, and a defendant testifying in his own behalf; the former goes upon the stand by compulsion, the latter voluntarily. Having waived his constitutional privilege to keep silent, he cannot give testimony which makes in his favor, and then object to legitimate cross-examination, upon the ground that his answers will crim-inate him : Commonwealth v. House, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 92, 108, and cases there cited. See also People v, Gardner, 28 L. R. A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>699, a\u00f1d notes. There was, therefore, no error in the ruling which is the subject of the tenth assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">9. The record does not show that the defendants were present when the verdict was rendered ; nor is it imperatively necessary in cases of this class that it should: Holmes v. Commonwealth, 25 Pa. 221. And as the depositions submitted in support of the motion in arrest of judgment are not part of the record, we might properly dismiss the eleventh assignment without further comment. It is not necessary, however, to put the decision on the technical ground. The question sought to be raised by the assignment was ruled in Lynch v. Commonwealth, 88 Pa. 189, where it was held, quoting the language of Chief Justice AGnew, that \u201c it cannot be doubted, even if arraignment be necessary as a fact in a trial for larceny, that mere voluntary absence at the rendition of the verdict, by one out on bail, who has appeared, and been tried regularly, is not a fatal error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The judgment is affirmed and the record remitted to the court below to the end that the sentence be fully carried into effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
