This office is in the charge of two agents. They are not required to attend at the office on Sunday. They were, in fact, on that day both out of the city. One of them, Mr. Price, arrived at the office about 10:30 Monday morning, July 3. The other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>agent, Mr. Williams, returned to the -city Sunday evening, and was at the office the next morning at 8:8*0.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-4\">The plaintiff: was required by Rule 22 to see that his arrival was registered. This rule is: \u201cA register shall be kept in Philadelphia of all vessels -arriving, and every pilot, immediately after his arrival in Philadelphia, shall go to the office and see that he is registered by the agent or agents, -and report to the agent or agents for outward duty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">This duty the plaintiff utterly ignored. True, he went to the office; true, he could not report to the agents, for they were not there; but the association\u2019s rules did not require the agents to be there, and one of them was there at the customary time the next (Monday) morning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">On that morning, however, Marshall left on an early train for his home at Lewes, Delaware.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">The privilege of going to his home is permitted to a pilot under Rule 24, which is: \u201cEvery pilot living out of Philadelphia When on outward turn, and a vessel not coming away, shall be allowed to go to his home, provided he pays the difference between his passage and his board, but the agent must first give his consent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-8\">In fact, Marshall did not get the consent of the agent. In fact, vessels were \u201c coming away.\u201d On Monday, pilot Shellenger toolc out a steamer, pilot Virden took out a steamer, and pilot -Burton took out a steamer. On Tuesday, pilot Maull took out <em>\u25a0&amp; </em>steamer, pilot Chambers took out a steamer, pilot Joseph took out a steamer, and pilot Kelly took out a steamer. On Wednesday, phot Bennett took out a steamer, pilot Truxton took Out .a steamer, pilot E. C. Marshall took out a schooner, and pilot Poynter took out a steamer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-9\">If the plaintiff' had not left the city on Monday morning he would have been appointed, in regular turn, to \u201c\u201c outward duty \u201d on Monday. When his 'turn came he Was not here. It is probable fhat the agent knew where the plaintiff was, and it is also likely 'that had he telegraphed to Marshall to Lewes to come back that the plaintiff would have come on the evening train, and been on hand to take out a ship that night or Tuesday morning. The knowledge the agent had of the plaintiff\u2019s whereabouts, however, was merely what others told him, and he had 'no intimation from the plaintiff as to his intentions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Rule 12 provides: \u2019\u201cAny pilot refusing to <em>go </em>on a boat when his turn comes shall be considered on sick leave, and shall \u00a1receive sick leave pay,\u201d and .sick leave pay is \u00a7,50.-,0.0 \u00a1per month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">Rule 6 provides : \u201c The pilots shall be appointed to outward bound vessels by the agent, and if any pilot shall refuse to go with a vessel he is thus appointed to he shall pay the sum of $25.-00 to the agent for the use of the .association.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">Rule <em>&amp; </em>provides: \u201cAny pilot who wishes to \u00a1stay ashore and not follow his business of pilot shall receive \u00a750.00 per month in lieu of his proportionate share of \u00a1earnings., but he shall mot receive .any pay for less than a \u00a1month.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">It is fair to the plaintiff to state that before he left .Philadelphia he made inquiries to learn whether there were vessels in port ready to leave or nearly ready which would require the services of more pilots than were in port and .intended to remain. When he left Philadelphia for his home early .Monday morning he thought that his services would not be required that day, and he also intended, if telegraphed for, to \u00a1come -back as soon as he could.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">He received no telegram, and .remained at his home. On July 8 he received a letter from -the agent, .Mr. Price, dated the 7th, .advising him that he had been placed on the \u201c retired list for the month of July.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">Upon receipt of that letter the plaintiff spoke to some -of his brother pilots, and they drew up a petition dated .July <em>\u00a1LQ, </em>to which .seven attached their .names, which merely .requested the secretary to .call a -special meeting .of the board -of directors to settle the ease of J. R. Marshall and T. D. Fuller.\u201d (Note. Fuller\u2019s case was heard by me with Marshall\u2019s. The .facts are identical. Fuller went home along with Marshall and without consent, and when his turn -came to take ,:a boat he was not here.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-9\">To this the secretary .replied the \u00a1next day that'he had no power to call the directors together, but that the president had, and he would forward the -communication to-the president. In fact,&lt;no special meeting was called. The -by-laws -fix \u00a1.a regular meeting for the first Monday in August.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-10\">The plaintiff himself wrote to the \u00a1secretary. The letter was read to the plaintiff, hut .not offered in evidence. The trial judge -did not -see it. .From the questions .asked, however, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>appears to have been a request for the directors to meet and hear the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">The' secretary, on July 18, wrote the plaintiff: \u201cA regular stated meeting of the Board of Directors of the Pilots\u2019 Association, Bay and River Delaware, will be held at 319 Walnut street, on Tuesday, August 1, 1899.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">Marshall did not attend the meeting. The notice did not request that he should, nor say that he could, but he made no effort to secure a hearing by appearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">\u25a0 At the meeting the directors passed the following resolution unanimously: \u201c That it is the sense of this Board, after hearing the cases of Thomas R. Marshall and Thomas D. Fuller, that they are entitled to receive only fifty dollars per month for month of July \u201d (according to the by-laws).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">This amount the plaintiff has refused to accept.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-8\">The plaintiff remained at Lewes \u2014 for just how long does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">The pilots maintain a steam pilot boat and a relief boat. One of these makes her headquarters at Lewes. The plaintiff went on board the boat at Lewes. On this boat the pilots are \u201c listed,\u201d that is, their turns are determined' by a list on which the names appear one after another. A pilot is put on an incoming boat when it is his turn. He is assigned to an outgoing boat in the same order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-10\">During July, the plaintiff being on the pilot boat, took his turn as \u201clisted\u201d in bringing a boat to this port. When he reached Philadelphia he reported to the agent and asked for a vessel down. The agent refused to give the plaintiff a vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">The pilots have a custom of exchanging vessels, that is, if A is assigned to a particular vessel, he will give B his turn, and when B is assigned take the vessel which is given B.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-12\">The plaintiff, being refused a boat, Mr. H. F. Yirden, who had been given the \u201c Kestor,\u201d requested plaintiff to take the \u201c Kestor \u201d out for him, which plaintiff agreed to do and did. The date of this service was not given. It was not with the knowledge or consent of the agent. Nor was the piloting up of a vessel with the knowledge or consent of the agent or the association. There does not appear to have been any scarcity of pilots at the time, and what the plaintiff did any other pilot could have done. The trial judge does not see how the receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>of the money for this service estops the association in any sense from contesting plaintiff\u2019s claim for more than sick leave pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">The pilots\u2019 association is made up of about ninety licensed pilots of New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. The service they render to commerce is important;. in fact, indispensable. Commerce is compelled to employ them. No vessel can come up or go down without a licensed pilot in charg\u00e9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">The pilots\u2019 association has been in existence for about five years. During all that time this is the first instance where a member has gone to his home without the agent\u2019s consent. In many cases the agent has given such, consent. In such cases, if the need for the services of a pilot, absent with leave, appears, he is telegraphed for. The plaintiff contends' that he \u25a0 had a right to rely on this custom, and that until he refused, to obey a telegram to return, the \u2022 association had no right .to consider him as refusing to take his turn. If he is correct then each pilot as he reaches port may, after making an honest effort to ascertain whether his services will be needed during the next twenty-four hours', go home, leaving no notice of his going with the agent and making ho effort to secure the agent\u2019s consent, but imposing upon his brother members the burden of performing his work, or upon the secretary the necessity of telegraphing for him to his supposed whereabouts, with the alternative that if there are not men enough in port to take away the vessels leaving and he does not come back, the commerce of the court, for the time being, stands still.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">It seems to the trial judge that the quasi-public character of this association must be taken into consideration in reading the by-laws and deciding their force and effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">The by-laws were passed to regulate the service so as to best serve the commerce of the port. Rule 12, \u201c Any pilot refusing to go on a boat when his turn comes shall be considered on sick leave and shall receive sick leave pay,\u201d either governs this case or it fails of its evident purpose. The plaintiff it is true, did not, when his turn came, say to the agent, \u201c I will not take my turn,\u201d but he was many miles from Philadelphia when his turn came, in a little town with two daily trains and no Sunday trains. The fact that he was there was not known to the agent except as he had heard from other pilots that the plaintiff had said to them he was going home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>No notice of any land bad. been left at the office for the agent 5 no -letter or telegram was \u00a1sent 'announcing a willingness to return when requested, and it seems to the trial judge \u00a1that the plaintiff pnt himself on sick leave when he left without the agent\u2019s consent, and that his absence, unexplained, and his whereabouts unknown, except by rumor, put Mm in the position \u00a1of \u201c refusing to \u00a1go on a boat when Ms turn came.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The fact that this is the first ease \u00a1of its kind in the history of the .association it seems to the trial judge is significant. It speaks 'well for the discipline of the pilots as a body. It shows, too, how serious a matter all have deemed it to go away without leave. It, at the same time, leads the trial judge to suggest that the association might have dealt with the plaintiff in a way which, while it would have emphasized the need of a rigid adherence to the by-laws, would not have been so severe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">W-ith \u00a1that, however, the trial judge has nothing to do .in deciding the \u00a1case now before him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">Believing that the plaintiff has been tendered all that' was due him under Bules 12 and 4, the trial judge finds that the bill \u00a1should he dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s requests for findings are attached hereto.' I have preferred to find the facts in my own language.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">The cases cited -by the plaintiff I deem inapplicable. The rules referred to :are fair and reasonable. They bear equally upon all. They \u00a1are, .in fact, of great importance to the vast public interests the association serves. They are plain, unambiguous and, in my opinion, apply to the -case under consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">The prothonotary will give the respective counsel ten days\u2019 notice of 'the filing hereof. If mo exceptions are filed hereto within ten \u00a1days he will mark the same -confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-11\">Exceptions to adjudication were dismissed by the court, and a decree entered dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-12\"><em>JSrror assigned </em>among others was decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-13\"><em>Ira J. </em>Williams, with \u00a1him <em>Simpson f Brown, </em>for appellant.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6y\">A penal by-law must be strictly construed, and there was mo refusal within the true meaning thereof -: Potter v.

Porter,</author>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s rights are determinable by Rule 12 of the bylaws which provides that, \u201c any pilot refusing to go \u00f3m a boat when his turn comes shall be considered on sick leave and shall receive sick leave pay.\u201d Under this rule the defendant association was empowered to treat the plaintiffs absence from Philadelphia on Monday, when his services were required and demandable, as the next in turn, a \u201c refusal.\u201d Refusal to do a particular thing is as clearly evinced by acts making performance impossible as by oral expression. The president and board of directors, at a regular meeting of which the plaintiff had notice, held the plaintiff bound by the by-law above quoted. The action was taken pursuant to the -seventh article -of 'the constitution referring to that body the determination of matters of dispute arising among the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The result to the plaintiff is a considerable loss for what might- seem to be trivial transgression. But we are not willing to stamp the by-law as unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable. The plaintiff was a member of the defendant association. He participated in its organization. He assented to its by-laws. He found nothing unreasonable in the provision now complained of until he chose to violate it. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>more, the by-law covered a subject of no mean importance. The members of the defendant association have much to do with the commerce of the city of Philadelphia. If without severe penalty members might absent themselves at will, serious consequences might result to outgoing vessels and thus to the interests of a large community. As the learned judge of the court below says, the organization is quasi-public. Its members perform high duties with which go great responsibilities. In view of the considerations suggested, we cannot regard the penalty here imposed by virtue of the by-law so unreasonable as to set aside the by-law or to relieve from its operation. The conduct of the plaintiff in the taking out and bringing in of vessels after he was notified that he was upon \u201c sick leave \u201d does not help his claim. His conduct was that of a man who, though suffering in pocket for dereliction of duty, was not desirous of escaping labor (during his period of suspension) which might aid his associates in performing the work of their joint undertaking. His relation to the defendant was not that of servant to master, Out that of an associate assisting and participating in \u00e1 common purpose. His acts must under the circumstances be regarded as voluntary, and were, it may be, properly due from him until the action of .the board of directors confirming his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The decree dismissing the bill is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
