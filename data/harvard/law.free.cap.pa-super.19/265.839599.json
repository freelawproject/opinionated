The said George Woelfel, the defendant, for several years prior to the date of this writ and up to the 'present day, has been a resident of the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland, where he was engaged in business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">By deed dated April 15, 1898, and recorded on the same day in the land and chattels records of the city of Baltimore, in the clerk\u2019s office of the Superior Court thereof, a certified copy of which was recorded in the recorder of deed\u2019s office of Philadelphia, on May 20, 1898, in deed book W. M. J. 288, p. 557, etc., the said George Woelfel for legal consideration, voluntarily granted and conveyed all his real and personal property, including his right to the funds in dispute, to the said George R. Willis, Esq., in trust, for the general benefit of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-9\">The deed was acknowledged, executed, recorded and properly delivered under the laws of the state of Maryland and the trustee thereunder lawfully entered upon the duties of his trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-10\">On April 18, 1898, the plaintiffs issued a foreign attachment out of this court as of the above term and number as against the said George Woelfel, defendant, attaching and summonsing the said Pennsylvania Insurance Company, garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-11\">The said garnishee is a corporation chartered by and existing under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-12\">At the time of the said deed of assignment by the said George Woelfel to the said George R. Willis, Esq., trustee, as aforesaid, the said garnishee was indebted to the said George Woelfel in the amount of an adjusted fire loss under certain policies'previously written by it in the city of Baltimore, and the amount of said indebtedness was attached by plaintiffs under said writ of foreign attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-13\">The said garnishee, prior to and at the time of issuing of its said insurance policy, and long prior to April 15, 1898, and on that day had an office and agency in the said city of Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and a legally authorized agent upon whom service of process might be made, and had to that end complied with the laws of the state of Maryland in force relating to fire insurance companies.

Willis, Esq., in trust, except that on April 15 or 16,1898, they cannot say which, they were informed by a business acquaintance who had heard thereof through entirely separate sources, and who was not connected with the plaintiffs, that the defendant was in financial trouble, but said informant did not state the nature thereof nor that an assignment had been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">It is further agreed by the parties hereto that if under the above facts the plaintiffs are in law entitled to recover, judgment shall be entered in their favor for the amount of the said fund, to wit: $144.25, otherwise judgment shall be entered in favor of George R.

S. 369 (1877) ; Mooney v. Buford, 72 Fed. Repr. 32 ; Harvey v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 50 Minn. 405; National Fire Ins. Co. v. Chambers, 53 N. J. Eq. 468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">The attachment takes the fund in the hands of the garnishee ahead of the assignee, although the assignment antedates the attachment, because the assignment was not recorded within the commonwealth as required by the act of May 3,1855, and no notice was given to the plaintiff: Philson v. Barnes, 50 Pa. 230 ; Steel v. Goodwin, 113 Pa. 288 ; Bacon v. Horne, 123 Pa. 452; Roche v. Rhode Island Ins. Assn., 2 Ill. App. 360; Chemical Nat. Bank v. Tuttle, 17 W. N.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Prior to the Act of May 3, 1855, P. L. 415, an assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>for the benefit of creditors made in Maryland and valid under the laws of that state would have protected this debt from subsequent attachment in Pennsylvania: Speed v. May, 17 Pa. 91; Law v. Mills, 18 Pa. 185 ; Philson v. Barnes, 50 Pa. 230. See also Noble v. Thompson Oil Co., 79 Pa. 354. The act-of 1855 declares, that whenever any person making an assignment of \u201c his or her estate situate within this commonwealth,\u201d for the benefit of creditors, shall reside out of this state, such assignment may be recorded within any county \u201c where such estate, real or personal may be,\u201d and take effect from its date; provided, that no bona fide purchaser, mortgagor or creditor having lien thereon before the recording, and not having had previous actual notice thereof, shall he affected or prejudiced by such assignment. If the situs of the debt at the time of the assignment was in Pennsylvania, not in Maryland, the act of 1855 applies. The debt would be deemed part of the estate of the defendant \u201c situate within this commonwealth \u201d if he were compelled to come to this state to collect it. See opinion by Mr. Justice McKenna in Chicago and Rock Island, etc., Ry. Co. v. Sturm, 174 U. S. 710. Accordingly it has been held that where a natural person, resident in Pennsylvania, owes a debt to a nonresident, the act of 1855 applies: Philson v. Barnes, 50 Pa. 230; Steel v. Goodwin, 113 Pa. 288. Of course the same would be true and applicable here, if the debtor were a Pennsylvania corporation which could be reached by process in Pennsylvania only. But here, the corporation debtor had complied with the laws of Maryland and was lawfully engaged in business in that state; it was subject to process there; its creditor resides there; the contract out of which the debt arose was made, and, for aught that appears, was performable there; in short it was a Maryland contract. See Burnett v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 176 Pa. 45, and Healy v. Eastern Building and Loan Assn., 17 Pa. Superior Ct. 385. The creditor needed not the aid of our courts or laws to collect the debt, nor did the trustee in the deed of assignment need their aid to perfect his title. The courts of Maryland could have compelled the appropriation of the debt to the payment of the creditor\u2019s debts to others, by attachment. The argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel necessarily concedes that the debt had a situs in Maryland for that purpose at least. But as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>creditor, being insolvent, chose to make the appropriation himself by a voluntary assignment for the benefit of all his creditors, and as the laws of Maryland were complied with in all particulars, we are of opinion that the right of the trustee to the money was complete without the recording of the deed in Pennsylvania, and was not divested nor impaired by the subsequent attachment. The manifest object of the act of 1855 was to protect our own citizens (Bacon v. Horne, 123 Pa. 452; Long v. Girdwood, 150 Pa. <em>413; </em>Hilliard v. Enders, 196 Pa. 587; and is sustainable as a regulation of the transfer of property situate within this commonwealth. \u201c When this power is asserted by legislation of the state where the property is situate, any principle of comity in conflict therewith must not render the legislation invalid: \u201d Steel v. Goodwin, 113 Pa. 288. But here the right of the trustee to the money rests upon a broader foundation than the principles of comity between states. He does not come into the courts of this state to perfect the transfer to him, or because he was compelled to do so to collect the debt, and is not to be deemed to have forfeited this right by a course which was manifestly for the protection and in relief of the stakeholder. To hold that the act of 1855 applies to such a case as is here presented is to give it an extraterritorial effect, which, presumably, was not intended by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The judgment of the court below on the case stated is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
