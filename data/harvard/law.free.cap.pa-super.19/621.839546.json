J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-8\">Clarinda Gumaer, the widow of the testator, presented her petition asking that Silas Hartley be compelled to pay her a certain legacy,.with arrears of interest thereon. She bases her claim upon the following provisions of her deceased husband\u2019s will:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-9\">\u201cI give and devise to my son, Frederick E. Gumaer, the farm known as the Dowd farm, containing nearly one hundred acres. I also direct that each of my sons, Frank Gumaer, Frederick Gumaer, and George H. Gumaer, if they shall accept the above property, it shall be on condition that they shall each pay annually an equal portion to their mother, Clarinda Gumaer, of six per cent interest on two thousand dollars, and if needed for her support, also the principal, each paying one third.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-10\">Devises were also made to Frank Gumaer and George H. Gumaer. It appears from the evidence that after the testator\u2019s death the Dowd farm was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale on a writ against Frederick Gumaer; was purchased by Thomas Patterson, and by him conveyed to Silas Hartley. Public notice was given at the sheriff\u2019s sale that the land was sold subject to the charge upon it which Clarinda Gumaer claimed was created by the provisions of the will above quoted. The first question to be considered is, whether or not this legacy is a charge upon the land. It was held by the court of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>pleas of Lackawanna county, in an opinion written by Judge Carpenter, at No. 396, May term, 1899, that by the terms of this will, a charge was created upon the land now owned by Hartley. In that case the question arose upon the distribution of the fund arising from the sheriff\u2019s sale of the Dowd farm, and counsel for Hartley, who did not appear in that case, earnestly contend that this decision was erroneous, and that it should not be followed in the present proceeding. It is not always an easy matter to determine whether language employed by a testator in his will creates a charge or lien upon the land, or whether it simply imposes a personal liability upon the part of the devisee of the land to pay a certain sum to another person. No two wills are couched in the same terms, and hence it is difficult to find an authority directly in point. There are some legal principles which aid the courts, however, in determining matters of this nature, and one of them is that the whole will must be considered to ascertain the intent of the testator: Wright\u2019s App., 12 Pa. 257. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-5\">It has also been held, while it need not be declared in express terms, that a charge is intended, that intent must be disclosed by the will itself, and not inferred from the circumstances: Duvall\u2019s Estate, 146 Pa. 176.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-6\">The intention to create a charge upon land must appear by direct expression or plain implication in the will: Sharp\u2019s Est., Pa.

It is hardly to be presumed that the\" testator\u2019s manifest desire to provide for his widow\u2019s wants, which so plainly appears by the terms of the will, should have been intended by him to rest upon no better security than a mere personal obligation upon the part of the devisees. He not only provides for her a home, an income, a garden, a supply of fruit, and use of certain cows, but he makes the principal sum of $2,000 payable to her, if needed for her support. It seems to me that the intention of the testator to make this $2,000 a charge upon the land, and thus provide security for its payment, appears \u201c by natural and obvious implication from the provisions of the will.\u201d] [1] See Gilbert\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 347, Wise\u2019s Est., 188 Pa. 258, Moran\u2019s Est., 13 Pa.

Portee, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">We hold with the court below that Ezekiel Gumaer made the moneys to be paid to Ms widow a charge upon the farms devised to his sons. The intent of the entire will is in accord with this construction. The language of the particular clause is, that if the three sons \u201c shall accept the above property, it shall be on condition that they each pay annually an equal portion to their mother, Clarinda Gumaer, of six per cent interest on \u00a72,000, and, if needed for her support, also the principal, each paying one third.\u201d From this language it appears that the testator coupled the payments by the devisees, with the devises of the land, and made the payments a condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>upon which the clevises should vest. Upon the authority of Moran\u2019s Estate, 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 251, the real estate thus devised became, in equity, chargeable with the payments to be made to the testator\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The order of the court below is not clear. The defendant, Hartley, is directed to pay Clarinda Gumaer arrears of interest. These seem to amount to $292. It further directs that a sufficient amount of the principal be paid \u201cto reduce the same to $500, which will remain a charge upon the land.\u201d This apparently means that the principal charge upon the interest of Hartley is reduced to $500, and that the balance of one third of the principal is to be paid to Clarinda Gummaer. As so construed the majority of this court are of the opinion that the decree should be affirmed. I personally hold to the view that there is no proof showing that the widow needed any part of the principal. She had been able to live without incurring debt, up to the time of the hearing. Furthermore the principal of the charge would still remain subject to such demands as her proven necessities might hereafter make upon it. In obedience, however, to the directions of the majority of the court the order is entered that the decree of the court below be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
