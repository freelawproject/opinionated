Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">This judgment was rightly entered non obstante' veredicto on the point reserved. The action was for damages for injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s horses resulting from being struck by a trolley car. The accident took place at or near the intersection of two streets in the suburbs of the city of Scranton. The plaintiff was approaching High street on which a single track of the defendant company was laid which was used for travel in both directions and was at a steep grade. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony relating to what he did immediately preceding the collision is not clear, and in some respects is contradictory. To demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>strate this would require many quotations from-the-testimony, unnecessarily extending this opinion. The.- substance of the matter* is that he, at, a distance of twenty or&gt; thirty feet; from the track, looked up and down, and saw no ear-in. either-direction <em>; </em>that he proceeded until the front feet of his horses were across the first rail when- he heard a, whistle,, looked up the grade and saw a car approaching; that he attempted to swing his horses to the left, whereupon the off horse was struck on the rump. On, crossrexamination, he says more than once, that from- the point, of: twenty or thirty feet from the- track until his-- horses- were, over the rail, he. looked down but not- up the track until, he heard'the whistle of the motonman.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">It-is impossible to escape- the. conclusion that he-was guilty of contributory, negligence. The law of Pennsylvania is-, well settled, that in. crossing the track of a trolley company;it is a duty to look, listen, and, if necessary, stop. It may now be. said to-be also.settled, tliat the looking-must be done\u00bb just before entering upon the track, or \u201c at.tbe very edge-of'the track,\u201d as said in Ehrisman, v. Traction. Co., 150 Pa. 180; in which this doctrine was first announced and which has been followed by numerous cases,: Wheelahan v. Traction Co., 150 Pa. 187; Brown v. Traction Co., 14 Pa., Superior Ct. 594; Trout v. Traction Co.,.13 Pa. Superior Ct., 17 ; Cupps v. Traction Co., 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 630 ; McPhillips v. Traction. Co., ante, p. 223; Darwood v. Traction Co., 189 Pa., 592; Burke v. Traction Co., 198 Pa. 497. The- latest case on the. subject is McCracken v. Traction Co., (not, yet reported), in which the opinion was filed by the. Supreme Court, on January 6* 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">There is.- in the case, before us uo testimony on behalf' of the plaintiff which indicates that ,he-complied with the-obligations of: this rule of law. The- testimony excludes- any inference that he looked in the direction; of the approaching car- just, before he- entered upon the track. If he had. so looked \u201c he could, have seen th.e car \u25a0 and stopped, andl the; accident would have been avoided-: \u201d Carson, v. Railway Co., 147. Pa. 219. Theinfractiom of-the- rule\u00bb of law being- apparent; the? judgment entered by the-court below is-unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Tbe case; of? Hamilton v. Traction Co., in- which an opinion Wi filed by the Supreme Court, on January 6, 1902 (not: yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>reported), is distinguishable from the case at bar, since in the former case, as appears by the- opinion of the court, the plaintiff was looking-just as \u201chis horses were about stepping over the track.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
