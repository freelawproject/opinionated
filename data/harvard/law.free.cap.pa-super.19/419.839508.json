Such a case comes within the provisions of the Act of March 11, 1875, P.

As this is a penal statute four persons cannot join as plaintiffs: the act under which they have joined themselves says \u201c person \u201d not persons. The action should have begun in a court of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">Mr. Waite: 1 desire to amend our offer so that it shall contain nothing except that the defendant in this case peddled goods, wares and merchandise which he did not manufacture through the lower end of this county and sold the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">Mr. Woods: We ask for a nonsuit on the ground that the record shows that this suit was brought under the act of 1840, amended by the act of 1889, and for the reasons we gave before, we ask for a compulsory nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">The Court: In view of the motion just now made by counsel for the defendant for a compulsory nonsuit, we will rule upon that motion and it will, in the view we take of the case, dispose of the pending offer as well. The transcript in the case on trial from the justice of the peace, showing that the suit as there brought was based upon an act of assembly approved April 16, 1840, and its supplement of May 9,1889, and the act of 1840 referring to the act of March 30, 1784, for the method of proceeding to recover the penalty therein prescribed, it follows that the proceeding should have been in accordance with the act of 1784 for the recovery of the penalty sought to be recovered in this case, and the act of 1784 in its 3d section providing that suit for the recovery of a penalty therein mentioned should be in a court of record within this state, it follows that the statutory course provided therein was not pursued. The penalty for which this suit was brought could not be recovered before a justice of the peace, and the case now on trial comes into this court from a justice of the peace. We have no jurisdiction of the subject, hence the motion for a compulsory nonsuit is sustained, and it is directed that a compulsory nonsuit be entered and an exception is noted for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.

Mercur, 78 Pa. 257.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AO8\">February 14, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AV-o\">Beaver, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b455-9\"><em>We </em>are asked to review a record in connection with which are contained the following docket entries :</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">December 6, 1900, jury called, selected and sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">December 6, 1900, by direction of court, compulsory nonsuit entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">February 14, 1900 (evidently 1901), motion of plaintiff, E. O. Heck, presented to court to amend record by changing style of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">May 24, 1901. Rule to amend record heard by Hon. John M. Bailey, P. J., and discharged, and bill of exceptions sealed by E. O. Heck, plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">June 5, 1901, appeal by plaintiffs to Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">The motion for a nonsuit was made after the commonwealth had made an offer of evidence containing presumably its entire case. This assumption is based upon the fact that plaintiff made no effort to amend or enlarge the offer after the motion for nonsuit was made. This offer was not formally ruled out but is incidentally passed upon by the granting of the motion for a non-suit, the court saying: \u201c In view of the motion just now made by counsel for the defendant for a compulsory nonsuit, we will rule upon that motion and it will, in the view we take of the case, dispose of the pending offer as well.\u201d The Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, provides: \u201c That whenever the defendant, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the trial of a cause in any court of common pleas of this commonwealth, shall offer on evidence, it shall be lawful for the judge presiding at the trial to order a judgment of nonsuit to be entered, if in his opinion the plaintiff shall have given no such evidence as in law is sufficient to maintain the action, with leave,\u201d etc. The motion for a nonsuit, after the plaintiff\u2019s offer, was, in effect, a demurrer to the evidence, and the granting of the motion was equivalent to a decision by the court that the plaintiff had offered no evidence, that is, no sufficient evidence to sustain the issue. We think, therefore, that the case comes within the provisions of the act of 1875 above quoted, which further provides that, in. case of a motion to set aside the judgment. of nonsuit and a refusal to do so, \u201c the plaintiff may remove the record, by writ of error, into the supreme court for revision and review in like manner and with like effect as he might review a judgment rendered against him upon a demurrer to evidence.\u201d No motion, so far as the record shows, has ever been made to set aside the judgment of nonsuit. The case, therefore, as we view it, comes within the ruling in Haverly v. Mercur, 78 Pa. 257. If it be said, that the appeal is from the decree of the court, refusing the motion to amend made subsequently to the nonsuit, it is sufficient answer to say that it is an interlocutory decree and not a final judgment, and from it no appeal lies. This appeal, therefore, has been improvidently taken and the motion to quash must be allowed. Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
