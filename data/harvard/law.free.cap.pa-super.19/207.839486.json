The preliminary driving of stakes necessary to fix where this house was to be located was not a \u201c proceeding with said work\u201d such as is referred to in the Act of assembly of June 26, 1895, P. L., 869. <em>Answer: </em>The answer is, I cannot so say. It is a question for the jury as to when the stakes were driven and their character and whether they 'were the stakes driven for the laying out of the building and from which it was erected. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">2. The words \u201c to proceed with said work \u2019\u2019contained in the Act of assembly of June 26, 1895, P. L. 369, does not refer to the time of driving the stakes by which the cellar digging is to be commenced. <em>Answer: </em>The answer is, the driving of the stakes in pursuance of the erection of the building and upon which the building is erected is a commencement. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\">3. The words \u201c to proceed with said work\u201d contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Act of assembly of June 26, 1895, P. L. 369, refer to tbe actual construction of the building, which in this case was the digging of the cellar. <em>Answer: </em>Our answer is the same as to point two. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">4. Unless the jury finds under the evidence that T. R. Tunis or H. W. Sellers authorized William Eves, Jr., to proceed with the work before the contract was signed, the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>We answer, that is affirmed,\u2014 but the jury may find from Mr. Tunis\u2019s and Mr. Sellers\u2019s presence when the stakes were driven, that they authorized the commencement of the building, \u2014 if the jury believe that the stakes were then driven from which the building was erected, and then this point is not affirmed. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">This agreement, as we construe the law, the agreement between the owner of the land and the contractor, to bind the material man must be entered into before the commencement of the building, and if it is not, then the subcontractor may recover notwithstanding the agreement has been entered into and is on record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">[The only question then in this case for you to decide is, was this building commenced prior to the execution of this written contract?] [2] If it was, then I charge you that the plaintiff is entitled to recover $151.17 and interest upon it from whatever time interest may be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\">Your verdict will depend altogether upon what view you take of the testimony relating to the commencement of this building. We charge you and [it is the law that the staking out of a building and laying of the lines of the building is its commencement if that staking and that laying out has been carried out in the erection of the building. So that if you shall find from the testimony in this case that this building was staked out and that the building was substantially constructed or erected from it as upon the land and that was prior to the entering into of this contract, prior to May 8, 1899, then this plaintiff is entitled to recover.] [1] But if from all the evidence in the cause you find that this building was not commenced until after the entering into of this contract between Mr. Tunis and Mr. Eves, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $156.42.

Porter,</author>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In this ease there was a written contract between the owner and the contractor which contained a stipulation against liens. No copy is furnished to us. We will, however, assume that the terms of this stipulation were legally sufficient to effectuate the purpose intended, since no question is raised upon the point. The contract, including the stipulation, was filed with the prothonotary pursuant to the terms of the act of May 8, 1895. The positive testimony of the contractor and the architect is that the contractor had no authority to commence work other than that conferred by the written contract. This evidence is not contradicted. It is shown that the plaintiff had no authority from the defendant, the owner of the land, to furnish materials to the land. They were furnished to the contractor after the execution of the contract. The right to proceed with the work was then first acquired by the contractor by virtue of his contract. The rights of the subcontractor were acquired solely through the principal contractor. The rights, of both to file liens were, by the terms of the contract, filed with the prothonotary, gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
