Clark, [l. s.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-32\">At the time the note was executed, Henry G. Clark owned real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>estate, part of it lying in Lancaster county, and part in Lebanon county. On 27th December, 1851, judgment was entered on this note in <em>Lancaster county </em>\u2014 and on 29th December, 1851, another judgment on it was entered in <em>Lebanon county ; </em>in each case by the prothonotary or his deputy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">On 6th January, 1852, Clark executed^. deed of trust to David M. Karmany, for the benefit of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">Clark died on 5th February, 1853, and letters of administration on his estate were granted to the said David M. Karmany on 26th September, 1853. It was stated on the part of the appellee that for most of the time between the date of the note and his death, Clai\u2019k was a resident of the borough of Lebanon, and it was alleged had not questioned the validity of the judgment entered in Lebanon county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">On 26 th September, 1853, a petition of Karmany, the administrator, was presented to the Court for a rule to show cause why the judgment entered in <em>Lebanon </em>county should not be stricken from the records; and on November 15, 1853, the rule was made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">Appeal was taken on the part of John Ely, and exception was taken to the vacating of the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-10\"><em>Weidman </em>and <em>Punch, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag-\">It was, <em>inter alia, </em>said that the obligpr had a right to confess two judgments for the same debt, and that this instrument was not one containing a warrant to a prothonotary to enter judgment, though by the Act of 1806 it is made the duty of the prothonotary to enter judgments on such instruments. If the entry of the second judgment were irregular, it was said that Clark himself had not instituted any proceeding to have it set aside, and that the administrator of his estate was estopped. Clark\u2019s estate is insolvent, and it was intimated that his assignee, under the deed of trust, was the proper person to institute proceedings to have it set aside, if erroneously entered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-11\"><em>Kline </em>and <em>Boughter, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAf\">By the 28th section of the Act of 24th February, 1806, it is made the duty of the prothonotary of any Court, &amp;c., on the application of any person, being the original holder (or assignee of such holder) of a note, bond, or other instrument of writing, <em>in which judgment is confessed, </em>or containing a warrant for an attorney-at-law or other person to confess judgment, to enter judgment against the person or persons who executed the same, &amp;c. A judgment on warrant of attorney is, in contemplation of law, a judgment rendered by the Court: Gibson, J., 1 <em>Penna. Rep. </em>251. The instrument became merged in the first judgment entered upon it. There was no proof made that Clark knew that the second judgment was entered. The ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ministrator of his estate has the right to ask that the judgment be vacated: Lowber\u2019s Appeal, 8 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>389</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Abk\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AXl\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHB\">The instrument on which the judgments were entered is, in construction of law, a power given to the prothonotary. He has no better right than an attorney-at-law to enter two judgments under a single warrant. The entry of the first judgment exhausts the power, and in this case the Court committed' no error in vacating the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
