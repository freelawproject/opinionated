It was not under seal. It was stated in it that Robert had leased to William on 27th March last, all his interest in certain lands and appurtenances belonging to the firm of Wm. H. P. &amp; Co. for the term of six years from the 1st inst., and had also assigned all his interest in the personal estate of the firm, to the said William. It was agreed that William was to use the interest and investments or capital, in carrying on the <em>tanning </em>business. The amount of the investments of each was to be ascertained by settlement of the partnership accounts, and the balance of the individual accounts between the parties to be ascertained by a settlement of accounts between them, the investments of each to be equalized by a note with interest. William was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>pay rent during the lease. The profits were to be applied to the debts for which they were <em>jointly </em>bound, from time to time as it could be spared from their business until such debts were paid. William was to account for any residue of profits after payment of the debts, deducting $200 for his services. The business was to be closed at the expiration of the lease, and if any balance was due to Robert after paying his part of the debts and any indebtedness to William, then the balance to be paid to Robert. It was agreed that Robert was to release to William all his interest in all real estate held in common by himself, William, and John, and was to assign his interest in all outstanding claims due to him, William, and John jointly, and William to account for one-third of the same. Robert was to assign to William his interest in all debts due to the estate of his father, for which William was to account. The receipt of Isabella Kelley and the interest of Robert on the judgment assigned to her as collateral security was to be assigned to William; and after the payment of the debt of Isabella Kelley, William to account to Robert for no greater amount of that judgment than he received thereon: and it proceeded, <em>\u201c </em>but it is understood between the parties that anything herein contained shall not render void or of no effect an article of agreement, made September, 1847, in reference to losses that might be sustained'ira <em>consequence of the liabilities for J. P. </em>The several sums mentioned in the lease, the assignment of personal property and releases are not to be taken into account in settlement. Said Wm. H. is to render an account of all produce and property of whatever kind he may receive from the lands released to him.\u201d In witness whereof, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">The lease was given in evidence \u2014 also an assignment by Robert to William of partnership property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">Evidence was given, on part of defendant, of payments by William of debts of John for which William and Robert were security, which debts were of dates <em>prior </em>to the agreement of September, 1847.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">On part of the defendant it was then offered to prove that before and since the date of the agreement of 1st September, 1847, William Patterson, the defendant, had paid large sums of money for which he and Robert and John were liable. The several offers were marked A, B, C, D, and were all overruled and exceptions were taken. The evidence referred to in these offers seemed to relate to legacies charged on lands devised to William, Robert, Andrew, and John, in the will of their father, of which the said four sons were executors, and for which they gave their bonds. It was alleged that these bonds were payable on 1st September, 1847, and that the interest accruing since that time and the principal had been paid by the defendant. John Patterson, it was said, was insolvent in 1845. It was stated in the third of the offers that it was made as well to show payments by William,' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>under the agreement of September, 1847, as by way of set-off to any claim, the plaintiff may have in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">Thus it did not appear that the claims referred to in the offers were for debts for which William and Robert were <em>security </em>for John.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">On part of the defendant, the following points were submitted\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">1. That there is no such cause of action set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement as will entitle him to recover in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">2. That there is no such cause of action set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s writ and statement as will entitle Mm to recover upon any evidence given in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\">8. That the agreement of the 1st September, 1847, does not involve any subject-matter which gives a right of action to either party to it upon the instrument itself, but that the consideration for entering into it is an existing state of accounts and liabilities, which alone are the subject of an action to be affected by the terms mentioned in that agreement, by which such settlement or action is to be governed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">4. That the agreement of the 1st September, 1847, is so merged in the agreement between the parties, of the 3d April, 1849, that this action cannot be maintained upon it, but that it is the legal interpretation of the agreements of the parties, that their settlement was to be postponed until the end of the <em>six years </em>mentioned in that agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-12\">5. That upon the statement filed in this cause, and the proof, that in fact $4707.75 of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not paid by him <em>until after this suit was </em>brought, he cannot recover that amount in tMs action, but must be limited in the amount of his claim to the money actually paid by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-13\">Graham, President Judge, charged that by the agreement of September, 1847, William and Robert were <em>severally </em>liable for debts of John, and were <em>jointly </em>liable for other of his debts, and to equalize their losses, agreed that upon a final settlement and payment of the debts of John, for which they or either of them were liable, the loss should be equalized between them, so that one should not lose more than the other. Robert, the plaintiff in .this case, alleges he has paid more of John\u2019s debts embraced by the terms of their agreement, than William has paid, and claims to recover one-half of the sum he has paid more than William. The parties have adduced evidence of the amounts paid by them respectively, and but few of the items were controverted. He referred to the jury to determine the state of the accounts, and to find accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-14\">In answer to the first and second points, he observed that if there was no cause of action set out in the statement, the defendant should have demurred. The <em>third </em>he answered in the negative. To the <em>fourth: </em>That there was nothing in the agreement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>3d April, 1849, to preclude the plaintiff from maintaining this action ; and the <em>fifth </em>he answered in the negative, observing that <em>\u201c </em>the proof is that the mortgages given by Robert, were received by the mortgagees in payment and satisfaction of the debts John owed them; and in the agreement of 1847, it is recited that the debts which compose plaintiff\u2019s claim in this action, were paid by Robert for John.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">Verdict was rendered for the plaintiff for $2949.31, which was subsequently reduced by crediting an amount considered by the judge to have been erroneously disallowed by the jury; and on 10th December, 1853, judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-7\">It was assigned for error, \u2014 1, 2, 3, and 4. That the Court erred in overruling the evidence referred to in the four bills of exceptions. 5. In the opinion that there was a cause of action set out in the statement. 6. That such a cause of action was proved as entitled the plaintiff to recover on his <em>statement. </em>7. In tbe opinion that the agreement of September, 1847, involved the subject-matter of an action. 8. In the opinion that it was not merged in that of 1849. 9. In refusing to answer <em>thejfifth </em>point affirmatively.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-9\"><em>Watts, </em>with whom was <em>Doty, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8N\">It was contended that it was not intended that the agreement of 1847 should be actionable, but only evidence of the understanding between the parties to which reference might be made. But if it were actionable, it was merged in that of 1849. It is not stated in the latter agreement that it is not to <em>affect </em>the agreement of 1847, but only that it is not to render it <em>void.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-10\">As to the bills of exception, the object was to show payments by William for Robert, which made the plaintiff debtor. It was offered to prove payment of joint debts and legacies under their father\u2019s will, and that the plaintiff was indebted several thousand dollars to defendant; and yet the plaintiff was permitted to recover in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-11\">The agreement of 1849 provides that after payment of the debt to Isabella Kelley, William was to account for no greater sum than he shall receive upon the judgment against John and then follows a stipulation, which, it was alleged, was intended to provide that when a settlement was made, their losses as securities for John should be equalized. It was alleged that those securities were not all discharged, for the agreement of 1849 was to continue for six years to enable William to discharge them as well as other debts for which they were liable. If the plaintiff has a right of action, he should have shown that all the joint or several liabilities <em>for John </em>were discharged, for it was said that it was not till then that a right of action could accrue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-12\"><em>Casey </em>and <em>Parker, </em>with whom was <em>Sharon, </em>for defendants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcH\">The agreement of 1847 had reference only to the personal debts of <em>John, for which they were security; </em>and not to debts which they owed as executors or as devisees under their father\u2019s will. It was not intended to apply to debts which John owed as devisee, and which were liens on the land. The object of the agreement of 1849 was to arrange the legacies and debts of their father\u2019s estate, and carrying on the tanning business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">The first four assignments involve the same principle, and all related to matters reserved in the agreement of 1849, for settlement at the end of the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-7\">The question of merger is one of <em>intention; </em>and it was said that such an idea is at variance with their agreement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b470-9\">Knox, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A39\">Under the agreement of the 1st September, A. d. 1847, William H. Patterson was liable to pay to Robert a sum which would equalize their payments, made on behalf of their brother John Patterson. The only point in the case before us, about which there can be any difficulty, is this. Is the agreement of 1st September, 1847, upon which this action is based, so affected by that of 3d of April, 1849, that it cannot be made the subject of a separate suit before the expiration of the time fixed in the second agreement ?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">There is no necessary connexion between these two contracts. The one has reference solely to liabilities incurred for John Patterson, whilst the effect of the other was to transfer to William II. Patterson, for a given period of time, the entire interest in the property and business theretofore owned and carried on by them jointly. This provision is to be found in the second contract \u2014 \u201c But it is understood between the parties that anything herein contained shall not render void or of no effect an article of agreement made September, 1847, in reference to losses that might be sustained in consequence of the liabilities for J. P.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">By express terms, then, the contract now in question is preserved, and its binding force acknowledged. Nor can we find anything in the second agreement which satisfies us that the time of execution with respect to the first is thereby prolonged. Such may have been the intention of the parties, but it is not so expressed in what is to us the evidence of their intention, viz., the writing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">It is unnecessary to examine the numerous errors assigned in detail. It was frankly admitted upon the argument by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that, they relied mainly upon the question which we have just considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">The evidence contained in offers marked A, B, C, D, was impertinent to the issue trying, and consequently there was no error in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The 5th, 6th, and 7th assignments relate to the cause of action, and its sufficiency. It certainly cannot seriously be questioned, but that where two persons are jointly and severally bound in unequal sums as security for a third, an agreement in writing under seal between themselves to equalize the loss will be obligatory, and may be enforced in an action at law. There is nothing in such an agreement forbidden either by the principles of law or morality, and its consideration may be found, if the character of the instrument rendered it essential, in* the mutual undertakings..</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The 8th has already been noticed, and the 9th has no validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-8\">Lewis, J., and Woodward, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
