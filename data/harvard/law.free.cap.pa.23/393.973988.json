By a written agreement of 6th May, 1786, between persons interested in the Cornwall and other estates, it was agreed that partition be made, and that <em>\u201cthe ore hanks hAonging to Cornwall Furnace he divided, into three parts\u201d </em>and that the parts considering quantity and quality be allotted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b393-11\">In a subsequent agreement dated 30th August, 1787, it was alleged that the former agreement could not be carried into execution without injustice to some of the parties, and it was agreed that \u201cthe ore banks belonging to Cornwall Burnace shall remain together and undivided as a tenancy in common, the parties interested to have certain portions, and that for this purpose <em>an accurate survey shall he made of the said ore hanks and hills, </em>if not- already done, and it is hereby declared to be the true intent and meaning thereof, that neither of the said parties, their agents or workmen, shall interfere or interrupt either of the other parties at any mine hole opened and occupied for the purpose of raising iron ore.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b393-12\">Another agreement was made on the same day as follows:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b393-13\">Whereas, It hath been suggested that the article respecting the ore banks and hills requires further explanation, and that it may so happen that veins of ore may extend <em>beyond, the limits of the survey made lately by Thomas Clark, </em>it is hereby expressly declared and agreed that the said Burd Grubb, Henry Bates Grubb, and Robert Coleman, and their respective heirs and assigns, shall have full liberty and privilege of ingress, egress, and regress, to and from the said <em>mine hills, </em>and shall have free and uninterrupted liberty and power to dig, sink shafts, drive drifts,'raise and carry away any ore that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>be found to extend beyond tbe limits of the said survey, without doing any material damage to the iron works or plantations.

In the absence of any survey as referred to in the supplemental agreement of 1787, the said agreement is to be considered as an extension instead of a limitation of the rights of the tenants in common; and under the supplemental agreement shafts might be sunk and drifts made beyond the base of the mine hills for the purpose of mining veins found to be contained in the hills.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-8\">3.

Neither party could maintain <em>trespass </em>against the other for removing surface ore from one of the hills from above its base.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-10\">5. The rule that judgment cannot be entered on a general verdict for a plaintiff where his declaration contains two or more counts one of which is bad, does not apply to the pleas of a defendant sued in trespass. If he have a single good plea which goes to the plaintiff's right of action, and a general verdict is rendered for him, he is entitled to judgment though some of his pleas were, bad, unless it appear that the evidence was inapplicable to his perfect plea.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-11\">6.

They reported that they had vieAved the Cornwall Furnace, Hopewell Forges, Union Forge, and all the other real estate late the property of Curtis Grubb and Peter Grubb, and had allotted three undivided fourth parts to Curtis Grubb, and one undivided fourth part to Robert Coleman, of Cornwall Furnace, and lands \u201c hereinafter described and referred to in a draft or plot made by Thomas Clark, viz., No. 1 and No. 2, containing seven hundred and fifty acres, excepting thereout the draft of the ore banks and hills lately surveyed by the said Thomas Clark,\u201d No. 3, containing 600 acres, &amp;c., &amp;c., allotting various portions of property to Curtis Grubb and Robert Coleman to be held in common <em>as to each other, </em>but in severalty as to the minor children of Peter Grubb.

They awarded the payment of $1704.43, with interest, by Burd Grubb and Henry Bates Grubb to Robert Coleman, and by Curtis Grubb to him of above \u00bf\u00a331, and their report proceeded as follows: \u201c And we do further report, that the tract of land, Bigham\u2019s Place, at Conewago, together with a small tract of forty acres of land adjoining thereto, and <em>also the ore hanks and mine hills of Cornwall Furnace, do still remain undivided, </em>to be held by the said Curtis Grubb, Robert Coleman, Burd Grubb, and Henry Bates Grubb, <em>as tenants in common, </em>according to their respective shares, and to the covenants and articles in the said agreement hereinbefore recited contained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\">The report was confirmed and partition ordered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-8\">The estate of <em>Curtis Cfrubh </em>in Cornwall Furnace and the lands adjacent thereto, including the seven hundred and fifty acre tract hereinbefore mentioned, and also the estate of the said Curtis Grubb and the said <em>Burd </em>Grubb in the Cornwall ore banks and mine hills, became vested in Robert Coleman; and twenty-five undivided forty-eighth parts of the Cornwall ore banks and mine hills, and the Cornwall Furnace estate as aforesaid, were vested <em>in the plaintiffs </em>in this action when it was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-9\">Six undivided forty-eighth parts of the Cornwall ore banks and mine hills, being the quantity of the estate held by their father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Henry Bates Grubb, </em>at the time of the partition of 1787, were at the commencement of this action vested in Edward B.

Grubb, and this suit was then brought, it being alleged, on part of plaintiffs, that this kind of ore, usually called <em>nigger heads, </em>was\u2019 not within the terms o\u2019f the partition of 1787, and that E. B. and C. B. Grubb had no authority to go <em>beyond the bounds of Clark\u2019s survey, </em>except by commencing <em>within it </em>and digging outward, following <em>veins of ore. </em>Clark\u2019s survey, and the construction of the partition of 1T87, were the main points at issue in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\">After the institution of the suit, an agreement in writing, dated 11th August, 1846, was signed b.y attorneys of the parties, by which it was agreed that E. B. Grubb and C. B. Grubb be substituted as the defendants; and it was agreed that at the institution of the suit, the fee simple in the land allotted by the referees to Curtis Grubb and Robert Coleman, was vested in the plaintiffs. Also, that at the time of the institution of the suits, the fee simple estate in the undivided five-sixths of three several tracts surveyed by Thomas Clark, <em>prout </em>the draft of the said survey, which is <em>made part of this ease stated, </em>was vested in the' plaintiffs, and the fee simple\u2019 in the undivided sixth part in the said tracts was vested in the defendants, subject to the covenants in the agreements referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-11\">It was further agreed that the parties shall select three iron-masters, or, in case of failure to select, then three iron-masters to be appointed by the Court, to decide upon the matters in controversy in this suit. A rule being granted on the defendants to show cause why the Court should not appoint three referees, a disavowal by E. B. Grubb of the reference was filed; and in September, 1847, the agreement to refer was stricken from the record. This was one of the errors assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-12\">The first pleas put in were <em>non eul., </em>with leave to give the special matters in evidence, and <em>liberum tenementum. </em>Subsequently new assignments and new pleas were filed, the plea of not guilty being withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-13\">The pleadings were voluminous. See argument <em>postea </em>page, 406.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-14\">On part of plaintiffs, Jacob Weidle, a surveyor, was examined, who exhibited a draft of a survey of the mine hills made by him. He said he made it upon the basis of a survey alleged to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>made by <em>Thomas </em>Olark; that he located the draft according to that survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\">Evidence was then given as to the handwriting of Thomas Clark, and that he had been dead near forty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-7\">There was then offered in evidence a draft alleged to be the draft made by Thomas Clark, and referred to in the report of the referees who made the partition. The draft was objected to as not being sufficiently proved, and that it was without date; but the Court decided that it was sufficiently proved to be submitted to the jury. Exception was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">The surveyor stated that he found no stones or posts set to indicate Clark\u2019s survey; that it does not extend to <em>the foot of the hill.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-9\">On part of <em>the </em>defendants, Hoffer, another surveyor, was examined, who stated that he could not locate on the ground the alleged survey by Clark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-10\">It was then offered to show the extent of <em>the hills ; </em>and that the paper produced as Clark\u2019s survey was not <em>an accurate </em>delineation of the hills, and could not have' been intended as the survey thereof. This was objected to on the ground that Clark\u2019s survey, and not the hills as they exist, is to designate the rights of the parties. The testimony was admitted, and was the subject of exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-11\">This witness said the hills were in most places well defined; in some not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-12\"><em>S. D. Rogers </em>was examined, and, <em>inter </em>alia, testified that according to his present information, Clark\u2019s survey does not embrace <em>all the ore; </em>that he thought a larger area would have to be included to take in the whole of <em>the big hill; </em>that topographers might disagree as to the exact place where a hill terminates and the plane begins. He said he considered <em>the house </em>to be below the hill. He testified that this mine ore he considered stratified; that the ore in these hills does not belong to the class of <em>hematite </em>\u2014is but slightly magnetic. The ore exposed to the elements has passed to the condition of hematite; that the <em>nigger heads </em>approach nearer to hematite, having been acted on by the elements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-13\"><em>J. </em>J7. <em>Rogers </em>testified that he considered that Clark\u2019s survey did not embrace near all the hill, topographically speaking. That the several hills are of one geological formation; the ore being of several varieties, but of the same general character; that the nigger heads were boulders from the harder ore, but were homogeneous with the other ore, of a different composition but of the same formation. Another witness said that he was administrator of Grubb\u2019s estate; managed Mount Hope Furnace for seven years; got ore from Middle* Grassy, and Big Hill, and never heard of any survey or marks around the hills; also that the mines were often broken by faults and rock; that the three hills are distinct and well defined; considered it a mass of ore, not veins; judged by the surface. Another witness said that he was employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>working ore from the hills about 48 years before ; that he never saw or heard of lines on the ground limiting the ore digging; that nigger heads were taken to Mount Vernon, Mount Hope, and other furnaces of Grubb\u2019s. Another witness said that the Clark survey was 200 yards from the top of the hill, and in places about as far from the bottom; and another said that he had been nine years at the works, and always began to mine <em>from the bottom of the hill; </em>that he had mined on <em>the outside </em>of the Clark survey; was digging for Grubbs ; that the mine was commenced before his time; did not know whether it was begun outside or inside of the Clark survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">Pearson, President Judge, in his charge to the jury observed, \u201c that to the declaration of the plaintiffs complaining of a trespass on their freehold, the defendants aver in substance, <em>first, </em>that it is their own free tenement; <em>second, </em>that it belongs to the plaintiffs and E, B. and C. B. Grubb, as tenants in common, and that they entered under the authority of the latter; <em>thirdly, </em>that if it is not within the freehold held in common, that Grubbs had, under the arrangement of 1787, a right to enter and remove the ore taken. That whether the ore taken was situate outside of the property held in common under the agreement made in 1787, depended on the location of the land reserved from <em>partition. </em>If the ore was removed from the land held as a tenancy in common by Coleman and Grubbs, this action will not lie; nor can it be sustained if Grubbs had a license to dig on the mine hills, where the trespass was committed, beyond the line of their common estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">In relation to the survey alleged to have been made by Thomas Clark, he observed, \u201cthat the written agreement of the parties showed that he had surveyed the hills and ore banks agreed to be excluded from partition, and that it was but fair to infer that the act was done for that purpose. He observed that from the endorsement on its back, stating that it was made for Curtis Grubb, Peter Grubb, and Robert Coleman, it was contended on part of the defendants that it was made in the lifetime of Peter Grubb; but he considered it unreasonable to suppose that it was made before any idea seemed to have been entertained of excluding the mine hills from partition, and that it had been carelessly endorsed. He however submitted to the jury to decide whether the survey was made by Thomas Clark, for the purpose of defining the ore hills, and was the one referred to in the writing or not. That if the jury concluded that it was, then to inquire as to whether it was intended to represent a survey marked and defined on the ground, or was made from conjecture; and whether it is possible at this time to locate it with reasonable certainty. * * * If no survey was made, or none can now be discovered, the co-tenants in common or those claiming under them, would have a right to obtain ore from any portion of the ore banks and hills, provided the line to designate the place of taking ore should be so run as to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>privilege of the water to the owner of Cornwall estate, and no material damage be done to the iron works and plantation.\u201d * * * He further observed, \u201c that the great difficulty was to ascertain whether the draft produced, correctly delineated the survey referred to in the report of the referees, or whether some other draft at one time existed. \u2018Wherever Thomas Clark\u2019s survey was made, there the tenancy in common is bounded.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">In answer to the plaintiff\u2019s <em>first </em>point he charged, that \u201cin the absence of any proof of a survey, the ore banks and hills are excluded from partition, and are not presumed to have been embraced. It would have been a violation of the agreement of the parties to have included them. They never were vested in the plaintiffs, or those through whom they claim in severalty; and any one of the tenants in common would have a right to dig ore on any part of the hills, provided they did not violate the agreement as to encroaching on the water rights, or materially injuring the iron works or plantation, but they have no privilege to go beyond the hills.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">He further observed, \u201c Taking it for granted that Thomas Clark made a survey of the premises, as averred by the plaintiffs, and that the ore in dispute was removed from <em>without </em>the boundaries of that survey, had Grubbs a right to do the act under the agreement of August 30, 1787 ? That depends upon the construction of the writing, which is a question solely for <em>the Court.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-8\">He charged that under the supplementary agreement of August, 1787, the Grubbs -were not bound to commence <em>within </em>the lines of Clark\u2019s survey, and work outwards into the adjoining <em>premises; </em>that the vein need not be continuous or connected with the ore within the lines, or unbroken by trap rock, or otherwise, or be <em>an extension </em>of the vein of ore. He expressed the opinion that the Grubbs had full authority under the agreement to remove the ore complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-9\">Fie added, \u201cWe are desirous that you should decide whether the draft in evidence was or was not made by Thomas Clark for the purpose of designating the land exempted from partition, as the establishment of that fact may be important to the parties hereafter. But as we have already said that the action cannot be sustained whether the ore taken was within or without the lines of Clark\u2019s survey (provided it was <em>on either of the mine </em>hills, which is proved and conceded), it (the survey) is not very important to the decision of the present case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-10\">He added, \u201c In the very confused state of the pleadings, it is difficult for us to instruct on which of the various issues to. render your verdict; but when agreed on, we will endeavor to put it in such form as will prejudice none of the plaintiff\u2019s rights hereafter.\u201d April 13th, 1854, the jury say that they find that the defendants were acting for and under E. B. Grubb and Clement B.

According to our construction of the supplemental agreement of the 30th August, 1787, the defendants were justified in removing the ore, whether found within or without the bounds of the survey, and on the correctness or incorrectness of that opinion the cause turned, and if we construed it rightly, must always turn. We are not yet convinced of any error in that opinion, and therefore overrule the motion for a new trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-8\">As to whether the pleadings are or are not such as to sustain a judgment, he, <em>inter </em>alia, observed that \u201c as no defects were pointed out on the trial, or on the motion in arrest of judgment, we take it for granted they are-regular. The verdict was drawn up hastily, and for the mere purpose of avoiding injury to the plaintiffs\u2019 title, by reason of any of the various pleas inserted by the defendants. All that was intended by the verdict, was to exclude a conclusion. If it has that effect it will have performed its office, as there is a general finding for the defendants, with a sufficient statement that they did not pass on or determine the titles of the - parties, but found, under the instruction of the Court, that there was a license to dig and remove the ore.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-9\">It was assigned for error: 1. The Court erred in permitting the defendants to give evidence of the extent of the hills, on and around the summit of which, the Cornwall ore banks and mine hills are located, as pertinent to the location of Clark\u2019s survey, such evidence tending to mislead the jury as to the true point at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>issue. 2. The Court erred in admitting the draft of Esquire Hoffer, purporting to show the extent of the Cornwall hills, by taking the water line at the base of them as pertinent to the location of Clark\u2019s survey, such evidence tending to' mislead the jury as to the true point at issue. In 8d and 4th it was alleged that the Court erred in the charge as to the <em>first </em>point, and also in avoiding it. 5. The Court further erred in their answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 first point, in this: That in connexion with that portion of their answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 first point, quoted in the fourth specification of error, the Court also say: \u201cIf no survey was made, then we must resort to the next best evidence \u2014 the other portion of the description of the agreement \u2014 \u2018 the ore banks and hills.\u2019\u201d Which was error, because it submitted to the jury the question whether Clark\u2019s survey had ever been made, whereas the agreements of the parties and the record of the partition of 1787, were conclusive evidence in .law that it had been made; and if they were not conclusive, there was no evidence that it was <em>not </em>made. 6. The Court erred in all that part of their charge relating to the construction of the supplementary agreement of 30th August, 1787, which is in answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 second point. 7. The Court erred in entering judgment on the verdict, because it did not find any issue joined. 8.

The main purpose of the parties was <em>partition. </em>By the <em>first </em>agreement of that day, it was stipulated that an accurate survey should be made of the <em>ore banks and mine </em>hills, to which alone the tenancy in common should be applicable. All beyond that was to belong to rvhomsoever it was assigned in the partition. If there had been no other agreement, it was said that the defendants could not have taken any ore beyond the limits of the survey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-8\">After the first agreement was executed, it appeared to the parties, perhaps by the production of Clark\u2019s survey, that the veins of ore might extend beyond the limits of the survey. It was said that it was evident that the parties meant to retain the interest they then held in such ore as was then <em>known to exist in a mass cr body </em>within the limits of the survey, and <em>to </em>resign their r-ight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>to all else. The extension of the mass of ore they could not know, and therefore they use doubtful language. The intention was to secure to each owner an interest in the <em>main body </em>of the ore, should it happen to extend beyond the limits of the survey. A stipulation, therefore, which enabled the parties to pursue the main body of ore outside of the lines of the survey within the lines was consistent with the main intention of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">If the construction of the Court wore unsound as to <em>the main body of ore, </em>it was especially so when applied to the detached ore scattered over the surface, weighing from several pounds to several tons, as this did not constitute <em>a vein of ore, </em>and its existence was evident to the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-7\">The pleadings made <em>two </em>issues, \u2014 1. Whether the ore was taken within the bounds of the survey. 2. Whether the taking of the ore was within the provisions of the- supplementary agreement of August, 1787, permitting parties to follow the ore when it extended beyond the bounds of the survey. The verdict does not find either of these; nor indeed any issue. The substance of the issue should be found: <em>Salkeld </em>372; 1 <em>Ld. Raymond </em>324; 2 <em>Id. </em>1518; 2 <em>Tidd </em>922; 5 <em>Cranch </em>19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">8th assignment.

At the base of each are small streams of water which mark the termination or foot of the hill. On survey, made shortly before the trial, they were found to contain 297J acres. The north and northeastern slope of the <em>Big Hill, from which the ore in question was taken, </em>averaged 20\u00b0 or 30\u00b0 of elevation from the stream at its base. The Cornwall furnace, dwelling-house, and coal-house, are quite near to the Western or Northwestern base of the Big Hill, and, in part, on a spur of it. The three hills are of one continuous deposit, and the formation has distinct boundaries. In their natural state they were covered from the summit to the base, to the streams of water, with top ore, from one to fifteen feet in thickness. It was called (by miners) <em>nigger heads, </em>and varied in size from a pound weight or less to masses weighing ten tons or more, and with these was intermingled fine ore. The north slope of the big hill was covered with ore in this way, not in detached lumps, but with lumps or masses so intermingled, not wholly <em>on, </em>but also <em>under </em>the surface to various depths. In many parts of the hills, after passing through the top ore, ore more compact is found called body ore, which also, however, contain nigger heads, or masses such as existed on the surface.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The referees appointed for the division of the ore banks belonging to Cornwall Furnace into three parts, &amp;c., advised the parties that the agreement could not be carried into execution; and, in pursuance of such recommendation, the first agreement of 30th August, 1787, was made to make partition according to quantity and quality, and to assign according to <em>the real interests and convenience of the parties. </em>By this agreement, the parties were to have right to dig, sink shafts, raise and carry away any ore that may be found to extend beyond the limits of the survey. The purpose was to secure to each party a full share of all the ore in the mines. An <em>accurate survey of the ore banks and hills </em>was to be made. The survey was but secondary evidence of the banks as exhibited in it. The survey was to be <em>accurate. </em>The courses and distances of a survey but point to the place: 8 <em>Barr </em>154; 6 <em>Id. </em>258. The words, <em>if not already </em>done, may indicate a doubt whether a survey already made was accurate. To this agreement Thomas Clark was a witness. In the supplemental agreement it is assumed that the survey had been lately made; but by this agreement full liberty of ingress and regress was given to and from the <em>mine hills.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">If the right to dig ore found outside of the limits of the survey is the right to take such ore as was a part of the same deposit as in that of the hills, then, whether the survey was accurate or not was not material, as the ore was secured to the parties. If the ore was secured, why limit the parties to an inconvenient way of working in order to prove that the ore outside of the survey is part of the ore of the hills? Though the agreement refers to the yeins of ore which <em>may </em>exist, the agreement was not designed to exclude the ore which was <em>visible </em>on the surface. The word <em>vein </em>was not used in its geological, but in its popular sense, to describe the ore <em>as it existed in the hills. </em>The right to dig, sink shafts, and drive drifts, &amp;c., comprehends the right to exercise every mode in which ore is sought for and raised; and drifts are driven up and not down a hill; the only limitation being the refraining from doing material damage to the iron works or plantations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">It was not disputed that a survey of the ore banks had been made by Thomas Clark, and it was admitted that such a survey was referred to in the agreement of 1787 as one lately made; but it was disputed whether the survey produced was <em>that survey. </em>The draft in question was run by Weidle, a surveyor, in 1814, and he found no marks of that survey on the ground. It was not an accurate survey of the hills. It comprehended a portion of Templeton\u2019s Hill, which was separated from the Big Hill, and on which there was no evidence of ore. The lines of the survey did not coincide with the lines of the base of the hill; one of the witnesses stated, that one of the lines of Clark\u2019s survey was \u201c40 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>50 perches from the foot of the bill. In some places it is half way down the hill \u2014 in some places more, in some less.\u201d Weidle\u2019s survey embraced only 104 acres, while the hills included an area of 297 acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">The evidence given by defendants to show the extent of the hills, and that they were distinct and defined upon the ground, was relevant to show that the draft in evidence was not the draft referred to in the agreement of 1787, and an accurate survey of the hills ; and also to determine the true construction of the agreement respecting them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\">A Court is not bound specifically to answer points, if they be answered in the general charge: 6 <em>Harris </em>215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\">The portion of the verdict failing to find as to the draft, or whether the place from which the ore was taken was within the bounds of the survey, or on the property held in common, was immaterial, and might be rejected as surplusage: 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>441; 1 <em>Watts </em>259; <em>Whar. Dig. </em>pl. 917. - It was found, according to the instructions of the Court, that the defendants were justified whether the ore was taken <em>within </em>or <em>without the bounds of Clark\u2019s survey. </em>The verdict was not special, but <em>general: </em>2 <em>Harris </em>21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-9\">The pleadings on part of the defendants presented <em>two </em>issues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-10\">In the first four pleas was averred the incorporeal hereditament, created by the agreement of 30th August, 1787, and there was set out at large the proceedings under that agreement as the foundation of the title. In them was averred and specifically pleaded the title by which this incorporeal hereditament was vested in E. and C. B. Grubb \u2014 and a license from them to the defendants sued. These pleas were pleas of justification under this incorporeal hereditament.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-11\">Upon the suggestion that under the general plea of <em>liberum tenementum </em>to the novel assignment of the plaintiff, the defendants could not give in evidence the freehold title of E. and O. B. Grubb to the tenancy in common under the agreement of 1787, and a license to defendants, another special plea was filed setting forth, by reference to the other plea, such freehold <em>title </em>and <em>the </em>license. This also was a special plea of justification, and upon these issues the cause was tried. The plaintiffs did not put in any replication to the special plea of <em>liberum, tenementum, </em>but went to trial on that plea. Thus there were two justifications well pleaded by defendants, either of which being found for them, they were entitled to a general acquittal, and it was not necessary to enter the verdict on either of the pleas: 8 <em>Watts </em>37, Wilson <em>v. </em>Gray.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-12\">The agreement to refer was <em>by its terms </em>to be considered as made under the Act of 16th June, 1836. That Act excepts such suits as respect <em>the title to real estate. </em>It appeared that the reference was made without authority from E. B. Grubb, who disavowed it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>agreement was executory, and nothing had been done under it. It was capable of being revoked: 9 <em>Barr </em>101; 2 <em>Watts </em>492; 4 <em>Watts </em>312.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-6\"><em>Stevens, </em>on same side.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-7\"><em>Meredith, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao0x\">The portion of the verdict alleged as surplusage was not so, and judgment should not have been entered without the issues submitted being found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-8\">It was contended that the whole of the hills as <em>natural objects </em>were not intended to be included within the lines of Clark\u2019s survey. The material question was whether the parties were to hold by the hills as natural objects, or by the deeds and the survey \u2014 and that unless the supplementary agreement of 1787 is to be confined to ore beginning within the survey, it may extend to the whole of the Cornwall estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b407-10\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALv\">If the Court were right in the construction they placed on the agreements of 1787, the right of the Grubbs to take ore from the <em>locus in quo </em>is established, the entry of the defendants under them and as their servants is justified, and all the other questions in the cause disappear, or lose, at least, a controlling influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">When it was found \u201con the fullest investigation\u201d that the large and valuable estates connected with these mine hills could'not be parted in severalty among the owners without great injustice to some of them, the agreement of 30th August, 1787, devised a plan of dividing all except the mine hills, and of keeping them for the common use, undivided, and as a tenancy in common. The difficulties in the way of equal partition of the hills, and the motives and reasons for agreeing to hold them undivided, were fully discussed in Coleman <em>v. </em>Coleman, 7 <em>Harris </em>100, and need not be again entered into here. The question now is whether anything less than the whole of the mine hills was exempted from partition, and appointed to be held in common. The plaintiffs insist that the Clark survey, as it is called, designated what was meant by the mine hills in these agreements; and as Clark\u2019s lines ran around the hills some distance above their natural base, and above the place from which the defendants took the ore in question, they deny the right of the Grubbs to mine below that line, except it be in pursuit of a vein struck above. Such was not the opinion of the Court below, and such is not our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">In the first agreement of 30th August, 1787, these hills are called \u201core banks;\u201d in the supplemental agreement of the same date \u2018\u2018ore banks and hills;\u201d and in the report of referees acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>under these agreements they are called the \u201c ore banks and. mine hills of Cornwall Furnace.\u201d They are three prominent, peculiar, well-defined, natural objects, and it is impossible for us to suppose that the parties intended to exempt from partition anything less than the whole of each of these hills from base to top. There is not a word in the first agreement of 1787 to indicate such an intention, or to impose any limitation on the tenants in common as to the places in the hills where they were to mine, except that their agents and workmen should not interrupt each other in their respective mine holes. Whatever might fairly be understood as constituting the \u201c ore banks\u201d was to be held in common, and where-ever in or upon these banks the parties found ore, whether \u201c nigger heads,\u201d surface, or vein ore, they might take it, so as not to interfere with each other\u2019s openings. Such was the agreement as at first made on the 30th August, 1787. The supplement of the same day was intended to explain the article respecting the ore banks, and it is supposed to have imposed limits on the rights of such of the tenants in common, in whom it vested an incorporeal estate, according to a survey said to have been then lately made by Thomas Clark. I confess the words of this supplement would never strike me as a <em>limitation, </em>but rather as an <em>extension </em>of the rights of the parties. Free ingress, egress, and regress are secured to each owner \u201cto and from <em>said mine Mils,\u201d </em>and \u201cthe free and uninterrupted liberty and power to dig, sink shafts, drive drifts, raise and carry away ore that may be found to extend beyond the limits of the said survey, without doing any material damage to the iron works or plantations.\u201d What \u201cthe survey made lately by Thomas Clark\u201d was, does not appear. The agreement of which this supplement was explanatory, provided that \u201c an accurate survey should be made of the said ore banks and hills, if not already done and the referees filed with their report a survey made by Thomas Clark of the estates divided, but \u00f3n which they did not designate the mine hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On the trial of this cause a survey was put in evidence professing to he the survey alluded to in the agreement and supplement, and the Court submitted it to the jury to find whether it was indeed that survey or not; but they returned \u201cthat they do not find whether the draft alleged to have been made by Thomas Clark, and given in evidence in this case, -was or was not the survey referred to in the proceedings in partition.\u201d We are, therefore, destitute of the Clark survey of the mine hills, a circumstance which might be very embarrassing if we were trying rights clearly beyond the natural boundaries of the hills, but for this reason it is more easy to say, nay, it is inevitably necessary to say, that an entry by one of the tenants in common, within the natural boundaries of the hills, was justified by the agreements of 1787. Beside, in the absence of the Clark survey, it is fair to presume that it embraced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the hills as they stand before the eye, for it was to be \u201c an accurate survey,\u201d and the survey of the residue of the joint estate as returned by the referees, instead of embracing a portion of the hills excluded them altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"AjN\">If the Clark survey were such, as in its absence we feel at liberty to presume it was, then the supplemental agreement was in fact, - as its words import, an extension, instead of a limitation of the rights of the tenants in common. Shafts might be sunk and drifts made beyond the base of the mine hills for the purpose of mining veins found to be contained in the.m. Veins of ore, conforming in their dip to the surface of such hills, could he advantageously mined only by taking position beyond the base of the hills, sinking a shaft to the vein, and then mining it' upward to the outcrop. This was probably what was intended to be secured to the parties, and hence the stipulation against damage to the \u201ciron works and plantations\u201d \u2014 all of which would be found beyond the hills and none of them on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">All this, it must be admitted, is somewhat speculative, for it is reasoning in regard to a survey which the jury could not establish from the evidence before them; but it is considered a more reasonable interpretation of the agreement of the parties than one \u25a0which would limit them to an upper section of the hills, and compel them to follow a vein downward instead of upward. Considerable emphasis was laid on the word \u201c <em>extend\u201d </em>in the supplemental agreement, but I see no necessity for presuming that a vein was to be mined downward to determine whether it extended beyond given limits. When iron ore is found in veins and their angle of inclination is ascertained, it is easily determined on the surface, with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes, whether they <em>extend </em>beyond the specified limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">But dismissing all views which connect themselves with the Clark survey, and confining our attention to the terms employed by the parties, we have no difficulty in saying that the mine hills as natural objects, those three upheaved masses of rock and ore, the outline of which is no doubt familiar to the eye of every neighbor and miner, were what the parties exempted from partition and agreed to hold in common; and if hereafter geologists cannot agree, as to the limits of the hills \u2014 at what points they begin to rise \u2014 no such question is present to embarrass us here, for the ore sued for was confessedly taken from the body of the main eastern hill, someway above its base. If we accounted the words of the parties doubtful and uncertain, we should be guided to the same construction of their agreements by their.long usage. For two generations they and their descendants have treated these mine hills as a tenancy in common, and have used them as appurtenant to their respective furnaces and forges. IIow can it be expected that at this late day Courts should construe the agreements of 1787 in opposition to this contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>exposition ? There is nothing in the verbiology of the papers, in the history of the property, or in the evidence in the cause to excuse, I will not say to demand a construction that would exclude some of the tenants in common from the treasures of these extraordinary hills. Their ancestors agreed to hold them in common, and as a common inheritance they have descended to the present owners. Whilst they hold them thus, and whilst the ore lasts, we have decided them to be impartible; and it follows that actions of trespass among themselves are not the remedies for grievances whether fancied or real.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">As to the seventh assignment of error, it is sufficient to say that the pleadings, though unnecessarily voluminous, fairly raised the issue on which the cause was put to the jury, and that issue they found distinctly for the defendants. The residue of their verdict is harmless, and might have been rejected as surplusage by the Court. The rule that judgment cannot be entered on a general verdict for a plaintiff where his declaration contains two or more counts, one of which is bad, does not apply to the pleas of a defendant sued in trespass. If he have a single good plea that goes to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action, and a general verdict passes for him, he is entitled to judgment though some of his pleas are bad, unless it appear that the evidence was inapplicable to his perfect plea: Wilson <em>v. </em>Gray, 6 <em>Watts </em>37. Here the title of the parties under whom the defendants justified was well pleaded, and having the verdict they were entitled to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">There is nothing in the eighth assignment; for, though counsel have a right to submit the client\u2019s cause to reference, the client has a right to revoke the submission, which Mr. Grubb did do in good time: Wilson <em>v. </em>Young, 9 <em>Barr; </em>Bingham\u2019s Trustees v. Guthrie, 7 <em>Harris </em>418.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">On the whole we see no error in the record, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
