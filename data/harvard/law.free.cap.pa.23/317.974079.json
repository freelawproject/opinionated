As to the meaning of the terms \u201cnext of kin\u201d or \u201cnearest of kindred,\u201d reference was made to 2 <em>Jarman </em>30-39. In this case <em>Samuel </em>answered all the requisites of the description; the property, therefore, vested in him. What estate had he? The words \u201cnext male heir\u201d and \u201cnearest of kin to me,\u201d were intended evidently to indicate the first taker, and not to qualify the estate. If a female, equally, near of kin with Samuel, had succeeded him, she was to be excluded. The subsequent words show that it was to go to the heirs of the male line \u2014 not to the male heirs of that line, as contended for by the defendant in error. The usual words of inheritance are not here; nevertheless, apt words to convey a fee simple are used. If. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the testator had said, I give it to the \u201cmale heir nearest of kin\u201d at the time of my death, and to the heirs of that line, it would have meant the same as the present will, and would have given a fee simple to the first taker. The meaning of the words succession or successors must control this estate. The testator in effect says: \u201c I give and allow the plantation to whomsoever may be my next male heir at the time of my death, and to his successors.\u201d Successors is the same as heirs, and creates a fee simple: 8 <em>Viner 206; Id. </em>209. The whole scope and words of the will show that the estate was to vest in the person answering the description of next male heir, and then to descend to his heirs. It is therefore a fee simple, and judgment should be entered for the defendant below.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-6\"><em>Eranlclin, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsZV\">It was admitted that the estate vested in the person answering the description at the time of the testator\u2019s death, viz., his eldest and only surviving son, Samuel: Doe <em>v. </em>Spratt, 5 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>Ald. </em>731; 27 <em>E. C. L. </em>163; 3 <em>East </em>288. <em>Heir male </em>is in such case a <em>designatio personae, </em>pointing to the special heir under the statute <em>de donis, </em>and not to the heir or heirs general: 1 <em>Coke </em>66, Arthur\u2019s Case; 2 <em>Vernon </em>729; 5 <em>Burr. </em>2617.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">It was further contended that the estate in remainder which vested in Samuel, was an estate <em>in tail male, </em>which became vested in Milton McIntyre, the plaintiff below, as heir in tail male of Samuel McIntyre. The <em>intention </em>of the testator is the cardinal point of inquiry: 4 <em>Cruise </em>157; 2 <em>Bin. </em>149; 7 <em>Barr </em>16. <em>All </em>of the words of the devise are to be considered: 2 <em>Williams on Exec. </em>931; 3 <em>Yeates </em>187; 1 <em>East </em>263. Successors means heirs: <em>Swinburne </em>145-159. If successors means heirs, the words \u201c <em>on that </em>line\u201d are to be disregarded in order to make the estate devised a fee simple. They can apply only to a fee tail: 8 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>38; 3 <em>Bin. </em>374; 7 <em>Taunton </em>85; 1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>521.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-8\">Words of procreation are not necessary to limit an estate in tail. Any words indicating the testator\u2019s intention to that effect are sufficient: <em>Swinburne </em>166; 4 <em>Cruise </em>268; 8 <em>Viner </em>212; 1 <em>Burr. </em>38. It is difficult to give a more correct description of an estate tail than by speaking of it as vesting iu the male heir, and passing on in succession on that line. The expression \u201c on that line\u201d is a phrase of restraining import; used to impose a precise limit to the previous general expression of male heir. It was in conclusion intimated that an intention was manifested in the devise to limit the estate to the issue of the first taker.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b319-10\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">After giving a life estate to McCoy, the testator allows \u201cthe plantation to come to the <em>nixt mail heair neerest </em>in kindred and relation to <em>mee, </em>according to law, and so on in such-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>cession </em>on that line.\u201d The person who filled the description here given, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, became seised of the estate in remainder. Was he seised in <em>fee simple </em>or <em>fee tail male ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The rule in England is that the heir at law is not to be disinherited except by express direction or necessary implication. That rule should be observed with more strictness here than in England, .because our laws of inheritance are more equal: 2 <em>Bin. </em>20. \u201cEntailments are recommended in monarchical governments as a protection to the power and influence of the landed aristocracy ; but such a policy has no application to republican establishments, where wealth does not form a permanent distinction, and under which every individual of every family has his equal rights and is equally invited by the genius of the institutions to depend upon his own merit and exertions4 <em>Kent </em>20. As the rules of descent established by law are presumed to be founded on w'isdom, and as the policy of the law stands opposed to entailments, the remainderman must be deemed seised in fee simple, unless we are forced by the clear language of the will to give it some other construction. Words of procreation are as necessary to the creation of an estate tail as words of inheritance are to a fee simple: 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>114. Rut we have no words of procreation here. Even the. words which designate the first taker after the life estate, do not necessarily import that he must be one of the heirs of the testator\u2019s body. He may be his \u201cnext male heir nearest in kindred\u201d without being lineally descended from him. The words \u201c so on- in succession on that line\u201d do not therefore necessarily mean that the estate shall go to the heirs of the body of the devisee. The words \u201caccording to law\u201d are not to be rejected in the construction of this will. It is true that the testator may have meant that the law is to be regarded in ascertaining who is his next male heir nearest in kindred and relation to him; but he may also have meant that the estate shall come to him, in the same manner that the law would Lave given it to the heirs of the testator. We adopt this as the true meaning.. The words \u201c on that line\u201d do not necessarily mean the male issue of the devisee, but simply his heirs as contradistinguished from the heirs of the tenant of the life estate previously given. If we created an estate tail by construction in this case, we must do it not only without words of procreation, but without any words which can supply their place. If the succession is not to be regulated according to law, but must be governed by the description given to designate the first taker after the life estate, the result would be inconvenient, and, as we think, contrary to the testator\u2019s intent. Upon the death of every tenant it would be necessary to ascertain, not only his male heir, but the mal\u00e9 heir nearest in kindred and relation to the testator. This, in process of time, would become impossible. And yet this is the line we should be compelled to seek for if we departed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>rules of descent established by law. An estate tail is so readily docked, that we are not willing to suppose the testator had such an unimportant object in view, where his will does not clearly express it. We are of opinion that Samuel McIntyre, the son of the testator, was seised in fee simple of the remainder, and that the plaintiff in error is therefore entitled to judgment on the case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Judgment reversed and judgment for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
