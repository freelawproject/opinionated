Reynolds contends that (1) the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on eight of the eleven counts because \"a rational jury could not have unanimously found that those counts were supported by evidence of particular instances of sexual acts or contact\"; (2) he was unfairly prejudiced by the court's admission into evidence of uncharged sexual abuse; and (3) the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the 1997 and 1998 unlawful sexual contact charges because those charges were subject to a six-year limitations period and the State failed to commence prosecution within that time period. We disagree and affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Preliminary Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In December 2016, Reynolds was indicted on four counts of gross sexual assault, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 253(1)(B) ; six counts of unlawful sexual contact, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 255(1)(C) ; and two counts of sexual abuse of a minor, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 254(3)(A). The indictment alleged a period of ongoing abuse against the victim on or about April 1 of every year from 1997 to 2002. In Count 1 through Count 8, Reynolds was charged with committing one count of gross sexual assault and one count of unlawful sexual contact against the victim on or about April 1 of every year from 1997 to 2000. In Count 9 through Count 12, Reynolds was charged with committing one count of sexual abuse of a minor and one count of unlawful sexual contact against the victim on or about April 1 of 2001 and 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B. Motion In Limine Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 3] After jury selection in June 2017, the State moved in limine, pursuant to M.R. Evid. 404(b), to permit the admission of evidence of uncharged sexual abuse alleged to have taken place outside of Oxford County. According to the State, evidence of this conduct was admissible to \"demonstrate [Reynolds's] opportunity to commit the sexual abuse, the relationship between the parties, as well as the intent to commit the ongoing abuse.\" Reynolds opposed the motion, arguing that admission of the alleged abuse violated both Rule 404(b) and M.R. Evid. 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] A hearing on the motion in limine was held before trial on July 17, 2017. The State clarified that although the \"[t]he majority of the sexual abuse occurred in an apartment in ... Paris [Oxford County],\" incidents also occurred \"on the road and while out camping. And so the [S]tate would like to make reference to those in [its] testimony.\" Reynolds continued to argue against the admissibility of the uncharged abuse, contending that \"[the victim] is claiming about 100 incidents, 80 percent of those happened at the house, at\n   the apartment.... What is the purpose of bringing in uncharged incidents?\" The court concluded that the proposed evidence was properly admissible under Rule 404(b) pursuant our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. DeLong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7913255\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/505/803/#p805\">\n    505 A.2d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805-06 (Me. 1986), because it was probative to demonstrate that \"the relationship between the parties is that this defendant ... considered this, you know, his - his sexual toy. I mean he did this - he did this as a matter of course wherever he went.\" However, in order to limit the prejudicial effect of these uncharged incidents, the court specified that the victim would not be permitted to describe the uncharged conduct \"in detail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Reynolds preserved his objection to the evidence pursuant to Rule 403, claiming the unfair prejudice created by that evidence substantially outweighed its probative value. However, after Reynolds was given the opportunity to request a limiting instruction regarding the proper use of the uncharged conduct, he stated that he did not wish to do so. Specifically, in response to the court's statement, \"You're entitled to [a limiting instruction] ... [a]nd you affirmatively waive that,\" Reynolds replied, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C. Factual History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The case then proceeded to trial. Viewing the trial record in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could rationally have found the following facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Haag\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312343\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/48/207/\">\n    2012 ME 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312343\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/48/207/\">\n    48 A.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The victim was born in April 1987 and was nine years old when she first met Reynolds, who was born on March 30, 1969. At the time, the victim was living with her grandparents in Oxford, but she subsequently moved into an apartment in South Paris with her mother, brother, and Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The victim was sexually abused by Reynolds for \"most of [her] childhood.\" The first incident occurred when she was nine and Reynolds touched her genitals while he was driving with her in his work vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   From that point on, Reynolds touched her genitals weekly, \"more times than [she] can count,\" until she was sixteen. Starting when the victim was ten years old, Reynolds also forced her to put her hands on his genitals. The abuse typically began by Reynolds saying \"something like he wanted to play[,] and then just do what he wanted from there.\" The abuse occurred after the victim got home from school but before her mother got home from work, or on weekend mornings when her mother was either at work or grocery shopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 8] When the victim was ten years old, Reynolds forced her to put her mouth on his genitals while they were alone in the South Paris apartment. Starting when she was twelve years old, Reynolds removed the victim's pants and put his tongue on her genitals. Also when the victim was twelve, Reynolds touched her genitals with his genitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 9] In addition to her testimony regarding specific incidents of abuse, the victim also testified that Reynolds either (1) touched her genitals with his hand or mouth; or (2) forced her to touch his genitals with her hand or mouth on a weekly basis until she was sixteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 10] At no time were the victim and Reynolds married. When the abuse began, Reynolds told her that she would be in trouble if she said anything, and she never\n   told anyone about the abuse while it was happening. In 2015, the victim finally told her then-fianc\u00e9 what had happened to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   D. Specific Unanimity Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 11] At the close of the State's case-in-chief, Reynolds moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to M.R.U. Crim. P. 29(a), which the court denied. After the close of the evidence, the court instructed the jury on specific unanimity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hanscom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316050\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/632/\">\n    2016 ME 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 11-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316050\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/632/\">\n    152 A.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reynolds objected to the court's initial instruction, stating that it was \"a bit of a summary\" and requesting that the court read the unanimity instruction \"exactly as it's written.\" The court agreed to do so and recited the specific unanimity instruction to the jury, generally tracking the language suggested in the\n   <em>\n    Maine Jury Instruction Manual\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alexander,\n   <em>\n    Maine Jury Instruction Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6-65 at 6-133 (2017-2018 ed.). There was no objection to this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   E. Conviction and Sentencing Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts, and a sentencing hearing was held in October 2017. The court sentenced Reynolds to fifteen years' imprisonment, all but ten years suspended, with six years' probation for each count of gross sexual assault, to be served concurrently with one another. In addition, the court sentenced Reynolds to five years' imprisonment for each of the unlawful sexual contact and sexual abuse of a minor charges, also to be served concurrently with the other sentences. This appeal followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2B(b)(1); 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Specific Unanimity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Reynolds contends that because the victim testified only to \"three discrete occasions of sexual acts or contact ... only three convictions could possibly have been the result of unanimous findings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Reynolds, because the victim testified that there were \"hundreds of sexual acts and incidents of sexual contact\" but \"only mentioned three in enough detail to distinguish one from any other,\" the jury could not have unanimously found that he committed the additional eight offenses charged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 14] \"We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State to determine whether a jury could rationally have found each element of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Hanscom\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed a trial court's denial of a request for a specific unanimity instruction where the defendant was charged with two counts of unlawful sexual contact involving two victims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316050\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/632/\">\n    2016 ME 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316050\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/632/\">\n    152 A.3d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the Washington Court of Appeals has observed, \"The more frequent and repetitive the abuse, the more likely it becomes that the victim will be unable to recall specific dates and places.

The victim further testified that by the time she was ten years old and continuing \"probably once a week\" thereafter, Reynolds began forcing her to touch his genitals, also in violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 255(1)(C). In addition, the victim testified that when she was ten years old, Reynolds forced her to put her mouth on his genitals, and when she was twelve years old, Reynolds put his tongue on her genitals, both in violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 253(1)(B). According to the victim, this conduct also occurred \"probably once a week\" until she was sixteen years old, in violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 253(1)(B) and 254(3)(A). Thus, although the jury may have been unable to distinguish among many of the various acts described during this pattern of consistent abuse, it was \"certainly capable of unanimously agreeing\" that the victim's testimony was credible, that this pattern of abuse occurred, and that discrete acts comprising this pattern of abuse took place on or about the dates alleged in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20611\">\n    270 Cal.Rptr. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=792%20P.2d%20643\">\n    792 P.2d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B. Uncharged Conduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b6 26] Reynolds next argues that the court erred in admitting evidence of uncharged sexual abuse because \"[t]he jury was essentially encouraged to punish [him] for a pattern of alleged, yet uncharged behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b6 27] As a preliminary matter, we note that Reynolds's theory on appeal differs from the one he advanced before the trial court. In opposing the State's motion in limine, Reynolds argued only against the victim's references to sexual abuse occurring outside of Oxford County-\"on the road and while out camping\"-and not conduct that occurred in the family's Paris apartment. Here, however, Reynolds argues that the uncharged conduct included not only each act outside of Oxford County, but also every referenced act of sexual abuse beyond the eleven acts specifically alleged in the indictment. According to Reynolds, this means that \"the jury's verdict on eight of the eleven counts is necessarily based on ... generalized evidence overwhelmingly comprised of uncharged conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b6 28] Because Reynolds, having been unsuccessful in his alternative argument before the trial court, has now changed his theory on appeal, we deem his current argument waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teel v. Colson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8027616\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/396/529/#p534\">\n    396 A.2d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534 (Me. 1979). Even if Reynolds had preserved this issue, however, it would be unavailing. Rather than charging Reynolds with upwards of 300 counts of sexual abuse-according to the victim's testimony, she was abused at least once weekly over the course of six years-the State, in exercising its prosecutorial discretion, elected to charge him with only one act of abuse per year within that period of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Heald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7982012\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/382/290/#p301\">\n    382 A.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (Me. 1978) (\"[A] reasonable prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of criminal laws is inherent in our criminal justice system ....\"). The court properly determined that evidence of Reynolds's ongoing abuse was admissible to show the relationship between him and the victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 404(b) ;\n   <em>\n    DeLong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7913255\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/505/803/#p805\">\n    505 A.2d at 805-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 29] Moreover, Reynolds's argument that he was unfairly prejudiced by the admission of this evidence is unpersuasive for three reasons. First, when a defendant believes he has been unfairly prejudiced by the consolidation of several identical crimes into one count of an indictment, he may move for relief from prejudicial joinder pursuant to M.R.U. Crim. P. 8(d).\n   <em>\n    Fortune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7276184\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/34/1115/\">\n    2011 ME 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7276184\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/34/1115/\">\n    34 A.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reynolds failed to do so. Moreover, although Reynolds argues that he was unfairly prejudiced by \"the generic testimony and lack of discrete events in this case,\" he did not request a bill of particulars pursuant to M.R.U. Crim. P. 16(d)(1) and is therefore presumed to have known which crimes he was required to defend against at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cloutier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11968724\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/695/550/\">\n    1997 ME 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11968724\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/695/550/\">\n    695 A.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Reynolds expressly waived his right to a limiting instruction regarding uncharged conduct, and is thereby precluded from now contending that the jury could have decided the case on an improper basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7348600\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/622/96/#p99\">\n    622 A.2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (Me. 1993) (\"[I]n the absence of a request to the court to provide a limiting instruction, we can assume that counsel concluded that a limiting instruction would have overemphasized the importance of the evidence and decided to forego the request for strategic reasons.\" (quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C. Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b6 30] Finally, Reynolds argues that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to Counts 2 and 4-which alleged unlawful sexual contact on or about April 1, 1997, and April 1, 1998, respectively-because those counts were subject to a six-year statute of limitations and the State failed to commence prosecution within that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 31] We disagree. Reynolds is correct that, before 1999, the criminal code provided for a six-year statute of limitations for unlawful sexual contact. 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 8(1), (2)(A) (Supp. 1997); 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 8(1), 2(A) (Supp. 1998),\n   <em>\n    amended by\n   </em>\n   P.L. 1999, ch. 438, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 (effective Sept. 18, 1999). However, the Legislature amended the Criminal Code in 1999 to remove the previous limitations period in 1999, and that amendment applied retroactively to the prosecution of crimes where the victim was younger than sixteen years old and where prosecution under the previous six-year limitations period had not yet been barred. P.L. 1999, ch. 438, \u00a7 3 (effective Sept. 18, 1999). Because the victim was under sixteen years old when Reynolds committed unlawful sexual contact in 1997 and 1998, and the six-year limitations period for those crimes had not yet expired when the Legislature removed the\n   statute of limitations defense in 1999, the State was not prohibited from initiating prosecution for those offenses in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stogner v.

P.L. 2001, ch. 383, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 156 (effective Jan. 31, 2003). As Reynolds observes, the indictment and judgment and commitment refer to different statutory provisions for these counts. Both counts of the indictment refer to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 254(1)(A), (3)(A) (2001)-which applied only when the actor was more than ten years older than the victim-while the judgment and commitment refers to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 254(1)(A) (2001), which applied to circumstances where the actor was at least five years older than the victim, not ten. Because the evidence at trial demonstrated a greater-than-ten-year age gap between Reynolds and the victim, and because the court instructed the jury using \"more than 10 years older\" language, it appears that Reynolds was instead convicted pursuant to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 254(3)(A) (Supp. 2001).
