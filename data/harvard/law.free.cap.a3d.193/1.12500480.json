The defendant, Edward Taupier, sent an e-mail\n   containing threats of violence against a judge of the Superior Court, Elizabeth A. Bozzuto, to a group of acquaintances. The defendant now appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment, rendered after a trial to the court, convicting him of threatening in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3), two counts of disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (3). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the charge of threatening\n   in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) on the ground that the statute is unconstitutional because it did not require the state to prove that he had the specific intent to terrorize Judge Bozzuto,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the trial court improperly considered evidence of events that occurred after he sent the threatening e-mail to support its conclusion that he violated that statute, and (3) the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he violated \u00a7\u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) and 53a-182 (a) (2). We disagree with the defendant's claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history and facts that the trial court found or that are undisputed. In 2012, the defendant's wife, Tanya Taupier, initiated an action to dissolve their marriage. Among the contested issues was the custodial status of the couple's two minor children. In August, 2013, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Carbonneau, J.\n   </em>\n   , ordered that the children reside with Tanya Taupier and attend school in Ellington, where she resided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the spring of 2014, Judge Bozzuto, who was responsible for managing the docket of the family court in Hartford, became involved in the defendant's dissolution proceeding. Judge Bozzuto assumed sole responsibility for the management of the case in order to ensure that it would be adjudicated in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 23, 2014, Judge Bozzuto ordered the Family Services Unit of the Court Support Services Division (family services unit) to conduct a comprehensive custody evaluation. Shortly thereafter, the family services\n   unit informed Judge Bozzuto that the defendant was interfering with the evaluation by injecting his personal views and opinions concerning the family\n   court system into the process. In response, on June 18, 2014, Judge Bozzuto conducted an in-court proceeding attended by the parties. Judge Bozzuto told the defendant that he was free to express his political beliefs and views of the family court system, but ordered him to refrain from doing so during interviews conducted by the family services unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 20, 2014, the defendant informed his wife that he had enrolled their children in school in Cromwell, where he resided, in violation of the court order that they attend school in Ellington. On August 22, 2014, counsel for Tanya Taupier sent the defendant drafts of a contempt motion and an application for an emergency ex parte order of custody that she planned to file in court. The defendant, who was representing himself in the divorce proceeding, then sought the advice of several acquaintances who had experience in family court, including Anne Stevenson and Michael Nowacki. At 11:24 p.m. that night, in response to e-mails that he had received from Stevenson, Nowacki, and Jennifer Verraneault regarding the court motions, the defendant sent an e-mail containing threatening statements toward Judge Bozzuto to Stevenson, Nowacki, Susan Skipp, Sunny Kelley, Paul Boyne, and Verraneault, all of whom had been engaged with the defendant for some time in efforts to reform the family court system. Specifically, the defendant's e-mail contained the following statements: (1) \"[t]hey can steal my kids from my cold dead bleeding cordite filled fists ... as my [sixty] round [magazine] falls to the floor and [I'm] dying as I change out to the next [thirty rounds]\"; (2) \"[Bo]zzuto lives in [W]atertown with her boys and [n]anny ... there [are] 245 [yards] between her master bedroom and a cemetery that provides cover and concealment\"; and (3) \"a [.308 caliber rifle] at 250 [yards] with a double\n   pane drops [one-half inch] per foot beyond the glass and loses [7 percent] of [foot pounds] of force [at] 250 [yards]-nonarmor piercing ball ammunition ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to the defendant's e-mail, on the morning of August 23, 2014, Nowacki sent an e-mail to the defendant stating: \"Ted, [t]here are disturbing comments made in this [e-mail]. You will be well served to NOT send such communications to anyone.\" The defendant then sent another\n   e-mail to Nowacki and Boyne in which he again suggested that he was contemplating violence against Judge Bozzuto and her family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In turn, Nowacki\n   sent the defendant an e-mail stating the following: \"Violence is not a rational response to injustice. Please refrain from communicating with me if you are going to allude to violence as a response.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After reading the defendant's first e-mail on August 23, 2014, Verraneault immediately communicated her concern about it to several people. On the afternoon of August 27, 2014, Verraneault learned of an incident earlier in the day during which Tanya Taupier had gone with a police escort to the school in Cromwell in which the defendant had enrolled their children and removed\n   them from the school. The defendant was present and recorded a video of the removal, while making a series of mocking comments to the police and Tanya Taupier. After learning of this incident, Verraneault feared that it might put the defendant \"over the edge.\" Accordingly, despite fears that she harbored about her own safety if the defendant were to learn that she had disclosed his e-mail concerning Judge Bozzuto, on August 28, 2014, Verraneault sent a screenshot of the contents of the e-mail to an acquaintance who was an attorney, Linda Allard. After discussing the matter with Verraneault, Allard informed Judicial Branch officials and the state police about the e-mail and they, in turn, informed Judge Bozzuto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge Bozzuto testified at trial that, after she learned about the e-mail, \"every night when I [got] home ... as soon as ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I pull[ed] up to the driveway and pull[ed] in ... every time I [got] out of that car I look[ed] up on the hill in the back where all the brush and trees are and [thought] of only [the defendant].... [T]hose bumps in the night, it's when the dogs start[ed] barking in the middle of the night and the first thing that [came] to my mind [was the defendant].\" As a result of the e-mail, she \"did a massive upgrade of security at the house, installing cameras and lights.\" Judge Bozzuto also provided her children's school with a mug shot of the defendant and put school officials on alert. State police surveilled her house for a week or two after Judge Bozzuto learned about the e-mail, and judicial marshals escorted her from her office to her car in the evening. Judge Bozzuto also contacted a sister whose daughter was taking care of Judge Bozzuto's dogs, and told her not to let her daughter go to Judge Bozzuto's residence without a police escort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant was arrested in connection with his first e-mail and ultimately was charged with threatening in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (3); two counts of disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2), one of which alleged that he caused inconvenience, annoyance and alarm to Judge Bozzuto, and one of which alleged that he caused inconvenience, annoyance and alarm to Verraneault; and breach of the peace in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before trial, the defendant moved to dismiss all of the charges. With respect to the threatening charges, the defendant contended that the e-mail did not contain speech that was punishable under the first amendment because the threat was not \"so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). In addition, the defendant argued that the threatening charges \"fail because the [d]efendant did not communicate the threat to the intended victim.\" In support of this claim, the defendant cited\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kenney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"228785\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/53/305/#p323\">\n    53 Conn.

The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Gold, J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   summarily denied the motion to dismiss, and the case was tried to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the trial, the defendant filed another motion to dismiss the charges, claiming that the threatening\n   statutes under which he had been charged were unconstitutional because they required the state to prove only that his conduct in sending the e-mail was in reckless disregard of causing terror to another person; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) and General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (3); when, according to the defendant, the first amendment requires proof of specific intent to terrorize another person. The defendant pointed out that, although this court in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , had applied an objective foreseeability standard to determine whether the defendant had made a \"true\n   threat\" that may be subject to punishment under the first amendment, we had expressly declined to consider whether the first amendment required proof of a specific intent because the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   had raised no such claim and, in any event, he could prevail even under the objective standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relying on Justice Alito's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Elonis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/#p2016\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2016-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/#p2016\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), the trial court concluded that the state was constitutionally required to prove that the defendant acted recklessly, that is, that the defendant subjectively knew that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his threatening speech would terrorize the target of the threat, and that he acted in conscious disregard of that risk. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3), which requires proof of recklessness, was not unconstitutional and denied the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court found the defendant guilty of threatening in the first degree, two counts of disorderly conduct, and breach of the peace in the second degree. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court considered separately the questions of whether (1) the language of the defendant's e-mail constituted a true threat that constitutionally could be punished, and (2) the defendant had knowingly disregarded the risk that the e-mail would cause Judge Bozzuto to be terrorized. With respect to the first issue, the trial court observed that, under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , threatening speech constitutionally may be punished when \"a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The trial court ultimately concluded that \"a reasonable person not only\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   foresee, but readily\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   foresee, that the language in the [defendant's] e-mail would be interpreted by those to whom it was communicated as a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of violence [against] Judge Bozzuto ....\" In support of this conclusion, the trial court relied on the e-mail's extremely detailed and specific description of the threatened assault on Judge Bozzuto, the prior relationship between the parties, the circumstances immediately preceding the e-mail, and the fact that firearms that could enable the defendant to carry out his threat were seized from the defendant's residence approximately one week after he sent the e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court then addressed the question of whether the state had proved the elements of threatening in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (3). The trial court disagreed with the defendant's claims that the state had failed to prove that he acted recklessly because \"(1) he did not send the e-mail directly to Judge Bozzuto, and (2) those to whom he did send it were seen\n   by him as 'like-minded individuals' who understood and shared his frustration with the family court system.\" The trial court found that, to the contrary, the evidence \"fully support[ed] the reasonable inference that the defendant\n   knew that his e-mail would be seen as a serious expression of his intentions, and was aware of and consciously disregarded the substantial and unjustifiable risk that, as a result, it would be disclosed to others and cause terror to Judge Bozzuto.\" To support this conclusion, the trial court again relied on the words used in the e-mail, the history between the parties, and the reactions of Nowacki and Verraneault. In addition, the trial court relied on the fact that, upon being admonished by Nowacki for sending the e-mail, the defendant expressed no surprise that Nowacki had interpreted the e-mail as a serious threat of violence and made no attempt to clarify his intent or retract the threat. Rather, the defendant validated Nowacki's interpretation by sending another e-mail reasserting the threat to Judge Bozzuto and, for the first time, threatening her children. Accordingly, the trial court found that the state had established the elements of threatening in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court then noted that, with regard to the charge of threatening in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3), the state was required to prove that the defendant had committed threatening in the second degree and, in committing that offense, had represented by his words that he possessed a firearm. The trial court concluded that the defendant's reference in the e-mail to the .308 caliber rifle satisfied that element. Accordingly, the trial court found the defendant guilty of threatening in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Turning to the other charges, the trial court concluded that the state had established the elements of disorderly conduct toward Judge Bozzuto and Verraneault. With respect to the count involving disorderly\n   conduct toward Verraneault, the trial court concluded that the defendant \"was aware that she would view [the e-mail] as a serious expression of [the defendant's] intent to shoot Judge Bozzuto, and that ... Verraneault would be disturbed and filled with anxiety as a result of that threatened harm.\" Finally, the trial court concluded that the state had proven the elements of breach of the peace in the second degree. Accordingly, the trial court found the defendant guilty on both counts of disorderly conduct and of breach of the peace in the second degree. The trial court then rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with its findings and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of five years imprisonment, execution suspended after eighteen months, and five years probation with special conditions on the charge of threatening in the first degree. This appeal followed. See footnote 4 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, the defendant first challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) under the free speech provisions of the first amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 and 14, of the Connecticut constitution on the grounds that (1) the statute does not require the state to prove that an individual who engaged in threatening speech had the specific intent to terrorize the target of the threat, and (2) even if the statute is constitutional as applied to threatening speech directed at a private individual, proof of specific intent is required when the speech is directed at a public official. He next claims that the trial court improperly considered evidence of certain events, namely, the seizure of firearms from his residence one week after he sent the e-mail concerning Judge Bozzuto, and his second e-mail to Nowacki, in which he again threatened Judge Bozzuto and her family, to support its conclusion that his e-mail was a punishable true threat. Finally, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient\n   to establish that he violated \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) by sending the e-mail or that he violated \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (2) by engaging in\n   disorderly conduct toward Verraneault. We address each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   FREE SPEECH CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We first address the defendant's claims that \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) is unconstitutional under the free speech provisions of the first amendment to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 and 14, of the Connecticut constitution because the statute does not require the state to prove that the person who engaged in the threatening speech had the specific intent to terrorize the target of the threat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude in part I A of this opinion that the statutory recklessness standard is constitutional under the first amendment when threatening speech is directed at a private individual. In part I B of this opinion, we conclude that the statutory recklessness standard is also constitutional under the free speech provisions of the state constitution. In part I C of this opinion, we consider and reject the defendant's suggestion that a higher mens rea standard is required under both the federal and state constitutions when threatening speech is directed at a public official.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin by noting the well established principle that determining the constitutionality of a statute presents a question of law subject to plenary review. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kerrigan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Public Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964750\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/135/#p155\">\n    289 Conn. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20A.2d%20407\">\n    957 A.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the first amendment required the state to prove that he had the specific intent to terrorize Judge Bozzuto before he could be punished for the threatening speech in his e-mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have explained,\n   in this part of our opinion, we limit our consideration to the federal constitutional standard for threatening speech directed at a private individual. We disagree with the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We begin with a review of the first amendment principles applicable to statutes that criminalize threatening speech. \"The [f]irst [a]mendment, applicable to the\n   [s]tates through the [f]ourteenth [a]mendment, provides that Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech. The hallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow free trade [of] ideas-even ideas that the overwhelming majority of people might find distasteful or discomforting.... Thus, the [f]irst [a]mendment ordinarily denies a [s]tate the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine [that] a vast majority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught with evil consequence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The protections afforded by the [f]irst [a]mendment, however, are not absolute, and we have long recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the [c]onstitution.... The [f]irst [a]mendment permits restrictions [on] the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Thus, for example, a [s]tate may punish those words [that] by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.... Furthermore, the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a [s]tate to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except [when] such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.... [T]he [f]irst [a]mendment also permits a [s]tate to ban a true threat....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"True threats encompass those statements [through which] the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals....

In support of this claim, the defendant relies on the text of article first, \u00a7 14, of the Connecticut constitution, which provides that citizens have a right \"to apply to those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances ... by petition, address or remonstrance.\" The defendant contends that his e-mail regarding Judge Bozzuto was a \"remonstrance\" within the meaning of this provision and, therefore, it was constitutionally protected.

In any event, article first, \u00a7 14, of the Connecticut constitution expressly guarantees the right to apply to government officials for the redress of grievances only if the redress is sought \"in a peaceable manner ....\" A statement that is a true threat would, ipso facto, not be one seeking redress in a peaceable manner. Accordingly, we conclude that the constitutional framers did not intend to protect the right to seek redress from a public official by way of a \"remonstrance\" when the speaker was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the public official would interpret the \"remonstrance\" as a serious threat of violence. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) is constitutional under the state constitution as it is applied to threatening speech directed at public officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   EVIDENTIARY CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We next address the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of events that occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he sent the e-mail to support its conclusion that the defendant violated \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3). Specifically, he contends that the trial court improperly admitted (1) evidence that firearms were seized from the defendant's residence one week after he sent the e-mail, and (2) the defendant's second e-mail to Nowacki, in which he reiterated his threats against Judge Bozzuto, because this evidence was irrelevant.

Because the defendant in the present case contends that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of events that occurred after the defendant sent the threatening e-mail on the ground\n   that the evidence was irrelevant, we review the trial court's action for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly considered evidence that firearms were seized from his home approximately one week after he sent the threatening e-mail to support its conclusion that the defendant violated \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3). The record reveals the following additional relevant facts. The state presented evidence that, during their investigation of the defendant, the police obtained a \"risk warrant\" pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 29-38c, authorizing them to enter the defendant's residence and to seize any firearms and ammunition that they found there. Upon executing the warrant, the police found and seized fifteen firearms and multiple rounds of ammunition. The police subsequently learned that, in March, 2013, the family court had issued an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any firearms. In accordance with that order, the defendant had surrendered a number of firearms to a friend. When the police went to that friend's residence on September 2, 2014, he confirmed that he had received thirteen firearms from the defendant in March, 2013. During the summer of 2014, however, the defendant had indicated that he wanted them back. On August 27, 2014, five days after sending the e-mail, the defendant went to his friend's residence and retrieved six of the firearms. The friend turned over the remaining firearms to the police. Thereafter, the police examined the fifteen firearms that had been seized from the defendant's residence and determined that four of them\n   were capable of accurately firing a projectile 245 yards, the distance to which the defendant had referred in his e-mail. The trial court concluded that, under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   456 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it could rely on this evidence to support a\n   finding that the defendant \"possessed the skills or wherewithal necessary to carry out [his] threat.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , however, this court concluded only that\n   <em>\n    knowledge by the target of a threat\n   </em>\n   that the defendant had the means to carry out the threat can support the inference that the target would reasonably interpret the threat to be serious.

In this regard, we emphasize that \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) does not allow a person to be punished for a thought-namely, having the subjective intent to carry out a threat. Rather, it allows threatening speech to be punished when the speaker was aware that there was substantial and unjustifiable risk that the speech\n   <em>\n    would be interpreted\n   </em>\n   as a serious threat of violence, regardless of the speaker's actual intentions.

Specifically, the trial court concluded that the fact that the defendant expressed no surprise that Nowacki had interpreted the e-mail as a serious threat of violence and made no attempt to clarify his intent or retract the threat but, instead, reiterated his threats against Judge Bozzuto and also threatened her children, showed that\n   the defendant was aware that his first e-mail would be interpreted as a serious threat. The defendant again contends that the trial court should have considered only the circumstances that existed at the time that the defendant sent the first e-mail when determining whether that e-mail contained a serious threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This court, however, has expressly recognized that \"evidence of the conduct of a defendant subsequent to the commission of a crime is admissible to show the defendant's state of mind at the time of the crime.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Croom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"530900\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/166/226/#p230\">\n    166 Conn. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20A.2d%20556\">\n    348 A.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). Although the defendant's second e-mail to Nowacki had no bearing on the question of whether the\n   <em>\n    recipients\n   </em>\n   of the first e-mail would have interpreted it as a serious threat, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that it was relevant to the issue of whether\n   <em>\n    the defendant was aware\n   </em>\n   when he sent the first e-mail that it would be interpreted in that manner. Specifically, the trial court reasonably could have inferred that, if the defendant had been unaware when he sent the first e-mail that it would be interpreted as a serious threat, he would have reacted quite differently to Nowacki's characterization of the e-mail as \"disturbing\" and his admonition to the defendant to refrain from making such statements. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it considered this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We next address the defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of threatening in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3). Specifically, the defendant contends that the state failed to satisfy the constitutional requirement that (1) it was\n   objectively foreseeable that the e-mail would be interpreted as a serious threat, and (2) it was reasonably foreseeable that Judge Bozzuto would be terrorized by his e-mail when the defendant did not send the e-mail to her. The defendant fails to recognize, however, that, even if the\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   standard is objective foreseeability, an issue that we have declined to decide in the present case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3) required the state to prove the higher recklessness standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the questions that we must\n   address are whether the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the language of the e-mail would be interpreted as a serious threat, and (2) the defendant was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that Judge Bozzuto would be terrorized by the e-mail even though he did not communicate it to her directly. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of threatening in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"The standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established.

To prove that the defendant committed threatening in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (3), the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant threatened to commit a crime of violence, and (2) in doing so, the\n   defendant acted in reckless disregard of the risk of causing terror to another person.

That e-mail stated: \"The court is dog shit and has no right to shit they don't have a rule on\"; \"there [are] 245 [yards] between [Judge Bozzuto's] master bedroom and a cemetery that provides cover and concealment\"; \"[t]hey could try and put me in jail but that would start the ringing of a bell that can be undone\"; \"[s]omeone wants to take my kids better have an [F-35 fighter jet] and smart bombs ... otherwise they will be found and adjusted ... they should seek shelter on the ISS ( [international] space station)\"; \"a [.308 caliber rifle] at 250 [yards] with a double pane drops [one-half inch] per foot beyond the glass and loses [7 percent] of [foot pounds] of force [at] 250 [yards]-nonarmor piercing ball ammunition\"; and \"unless you sleep with level [three] body armor or live on the [international space station] you should be careful of actions.\" Judge Bozzuto testified that the descriptions of her residence and the surrounding area were\n   accurate. Thus, the defendant's e-mail made it clear that he was extremely angry at the \"court,\" over which Judge Bozzuto had presided, that he had discovered where she lived, that he had surveilled her residence, that he had thought through a very detailed and specific way to kill her at that location, and that he had anticipated being punished for his conduct. Although the defendant did not explicitly say that he was going to shoot Judge Bozzuto, we have recognized that \"rigid adherence to the literal meaning of a communication ... would render [statutes proscribing true threats] powerless against the ingenuity of threateners who can instill in the victim's mind as clear an apprehension of impending injury by an implied menace as by a literal threat.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude, therefore, that the language of the defendant's e-mail conveyed the clear connotation that he was seriously contemplating violence against Judge Bozzuto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Indeed, the reactions of Nowacki, who called the e-mail disturbing, warned the defendant to refrain from making such statements, and admonished him that violence was not a solution, and Verraneault, who immediately contacted several people to express her concern and ultimately took steps to warn Judge Bozzuto, indicate that\n   this is how they, in fact, interpreted the defendant's e-mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Judge Bozzuto's fearful\n   reaction and the steps that she took to protect herself and her family from the defendant, including installing security equipment and warning her niece not to go to her house without a police escort, show that she believed the defendant's threats were serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The history between the defendant and Judge Bozzuto, along with the events immediately preceding the e-mail, also support the conclusion that the defendant was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the recipients of the e-mail and Judge Bozzuto would interpret it as a serious threat. One of the recipients of the e-mail, Kelley, testified that, during her dealings with the family court system, her feelings ran the \"full gamut of every horrible thing that you can imagine. I've been angry, I've been sad, I've been despondent. There [are] no words. Apoplectic. I mean, it's the full gamut of terror. It's absolute terror.\" Kelley testified that she expressed those feelings to the defendant \"[b]ecause he was experiencing something similar.\" The trial court reasonably could have inferred from this testimony that the other e-mail recipients, all of whom had been engaged with the defendant in efforts to reform the family court system, were equally aware that the defendant harbored such feelings toward the family court system, which Judge Bozzuto represented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The state also presented evidence in the form of testimony by Tanya Taupier that the defendant's demeanor throughout the course of the divorce proceeding had been contentious and adversarial to all court personnel involved in the case. In addition, there was evidence that, on June 18, 2014, Judge Bozzuto had admonished the defendant in court to stop interjecting his political views into the custody evaluation that was being performed by the family services unit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although\n   there was no specific evidence that the e-mail recipients were aware of the details of this particular interaction between the defendant and Judge Bozzuto, the trial court reasonably could have inferred that the interaction would have reinforced the defendant's negative feelings toward the family court and Judge Bozzuto, and that the members of the informal family court reform group would have been generally aware of his growing animosity and frustration.\n   In addition, the state presented evidence that the defendant had enrolled his children in school in Cromwell, where the defendant lived, in defiance of the court order requiring that the children attend school in Ellington, where Tanya Taupier lived. In response, on August 22, 2014, the same day that the defendant sent the threatening e-mail, counsel for Tanya Taupier sent the defendant drafts of a contempt motion and an application for an emergency ex parte order of custody that she planned to file with the family court and, more specifically, Judge Bozzuto. The recipients of the e-mail and Judge Bozzuto were aware of these developments in the case when they received the defendant's e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We conclude this evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that, as the trial court stated, \"a reasonable person not only\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   foresee, but readily\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   foresee, that the language in the e-mail would be interpreted by those to whom it was communicated as a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of violence [against] Judge Bozzuto ....\" (Emphasis in original.) As we have explained, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would interpret threatening\n   speech as a serious threat supports the inference that the speaker was aware that the speech would be interpreted in that manner. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738702\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/20/#p33\">\n    226 Conn. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20862\">\n    627 A.2d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the state of mind amounting to recklessness ... may be inferred from conduct\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Moreover, as we explained in part II B of this opinion, the second e-mail that the defendant sent to Nowacki and Boyne in response to Nowacki's e-mail characterizing the defendant's first e-mail as \"disturbing,\" and urging the defendant to refrain from making such statements, supports the inference that the defendant was subjectively aware when he sent the first e-mail that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that it would be interpreted as a serious threat. The defendant did not suggest in that e-mail that Nowacki should have known that the language of the first e-mail was merely hyperbolic bluster resulting from late night fatigue or a passing moment of intense despondency or frustration. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krijger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20434\">\n    313 Conn. at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20946\">\n    97 A.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's apology moments after making threatening comments showed that threat was not serious). To the contrary, the defendant confirmed the validity of Nowacki's initial interpretation of the e-mail by stating, among other things, that, \"[i]f they feel it's disturbing that I will fiercely protect my family with all my life ... they would be correct, I will gladly accept my death and theirs protecting my civil rights under my uniform code of justice.\" Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that \"the defendant was himself aware that his e-mail would be seen as threatening ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We next address the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that Judge Bozzuto would be terrorized by the e-mail\n   because he did not send it to her. The defendant contends that, when he sent the e-mail regarding Judge Bozzuto, he could not have foreseen that it would be communicated to her because he sent it \"to friends and fellow travelers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To the extent that the defendant contends that threatening speech that is not communicated directly to the target of the speech cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a punishable true threat, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Numerous courts have held to the contrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the reasoning\n   of\n   these cases is somewhat ad hoc, in light of the purpose of the true threats doctrine, which is not to punish threatening speech in a vacuum, but to protect targets of threats from the fear of violence; see\n   <em>\n    Virginia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    538 U.S. at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030793\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/343/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a prohibition on true threats protect[s] individuals from the fear of violence and from the disruption that fear engenders\" [internal quotation marks omitted] );\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137287\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/78/103/#p108\">\n    78 Ark.

We conclude, therefore, that a defendant may be punished for threatening speech directed at a third party if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that his speech would be interpreted as a serious threat\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the threat would be communicated to the target of the threat.

Thus, if the threatener intended the threat to be taken seriously by the victim, he must necessarily have intended it to be conveyed.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.] ), review denied, California Supreme Court, Docket No. S101923 (December 19, 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In the present case, we agree with the trial court that, even if the recipients of the e-mail were \" 'like-minded individuals' who understood and shared [the defendant's] frustration with the family court system\" and his desire to reform it, the language of the e-mail was so extreme that the defendant had to have been \"aware of and consciously disregarded the substantial and unjustifiable risk that ... it would be disclosed to others and cause terror to Judge Bozzuto.\" Indeed, there was no credible evidence that would support, much less compel, a finding that the defendant believed that all of the recipients would either support or be indifferent to a serious threat to kill a family court judge. To the contrary, the reactions of Nowacki and Verraneault to the defendant's first e-mail support the inference that\n   it was not typical of the communications that previously had been shared by the group and, therefore, that the defendant would have had no reason to believe the recipients would share his desire to inflict violence against Judge Bozzuto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Moreover, when Skipp was asked if all of the recipients of the e-mail were \"of a like mind when the issue was family court in Connecticut,\" she agreed that they were with the\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   of Verraneault, who had \"no children that were endangered by the state's actions.\" We conclude that this evidence\n   was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that there was a substantial and unjustifiable risk that\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   Verraneault would react to the e-mail in the same manner that any reasonable person would react to a serious death threat against another person, and take steps to notify Judge Bozzuto. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of threatening in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, we address the defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he engaged in disorderly conduct directed at Verraneault. To prove this charge, the state was required to establish\n   that the defendant, by engaging in offensive or disorderly conduct, recklessly created a risk of causing inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to Verraneault. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a). The defendant contends that although Verraneault \"undoubtedly experienced 'inconvenience, annoyance or alarm' upon receipt of the e-mail,\" because the e-mail was not a true threat, Verraneault's \"tender sensibilities should be of no moment to this court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We have concluded, however, that the defendant's e-mail\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   indeed a true threat. We further conclude that, when a speaker communicates a true threat to a person other than the target of the threat, and there is no evidence that the speaker believed that the third party would share or be indifferent to the speaker's desire to inflict violence on the target, the communication constitutes offensive conduct and creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person will be inconvenienced, annoyed and alarmed. The defendant placed Verraneault in a position requiring her to either keep quiet about the threat, thereby making herself partially responsible-at least morally, if not legally-in the event it was carried out, or to instead communicate the threat to Judge Bozzuto, thereby taking the risk that the defendant's homicidal anger would be directed at her. Indeed, the trial court expressly found that Verraneault \"harbored [fears] about her own safety if [the defendant] were to learn that she was the person who had disclosed the e-mail to law enforcement authorities ....\" Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of disorderly conduct directed at Verraneault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The first amendment to the United States constitution provides: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Article first, \u00a7 4, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \"Every citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Article first, \u00a7 5, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \"No law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Article first, \u00a7 14, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \"The citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble for their common good, and to apply to those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address or remonstrance.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61aa (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of threatening in the first degree when such person ...

The trial court also found that Verraneault's delay in warning Judge Bozzuto was explained in part by the fact that \"she harbored genuine concerns as to how the defendant would react if he was to learn that she was the person who had reported the e-mail to authorities.\" It would, indeed, be ironic to conclude that a delay in reporting caused by a genuine fear of the person who made the threat could be used to infer that the recipient did not interpret the threat to be serious.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    The state presented evidence, on which the trial court relied, that, after Judge Bozzuto admonished the defendant in court on June 18, 2014, the defendant sent out multiple e-mails and Facebook postings criticizing Judge Bozzuto.
