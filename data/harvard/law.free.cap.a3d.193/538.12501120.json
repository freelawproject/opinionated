The defendant, the Commissioner of Revenue Services (commissioner), appeals, and the plaintiff, Dish Network, LLC, cross appeals, from the judgment of the trial court sustaining in part the plaintiff's tax appeals and ordering a refund of taxes previously paid on earnings from the sale of certain goods\n   and services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Addressing the parties'\n   various contentions, we reach the following conclusions: (1) the trial court properly determined that General Statutes \u00a7 12-268i\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not provide the exclusive procedure for challenging a tax assessment for a tax period that has been the subject of an audit, and, therefore, the plaintiff was not barred from seeking a refund for certain audited tax periods pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) imposes a tax on gross earnings from the transmission of video programming by satellite and certain payment related fees, but not the sale, lease, installation, or maintenance of equipment or DVR service; and (3) the trial court properly determined that\n   the plaintiff was not entitled to interest on the refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history and facts that were found by the trial court or that are not disputed. The plaintiff, a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Colorado, is in the business of providing satellite delivered digital television to subscribers across the country, including in Connecticut. In order to provide this service, the plaintiff transmits video programming from its facilities to one or more satellites orbiting the Earth. The satellites then transmit the programming to an antenna, known as a satellite dish, which is connected to a receiver at the subscriber's location.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In order to receive a particular package of video programming, individual subscribers must enter into a contract with the plaintiff. In addition to charging a fee for the transmission of video programming, these contracts allow the plaintiff to charge subscribers for the purchase or lease of satellite dishes and related equipment, equipment installation and maintenance, DVR service, and subscriptions to\n   Dish Magazine, which is delivered by the United States Postal Service. The contracts also allow the plaintiff to impose fees for the failure of a subscriber to pay bills on time, for reconnecting the subscriber after being disconnected\n   for nonpayment, and for certain types of payment plans (payment related fees).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under \u00a7 12-256 (b), the plaintiff is required to \"pay a quarterly tax upon the gross earnings from .... (2) the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite ....\" Pursuant to this provision, the plaintiff filed timely tax returns for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2006, the first quarter of 2007, the third and fourth quarters of 2010, and the first quarter of 2011 (disputed tax periods).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2008, the commissioner conducted a field audit of the plaintiff's returns for the first, second, and third quarters of 2006 (audited tax periods) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-268g\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sent a notice of the result to the plaintiff. The commissioner also sent the plaintiff a billing notice for the audited tax periods. The plaintiff never challenged the audit results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff ultimately filed amended tax returns and sought refunds pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1) for all of the disputed tax periods, including the audited tax periods. The plaintiff claimed that it had paid taxes on gross earnings from the sale of both programming services and nonprogramming goods and services during the relevant periods when, according to the plaintiff, the only earnings subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) were its gross earnings from the sale of programming\n   services. The commissioner concluded that, to the contrary, the plaintiff's gross earnings from the sale of both programming services and nonprogramming goods and services were subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2). Accordingly, the commissioner denied the plaintiff's requests for refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from the commissioner's decisions pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that it was entitled, as a matter of law, to a refund of the taxes that it paid pursuant to \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) on gross earnings from the sale of nonprogramming goods and services. The\n   commissioner then filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment, contending that, to the contrary, the plaintiff's gross earnings from the sale of nonprogramming goods and services were, as a matter of law, subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commissioner further claimed that the plaintiff's appeal with respect to the audited tax periods was barred because the amounts owed for those periods had been finally determined pursuant to the audit, the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by challenging\n   the audit result pursuant to \u00a7 12-268i, and the statute authorizing refund claims, \u00a7 12-268c, did not provide an alternative route for the plaintiff to contest the final assessment for the audited tax periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With respect to the commissioner's claim that the plaintiff was barred from seeking a refund for the audited tax periods because it failed to challenge the audit result pursuant to \u00a7 12-268i, the trial court concluded that that statute does not provide the exclusive administrative remedy for the overpayment of taxes for a tax period that has been subject to an audit. Rather, the court concluded that \" \u00a7\u00a7 12-268c and 12-268i stand independently,\" and that \u00a7 12-268c provides an alternative procedure for correcting an overpayment of taxes under these circumstances. Accordingly, the court concluded that the plaintiff's claim with respect to the audited tax periods was not barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court then turned to the plaintiff's claim that it was entitled to a refund of taxes paid on gross earnings from the sale of nonprogramming goods and services. The court noted that \u00a7 12-256 (b) required the plaintiff to pay taxes \"upon the gross earnings from ... the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite ....\" The court then observed that dictionaries have defined \" 'from' as indicating 'the source or original or moving force of something.' \" The court further noted that the language of \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) stands in contrast to the language of \u00a7 12-256 (b) (1), which expressly imposes a tax on the gross earnings from \"the lines, facilities, apparatus and auxiliary equipment in this state used for operating a community antenna television system ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the principles\n   that related parts of a statute provide guidance in determining the meaning of a statutory provision; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ehlers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546996\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/579/#p590\">\n    252 Conn. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20A.2d%201079\">\n    750 A.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (\"[r]elated statutory provisions, or statutes in pari materia, often provide guidance in determining the meaning [of statutory language]\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ); and that tax statutes must be strictly construed; see\n   <em>\n    Zachs\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Groppo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"537647\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/207/683/#p689\">\n    207 Conn. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20A.2d%201145\">\n    542 A.2d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) ; the trial court concluded that the plaintiff's gross earnings from the sale of equipment, installation and maintenance of equipment, and subscriptions to Dish Magazine are not gross earnings \"from ... the transmission ... of video programming by satellite\" and that, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to a refund of the taxes that it had paid on those gross earnings. The court also concluded, however, that payment related fees and DVR service are sufficiently related to \"the\n   source,\" i.e., \"transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\"; General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) ; that they constituted programming services subject to taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court then noted that the parties had not yet addressed the amount of the refund that was due to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the court ordered the parties to confer on that issue and to report back to the court. Thereafter, the parties submitted a joint stipulation to the court setting forth the amounts due to the plaintiff. On the basis of the stipulation, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $886,845.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff then filed a motion requesting that the trial court award interest on the $886,845 refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1). The trial court concluded that \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1) applies \"only to the situation where the commissioner ... allows for a refund due to overpayment. The correct statute referring to interest after a successful tax appeal from a gross earning tax payment\n   is \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   .\" The court denied the plaintiff's motion because an interest award pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   is \"primarily an equitable determination and a matter lying within the discretion of the trial court\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    Wheelabrator Bridgeport, L.P.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20332\">\n    320 Conn. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20A.3d%20402\">\n    133 A.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; and the plaintiff had presented no evidence that the equities weighed in favor of granting an interest award. In addition, the court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to interest because it had voluntarily agreed to the stipulation of damages, which did not include interest on the refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The commissioner then filed an appeal, claiming that the trial court improperly determined that (1) the plaintiff's claim for a refund with respect to the audited tax periods was not barred, and (2) the plaintiff's gross earnings on the sale of nonprogramming goods and services were not subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2). The plaintiff then cross appealed, claiming that (1) the trial court improperly determined that payment related fees and gross earnings from the provision of DVR service are subject to taxation pursuant to \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2), and (2) the plaintiff was not entitled to interest on the refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1). See footnote 2 of this opinion. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court improperly determined that gross earnings from the provision of DVR service are subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2), and we reject the parties' other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first address the commissioner's claim that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 12-268i does not provide the exclusive procedure for challenging the assessment after an audit and, therefore, that the\n   plaintiff was not barred from seeking a refund for the audited tax periods pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether \u00a7 12-268i provides the exclusive procedure for seeking a refund of\n   an overpayment when the commissioner has previously conducted an audit for the tax period in question presents a question of statutory interpretation subject to plenary review. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Perez-Dickson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20483\">\n    304 Conn. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%2069\">\n    43 A.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.... In seeking to determine that meaning [General Statutes] \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 507-508,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%2069\">\n    43 A.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin with a review of the statutory language. Section 12-268g provides in relevant part that \"[t]he commissioner shall, within three years after the due date for the filing of a return ... examine it and, in case any error is disclosed by such examination, shall,\n   within thirty days after such disclosure, notify the taxpayer thereof....\" Section \u00a7 12-268i provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny taxpayer aggrieved by the action of the commissioner or his authorized agent in fixing the amount of any tax ... may apply to the commissioner, in writing, within sixty days after the notice of such action is delivered or mailed to it, for a hearing and a correction of the amount of such tax ....\" Section 12-268c (a) (1) provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny company ... believing that it has overpaid any taxes due under the provisions of chapter 210, 211 or 212 may file a claim for refund in writing with the commissioner within three years from the due date for which such overpayment was made ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The commissioner claims that, when the commissioner has audited a tax return for a specific tax period pursuant to \u00a7 12-268g and notified the taxpayer of errors that were discovered, and the taxpayer has failed to challenge the audit result within sixty days pursuant to \u00a7 12-268i, the taxpayer is then barred from requesting a refund for any overpayment of taxes during the audited period pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1). The commissioner contends that allowing a taxpayer to file a refund claim pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1) in these circumstances-under which a refund claim may be filed \"within three years from the due date for which such overpayment was made\"-would \"[eliminate] the finality of audit determinations\" and render meaningless the sixty day time limitation contained in \u00a7 12-268i. Thus, under the commissioner's interpretation of the statutory scheme, if the commissioner discovers an error in a tax return during an audit conducted pursuant to \u00a7 12-268g, and the taxpayer does not dispute that specific error, the taxpayer must then either (1) conduct its own comprehensive audit to ensure that there was no overpayment of taxes during the audited period for any reason and, if it discovers an overpayment, challenge the audit\n   result and assessment within sixty days, or (2) be forever foreclosed from seeking a refund of the overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nothing in the language of \u00a7 12-268g, however, suggests that there is any such burden on the taxpayer. To the contrary, the statute provides that the\n   <em>\n    commissioner\n   </em>\n   shall examine the taxpayer's tax return. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-268g (\"[t]he commissioner shall, within three years after the due date for the filing of a return ... examine it\"). In turn, this suggests\n   that, if the commissioner finds an error, the taxpayer has sixty days under \u00a7 12-268i to challenge\n   <em>\n    that specific finding of error\n   </em>\n   by filing what is the effective equivalent of an appeal from the audit result, and that the taxpayer is not required to identify at that time any and all overpayments made during the audited period, regardless of whether they are related in any manner to the error found by the commissioner. Indeed, an appeal from an administrative ruling ordinarily does not provide the appellant with the opportunity-much less impose the obligation-to raise claims that are entirely unrelated to the ruling being appealed from. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that overpayments made during the audited period that are discovered by the\n   <em>\n    taxpayer\n   </em>\n   are governed by \u00a7 12-268c, which authorizes taxpayers to seek a refund by filing a claim with the commissioner within three years of the due date for the overpayment. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1) (\"[a]ny company ... believing that it has overpaid any taxes ... may file a claim for refund in writing with the commissioner within three years from the due date for which such overpayment was made\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The commissioner's interpretation of the relevant statutes is also unworkable because, as the plaintiff in the present case points out, there are circumstances under which a taxpayer may not even have a claim for a refund until long after the audit result has become\n   final. For example, a taxpayer that provided a refund to a customer for a payment received during the audit period after the sixty day period for challenging an audit result had expired, but before the three year period for seeking a refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c had expired, would be left without effective recourse. The commissioner asserted at oral argument before this court that a taxpayer may seek relief pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-39s\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   under these circumstances, but that statute provides far less protection to taxpayers who have overpaid their taxes than \u00a7 12-268c does because refund claims pursuant \u00a7 12-39s, unlike claims pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c, \"are committed to the [commissioner's] sole discretion, and [the courts are], therefore, without jurisdiction to evaluate [their] merits ....\"\n   <em>\n    Chatterjee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5748797\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/681/#p693\">\n    277 Conn. 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=894%20A.2d%20919\">\n    894 A.2d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the legislature intended that \u00a7 12-39s would apply to refund claims that, for reasons entirely beyond the control of the taxpayer, could not be discovered within sixty days of an audit result, but that are discovered within three years of the overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that the fact that an audit result has become final because the taxpayer has failed to challenge it within sixty days pursuant to \u00a7 12-268i does not necessarily mean that the taxpayer is barred from seeking a refund of overpayments made during the audited period pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c. We emphasize that we are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   holding that a taxpayer may relitigate a specific audit result that has become final by requesting a refund of\n   payments that were made on the basis of the specific error that the commissioner found. Principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel, as well as the policy disfavoring\n   collateral attacks on final decisions, would likely bar any such claim.

In the present case, the commissioner does not argue that the claims that the plaintiff raised in its requests for a refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c were related in any way to errors that the commissioner discovered\n   during the audits.

(2) the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite .... No deduction shall be allowed from such gross earnings for operations related to commissions, rebates or other payments, except such refunds as arise from errors or overcharges.

The plaintiff contends, to the contrary, that \u00a7 12-256 (b) plainly and unambiguously imposes a tax\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the gross earnings from \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\"-i.e., programming services. The plaintiff further contends that, to the extent that there is any ambiguity in the statute, that ambiguity must be resolved in its favor because a statute imposing a tax must be strictly construed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although we are not entirely sure that the phrase \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\" plainly and unambiguously is limited to programming services, we also cannot conclude that, on its face, the phrase plainly and unambiguously includes such operations as the sale or lease of satellite dishes and related equipment or equipment installation and maintenance.

We therefore examine the other provisions of \u00a7 12-256 and related statutes to determine whether they clarify the meaning of the phrase.

The plaintiff in that case contended that moneys that it collected from customers to pay for the tax imposed by General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 12-587 on \"gross earnings ... derived ... from the sale of petroleum products in this state\" were not taxable \"gross earnings.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20771\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 584 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20771\">\n    522 A.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court then concluded that the only issue that it was required to address was the meaning of the phrase \"gross earnings,\" as used in \u00a7 12-587. See id., at 593,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20771\">\n    522 A.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he heart of the disagreement between the parties is how to define the relevant 'earnings' \"); id., at 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20771\">\n    522 A.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the statutory definition of 'gross earnings' in \u00a7 12-587 instructs us to look to the usual meaning of 'gross receipts' \"). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co.\n   </em>\n   stands only for the proposition that \"gross earnings\" include the business' \"entire earnings and receipts\"\n   <em>\n    from an operation of the business that is subject to the tax\n   </em>\n   .

Contrary to the commissioner's contention, this court did not hold that a gross earnings tax necessarily applies to\n   <em>\n    all operations\n   </em>\n   in which the taxed business is engaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The commissioner also makes a number of textual arguments in support of the contention that \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) imposes a tax on all nonprogramming services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, he contends that the second sentence of \u00a7 12-256 (b) providing that \"[n]o deduction shall be allowed from such gross earnings for operations related to commissions, rebates or other payments, except such refunds as arise from errors or overcharges,\" clearly means that the tax is imposed on \"gross earnings for operations.\" We disagree. Although the sentence is not a model of clarity, it is more reasonably read as providing that \"[n]o deduction shall be allowed ... for operations related to commissions ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b). In other words, contrary to the commissioner's contention, the phrase \"for operations\" does not modify \"gross earnings\"; rather, the phrase \"related to commissions\" modifies \"operations.\" Indeed, the phrase \"gross earnings\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   operations\" makes little sense. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b). In ordinary usage, earnings derive\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   a business' operations, not\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   them. In contrast, the phrase \"[n]o deduction shall be allowed ... for operations\" is grammatically sound. In any event, even if the legislature intended the phrase \"gross earnings for operations\" to refer to \"gross earnings from operations,\" we cannot perceive why, as applied to satellite television providers, the word \"operations\" should be interpreted to mean anything other than \"the transmission to subscribers in this\n   state of video programming by satellite ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the commissioner relies on the third sentence of \u00a7 12-256 (b) providing that \"[o]n or before the last day of the month next succeeding each quarterly period, each [taxpayer] shall render to the commissioner a return on forms prescribed or furnished by the commissioner, signed by the person performing the duties of treasurer or an authorized agent or officer of the system or service operated by such person, which return shall include information regarding the name and location within this state of such system or service\n   <em>\n    and the total amount of gross earnings derived from such operations\n   </em>\n   and such other facts as the commissioner may require for the purpose of making any computation required by this chapter.\" (Emphasis added.) The commissioner contends that this language shows that the tax is imposed on gross earnings derived from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the plaintiff's operations. The obvious flaw in this argument, however, is that the statute expressly refers to \"\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   operations,\" and the antecedent to this phrase is \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2). Accordingly, if the phrase \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\" does not include\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the plaintiff's operations-which is the very issue that we must decide-the phrase \"such operations\" does not include all of those operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The commissioner further contends that \"construction of 'transmission of video programming by satellite' as referring to a separately itemized product, rather than a description of the [plaintiff's] business itself, leads to absurd or unworkable results,\" because the transmission of video programming itself is useless to subscribers if they do not have the equipment to receive and view the programming. Again, we are not persuaded. The mere fact that subscribers must purchase or lease equipment in order to view the video programming\n   transmitted by the plaintiff does not, ipso facto, establish that the legislature must have intended to impose a tax on earnings from the sale or lease of that equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We also disagree with the commissioner's contention that the plaintiff sells no product that merely consists of the \"transmission of video programming\" because \"[a] one-way video programming by satellite business ... is always\n   <em>\n    transmitting\n   </em>\n   all of its offered programming to its entire service area, whether or not any given person on any given plot of real estate has subscribed to its services.\" (Emphasis in original.) Because subscribers would discontinue payments to the plaintiff if it stopped transmitting video programming, it necessarily follows that they are paying for such transmissions. Indeed, we see no reason why a satellite television provider could not engage\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   in the operation of transmitting video programming and leave to others the sale and installation\n   of equipment necessary to view the programing. In that case, the company's earnings could be from nothing\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   the sale of transmissions. We fail to see the significance of the fact that satellite television providers continue their transmissions regardless of the number of subscribers in a particular geographic area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The commissioner further contends that, if \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) applies only to programming services, satellite television providers hypothetically could avoid paying any tax at all by allocating all charges for transmission of video programming to charges for the sale or lease of equipment necessary to receive the transmissions. Nothing in the record, however, suggests that this hypothetical problem has actually materialized. To the contrary, the commissioner stipulated before the trial court that the plaintiff had accurately allocated earnings from programming services and nonprogramming goods and services when it calculated the amount of the refund\n   that it was owed for taxes paid on gross earnings from the sale of nonprogramming services, which allocation was based upon the plaintiff's internal accounting policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the commissioner contends that, by using the word \"from\" in the phrase \"gross earnings from ... (2) the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\"; General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b) ; the legislature \"delegated the task of determining the sufficiency of the relationship of the receipts to the business' operations to the commissioner.\" To support this contention, the commissioner relies on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Scholastic Book Clubs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20204\">\n    304 Conn. 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20A.3d%201183\">\n    38 A.3d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417697,12417668,12417703,12417642,12417710,12417716,12417687,12417694\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/940/\">\n    568 U.S. 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20S.%20Ct.%20425\">\n    133 S.Ct. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20255\">\n    184 L.Ed.2d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), in which we interpreted a statute, General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (a) (15) (A), containing the phrase \"includes but shall not be limited to.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20255\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We concluded that that phrase, \"coupled with the enumeration of specific or illustrative acts of ... conduct, is indicative of a legislative intent ... to delegate to the [commissioner] the duty of ascertaining what other or additional acts fall within the articulated standard.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20255\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The basis for this conclusion, however, was that the phrase \"includes but shall not be limited to\" is\n   <em>\n    expansive\n   </em>\n   , that is, it indicates that the\n   statute refers to items in addition to the expressly enumerated items.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20255\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The commissioner has cited no authority for the proposition that the word \"from,\" when coupled with a specified item, has a similarly expansive meaning. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the legislature's use of the word \"from\" in \u00a7 12-256 (b) is indicative of an intent that the commissioner would have the discretion to tax gross earnings from business operations\n   <em>\n    in addition\n   </em>\n   to the specifically enumerated operation, namely, \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite,\" or that that phrase should be construed broadly to include any potentially\n   <em>\n    related\n   </em>\n   operations.\n   We further note that businesses are not always taxed on the gross earnings from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of their business operations.

In addition, when the legislature wants to tax a business' earnings from all sources, it knows how to do so. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 12-249 provides that \"[e]ach corporation operating a railroad, and carrying on business for profit in this state, shall ... pay a tax computed upon its gross earnings\n   <em>\n    from all sources from operations in this state\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) We can perceive\n   no reason why the legislature would not have used similar language in \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) if its intent had been to impose a tax on all operations of a business engaged in the transmission of video programming by satellite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We acknowledge that the legislative history of Public Acts 2003, Spec. Sess., June, 2003, No. 03-1, \u00a7 92, which is codified at \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2), does not reveal the reasons why the legislature would have wanted to exempt from the imposition of the tax gross earnings from the sale and lease of equipment by satellite television providers, and from the installation and maintenance of such equipment. We cannot simply assume, however, that no such reasons could possibly have existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is possible, for example, that the legislature might have believed that not imposing a tax on the sale or lease of equipment would incentivize the purchase of such equipment and thereby expand the gross earnings from transmissions that are subject to the tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is also\n   possible that the legislature was unaware that satellite television providers derive significant earnings from the sale and lease of equipment necessary to view the video programming that they transmit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that nothing in the text of \u00a7 12-256 or related statutes makes it clear that the phrase \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite,\" as it is used in \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2), was intended to include the sale or lease of satellite dishes and related equipment required to view video programming transmitted by satellite or fees for equipment installation and maintenance. Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase is ambiguous in that respect. It is well settled that tax statutes must be strictly construed, and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. See,\n   e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Andersen Consulting, LLP\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   , supra, 255 Conn. at 511,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=767%20A.2d%20692\">\n    767 A.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Zachs\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Groppo\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"537647\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/207/683/#p689\">\n    207 Conn. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=542%20A.2d%201145\">\n    542 A.2d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly determined that earnings from the sale and lease of equipment and equipment installation and maintenance are not subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We next address the plaintiff's claim, made in its cross appeal, that the trial court improperly determined that its gross earnings from the sale of DVR service and the imposition of payment related fees are subject to the tax imposed by \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2). We agree with the plaintiff that the gross earnings from the sale of DVR services are not subject to the tax, but reject its claim with respect to payment related fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We first consider whether payments from subscribers for DVR service clearly constitute \"gross earnings from ... the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\" under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiff submitted an affidavit to the trial court averring that \"DVR service is provided through a device leased to the subscriber that combines a receiver with a computer-type hard drive. This device ... record[s] video programming transmitted to the subscriber's receiver, which allow[s] the subscriber to view the video programming on the subscriber's own schedule. The DVR service function[s] only after the video programming [has] been delivered to the subscriber by satellite.\" In addition, the affidavit averred that, \"[w]hile the bulk of [the plaintiff's] gross earnings from subscribers were from its sale of [television] programming and pay-per-view movies and/or events, [the plaintiff] also received gross earnings from subscribers for other goods and services that did not constitute video programming transmitted by satellite,\" including DVR service. The commissioner concedes these factual assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although DVR service requires the prior transmission of video programming, we conclude that there is at least a plausible argument that DVR service is a separate and distinct operation from \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2). The capability of recording video programming is not the same thing as the capability of receiving transmissions of video programming in the first instance. Indeed, according to the undisputed averments in the plaintiff's affidavit, subscribers pay for DVR service\n   <em>\n    in addition\n   </em>\n   to the transmission of the programming that is recorded with the DVR device. It would be anomalous to conclude that subscribers pay for the same service twice. Because \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) is ambiguous as to whether it was intended to impose a tax on gross earnings from the provision of DVR service, we must construe the statute in the plaintiff's favor.

We conclude that, just as charges to subscribers to recover the tax imposed by \u00a7 12-256 (b) (2) are subject to taxation under that statute because such charges are clearly part and parcel of the taxed business operation,\n   i.e., \"the transmission to subscribers in this state of video programming by satellite\"-which the plaintiff concedes-the imposition of payment related fees is clearly part and parcel of that operation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498005\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/583/#p592\">\n    202 Conn. at 592-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20771\">\n    522 A.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting claim that moneys collected from consumers to recover payment of gross earnings taxes on sale of petroleum products are not \"earnings from the sale of petroleum products\").

We conclude that the trial court properly determined that \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   applies when a taxpayer has appealed from the denial of a refund claim. We further conclude that the court properly determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to an interest award pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   because it never made a claim pursuant to that statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Whether \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1) or \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   applies in cases in which a taxpayer has appealed from the commissioner's denial of a refund claim is a question of statutory interpretation subject to plenary review.

We begin our analysis with the language of the relevant statutes. Section 12-268c (a) (1) authorizes certain taxpayers that believe that they have overpaid their taxes to\n   \"file a claim for refund in writing with the commissioner within three years from the due date for which such overpayment was made ....\" Section 12-268c (b) (1) provides that, \"[t]o any refunds granted as a result of overpayments of any taxes under\n   chapter 210, 211 or 212, except refunds due because of any intentional overpayment, there shall be added interest at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent for each month or fraction of a month, as provided in subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Section 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   authorizes a taxpayer that is aggrieved by an order of the commissioner to \"take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain ....\" Section 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   further provides that the trial court \"may grant such relief as may be equitable and, if such tax has been paid prior to the granting of such relief, may order the Treasurer to pay the amount of such relief, with interest at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent per month or fraction thereof to the aggrieved taxpayer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   authorizes the trial court to award interest when the tax assessment that is disputed on appeal \"has been paid prior to the granting of ... relief ....\" By its very nature, therefore, the interest provision of \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   applies when, and only when, the trial court concludes that the taxpayer is entitled to a\n   <em>\n    refund\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, if this interest provision does not apply to an appeal from the commissioner's denial of a refund claim filed pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1), we would be hard-pressed to imagine when it would apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put another way, if the interest provision of\n   \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1) applies when the trial court has ordered a refund pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   , the provision of \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   authorizing the trial court to award interest when, and only when, a taxpayer is entitled to a refund would be superfluous.

We note in this regard that, even if the plaintiff were correct that \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   mandates that the trial court award interest on refunds, the statute cannot be construed as requiring the trial court to grant the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   interest award that the commissioner would have been required to grant pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1) if he had granted the refund in the first instance, because the methods of calculating interest set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   and 12-268c (b) are different. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (authorizing trial court to order payment of interest at\n   rate of two-thirds of one percent per month or fraction of month), with General Statutes \u00a7 12-268c (b) (requiring commissioner to pay interest at rate of two-thirds of one percent per month or fraction of month, but excluding ninety days from interest period).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the plaintiff's failure to request an interest award pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   cannot be deemed a mere technicality in light of its request for interest pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1).\n   The plaintiff also contends that, if the interest provision of \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   is discretionary, that statute cannot apply when the trial court has ordered a refund following the denial of a claim filed pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c (a) (1) because the legislature could not have intended to encourage the commissioner to deny meritorious refund claims and \"force taxpayers into court where a discretionary award of interest is far less likely.\" Even if we were to assume that interest awards pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   are discretionary, however, we would not find the plaintiff's argument persuasive. This court has held that, even when interest awards are discretionary, there is no requirement that the party seeking interest prove wrongfulness above and beyond the unlawful detention of the payment in order for the trial court to have the discretion to award interest.

The record does not reveal, however, whether the sale and lease of equipment and equipment installation and maintenance are subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-256 (b) (1), or whether that tax is limited to gross earnings derived from a business' use of its own lines, facilities, apparatus and auxiliary equipment.

The proposed legislation would have amended \u00a7 12-256 (b) by adding the following provision: \"For purposes of this subdivision, receipts from subscribers include, but are not limited to, all revenues received by a system, service or business described in this subdivision from sales or rentals of equipment related to the operation or use of such system, service or business, including, but not limited to, all charges related to the installation, maintenance and repair of such equipment.\" Raised Bill No. 7312, 2017 Sess., \u00a7 2.

In addition, Kueck's written testimony stated that this bill would \"detrimentally affect the state's economy in multiple ways,\" including reducing the demand for satellite television service, to which nearly 175,000 families in the state subscribe.

Namely, in a case in which the commissioner granted a claim for a refund, but refused to add interest as required by \u00a7 12-268c (b) (1), the taxpayer could seek relief from that ruling by appealing to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    , in which case, the commissioner could contend that \u00a7 12-268c (b) no longer applied. In that situation, however, we have little doubt that, even assuming that an interest award pursuant to \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    is discretionary-an issue that, as we discuss subsequently in this opinion, we need not decide here-it would be an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to award interest pursuant to that statute. Indeed, the commissioner makes no claim in the present case that he has any authority to refuse to pay interest on a refund that he has granted pursuant to \u00a7 12-268c. As we also discuss subsequently in this opinion, we recognize that the method of calculating interest under \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    is different from the method under \u00a7 12-268c (b). Because \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    allows for a larger interest award, however, the taxpayer would not be harmed in this situation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The plaintiff stated in a footnote in its reply to the commissioner's objection to its motion for interest that, \"[s]ince ... \u00a7 12-268c (b) clearly and specifically addresses the issue of interest on refunds of the satellite gross earnings tax, it is the controlling statute.\" The plaintiff then noted that \"equity calls for the award of interest in any event. While [the commissioner] attempts to lay responsibility for the length of this litigation on [the plaintiff], the record is clear that: (i) [the plaintiff] repeatedly requested schedules and hearings in an effort to speedily resolve this litigation, only to be met with [the commissioner's] persistent objections; and (ii) [the plaintiff] supplied tremendous amounts of data to [the commissioner] in a good faith effort to come to an agreement on the amount of the refund due, both voluntarily and in response to formal discovery, ultimately fostering the parties' agreement on the amount of the refund.\" The plaintiff did not claim in the alternative, however, that \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    applied. Nor did the plaintiff claim, as it does on appeal, that the interest provision of \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    is mandatory. Rather, the plaintiff appears to have been suggesting that,\n    <em>\n     even if\n    </em>\n    , as the commissioner had contended in his opposition to the plaintiff's motion for interest, \u00a7 12-268\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    applies to claims for interest in appeals from the commissioner's denial of a refund claim, the equities weighed in favor of an interest award.
