Plaintiffs sought relief from the City of Rutland after suffering sewage backups in their homes. The trial court granted summary judgment to the City, concluding that plaintiffs failed to adequately support their negligence, nuisance, trespass, and constitutional takings claims. Plaintiffs appeal, arguing that they produced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment. We affirm the court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. Plaintiffs live on Butterfly Avenue in the City of Rutland. The City's sewage/stormwater system is over 100 years old. Two combined sewer/stormwater lines run under plaintiffs' street. Originally, these pipes consisted of a 12-inch vitrified clay pipe on the western line and a parallel 15-inch vitrified clay pipe on the eastern line. In 1987, the City conducted a video inspection of the pipes, which showed that the pipes were cracked, structurally unsound, and that they had significant root intrusion. The following year, based on the root intrusion, engineering recommendations, and financial considerations, the City undertook a so-called slip-lining process that inserted polyethylene sleeves of lesser diameter through the clay pipes. It slip-lined the 12-inch clay pipe on the western line with a 9-inch polyethylene pipe, and it slip-lined the 15-inch clay pipe on the eastern line with a 12-inch polyethene pipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. In May 2014, the City experienced an extremely intense rain and hail storm, accompanied by high winds; 1.3 inches of rain fell in just fifteen minutes. The total rainfall was 1.65 inches. The flow rate at the City's main sewer interceptor rose instantly from approximately 7 million gallons per day (MGD) to almost 70 MGD, and the storm caused 3 million gallons of combined wastewater (domestic sewage and stormwater) to overflow to receiving streams. That day, the City's combined sewer/stormwater line also backed up into the basements of plaintiffs' homes causing property damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. In January 2015, plaintiffs sued the City, asserting that it had been negligent\n   in the design, construction, and/or maintenance and repair of the City's public sewer lines. Plaintiffs also raised nuisance, trespass, and constitutional takings claims. With respect to their negligence claim, plaintiffs alleged that the City had not acted reasonably or prudently in designing the lines and in deciding to slip-line them in 1988. They further asserted that the City had a duty to keep and maintain the lines in a reasonably safe and proper condition for the public's use and benefit. Plaintiffs sought damages as well as injunctive relief requiring the City to remedy the storm/wastewater system near their property to prevent future damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. The City moved for summary judgment. In addition to the facts recited above, the City produced evidence that it has had an excessive number of combined storm/sewer overflows due in part to the age of its infrastructure and that it has limited resources in addressing these issues. The City also noted that the state and the federal governments imposed significant regulatory constraints on its actions and priorities, which was one of many factors that influenced the City's decisions regarding the use of its limited funds. Plaintiffs' expert agreed that deciding the priority of projects was a matter of discretion and that such decisions involved the exercise of judgment and the weighing of technical merit and available resources. Based on these and additional proffered facts, the City maintained that it was entitled to summary judgment on numerous grounds, including immunity and plaintiffs' failure to establish causation for the negligence and nuisance claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, submitting an affidavit from their expert engineer to supplement the expert's deposition testimony. With respect to their negligence claim, plaintiffs argued that they had produced evidence to show that the cause of the sewage backup in their homes was a combination of a bend in the westernmost pipe and a reduction in flow caused by the slip-lining. The parties disagreed about the degree of the bend in the pipe; they also disagreed whether the slip-lining had reduced the water flow given the root intrusion and other issues with the pre-1988 pipes. Plaintiffs also challenged the City's position regarding their nuisance, trespass, and takings claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. In an April 2017 order, the court granted summary judgment to the City. It concluded that plaintiffs could not establish causation for purposes of their negligence claim. It thus did not reach the City's remaining arguments regarding this claim. Given the absence of causation, the trial court also rejected plaintiffs' nuisance claim. As to trespass, the court found that plaintiffs needed to show an intentional act and that there was no such allegation or evidence of that here. Finally, the court found that plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to support their takings claim. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8. We review a grant of summary judgment using the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Richart v.

We conclude that the City was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims, although parts of our decision rest on different grounds than those identified by the trial court.

We conclude as a matter of law that the City is immune from plaintiffs' negligence, trespass, and nuisance claims because it was exercising discretionary, policymaking authority when it designed the sewer/stormwater lines and when it decided to slip-line certain pipes rather than replace the lines entirely. As to plaintiffs' takings claim, we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment. We thus affirm the court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.

The application of the immunity here is not simply a carry-over of the concept of a governmental function as distinguished from a proprietary function, but is based on the theory that some governmental functions are of a type that should not be subject to review and second-guessing by the courts in a tort action.

Turning to the instant case, we conclude as a matter of law that, like the types of decisions referenced above, the decisions at issue here-the design of the sewer system and the City's decision to slip-line the damaged pipes rather than replace the system entirely-\"required a weighing of the type of public policy considerations that would warrant shielding [the City] from liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5776978\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/161/168/#p170\">\n    161 Vt. at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5776978\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/161/168/#p170\">\n    638 A.2d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the City stated in its motion for summary judgment, its sewage system is 100 years old and the City must prioritize expenditures related to this system mindful of, among other things, regulatory requirements, significant potential fines and costs, engineering recommendations, cost efficiencies including costs of road projects, and limited funds. The City alleged, and plaintiffs' expert agreed, that deciding the priority of projects is a matter of discretion, which involves judgment and the weighing of technical merit and available resources. Additionally, as plaintiffs' expert agreed, there are various ways to address substantial root intrusion into clay pipes, including slip-lining, which is the least expensive alternative. The City's decisions to design the system to include a particular bend in a pipe-to whatever degree it is actually bent-and to slip-line rather than replace the vitrified clay pipes entirely were within its discretion, and separation of powers concerns compel the conclusion that the City is immune from negligence liability for these decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22. Our conclusion that these decisions are best characterized as planning and design decisions rather than \"maintenance\" issues is informed by\n   <em>\n    Gage\n   </em>\n   and by cases from other states.

Plaintiffs believe that the pipes should be of a greater diameter and that there should not be a bend of a certain degree in a particular pipe. \"When remedying a problem would require a city to, in essence, redesign or reconstruct the sewer system, then the complaint presents a design or construction issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Essman v.

There is no suggestion that any particular \"maintenance\" would have prevented the damages here. The issue is redesigning the system. Indeed, as part of their requested relief, plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction ordering the City to \"design, construct, and maintain a reasonable and adequate remedy to the storm/wastewater system in the vicinity of [their] property so that they are not put in\n   peril of future losses and damages from storm water and/or wastewater.\" The proper design of the City's sewer system must be left to the City. It is appropriate to \"limit judicial interference with legislative and executive decision-making, because to accept a jury's verdict as to the reasonableness and safety of a plan of governmental services and prefer it over the judgment of the governmental body which originally considered and passed on the matter would be to obstruct normal governmental operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Tarbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=956%20A.2d%20322\">\n    956 A.2d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, quotations, and alteration omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24.

Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the City's \"conduct, actions and/or inactions ... created a nuisance that substantially and unreasonably interferes with [their] right to use and enjoy their properties.\" They also asserted that the City's conduct \"constitutes a breach of duty to the plaintiffs.\" The behavior at issue is apparently the City's allegedly flawed design of the system and its decision to slip-line the pipes. It appears that the alleged nuisance is the \"continued intrusion of ... sewage into [plaintiffs'] homes and the damage it causes both at the time and in decreasing the market value or marketability of their homes,\" which plaintiffs allege \"is caused by the City's decision to spend its money on other projects.\" Plaintiffs asserted in their opposition to summary judgment that prior to the 2014 incidents, the City had notice of what appears to be a 1986 backup in the Daly home and a 2007 backup in the Lorman home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   B. Immunity\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30. We have not yet addressed whether, and when, a municipality can be\n   held liable on a nuisance claim under circumstances similar to these. Different treatises appear to endorse different approaches, sometimes within the same discussion, and case law reflects a variety of opinions on this question. See, e.g., 18A McQuillan,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 53:77.21 (\"Claims of nuisance per se and intentional nuisance in fact are not barred by governmental immunity. However, in other jurisdictions, claims of intentional nuisance are barred, as are claims of public nuisance.\" (footnotes omitted) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53:151 (\"There is a conflict in the jurisdictions as to the liability for inadequate sewers or drains. Sometimes the governing law is not harmonious even in the same state.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 31. McQuillan states that \"[i]n jurisdictions that still provide tort immunity for municipalities under the governmental-proprietary distinction, there has long been an exception for nuisances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 53:77.21. \"One rationale is that nuisances involving damage to private property resemble unconstitutional takings. Another rationale is that life-threatening conditions created by the municipality ought not be treated as mere negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnotes omitted). McQuillan also recognizes, however, that \"[a]s a matter of law, particular municipal acts may constitute negligence rather than intentional nuisance,\" and that \"[a] single isolated occurrence or act, which if regularly repeated would constitute a nuisance, is not a nuisance until it is regularly repeated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Kellogg v.

A different treatise, The Law of Torts, provides an analysis that we find compelling here. Dobbs posits that, stated bluntly, \"a nuisance claim based on negligence is merely a negligence claim with harm to interests in use and enjoyment.\" 2 D. Dobbs, The Law of Torts \u00a7 400, at 623. He continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   When a public entity creates a nuisance, some courts will reject common law immunities and subject the entity to liability. However, because a nuisance claim based on negligent acts is merely a claim of negligence that causes loss of use and enjoyment of land, the logical result is that immunity depends on whether the defendant's negligent acts called for immunity, not on the nuisance label itself. Thus if a city negligently creates a nuisance but its negligent acts are discretionary, it would enjoy the discretionary immunity. Of course, to the extent that the conduct exceeds the city's immunity, suit will be permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554638\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/908/822/#p829\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnotes omitted).

We agree with Dobbs that logic dictates that the City is immune from plaintiffs' nuisance claim, which is essentially a restated version of plaintiffs' negligence claim. The claim rests on negligence and the same discretionary acts discussed above. Allowing this claim to proceed would lead to the same result that the discretionary-function immunity is designed to avoid: having the court second-guess the City's discretionary decisions regarding the design of the sewer system.

The undisputed facts here show that the sewage backups on plaintiffs' property have been intermittent, limited, and transient. The Gallaghers have had one backup since 2007 and the Lormans have had two. The Dalys have had five backups between 1983 and 2014 with the closest backups occurring four years apart. While no backup is insignificant, the backups occurred intermittently over a long period of time, and we conclude that this does not suffice to show a taking under the law.
