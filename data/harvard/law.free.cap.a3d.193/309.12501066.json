Before we identify the\n   legal issues raised by defendant, we will briefly summarize how these allegations came to light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 30, 2015, the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (Division) received a referral that alleged defendant was sexually abusing his biological daughter Jane, who was then fifteen years old. The Division assigned two Special Response Unit (SPRU) workers to investigate. The lead SPRU investigator reported the sexual abuse allegations to the Camden County Prosecutor's Office (CCPO). The SPRU workers interviewed Jane, her biological mother S.K., and her older sister Kate, who was then sixteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the information revealed through these interviews, the Division executed an emergency Dodd removal\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the children and placed them in the temporary custody of a foster family. On June 2, 2015, the Division filed an Order to Show Cause (OTSC) and Verified Complaint charging both defendant and S.K. with child sexual abuse under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(3). The Family Part granted the OTSC, placed the children with a Division-approved foster family, and awarded the Division temporary custody, care, and supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the same time the Division's investigation and proceedings in the Family Part were going forward, the CCPO began its own parallel criminal investigation of these allegations. Law enforcement agents assisted Division caseworkers to effectuate the emergency Dodd removal of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a CCPO Detective explained the nature of the charges, defendant agreed to submit to a lie detector test on June 1, 2015, at the Lindenwold Police Station. Defendant later refused to submit to the test and declined to cooperate with the criminal investigation. The CCPO ultimately arrested and charged defendant on three counts of first degree\n   aggravated sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(a)(2)(a), four counts of second degree sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(b), and two counts of second degree endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While these criminal charges were pending, the Family Part initially enjoined defendant from having any contact with his daughters, and ordered him to submit to psychological and psychiatric evaluations. On January 25, 2016, the Family Part Judge conducted a fact-finding hearing pursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.44, and the Division called defendant as a witness to corroborate the allegations of sexual abuse made against him by his daughter Jane. On the advice of his attorney, defendant invoked his right against self-incrimination and refused to testify. At the request of the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) who represented the Division, the Family Part Judge drew an adverse inference of culpability against defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jane did not testify at the fact-finding hearing. The only evidence of the sexual molestation came from S.K.'s hearsay testimony, who recited what Jane told her about the alleged molestation. In the course of making his factual findings, the judge relied on the adverse inference he drew from defendant's invocation of his right against self-incrimination as substantive evidence to corroborate Jane's allegations of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this appeal, defendant argues the Family Part Judge improperly drew an adverse inference against him when he invoked his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and this State's evidence rule N.J.R.E. 503 in response to the Division's request to call him as a witness in the fact-finding hearing. This issue has not been addressed in a published opinion by any court in this State. We now hold that a Family Part Judge may not draw an adverse inference of culpability against a defendant who invokes his right against self-incrimination to refuse to testify at a Title 9 fact-finding hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant also claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree. Defense counsel's performance in this case fell\n   below the standards of competence expected from an attorney admitted to practice law in this State. Counsel was not prepared to provide defendant with a proper defense. His inattentiveness permitted the Division to present legally incompetent evidence to corroborate the allegations of abuse, the dispositive issue in this case. Counsel's ineffective assistance also significantly contributed to the legal error that irreparably tainted the Family Part's findings of abuse against defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Initial Interview\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The first time a Division caseworker interviewed Jane was in her home on May 30, 2015. She was fifteen years old at the time. Jane was hesitant and felt \"awkward\" talking about her father's behavior. She said her father had touched her breasts over her clothing, and that the abuse began when she was eleven and ended when she was thirteen years old. However, she could not recall specific time frames when the molestation began or ended. When the caseworker asked her if anyone had ever had sex with her, she said \"yes\" and that it happened \"years ago but\n   stopped when she was ten years old.\" She also claimed that her father had raped her when she was six years old, and continued until she was ten years old, often when her mother was at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jane claimed she told her sister about the abuse when it happened and that her mother also knew. Jane told the caseworker that her mother did not believe her because her father said she was lying. She also told the caseworker that her mother \"had a talk\" with her father about it \"so he would stop.\" S.K. denied knowledge of the abuse. She claimed that defendant and Jane have a \"strained relationship,\" and attributed her daughter's allegations of sexual abuse against her own father to \"becoming a teenager and going through teenage things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later that same day, a caseworker accompanied the family to the Hi-Nella Police Station where Jane and her sister Kate met\n   with a Detective from the CCPO. The sisters were interviewed separately. As was the case with her discussion with the Division caseworker, Jane was at first hesitant and felt awkward talking about defendant with the Detective. She eventually told him that the sexual abuse began when she was six years old and continued until she was approximately eleven. When the Detective asked her if she could tell him what happened, she answered: \"No. It's ... I don't actually remember, I have [a] bad memory.\" She also claimed she could not remember the last time he molested her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite her age, the Detective used drawings of male and female bodies and pointed to specific body parts to ask her where defendant had touched her. Jane told him he touched specific body parts with \"his hand and dick.\" She claimed he kissed her lips while she was laying down, and touched her \"boobs\" with his hand, and her vagina with his \"dick and hand.\" With respect to her vagina, she claimed he touched her \"on the inside.\" At the time, she did not know whether this was right or wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The molestation occurred in her bedroom, and she estimated it happened \"probably less than twenty [times].\" She did not tell her friends or her older sisters\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   about the abuse until she was twelve or thirteen years old. Her sisters did not tell anyone; Jane told the Detective that she believes her mother was not aware of the abuse. When Jane finally told her friends, she told them she was \"raped a while ago.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Detective next interviewed Jane's older sister Kate. Kate told him that she did not remember what Jane told her when Jane was twelve years old. According to Kate, Jane never told her anything about what her father was doing to her. When the Detective pursued the issue more vigorously, Kate said that Jane might have told her about something \"a really long time ago,\" but claimed to have no specific recollection or knowledge about what it was about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When the Detective interviewed S.K., she again denied any knowledge of sexual abuse. She claimed Jane fabricated these allegations against her father because he had chastised her for being disrespectful to him. According to S.K., Jane told defendant: \"how can I respect you when you raped me.\" S.K. told the Detective that she did not ask defendant about Jane's comment. However, when she asked Jane, she did not reply. At that point, S.K. said she decided to \"let the comment die.\" S.K. noted that defendant had \"always been\n   mean\" to Jane because he suspected she was not his biological child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant denied the veracity of his daughter's allegations and \"became hostile\" when he was interviewed by the CCPO Detective. When the Division caseworkers told defendant that they were taking temporary custody of his two daughters on an emergency basis, he told the caseworkers that he \"would plead guilty to the charges, even though he was not guilty, if that meant the children could stay with their mother.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Detective interviewed Jane a second time on June 3, 2015. She again claimed that she was not certain when the sexual abuse began. She estimated that it started when she was six or seven years old and ended when she was ten or eleven. She did not recall how many times she was sexually molested because she has a \"really, really bad memory.\" The video recording shows the Detective reviewed her May 30, 2015 statement with Jane to confirm that her father had \"touched her on her boobs and her private part.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During this second interview, Jane made the following statement about defendant: \"I heard that the information I'm giving you in here is going to help them decide if my dad goes to jail. He wouldn't survive in jail because of the problem he has with his knee and stuff.\" When the Detective asked her what she would like to see done in terms of punishment for her father, she responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Well if they're hurt, if it was someone who actually did it to other people, he only did it to me and he stopped and he learned his lesson and never did it since. And\n   he's really hurt and he's also my dad. And I don't want him to die and because I know he's gonna die in jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Verified Complaint the Division filed in the Family Part on June 2, 2015 included the following statement: \"Detective Houten explained that he was not sure, at this time, what charges, if any, were going to be pressed against [defendant] as right now it was [Jane's] word against his word.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Division referred Jane to the CARES Institute\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a medical examination. In a report dated June 23, 2015, Dr. Marita Lind, M.D., states that Jane reported to her medical examination accompanied by her adult sister. According to Dr. Lind, the Division referred this fifteen-year-old girl \"for the diagnosis and treatment of any residual to inappropriate sexual contact she may have experienced.\" Jane repeated her allegations against her father, but Dr. Lind did not find any physical evidence of prior sexual activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Family Part Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Family Part conducted a number of case status hearings from June to December 2015. The court ordered the Division to provide Jane and Kate individualized and family therapy. Defendant was indicted on multiple counts of first and second degree sexual offenses and was detained at the Camden County Jail awaiting trial in the Criminal Part. The Division placed Jane and Kate in the physical custody of their adult sister. S.K. cooperated with the Division and completed all court-ordered\n   services, including psychological and domestic violence evaluations. The court initially awarded S.K. unsupervised visitation with the children.\n   The court eventually reunited the girls with their mother, restoring S.K.'s full legal and physical custody. Although he was incarcerated, the court continued to enjoin defendant from having any contact with his minor daughters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On December 11, 2015, the Family Part Judge held a pre-trial compliance review hearing to address any issues related to the fact-finding hearing. The DAG representing the Division indicated he planned to call S.K. as a witness. This prompted the Law Guardian to make the following statement for the record: \"But for a limited purpose. [S.K. is] not going to be testifying against the father. She's just going to be identifying the children's voices on the audio so that the children don't have to come in.\" The DAG responded: \"Correct, yes.\" Furthermore, the DAG also confirmed that S.K. did not have \"any direct knowledge of [what] actually ... [is] going on. It's [only] for ... identification purposes of the videos.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The judge asked defense counsel whether \"the evidence that the Division will attempt to bring forth ... [would] establish the burden [of proof] here?\" Defense counsel responded: \"Judge, I have reviewed the evidence. I'm not going to concede that [the Division] can prove [its] case based on the evidence.\" This prompted the DAG to make the following comment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE DAG: Quite frankly, Judge, and no offense [for] interrupting [defense counsel], given the way that the Appellate Division has been handling cases lately, I would prefer to put on live testimony and have a full hearing on this, given the nature of the allegations here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: So we're going to have to call one of the children?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE DAG: Hopefully I won't have to. Hopefully her statements, Your Honor is going to make the evidentiary ruling that her [presumably referring to Jane] statements are able to go in. They are investigative. If there's a request for cross-examination, I guess we'll have to deal with it at that point. But I have listened to the tapes. I know [defense counsel] listened to the tapes. The child is quite explicit in what she says and heard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: The burden here is of course with the Division. There is no requirement that we have proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But the proof is by the preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    So wouldn't the child describing the abuse in question on a videotape, doesn't that satisfy the burden here\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL:\n   <em>\n    Judge, you could find that testimony to be [ ]credible. Judge, I cannot without committing malpractice concede the case\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. But assuming that comes in, assuming it's not, assuming it's credible, what is it the defense would have? I'm just trying to pre-try the case, that's all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: No, I understand, I understand. Again, I think the Division, if Your Honor finds that testimony to be credible, then I think we have a tough case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Now you could, on your own, call the children as your witnesses and cross-examine them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: I certainly could.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: Do you plan to do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Later in the colloquy, defense counsel made the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: And Judge, so I'm clear and everybody at counsel table is clear\n   <em>\n    my client will be asserting his Fifth Amendment rights so we are going to object to him testifying\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE DAG: That's fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: So the question then, can the court take an inference that by exercising his Fifth Amendment rights in this proceeding, can the court take an inference of culpability?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE DAG: I believe Your Honor can.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, I have researched the issue and I don't remember what I came up with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE DAG: I have some case law [that] I can send --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: I suspect that you might be able to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE COURT: Why don't you send the case law over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Family Part held the fact-finding hearing on January 25, 2016. The DAG played audio recordings of interviews conducted by the CCPO Detective of Jane and her older sister Kate. Defense counsel did not object nor ask to cross-examine the girls. The Division called S.K. as a witness for the limited purpose of identifying the voices on the audio recordings as being those of her daughters Jane and Kate. Without objection from defendant's counsel, the judge also admitted into evidence a video/audio recording of Jane's second interview with the CCPO Detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thereafter, the DAG questioned S.K. about the verbal altercation she witnessed between defendant and Jane. The DAG asked S.K.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. And do you recall at that point that your husband told [Jane] that he wanted a little respect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. Okay. Do you recall what [Jane's] answer was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. I think she said that, how can -- how or would respect somebody who raped you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response to a series of leading questions by the DAG, S.K. confirmed that Jane made this statement before the Division and the CCPO began their respective investigations of Jane's allegations of sexual abuse by defendant. S.K. also testified that Jane was currently living with her and was participating in Division-sponsored therapeutic programs. S.K. also testified that Jane had not mentioned the allegations against defendant. Neither defense counsel nor the Law Guardian asked S.K. any questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Division also called Allison Quinn, the caseworker who responded to the referral of sexual abuse on May 30, 2015, and thereafter interviewed Jane. Quinn testified that Jane \"basically relayed the same thing that she said in the videotape to me.\" According to Quinn, when she asked Jane questions about her father touching her, \"[Jane] shut down. She gave no eye contact and appeared uncomfortable.\" Quinn also testified that Jane told her that she told her sister about the abuse. Defense counsel did not cross-examine Quinn at this point. Instead, the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE DAG: Your Honor, I am going to renew my request to call [defendant as a witness]. I believe there's going to be an objection from his attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: That's correct, Judge. He's exercising his Fifth Amendment right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   THE COURT: Well doesn't he, himself, have to tell us that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: If we want to go through that exercise we can do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Is it true that you wish to exercise your Fifth Amendment\n   right to remain silent and not provide any testimony in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   THE COURT: Is that true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   THE DAG: With that, Your Honor, the Division's going to rest. I am going to ask the court to [draw] a negative inference as to [defendant], which I believe in\n   <em>\n    Belito\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   (phonetic), I think that's the case, is permissible. I've previously briefed this issue out in --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah, I recall, you supplied it. Any argument on that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Judge, I didn't specifically research that issue but I believe counsel may be correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   THE COURT: ... We've had a lot of discussions over the years, but at this juncture the court is satisfied that counsel has provided appropriate case law. And in fact it took me years to find appropriate case law and counsel finally found it for us. But that is correct. So there is an inference and you rest?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   THE DAG: I rest, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Notwithstanding the Division's decision to rest its case, the judge permitted defense counsel to cross-examine Quinn. In response to defense counsel's question, Quinn confirmed that Jane's medical evaluation conducted at the CARES Institute did not find any physical evidence of sexual abuse. The rest of defense counsel's cross-examination merely reviewed matters covered by Quinn in her direct testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendant did not call any witnesses. The next phase of the fact-finding hearing involved only the arguments of counsel and their interactions with the judge in response to his questions. Defense counsel argued that the audio and video recordings of Jane's interview conducted by the CCPO Detective shows Jane made several materially inconsistent statements about the alleged sexual abuse. Defense counsel emphasized that the physician who conducted Jane's medical examination did not find any physical evidence that she had had vaginal intercourse. Counsel argued this\n   was inconsistent with Jane's statement to the Detective \"that her father penetrated her with his dick.\" Defense counsel also argued that the Detective did not ask her whether she understood that she had \"a duty to tell the truth right now.\" The judge agreed that \"whoever interviewed the child ... did an extremely poor job.\" Finally, defense counsel argued that \"under [N.J.R.E.] 603, the child has to be under oath. The child was never placed under oath. The testimony cannot be accepted under [N.J.R.E.] 603.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The DAG argued that the recordings of Jane's interviews with the Detective \"wasn't necessarily testimony that was put on. That was the child's out of court statements as to the ... allegations of abuse.\" Citing this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. Z.P.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960219\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/351/427/\">\n    351 N.J. Super. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960219\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/351/427/\">\n    798 A.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 2002), the DAG argued the recordings of Jane's interviews were intended as corroborative\n   evidence. This prompted the following colloquy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   THE COURT: But it's the same thing over and over again. She says something to the Division, she says something to the person from the prosecutor's office --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   THE DAG: No. It's the unprompted spontaneous admission that she made to her mother several months before about her father raping her. There wasn't ... Division involvement at the time. The child made the statement. She said that --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   THE COURT: Well not when [S.K. asked] the other question. Were you concerned when your daughter made that statement that she was actually raped or was she just responding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   THE DAG: That is actually included in the 9-7,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   which mom indicated, and you can bring her back if we need to, saying that she figured that dad would just deny it anyway. That's included in there. We're talking about two separate allegations several months apart. The child's statement is consistent among both the videotape as well as the audiotape recording.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The judge ultimately concluded the Division presented sufficient competent evidence to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that defendant sexually abused Jane under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(3). The judge made the following findings in support of this conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   All right. This is a difficult case and the way this court has spoken about it shows the court's concerns. The court has reviewed everything that was submitted. It's looked at the police report and the prosecutor's report, but certainly it isn't considering those two documents in any way in making a determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   What is interesting though, is this special nature of the rule that the defendant could have made some comments, and in this environment I would think that if he wanted to he could have. I don't think anyone is going to rip into him in his criminal case, but other than to say what response to what occurred. But that is his decision and I know that attorneys generally make that comment. But here we do not, the case law says we continue on with this case independent a Fifth Amendment issue. We don't postpone this case for a Fifth Amendment issue, but it is clearly raised here that the defendant does not have a right to have this case postponed.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(a), \"[w]hen a criminal complaint has been filed against a parent or guardian arising out of the same\n   incident as a [Division] action ... the Family Part shall determine the nature and scope of parental or guardian visitation[.]\" Under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(a)(1), when the Family Part schedules \"any hearing at which visitation conditions are to be imposed or modified, the court shall provide notice to the county prosecutor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   At this hearing, in addition to the DAG, defense attorneys, and the Law Guardian, the county prosecutor is permitted to appear before the Family Part to present the State's views on the question of visitation. \"Prior to any hearing [the Family Part] shall issue an appropriate protective order governing disclosure of confidential Division records consistent with N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a.\"\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(a)(2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Under Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(b), \"if there is a criminal investigation of an incident that is the basis for the [Division's\" complaint] before the Family Part, the Division \"may request that the prosecutor provide any relevant information for use in the action.\" As we explained in\n   <em>\n    S.M. v.

However, we must emphasize that\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6 does not impose a reciprocal obligation upon the Division to share information with the County Prosecutor. In our view, the reason for such an omission is made clear in this final statement: \"\n   <em>\n    No rights or privileges that may otherwise exist are affected by this dispute resolution procedure\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(b) [ (emphasis added).] Stated differently, the Division's information-disclosure obligations to law enforcement agencies remained as codified in N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Thus, none of the provisions in\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6 empower a Family Part Judge presiding in a Title 9 fact-finding hearing to enjoin the county prosecutor from using a defendant's self-incriminating statements as part of the State's case in a criminal trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Family Part's authority under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(a)(2) is expressly circumscribed by N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a and b. The plain text of this statute does not authorize the Family Part to take any action to prevent the Division from providing the county prosecutor with a transcript of the fact-finding hearing containing a defendant's self-incriminating testimony. In this light, we must now address whether a Family Part Judge may draw an adverse inference of culpability based on defendant's exercise of his right against self-incrimination to refuse to testify as a Division witness at a fact-finding hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Parents have a fundamental constitutional right to raise their children,\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

At the December 11, 2015 pre-trial hearing, defense counsel claimed he had researched the case law concerning whether the judge could draw such an adverse inference against defendant under these circumstances. At the fact-finding hearing conducted on January 25, 2016, defense counsel did not cite any legal authority to support an argument against this critical aspect of the Division's case, seeming to concede the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Despite evidence in the record showing that Jane had made numerous inconsistent statements concerning the nature and duration of the sexual abuse, defense counsel did not make any effort to call her as witness. Defense counsel did not argue that the Division's case against his client was based entirely on hearsay evidence, leaving him unable to cross-examine any of the witnesses who provided prerecorded statements that were considered by the judge. Most egregiously, despite his representation to the judge at the pre-trial hearing that he had researched the law on the use of\n   adverse inferences in civil trials,\n   defense counsel seemed utterly unfamiliar with the body of case law this court has discussed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   We conclude defendant established both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   standard. Defense counsel was ill-prepared to represent defendant at the fact-finding hearing. Defense counsel's conduct fell below the standard of professional competence expected from an attorney in this State. Furthermore, defense counsel's lack of preparation materially prejudiced defendant's right to a fair fact-finding hearing, thus satisfying the second prong under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The Family Part Judge erred when he drew an adverse inference of culpability that defendant sexually abused his biological daughter Jane, based only on defendant's refusal to testify as a witness in the Division's case in chief. Under these circumstances, defendant's decision to refuse to testify was constitutionally protected under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and N.J.R.E. 503. Because the judge relied on defendant's silence to draw an adverse inference of culpability to corroborate the child's hearsay statements, the Division failed to prove, by a preponderance of the competent evidence, that defendant sexually abused his daughter Jane, as defined in N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Finally, we conclude that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel at the fact-finding hearing.

Although domestic violence records are sealed under threat of criminal prosecution, N.J.S.A. 2C:25-34, domestic violence trials are held in open court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1:2-1 (requiring that \"[a]ll trials ... be conducted in open court unless otherwise provided by rule or statute\"), and thus a defendant's testimony is accessible to the public and to the prosecutor in a parallel criminal prosecution. Similar to child welfare litigation, domestic violence matters cannot be adjourned to accommodate the lengthy criminal process, allowing a defendant to testify after the criminal matter is closed, thus avoiding criminal exposure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As my colleagues point out, the Division is required to share its investigative records with the prosecutor. N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a(b)(2). But the statute defines the \"records\" that must be shared as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   All records of child abuse reports made pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1971, c.437 (\n   <em>\n    C.9:6-8.10\n   </em>\n   ), all information obtained by the Department of Children and Families in investigating such reports including reports received pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1974, c.119 (\n   <em>\n    C.9:6-8.40\n   </em>\n   ), and all reports of findings forwarded to the child abuse registry pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1971, c.437 (\n   <em>\n    C.9:6-8.11\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10a(a).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   This definition of records does not include a trial transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Moreover, the right of a prosecutor to participate in a hearing on visitation pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   5:12-6(a) allows the prosecutor to have input only into a condition of release on criminal charges.

Frequently visitation of some kind with a parent is allowed in the parallel child welfare case. Even a neglected or abused child most often benefits from some contact with the perpetrating parent. The Division has the capacity to provide supervised visitation, not commonly available in criminal matters. The Family court determines the visitation accorded a released defendant, but the prosecutor is permitted input in that sole aspect of the Family case, so that the court will have the fullest possible information before making the decision, and the prosecution will be assured the child is safe and its witness protected from possible intimidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The limited appearance by the prosecutor in the child welfare case to resolve the issue of visitation does not dictate our decision here. Unlike in the domestic violence context, the Legislature had no need to enact a specific provision to ensure that a parent's testimony could not be used in the parallel criminal proceeding. Child welfare proceedings are conducted in closed courtrooms,\n   inaccessible to the public, including the prosecutor or other interested party.\n   <em>\n    J.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1388901\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/120/112/#p127\">\n    120 N.J. at 127-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1388901\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/120/112/#p127\">\n    576 A.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Only the court may lift that seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The testimony of a parent accused of abuse or neglect should be heard by the court for the protection and benefit of the child. Unlike in most adversarial proceedings, the third party, the innocent child, is the most important party in a child welfare case. The court should be well-informed before making decisions that will forever affect the child and the family. Here, in my view, the court should have denied the defendant father's application to invoke the right to remain silent and required him to testify, while assuring the father that his testimony could not be used against him in the pending parallel criminal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    \"A 'Dodd removal' refers to the emergency removal of a child from the home without a court order, pursuant to the Dodd Act, which, as amended, is found at N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21 to -8.82.
