In Count I, the Coalition challenges recently promulgated regulations\n   related to unconventional oil and gas well operations contained in Title 25, Chapter 78a of the Pennsylvania Administrative Code (Chapter 78a Regulations), namely, Section 78a.15(f) and (g) and certain definitions in Section 78a.1 pertaining to public resources,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.15(f)-(g), 78a.1 (referred to generally as the Public Resource Regulations). For the reasons that follow, we grant the Application in part with respect to the challenged definitions, as well as Section 78a.15(g)'s mandate regarding consideration of comments and recommendations submitted by municipalities, which we declare as void and unenforceable, and deny the Application in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Environmental Quality Board (Board) published the Chapter 78a Regulations in the\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Bulletin\n   </em>\n   on October 8, 2016, which immediately went into effect. 46 Pa. B. 6431 (2016). The Chapter 78a Regulations relate to surface activities associated with the development of unconventional wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 13, 2016, the Coalition filed its Petition against the Board and the Department of Environmental Protection (Department) (collectively, the Agencies) seeking pre-enforcement review of the Chapter 78a Regulations. The Coalition asserts seven counts and requests declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Count I, the Coalition challenges the validity of Section 78a.15(f) and (g) pertaining to public resources and the related definitions contained in Section 78a.1 of the Chapter 78a Regulations. The Coalition claims that Section 78a.15 injects an entirely new pre-permitting process without statutory authority. It challenges the attendant definitions of \"other critical communities,\" \"common areas of a school's property,\" \"playground,\" and \"public resource agency\" in Section 78a.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Contemporaneous with the Petition, the Coalition filed an application for expedited special relief to preliminarily enjoin the Department's enforcement of the Chapter 78a Regulations to prevent immediate, substantial and irreparable harm to the Coalition and its members. On November 8, 2016, following an evidentiary hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   this Court granted in part and denied in part the Coalition's application, preliminarily enjoining portions of the Chapter 78a Regulations challenged. With regard to Count I, this Court enjoined application of the Public Resource Regulations \"only to the extent that they include 'common areas o[f] a school's property or a playground' and 'species of special concern' as 'public resources' and include 'playground owners' in the definition of 'public resource agency.' \" Preliminary Injunction Order, 11/8/16, at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Agencies appealed the Preliminary Injunction Order to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Coalition contends that the new well permit application provisions in Section 78a.15(f) and (g), along with applicable definitions in Section 78a.1, are unlawful, unreasonable and unenforceable. Specifically, the Coalition challenges Section 78a.15(f)(1)(iv) (requiring well applicants to identify and provide information concerning \"other critical communities\"), 78a.15(f)(1)(vi) (requiring well applicants to identify and provide information concerning \"common areas of a school's property or a playground\" in a well permit application), 78a.15(f)(2) and (g) (relating to \"public resource agency\"), and Section 78a.1 (corresponding definitions). The Coalition claims that the Public Resource Regulations lack statutory authorization and contradict Act 13 of 2012, a statute amending the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act (Act 13), 58 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2301 - 3504,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as other\n   Pennsylvania statutes and regulations applicable to the industry; are contrary to the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township v.

Petition for Review \u00b6\u00b6 44(a)-(k). The Coalition further claims that the Board failed to heed the direction of Section 3215(e) of Act 13, 58 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3215(e), to develop criteria to ensure the optimal development of oil and gas resources and respect the property rights of oil and gas owners before the Department may impose conditions necessary to protect against probable harmful impacts to public resources. The Public Resource Regulations far exceed any legitimate public resource protection. Where the Public Resource Regulations give meaning to the words used in Act 13, they are either untethered from the Agencies' statutory authority or directly in conflict with it. For these reasons, the Coalition asks this Court to declare Section 78a.15(f)-(g), and the definitions of \"other critical communities,\" \"common areas of a school's property,\" \"playground,\" and \"public resource agency,\" in Section 78a.1 as unlawful, void and unenforceable. As there are no disputed material facts with respect to Count I of the Petition, the Coalition maintains that Count I is ripe for summary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Coalition asserts that there are no material facts in issue regarding Count I while the Agencies argue there are. The dispute centers over whether the oil and gas industry is subject to different treatment. The Coalition contends that Section 78a.15 imposes new obligations on applicants for well permits not imposed upon other industries. According to the Coalition, the requirement that unconventional well operators must protect unlisted \"species of special concern\" is not reasonably based on any difference between the unconventional well industry and other industries that justifies dissimilar treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Agencies counter that other regulatory programs all require the equivalent of an \"environmental analysis\" or \"impact analysis\" that involves consideration of impacts to species other than threatened or endangered species. The Agencies contend that whether the Public Resource Regulations treat the unconventional gas and oil industry differently is a material fact in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Contrary to the Agencies' assertions, the issue of whether the Public Resource Regulations treat the unconventional gas and oil industry differently by requiring consideration of \"species of special concern\" is not a disputed fact but rather one that may be determined based on comparison of statutory and regulatory provisions. Thus, we conclude that the Coalition's Application seeking a declaration that the Public Resource Regulations are unlawful and unenforceable is ripe for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Section 78a.15(f) and (g) - \"Pre-Permit Process\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, the Coalition contends that the \"pre-permit process\" established under Section 78a.15(f) and (g) is unlawful and unenforceable. According to the Coalition, the Agencies have created an elaborate process without statutory authority, and\n   without fully understanding the burden it imposes on well permit applicants. Specifically, the Coalition argues that the Public Resource Regulations are contrary to and circumvent statutory authority, namely, Sections 3211, 3212, and 3212.1 of Act 13. To the extent the Agencies rely on Section 3215(c) of Act 13 for authority, the Coalition maintains that the Supreme Court found portions of Section 3215(c) unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   , thereby negating the statutory basis for the Public Resource Regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In addition, the Coalition challenges the Board's failure to develop criteria required by Section 3215(e) of Act 13 as a prerequisite to the Department's authority to impose permit conditions related to public resources. Section 78a.15(g) of the Chapter 78a Regulations is merely an expanded recitation of the statutory language in Section 3215(c) of Act 13, without any explanation of how the Department will balance and evaluate each item it must consider to arrive at appropriate permit conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, the Coalition claims that the Public Resource Regulations fail to comply with the Regulatory Review Act (Review Act)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and rulemaking procedures. More particularly, it asserts the regulatory analysis form (RAF)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not include any estimates for the cost of compliance with mandated mitigation measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Agencies counter that the Public Resource Regulations are lawful as they fall squarely within the Department's statutory authorities and constitutional duties. The Chapter 78a Regulations were properly promulgated in accordance with the regulatory review process set forth in the Review Act; the Commonwealth Attorneys Act;\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Commonwealth Documents Law (Documents Law);\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Sections 1917-A and 1920-A of the Administrative Code of 1929.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   46 Pa. B. 6432 (2016). Therefore, the regulations have an extremely strong presumption of validity, which the Coalition's claims do not overcome. Most importantly, the Public Resource Regulations do not change the Department's powers to issue, condition, or deny permits. These regulations simply put more information before the Department as it considers the possible impacts of unconventional natural gas well development upon public natural resources. It is not unlawful to ask an applicant to provide more information so that the Department can accurately assess the potential impacts of the well development\n   on public resources. Section 3215(c) of Act 13 authorizes the Department to condition well permits to minimize impact to public resources. The Coalition's characterization of\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   is incorrect.\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   merely limited, but did not negate, the Department's authority under Section 3215(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Agencies further assert that the Public Resource Regulations are not unconstitutionally vague because they provide ample criteria to guide the Department in developing appropriate permit conditions. The Public Resource Regulations establish criteria for the Department to consider the potential impacts of drilling a proposed unconventional well on surrounding public resources and to evaluate and condition permits accordingly; require applicants to notify public resource agencies of potential impacts; and provide public resource agencies the opportunity to comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, the Agencies assert that the Coalition has offered no evidence or legal argument in support of its claim that the RAF is insufficient with respect to the cost of compliance with the Public Resource Regulations. The Review Act does not authorize a challenge to the review conducted by the Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

We explained that by using this language of limitation, the Supreme Court only intended to enjoin these provisions in connection to the water source and waiver setback provisions in\n   Section 3215(b), which the Court declared unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In practice, this means that when [the Department] considers the impact of a proposed well\" on public resources, \"it is not constrained to do so 'in accordance with' enjoined Section 3215(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 829-30.

Rather, it just curtailed it with respect to water source and waiver setback provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Section 3215(c), to the extent it does not implicate Section 3215(b), remains a viable source of statutory authority for the Public Resource Regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In addition, Sections 3211 and 3212 of Act 13 provide express requirements for well permit applicants to provide notice to certain enumerated parties and objection opportunities for a subset of such parties. Section 3211 of Act 13 provides detailed instructions related to well permits, including the information to be provided in a well permit application, a specific list of persons to whom the plat must be mailed, and the nature of this third-party notification. The General Assembly revised several subsections in Act 13 to include specific direction regarding notice of well permit applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 3211(a) (revised to include permits to operate abandoned or orphan wells), (b) (revised to require additional information in the permit application, including a list of municipalities adjacent to the well site and water supply owners within 3,000 feet of an unconventional well bore, and that plats be forwarded to an expanded list of persons in an expanded geographic area for unconventional oil and gas operations), and (b.2) (directing revisions to the well permit application form). In addition, Section 3211(e) of Act 13 requires the Department to issue well permits within 45 days of submission unless it denies the permit application for one of the express reasons set forth in subsection 3211(e.1). 58 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3211(e). Section 3212.1 of Act 13 defines who may comment on or object to a well permit application. 58 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3212.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   With this statutory authority in mind, we examine the Coalition's challenge to the pre-permit process that requires well applicants to provide information to the Department in the well permit applications and notice to applicable public resource agencies, and sets forth the information the Department will consider prior to conditioning a well permit based on impacts to public resources. 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 75a.15(f), (g). Act 13 requires the Department to consider the impact of proposed wells on various public resources when making a determination on a well permit. 58 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3215(c). To do this, the Department must have information at its disposal. Act 13 does not restrict how the Department should gather the information necessary to consider the impacts on public resources. Well applicants and public resource agencies have the knowledge and expertise about the public resources in the vicinity of the proposed well, the functions and uses of those public resources, and how those functions and uses may be impacted by drilling unconventional wells.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.15. Soliciting information from the well applicant and public resource agencies for consideration furthers the purpose of Act 13.

Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Next, the Coalition contends that Section 78a.15(f)(1)(iv)'s requirement to identify and provide information concerning \"other critical communities\" as defined in Section 78a.1 is unlawful and unenforceable. The term \"other critical communities,\" which was in the predecessor to Act 13, remained unchanged and undefined in Act 13. The regulations now define \"other critical communities,\" for the first time, to include any \"species of special concern\" as identified on a PNDI receipt. 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.1. The phrase \"species of special concern\" is not contained within or authorized by Act 13. The special concern species provisions bypass the Documents Law's formal notice and comment rulemaking process. In addition, the special concern species provisions violate the prohibition against special laws contained in Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Documents Law. Finally, the Coalition asserts that the Agencies lack jurisdiction over species of special concern; the PNDI receipt is managed by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), not by the Agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Agencies respond that the broad scope of Act 13 supports protection of species of special concern. Section 3215(c) clearly intends to include more than simply \"threatened\" species. The term \"threatened\" has a particular legal meaning. The General Assembly chose not to use that term in Section 3215, and instead opted for the more expansive term of \"other critical communities.\" To conclude otherwise treats the phrase \"other critical communities\" as mere surplusage, which is contrary to the principles of statutory interpretation. Moreover, the regulatory definition of \"other critical communities\" manifests the Department's past practices and policies and codifies the process used prior to the adoption of the regulation. Defining \"other critical communities\" as \"species of special concern\" does not create a special law prohibited by Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Contrary to the Coalition's assertions, the Public Resource Regulations do not treat the unconventional gas industry as a special class,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the only earth-disturbance industry for which the Department considers impacts upon species other than those that are threatened or endangered. Other regulatory programs protect special concern species beyond those classified as threatened and endangered. Further, \"species of special concern\" does not violate the Documents Law because the General Assembly intended no such restraint on the consideration of public resources. Finally, although the Agencies may lack jurisdiction over the species of special concern, the Agencies are constitutionally and statutorily charged with protecting public resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Under the Agencies' interpretation, the Department must consider impacts to rare and endangered species and species of \"special concern,\" but not \"threatened\" species. Such an interpretation is illogical and seems contrary to the intention of the General Assembly to protect\n   <em>\n    at risk\n   </em>\n   species.

The Coalition claims that common areas of a school's property and playgrounds are not of the same kind or class of public resources contained in the statutory list because these areas may be located on private property. Private property is not a \"public resource\" of the Commonwealth. In addition, the definition of school is so broad that virtually any institution qualifies, including career and technical centers, community colleges, driver training schools, and theological seminaries. The Coalition asserts that the number of qualifying resources is \"unlimited, unknown and unknowable,\" rendering the regulation overly broad and unenforceable. Petitioner's Brief at 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The Coalition further contends that the term \"playground\" suffers from the same flaws. Under the regulatory definition, even a playground at a McDonald's restaurant qualifies as a \"public resource\" if it includes an outdoor area provided to the general public for recreational purposes. The definition would also include community playgrounds, like a homeowners' association area that is open to the public. Both regulatory definitions include thousands of private properties owned by private entities that are not \"public resources\" as contemplated by the constitution or Act 13. Surely, this is not what the General Assembly envisioned as \"public resources\" in Section 3215(c) of Act 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The Agencies respond that \"common areas of a school's property or playground\" are of the same class or nature as the items listed in Section 3215(c). The inclusion of these areas is appropriate because they are used in a manner similar to how the general public uses publicly owned parks. These areas are only considered if the general public has access to them for recreational purposes. The Coalition's argument that common areas of a school's property or playgrounds cannot be public resources because they are privately owned property misses the mark. Many of the public resources included in Act 13 are, in fact, located on privately owned property. As for the Coalition's argument that the number of such resources is \"unknown or unknowable\" and not compiled on any known list, a list is not necessary because these resources are visually identifiable. A permit applicant need only look 200 feet from its proposed limit of disturbance to see whether a neighboring feature may fit the definition of a playground or common area of a school that is open to the public. Any argument that doing this is burdensome is simply ludicrous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission identifies threatened, endangered and at-risk wildlife species. DCNR maintains a list of rare, threatened and endangered plants. DCNR also maintains a list of historical and archaeological sites listed on the Federal or State list of historic places. The Department provides a Pennsylvania Conservation Explorer's online planning tool,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   which allows operators to identify the location of the majority of public resources listed in Act 13.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   46 Pa.

There is also a National Register of Historic Places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Public Resource Regulations expand the list by creating a new class of \"public resources.\" The regulation includes the places identified in the statute, but it\n   adds \"common areas of a school's property\" and \"playgrounds\" to the list of \"public resources.\" 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.15(f)(1). The regulation requires well applicants to identify and provide information on \"common areas of a school's property\" and \"playgrounds\" located within 200 feet of the proposed well location in addition to the other listed \"public resources.\" 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.15(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Section 78a.1 defines \"common areas of a school's property\" as \"[a]n area on a school's property accessible to the general public for recreational purposes. For the purposes of this definition, a school is a facility providing elementary, secondary or postsecondary educational services.\" 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.1. According to the Department's interpretation, the term \"school\" is a \"facility providing elementary, secondary, or postsecondary educational services\" that has \"outdoor facilities accessible to the general public for recreational purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner's Brief, Appendix G at No. 15 (Department's Response to the Coalition's First Set of Interrogatories). The regulation defines \"playground\" as \"(i) An outdoor area provided to the general public for recreational purposes. (ii) The term includes community-operated recreational facilities.\" 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The Coalition contends that these definitions exceed the scope of the statute by including purely private places that do not constitute public resources and that the regulatory additions to public resources are not of the same class or nature as the statutory items. The Agencies assert that common areas of a school's property and playgrounds share many of the inherent features as publicly-owned parks and forests, or even National or State scenic rivers, that make them public resources worthy of the Department's consideration in the permitting process. Respondents' Brief at 22. According to the Agencies, common areas of a school's property and playgrounds are used by the general public for recreational purposes in a manner similar to how the general public uses publicly owned parks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. In other words, any area that the general public has access to for recreational purposes is a public resource that must be identified on a well permit application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As the Agencies further explain, the definitions of \"common areas of a school's property\" and \"playground\" make it clear that the impact on these areas is to be considered only when the general public has open access to them for recreational purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Although common areas of a school's property and playgrounds may share some similarities with the public resources listed in Section 3215(c), we agree with the Coalition that they are not within the \"same general class or nature as\" their statutory counterparts. With regard to schools, virtually any school would fall within the definition of \"school,\" such as career and technical centers, culinary schools, charter schools, community colleges, private-licensed school, driver-training school, vocational schools, etc. The list is seemingly endless as any institution providing some form of educational services would ostensibly qualify as a \"school\" under the regulatory definition. As for the recreational aspect, a mere picnic table and bench or basketball hoop accessible to the public would bring the school's property within the purview of the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   As for playgrounds, again the definition is so broad as to defy quantification and compliance. The definition embraces publicly and privately owned \"playgrounds.\" It obviously includes children's playgrounds, sports fields, and picnic sites. However, it also includes virtually any area open to the public for recreational purposes, including commercial enterprises, such as shopping centers, movie theaters, sports stadiums,\n   amusement parks, and golf courses. Even a playground adjoining a McDonald's eatery would qualify as a \"public resource\" under the regulation. The sheer diversity of these resources renders the regulation unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Unlike the public resources listed in Section 3215(c) of Act 13, the regulations' proffered additions are not readily identifiable. The Department does not maintain a count or list of \"schools\" or \"playgrounds\" within the Commonwealth. The Pennsylvania Conservation Explorer's online planning tool does not include common areas of a school's property or playgrounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Commonwealth Court Preliminary Injunction Hearing, Stipulated Hearing Exhibit No. 2 at 86 (\"the tool may not have data to identify all the public resources listed in Section 78a.15(f)(1), operators will need to conduct a field survey ... to identify public resources. This field survey will likely include identification of schools and playgrounds 200 feet from the limit of disturbance of the well site.\"). The Agencies assert that the use of lists or databases provides reasonable and appropriate processes to identify public resources where the resource itself would not otherwise be visually identifiable. Respondents' Brief at 26. According to the Agencies, a permit applicant need only look 200 feet from its proposed limit of disturbance to see whether a neighboring feature may fit the definition of a common area of a school or a playground that is open to the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   However, not all outdoor areas used for recreational purposes bear readily identifiable hallmarks such as jungle gyms, picnic tables, or swing sets. For example, it is not uncommon for school parking lots to serve as playgrounds at recess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felger v.

In addition, \"open space lands used for outdoor recreation or the enjoyment of scenic or natural beauty and open to the public for such use\" enrolled for preferential tax treatment under the Pennsylvania Farmland and Forest Land Assessment Act of 1974, commonly known as the Clean and Green Act (Clean and Green Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   would certainly qualify as a \"playground\" under the Public Resource Regulations, but may not be visually identifiable as recreational space.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 2 of the Clean and Green Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5490.2 (defining agricultural reserve and recreational activity\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Section 3 of the Clean and Green Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5490.3 (permitting enrollment of ten contiguous acres of land devoted to \"agricultural reserve\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Upon review, the regulatory definitions of the terms \"common areas of a school's property\" and \"playground\" are vague, overly broad, and unpredictable thereby making compliance unduly burdensome. \"Common areas of a school's property\" or \"playgrounds\" do not share the same attributes as the other public resources identified in the statute because they do not implicate public interest in the same way. In other words, a McDonald's playground or a school parking lot utilized as a playground are not of the same class or nature as a scenic river, public park, or historical site warranting Commonwealth\n   trustee protection. Although common areas of a school's property and playgrounds may share some recreational similarities with the statutory public resources, they do not implicate \"public interest\" in the same way and they are not part of the trust corpus over which the Commonwealth is charged with protecting under the Constitution. For these reasons, we declare that the regulatory definition of public resources to the extent it includes \"common areas of a school's property\" and \"playground\" is void and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    E. \"Public Resource Agencies\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Finally, the Coalition challenges the provisions of Section 78a.15(f)(2) and (g) related to \"public resource agencies\" and the definition of \"public resource agency\" in Section 78a.1 as unlawful and unenforceable. The Coalition maintains that, in\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court enjoined the Department's authority to consider comments of municipalities in the well permit process by declaring Section 3215(d) unconstitutional. Moreover, the Coalition claims that allowing municipalities to comment on well locations in the permit process circumvents due process rights of oil and gas owners. The Department cannot grant powers to municipalities that no statute provides. To do so would allow municipalities to condition permits beyond their authority under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In addition, the Coalition asserts that the addition of \"playground owners\" as \"public resource agencies\" is not only contrary to Pennsylvania law defining the term \"agency,\" but is impractical and unworkable. An \"agency\" refers to a government agency, not private entities. The inclusion of playground owners as public resource agencies is patently unreasonable. Public resources are governed by singular public government agencies, such as the Pennsylvania Game Commission or the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, which can be easily identified and notified as appropriate during the well permit process. The inclusion of playground owners improperly adds thousands of unknown, unidentified, unlisted private entities as public resource agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   The Agencies respond that, although the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   declared Section 3215(d) unconstitutional,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344715,7264422\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/83/901/\">\n    83 A.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it did so because the statutory provision provided that the Department \"may\" consider comments and recommendations submitted by public resource agencies at its discretion. The Supreme Court found that this had the effect of marginalizing local input. Section 78a.15(g) of the Chapter 78a Regulations succeeds where Section 3215(d) of Act 13 failed by providing that the Department \"will\" consider such comments. Therefore, the Coalition's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Robinson II\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The Agencies further respond that the Public Resource Regulations do not violate due process. The Public Resource Regulations do not grant any powers to municipalities or allow them to exercise any authority in conditioning a permit. It merely authorizes the Department to consider their comments. The power to condition a permit lies solely with the Department. Its decisions are appealable to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   As for the Coalition's challenge to the definition, the Agencies defend that \"public resource agency\" is a term of art used for purposes of the Chapter 78a Regulations that does not conflict with any definition elsewhere in Pennsylvania law. The Coalition incorrectly focuses on the usage of the\n   word \"agency\" as defined by the body of administrative law. The term \"agency\" has a specialized purpose within this regulatory framework. The fact that playgrounds may not have one Commonwealth agency responsible for all of them does not render the regulation unreasonable or unworkable. Identifying and notifying the responsible public resource agency is something that can be readily determined on a case-by-case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    Statutory Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Section 78a.15(f) of the Chapter 78a Regulations provides that well applicants must notify public resource agencies responsible for managing the public resources of the application. From the date of notification, the public resource agency has 30 days to provide written comments to the Department regarding its recommendations to avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate probable harmful impacts to the public resource. Section 78a.15(g)(4) of the Chapter 78a Regulations provides that the Department \"\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   consider ... [t]he comments and recommendations submitted by public resource agencies ....\" 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 78a.15(g)(4) (emphasis added).

The result is that Section 3215 fosters decisions regarding the environment and habitability that are non-responsive to local concerns; and, as with the uniformity requirement of Section 3304, the effect of failing to account for local conditions causes a disparate impact upon beneficiaries of the trust. Moreover, insofar as the Department ... is not required, but is merely permitted, to account for local concerns in its permit decisions, Section 3215(d) fails to ensure that any disparate effects are attenuated.

Under the definition, it is unclear which would be the \"public resource agency\" for notification purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Under either interpretation, identifying and notifying the appropriate contact may be impossible, if not extremely burdensome. Unlike the other public resources listed in Section 3215(c), \"playgrounds\" are not governed by singular government agencies that can be easily identified and notified during the well permitting process. A \"playground owner\" may be a corporation, homeowners' association, estate, trust, or private citizen. Even if the playground owner is identified, the point of contact for such private \"owners\" may be unknown, unidentified, or unlisted. Requiring a permit applicant to identify and notify \"playground owners\" is unduly burdensome and unreasonable. And, considering our problem with the regulatory definition of \"common areas of a school's property\" and \"playgrounds,\" as discussed above, the definition of \"public resource agency\" to the extent it includes owners of such recreational areas fails by extension. For these reasons, we conclude that the addition of \"playground owners\" as a public resource agency is unlawful and unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
