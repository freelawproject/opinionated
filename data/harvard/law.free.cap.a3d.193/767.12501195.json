When Mr. Bartel sought to recover the check over a decade later, it had vanished from the safe, both of the McKinleys had died, and neither Mr. Bartel nor the issuing bank had any record of where the check might have gone. Mr. Bartel filed suit against appellee Bank of America Corporation to enforce his claim for the value of the missing check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is Mr. Bartel's second appeal from the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Bank of America. On remand after the first appeal, the trial court granted summary judgment again, finding that Mr. Bartel's claims were barred by laches, that he failed to satisfy two separate statutes governing the enforcement of a lost or stolen cashier's check, and that his sworn declaration of loss was insufficient. Mr. Bartel challenges each of the trial court's findings. We conclude that because Mr. Bartel \"transferred\" the cashier's check when he made it payable to the McKinleys and then left it in their possession, he is now precluded from enforcing his statutory claim for the missing instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the trial court, the parties alleged the following during discovery and in support of their summary judgment filings. In 1994, Richard Bartel purchased a cashier's check in the amount of $30,761.00 from Bank of America's predecessor in interest, NationsBank of Maryland, N.A. The check was payable to \"Dana McKinley or Edna McKinley or Richard Bartel.\" The bank issued the check to Mr. Bartel and shortly after, according to Mr. Bartel, he and Dana McKinley placed the check in the McKinleys' safe. Mr. Bartel intended the check to serve as consideration for a contemplated business transaction with the McKinleys. Specifically, Mr. Bartel hoped that the McKinleys would sell their shares of a company of which Mr. Bartel was a\n   majority shareholder-though he had \"no specific reason to believe they would do so.\" After the McKinleys declined to consummate the hoped-for business transaction, Mr. Bartel left the check with Dana McKinley anyway on the chance that they would come to an agreement later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Bartel has not seen the check since he left it with the McKinleys in 1994. At some point, he reached out to the McKinleys to inquire about the check. According to Mr. Bartel, Dana McKinley informed him that he had not \"touched or moved the check\" but that he had \"seen it on multiple occasions.\" Mr. McKinley added, however, that \"he could not open the safe because he had fumbled a change in the safe combination, or alternatively, that his [g]uardian had changed the combination.\" Mr. McKinley's guardian was appointed in 2008 because Mr. McKinley was suffering from a deteriorating mental illness. Mr. McKinley's mother Edna McKinley died that same year, at which point she was \"blind, over eighty years of age[,] and immobile.\" Although Mr. Bartel alleges that Mr. McKinley told him that he never moved the check, there is no indication in the record that Edna McKinley made any equivalent representation. Mr. Bartel stated in a 2008 email that Rene McKinley, who was Dana McKinley's sister and Edna's daughter, had access to the safe at one point after receiving the combination from a family friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2009, Mr. Bartel filed an action in Florida, where the McKinleys had lived, to obtain possession of the check. When the safe was eventually drilled open, the check was not found inside. Mr. Bartel later learned, from an inventory of Dana's and Edna's estates, that there was no record of a deposit into either of their accounts other than ordinary pension deposits. Mr. Bartel asked Bank of America to run a search for records relating to the check. A representative of the bank responded that there was no record of escheatment to the State of Maryland (where the check was issued) and no record of the check as unclaimed property in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Bartel submitted what he titled a \"declaration of loss\" of the check to Bank of America in 2013, requesting payment. In that declaration, he asserted that no payment of the check had ever occurred and that the original instrument had been lost. He attached a photocopy of the original check, emblazoned with the words \"copy-not negotiable.\" The bank replied that it could not honor his demand for payment. The bank explained that, in conformance with federal law, it maintained records for seven years and was at that point-nineteen years from the date of issuance-unable to locate any information related to the check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after, Mr. Bartel filed a complaint against Bank of America for relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2028%3A3-309\">\n    D.C.

We also left open \"whether dismissal or summary judgment would be appropriate on other grounds not reached by the trial court, including laches as well as other statutory requirements under sections 28:3-309 and 28:3-312.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769574\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1043/#p1047\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, we clarified that we did not decide \"whether, given that the Bank bears the burden on the issue of prior payment, the Bank [could] nevertheless [ ] demonstrate an entitlement to summary judgment on that issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769574\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1043/#p1047\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On remand, the parties again filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court once again granted summary judgment for Bank of America, this time on three independent grounds. The court first found that Bank of America's equitable defense of laches applied because Mr. Bartel had \"failed to exercise reasonable diligence in protecting his rights\" by waiting nineteen years to seek payment from the bank. The court also granted summary judgment because Mr. Bartel had failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for enforcement of a lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2028%3A3-309\">\n    D.C.

Section 28:3-312(a)(3) imposes an obligation on a bank that issues a cashier's check to refund a lost check to a claimant who files, under penalty of perjury, a declaration that says that the declarer lost possession of the check and that the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer. Section 28:3-309 similarly states that the loss of possession cannot be the result of a \"transfer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"An instrument is transferred\n   when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028%3A3-203\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 28:3-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this case, Mr. Bartel purchased a cashier's check and chose to have it made payable to Dana McKinley, Edna McKinley, or himself. He then placed the check in the McKinleys' safe and left it there. The trial court found, and Bank of America emphasizes on appeal, that the moment that Mr. Bartel voluntarily left the check made out to both McKinleys in their possession, he transferred the instrument to them. Mr. Bartel's primary response is that although he did give the McKinleys the check, he did not do so \"for the purpose\" of giving them the right to enforce the instrument. Rather, he gave them the check for safekeeping. For him to have \"transferred\" the check, Mr. Bartel argues, the McKinleys would have needed the lawful right to enforce the check-which he says they never had because he gave them the check only in contemplation of a future negotiation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As named payees on the cashier's check, both of the McKinleys were entitled to enforce the instrument once they had possession.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028%3A3-110\">\n    D.C.

The UCC draws a distinction between the right to enforce an instrument and the ownership of an instrument. As stated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028%3A3-301\">\n    D.C.

Given the facts at hand, however, we interpret \"transfer\" consistent with the primary concern associated with a missing instrument-that the bank not be forced to pay twice,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     A.I.

Having voluntarily given the McKinleys a cashier's check that they could readily enforce or negotiate at any time, Mr. Bartel is no longer in the best position to attest to the fate of the missing instrument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
