On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and improperly rejected his claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Specifically, the petitioner claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing: (1) to take appropriate measures at trial to preclude the introduction of evidence of the petitioner's prior commission of crimes; (2) to take appropriate measures to preclude, or failing to call an expert to challenge, the state's introduction of firearms and ballistics evidence; and (3) to adequately preserve an issue for appellate review. We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth by this court on the petitioner's direct appeal, are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's claims. \"On December 26, 2007, the Southington police went to the apartment of the victim, Thomas Szadkowski, at 81 Academy Street to check on his welfare, as he had not reported to work that day. The\n   police found the victim in his kitchen, lying dead of a gunshot wound. During their search of the victim's\n   apartment, the Southington and state police observed a number of open windows on the screen of the victim's computer. One window depicted an America Online instant message exchange between the [petitioner] and the victim, which took place between approximately 8:45 and 9:45 p.m. on December 24, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The instant message screen revealed that the victim had invited the [petitioner] to his apartment. Another open screen displayed the [petitioner's] photograph and profile. The [petitioner] accepted the invitation and drove to the victim's apartment. After the [petitioner] and the victim engaged in a sexual act, the [petitioner] retrieved a gun from his motor vehicle, returned to the victim's apartment and shot him. When he left the apartment, the [petitioner] took the victim's Xbox 360 game console (Xbox). On December 26, 2007, the [petitioner] gave the Xbox to a former girlfriend, Laurel Brooks, as a gift for her younger brother. The [petitioner] was arrested at his home in New Britain on December 30, 2007. He subsequently signed a written statement and confessed, during a videotaped interview, to having shot the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" (Footnote in original.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777990\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/139/99/#p100\">\n    139 Conn.

In a substitute long form information, the state charged the petitioner with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, felony murder in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). After a trial, the jury found the petitioner guilty of all three counts. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Espinosa, J.\n   </em>\n   , merged the felony murder conviction into the murder conviction and sentenced the petitioner to a total effective sentence of seventy years incarceration on the murder and robbery charges.

Specifically, as summarized by the habeas court in its memorandum of decision, the petitioner claimed that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by \"failing to object, exclude, or move to limit the use of testimony elicited from the petitioner on cross-examination and from Laurel Brooks, in the state's rebuttal, regarding whether the petitioner had acknowledged to Brooks having committed robberies in the past ... failing to object, exclude, or move to limit the use of evidence pertaining to the petitioner's possession of a .223 caliber [AR-15] Bushmaster assault rifle seized incident to his arrest ... failing to present testimony from a firearms expert to prove that [the] Bushmaster rifle was\n   not the murder weapon; and ... failing to investigate adequately the possibility that Richard Diaz was the real culprit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A trial commenced before the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.\n   </em>\n   , on October 3, 2016. The court heard testimony from Lieutenant Joseph Rainone, a Waterbury police officer who testified at the petitioner's criminal trial as\n   a firearms expert for the state; Dr. Albert Harper, a firearms expert; Attorneys Eddy and Simon; Diaz; Carmen Baez, an investigator for the Office of the Public Defender; Attorney Sebastian DeSantis, a Connecticut criminal defense attorney; and the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After trial, in a written memorandum of decision dated October 13, 2016, the habeas court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court determined that the petitioner had failed to establish that trial counsel's claimed errors prejudiced him. The petitioner then filed a petition for certification to appeal, which the habeas court denied. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Faced with a habeas court's denial of a petition for certification to appeal, a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged test enunciated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760025\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/178/\">\n    229 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20601\">\n    640 A.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), and adopted in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763418\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/608/#p612\">\n    230 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%20126\">\n    646 A.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

He first claims that trial counsel was ineffective in \"failing to take appropriate measures to preclude the admission of the highly prejudicial evidence of Mr. Mercado's prior commission of crimes.\" Specifically, he argues that trial counsel \"did not adequately object\" when the state elicited testimony from the petitioner at his criminal trial regarding statements he allegedly made to Brooks about committing crimes in the past,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"did not adequately object\" when the state recalled Brooks on rebuttal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The petitioner's second claim is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to take appropriate measures to preclude, or failing to call an expert to challenge, the state's introduction of firearms and ballistics evidence. Specifically, he argues that trial counsel did not \"take appropriate measures to preclude the introduction of highly prejudicial irrelevant evidence, including the .223 caliber AR-15 Bushmaster assault [rifle] seized from [the petitioner's] home, two .22 caliber bullets, and references to a conversion kit which would not have rendered the AR-15 Bushmaster capable of firing .22 caliber bullets.\" He further argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to introduce expert testimony to establish that \"the conversion kit the state alleged Mr. Mercado possessed did not render the .223 caliber AR-15 Bushmaster weapon capable of firing the fatal bullet.\" The petitioner contends that these errors \"provided a basis for the jury to convict the [petitioner] on side issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, and closely related to his first claim, the petitioner claims that by failing to object to the state's\n   recalling of Brooks on rebuttal, trial counsel \"failed to adequately preserve [the] issue for purposes of appellate review.\" He notes that, on direct appeal of his conviction to this court, this court declined to review his claims related to the admission of Brooks' testimony because \"the issue had not been properly preserved by trial [counsel] during the criminal proceeding.\" See footnote 4 of this opinion.

The habeas court rejected the petitioner's argument that but for trial counsel's alleged errors, the outcome of his appeal would have been different. The petitioner, in his brief to this court, argues that he has shown prejudice by pointing to the trial court's \"threshold determination in granting the [petitioner's] motion in limine that the evidence was indeed prejudicial,\" and \"the expert legal testimony introduced at the habeas trial.\" Upon review of the record, however, it is clear that Attorney DeSantis' testimony to which the petitioner refers establishes only that this court did not review the petitioner's claim on direct appeal because it was not preserved for appeal, which is not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A further review of Attorney DeSantis' testimony reveals that he testified only that a reasonably competent attorney would have objected to the state's attempt to ask the petitioner about his \"other crimes\" conversation with Brooks, which, if sustained, would have had the effect of precluding \"other crimes testimony\" from Brooks. He further testified that if the objection were overruled, it would have preserved the record for appeal. At no time did Attorney DeSantis testify that had trial counsel preserved the record for appeal, this court would have reversed the petitioner's conviction. Therefore, in light of the fact that the petitioner has provided no basis from which a court could find a reasonable probability that the result of his appeal\n   would have been different, we agree with the habeas court's finding that the petitioner failed to prove that he was prejudiced by this claimed error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Simply put, even if we were to determine that trial counsel's performance was deficient, in light of our review of the record and the sheer strength of the state's case against the petitioner, we conclude that the petitioner's claim that the result of his criminal proceedings would have been different is highly speculative at best.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner has failed to demonstrate\n   that the issues raised are debatable among jurists of reason, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner, or that the questions deserve encouragement to proceed further. Accordingly, the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \"The [petitioner] filed a motion to suppress his statements claiming that they were the product of police intimidation and coercion and therefore were not voluntary.

He claimed that he used an adapter, which modified the AR-15 to allow it to shoot .22 caliber bullets. At the criminal trial, the unmodified AR-15 was entered into evidence as a full exhibit. The state's firearms expert, Lieutenant Rainone, testified that, in its unmodified condition, the AR-15 was incapable of firing the .22 caliber bullet that killed the victim.

The petitioner presented the testimony of a firearms expert, Dr. Harper, who testified, consistent with Lieutenant Rainone's testimony, that the AR-15 admitted at the petitioner's criminal trial was incapable of firing a .22 caliber bullet. He further testified that even if the AR-15 was modified to fire a .22 caliber bullet, the two bullets recovered from the victim's head and the petitioner's backyard could not have been fired from the AR-15 in the condition in which it was seized, unless the barrel was changed. Dr. Harper testified that, with respect to the issue of the murder weapon, he agreed with Lieutenant Rainone's testimony that the AR-15 seized and entered into evidence at the petitioner's criminal trial did not fire the .22 caliber bullet that killed the victim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    When trial counsel was questioned about the admission of the AR-15 at the petitioner's criminal trial, Attorney Eddy testified that trial counsel engaged a firearms expert, but that expert \"came to the same conclusion as Lieutenant Rainone,\" so trial counsel made the tactical decision to allow the state to introduce the AR-15. This allowed trial counsel to argue to the jury that the gun recovered from the petitioner's home was not the murder weapon, even according to the state's own expert. Attorney Simon testified that trial counsel hired a firearms expert, but that his opinions were \"not particularly helpful.\" He testified that he argued to the jury that the seized AR-15 was not the murder weapon, and that trial counsel thought that such an argument was \"as good as it got\" for the petitioner.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In support of his argument that his counsel's deficient performance prejudiced him, the petitioner repeatedly cites to this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Coccomo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063438\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/115/384/\">\n     115 Conn.
