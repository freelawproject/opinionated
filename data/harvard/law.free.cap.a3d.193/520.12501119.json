(Radiologic Associates), Robert Wolek, Middlesex Hospital,\n   Shoreline Surgical Associates, P.C. (Shoreline), and Eileen Tobin, on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to commence their action within the five year repose period of General Statutes \u00a7 52-555,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this state's wrongful death statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that compliance with that repose provision is a prerequisite to the court's jurisdiction over the action. They further claim that the trial court improperly resolved disputed jurisdictional facts without affording them an opportunity either to engage in limited discovery or to present evidence in connection with their contention that the repose period had been tolled by the continuing course of conduct doctrine or the continuing course of treatment doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although\n   we reject the plaintiffs' jurisdictional claim, we agree with their second claim insofar as the continuing course of conduct doctrine is concerned. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiffs' claims. On November 1, 2007, the decedent was admitted to Middlesex Hospital by her surgeon, Jonathan Blancaflor, an employee of Shoreline, for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. On November 5, 2007, while the decedent was recovering from that surgery, Eileen Tobin, a physician's assistant also employed by Shoreline, ordered an X-ray of the decedent's chest. Robert Wolek, a radiologist employed by Radiologic Associates, which provides radiological services for Middlesex Hospital, interpreted the X-ray and dictated a report of his findings. The report was transcribed at 4:29 p.m. on November 5, 2007, and edited, approved, and electronically signed by Wolek at 10:52 p.m. that same day. In addition to reporting the presence of pulmonary opacities indicative of \"congestive heart failure,\" Wolek also reported the presence of a separate \"1.8 [centimeter] spiculated density in the left upper lung,\" indicative of lung cancer. Wolek recommended that the mass be investigated further by \"[c]orrelation with older studies,\" if available, and by a computerized tomography (CT) scan. Wolek's\n   report indicates that his findings were \"called to the [hospital] floor at the time of the reading.\" A nurse's note in the decedent's hospital file indicates that the decedent's X-ray results were received at approximately 2:30 p.m. on November 5, 2007, and communicated to Tobin at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 12, 2007, Tobin dictated a discharge summary for the decedent's medical file, in which she specifically referenced Wolek's findings regarding the decedent's congestive heart failure but not his diagnosis of a spiculated density in her left lung. Approximately four and one-half years later, on April 6, 2012, a CT scan of the decedent's lungs revealed a large neoplasm in the upper left lobe measuring 5.4 by 4 by 6.6 centimeters. The decedent died from stage IV lung cancer approximately two years later, on June 8, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 7, 2014, the plaintiffs commenced this action, alleging that the decedent's death was the direct result of the defendants' failure, or the failure of their agents or employees, to exercise reasonable care in a number of respects, including but not limited to their continuing failure to notify the decedent about the suspicious mass in her left lung even though they all were aware of the condition. Shortly thereafter, the defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, in which they argued that, because a wrongful death action is a statutorily\n   created right of action that did not exist at common law, the plaintiffs' failure to commence the action within the five year statutory repose period deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Karp\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Urban Redevelopment Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670805\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/162/525/#p529\">\n    162 Conn. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=294%20A.2d%20633\">\n    294 A.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) (\"the general rule [is] that a time limitation on the enforcement of a right, created by statute and not existing at common law, is a part of the right and must be met in order to provide a court with jurisdiction to hear the cause of action\"). Tobin\n   also filed an affidavit in which she stated that she provided no care for the decedent after November 5, 2007, never received a telephone call or any other form of communication from Wolek regarding the results of the decedent's November 5, 2007 X-ray, never was informed by anyone that Wolek had diagnosed a mass in the decedent's lung, and never saw or was provided a copy of Wolek's X-ray report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, the plaintiffs filed a motion for limited discovery in which they asserted, inter alia, that the repose period had been tolled as to all of the defendants in accordance with the continuing course of conduct and continuing course of treatment doctrines. They further asserted that, under\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145932\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/642/\">\n    292 Conn. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    974 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), when a determination of subject matter jurisdiction turns on disputed issues of fact, the case cannot properly be decided on a motion to dismiss unless the plaintiff is afforded an opportunity to establish such facts either via discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Id., at 652,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    974 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[when] a jurisdictional determination is dependent on the resolution of a critical factual dispute, it cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss in the absence of an evidentiary hearing to establish jurisdictional facts\"). The plaintiffs also outlined the discovery that they believed was necessary for them to establish the court's jurisdiction through the application of tolling doctrines. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought to discover, among other things, the name of the person from Wolek's office, if it was not Wolek himself, who called the hospital floor to report the decedent's X-ray results, the name of the person who took that call, and the information that was imparted to him or her during the call. The plaintiffs also sought discovery related to Wolek's and Radiologic Associates' general practices for communicating X-ray results and whether the decedent's X-ray results were ever transferred to the decedent's hospital chart, to\n   Tobin, or to any of the decedent's other health-care providers. Following argument on the plaintiffs' motion for limited discovery, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Domnarski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the motion, explaining that\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Albertsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062182\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/114/600/#p608\">\n    114 Conn.

The plaintiffs also argued that, \"[t]o the extent the court in making this jurisdictional determination considers anything other than the factual allegations contained in the plaintiffs' complaint, the plaintiff[s] [request] an evidentiary hearing to address any critical disputed issues of fact.... At present, the only 'evidentiary' information submitted by the defendants is the self-serving affidavit of [Tobin], which should be discounted in its entirety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Aurigemma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , heard argument on this issue. At that time, Tobin, Shoreline\n   and Middlesex Hospital all argued that the continuing course of conduct doctrine was inapplicable to them because, among other reasons, none of them was aware, prior to the expiration of the repose period, that Wolek had diagnosed a mass in the decedent's left lung. See\n   <em>\n    Grey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stamford Health System, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 282 Conn. at 745, 756,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=924%20A.2d%20831\">\n    924 A.2d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (for continuing course of conduct doctrine to apply, plaintiff must prove that defendant had actual knowledge of plaintiff's need for ongoing treatment or monitoring). For their part, Wolek and Radiologic Associates claimed that Wolek had fulfilled his duty to the decedent by correctly diagnosing the mass and reporting his diagnosis to the hospital floor. Finally, all of the defendants asserted that the continuing course of treatment doctrine was inapplicable because none of them had provided the decedent with ongoing treatment for any identified condition following her discharge from the hospital. See id., at 754,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=924%20A.2d%20831\">\n    924 A.2d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (to establish continuous course of treatment, plaintiff is required to prove, among other things, that she had an identified medical condition requiring ongoing treatment or monitoring and that defendants provided such treatment or monitoring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response, the plaintiffs reiterated their claims that the motions to dismiss must be denied because the limitation period of \u00a7 52-555 does not implicate the court's subject matter jurisdiction and that, even if it does, the allegations of the complaint raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants knew about the mass in the decedent's lung prior to the expiration of the statutory repose period. Specifically, the plaintiffs' counsel argued: \"Factually, this case poses a very interesting scenario. We have, in this case, a chest X-ray that was taken on November 5, 2007. It was interpreted by ... Wolek .... In his radiology report, [he] indicate[d] that he [found], in addition to findings consistent with congestive heart failure...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   a 1.8 centimeter spiculated mass ... suggestive of cancer in the left lung.... [I]n their brief, [Wolek and Radiologic Associates] say not only did [Wolek] identify it but [that] he circled it on the film ... so that other health-care providers, looking at the film, would be able to clearly see what was ... there. In their [brief], they [also] say [that Wolek] was so ... concerned about [the mass] that he wanted to pass [the information] on ... to the [physician's assistant] who [had] ordered the film, and the way he did that was he called down to the [hospital] floor, [and] apparently spoke to a nurse because\n   there's a record [of their conversation] in the chart. I can't tell you who the nurse was [because] I can't read her signature, but that [call occurred at] about 2:30 ... that afternoon. And the nurse, in the [chart], indicates [that she] passed [the information] on ... to ... Tobin. So, [we have] actual knowledge of Wolek, actual knowledge of [the] agent, servant, or employee of the hospital, and actual knowledge of Tobin.... Now, in her self-serving affidavit ... Tobin says, 'nobody told me anything. I didn't know.' ... [As] Wolek ... points out, [however], she had to know because, in the discharge summary ... she indicates ... [that the] X-ray [revealed] ... evidence of congestive heart failure. So, clearly, she was aware of at least some of the findings on the chest X-ray. This is all fodder for the jury. [It] is ... for the jury to decide who knew what and when.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After argument, the trial court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss. As a threshold matter, the court, relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    Ecker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"504648\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/205/219/#p231\">\n    205 Conn. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231-32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=530%20A.2d%201056\">\n    530 A.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), concluded that compliance with the repose provision of \u00a7 52-555 is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit and rejected the plaintiffs' contention to the contrary. The court also agreed with the defendants that the record did not support application of either the continuing course of conduct doctrine or the continuing course of treatment doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to its ruling on the continuing course of treatment doctrine, the court reasoned that the plaintiffs had failed to prove or allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that the defendants had treated or monitored the decedent for any condition following her discharge from the hospital. In addition, the court concluded that the continuing course of conduct doctrine was inapplicable to Wolek and Radiologic Associates because the plaintiffs' claims against them were predicated on Wolek's alleged failure to accurately report his findings to Tobin and Blancaflor. The court further asserted that it was \"undisputed\" that Wolek\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   report his findings to someone on the hospital floor, who, in turn, reported them to Tobin. The court also explained that \"[t]he undisputed fact that ... Wolek reported the findings of his diagnosis to the decedent's treating health-care providers release[s] him [from] any continuing obligation to the decedent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to Tobin and Shoreline, the court determined that the continuing course of conduct doctrine was inapplicable to them because, in her affidavit, Tobin stated that she was not aware, prior to the commencement of the plaintiffs' action, that the X-ray she had ordered for the decedent on November 5, 2007, had revealed a mass in the decedent's left lung. The trial court observed that, although the plaintiffs \"mention[ed] in their memorandum in opposition to the motions to dismiss that they intend[ed] to demand an evidentiary hearing,\" \"they failed to present any evidence at the hearing at which the motions were argued [to rebut Tobin's claims]. The affidavits and records they have presented in opposition to the motion[s] to dismiss do not contain any evidence that Tobin knew about the abnormality in the chest X-ray.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the trial court concluded that the continuing course of conduct doctrine did not apply to Middlesex Hospital because the plaintiffs' claims against the\n   hospital were derivative of their claims against Wolek and Radiologic Associates, which the court had dismissed, and, because, in the court's view, \"[i]t would be virtually impossible for any hospital to be free from protracted and unknown liability if at any time a former patient with whom the hospital has no ongoing relationship could extend the limitations period by virtue\n   of a claim that the hospital failed to send a patient's [X-ray] report\" to the patient's physicians. After the court granted the motions to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed a timely motion to reargue, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court (1) incorrectly concluded that the repose period of \u00a7 52-555 is subject matter jurisdictional, (2) improperly denied their motion for limited discovery, (3) improperly failed to construe the complaint in the light most favorable to them, (4) misidentified disputed facts as undisputed, and (5) improperly resolved disputed jurisdictional facts without conducting an evidentiary hearing, as required by\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145932\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/642/\">\n    292 Conn. at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    974 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs further contend that, in dismissing their claims against Middlesex Hospital, the trial court addressed only those claims that were derivative of their claims against Wolek and Radiologic Associates and failed to address the plaintiffs' direct liability claims against the hospital predicated on the hospital nurse's failure to accurately report Wolek's findings to Tobin and Blancaflor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendants maintain that the trial court correctly concluded that the failure to comply with the repose period of \u00a7 52-555 deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the present action and that the undisputed facts do not support application of either the continuing course of conduct doctrine or the continuing course of treatment doctrine. Some of the defendants also argue, for the first time on appeal, that the tolling doctrines on which the plaintiffs rely do not apply to\n   \u00a7 52-555. Those same defendants also argue that the plaintiffs waived the right to an evidentiary hearing by failing to request one prior to the trial court's ruling on the motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the reasons set forth hereinafter, we agree with the defendants that the trial court correctly determined that noncompliance with the repose provision of \u00a7 52-555 deprives a trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the present action. We further conclude that the continuing course of conduct and continuing course of treatment doctrines are properly pleaded in avoidance of that statute. We then reject the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs failed to preserve their claim for an evidentiary hearing. Finally, although we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the record in the present case does not support application of the continuing course of treatment doctrine, we agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court improperly denied the plaintiffs' request to conduct limited discovery or for an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts related to their claim that the repose period was tolled by the continuing course of conduct doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth the legal principles that govern our review of the plaintiffs' claims. \"A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... When a ... court decides a ... question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light....

We agree with the plaintiffs with respect to the continuing course of conduct doctrine but disagree that the trial court incorrectly resolved their claims under the continuing course of treatment doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs' claim, however, we briefly address the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs waived the right to an evidentiary hearing by failing to request one in a timely manner. As we previously indicated, the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, observed that the plaintiffs had failed to present evidence in support of their tolling claims, stating in relevant part: \"[The plaintiffs] mention in their memorandum in opposition to the motions to dismiss that they intend to demand an evidentiary hearing. However, they failed to present any evidence at the hearing at which the motions were argued.\" As the plaintiffs have explained, however, the trial court appears to have misread their opposing memorandum because they actually stated therein: \"To the extent the court in making this jurisdictional determination considers anything other than the factual allegations contained in the plaintiffs' complaint, the plaintiff[s] request an evidentiary hearing to address any critical disputed issues of fact.\" Thus, contrary to the trial court's determination, the plaintiffs did not request an evidentiary hearing prior to oral argument; rather, it was the plaintiffs' position that their complaint alone was sufficient to establish the court's jurisdiction but that a hearing would be necessary if the court did not agree. As the plaintiffs maintain, \"[i]t was the court, not the plaintiffs, who would [have] know[n] if that eventuality was to occur.\" We note, moreover, as we previously indicated, that the plaintiffs brought this apparent misunderstanding to the trial court's attention in their motion to reargue, which the trial court summarily denied. In light of this procedural history, we are persuaded that the plaintiffs' claim for an evidentiary hearing is preserved. But, even if it were not, the defendants do not dispute that the plaintiffs' challenge to the trial court's denial of their motion for limited discovery is preserved. As we previously indicated, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Domnarski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the plaintiffs' discovery motion on the basis of its conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Albertsen\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062182\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/114/600/#p608\">\n    114 Conn.

We turn, therefore, to the merits of the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court improperly denied both\n   their request for limited discovery and their request for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We previously have explained that \"[t]rial courts addressing motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction ... may encounter different situations, depending on the status of the record in the case.... [L]ack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found in any one of three instances: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court's resolution of disputed facts....

In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"In contrast, if the complaint is supplemented by undisputed facts established by affidavits submitted in support of the motion to dismiss ... the trial court,\n   in determining the jurisdictional issue, may consider these supplementary undisputed facts and need not conclusively presume the validity of the allegations of the complaint.... Rather, those allegations are tempered by the light shed on them by the [supplementary undisputed facts].... If affidavits and/or other evidence submitted in support of a defendant's motion to dismiss conclusively establish that jurisdiction is lacking, and the plaintiff fails to undermine this conclusion with counteraffidavits ... or other evidence, the trial court may dismiss the action without further proceedings.... If, however, the defendant submits either no proof to rebut the plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations ... or only evidence that fails to call those allegations into question ... the plaintiff need not supply counteraffidavits or other evidence to support the complaint ... but may rest on the jurisdictional allegations therein....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Finally, [when] a jurisdictional determination is dependent on the resolution of a critical factual dispute, it cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss in the absence of an evidentiary hearing to establish jurisdictional facts.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H.N.S.

As we have indicated, the policy underlying the continuous [course of]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   treatment doctrine is to allow the plaintiff to complete treatment for an existing condition with the defendant and to protect the physician-patient relationship during that period. Accordingly, when the plaintiff had no knowledge of a medical condition and, therefore, had no reason to expect ongoing treatment for it from the defendant, there is no reason to apply the doctrine.... In contrast, under the continuing course of conduct doctrine, if the defendant had reason to know that the plaintiff required ongoing treatment or monitoring for a particular condition, then the defendant may have had a continuing duty to warn the plaintiff or to monitor the condition, and the continuing breach of that duty tolls the statute of limitations, regardless of whether the plaintiff had knowledge of any reason to seek further treatment.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted.) Id., at 755-56,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=924%20A.2d%20831\">\n    924 A.2d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Application of these principles to the present facts leads us to conclude that the plaintiffs cannot prevail under the continuing course of treatment doctrine because, in addition to the reasons cited by the trial court, it is undisputed that the decedent was never advised by any of the defendants that Wolek had diagnosed a suspicious mass in her left lung. Never having been advised about the mass, the decedent could not possibly have expected the defendants to provide ongoing treatment for it, and the plaintiffs do not claim that the defendants provided any such treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Whether the plaintiffs can prevail under the continuing course of conduct doctrine is a different matter, however, and one that the trial court properly could not resolve without conducting an evidentiary hearing or allowing the plaintiffs to conduct limited discovery directed toward establishing the court's jurisdiction. Indeed, the present case is precisely the sort of case we had in mind in\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   when we observed that \"the question of jurisdiction [may be so] intertwined with\n   the merits of the case ... [that] a court cannot resolve the jurisdictional question without a hearing to evaluate those merits\";\n   <em>\n    Conboy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145932\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/642/\">\n    292 Conn. at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    974 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; or \"until the parties complete further discovery or, if necessary [and appropriate], a full trial on the merits has occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 653 n.16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20669\">\n    974 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so because the issues of whether the court has jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims and whether the plaintiffs ultimately can prevail on those claims appear to turn on the same question: did the defendants know about the suspicious mass in the decedent's lung prior to the expiration of the statute of repose? Contrary to the determination of the trial court, the facts that may illuminate the answer to that question are very much in dispute. For example, as the plaintiffs argued in the trial court, although Tobin's affidavit states that she was never informed about the mass, a nurse's note in the decedent's hospital file indicates otherwise. Similarly, although Middlesex Hospital argues that there is no evidence that any of its employees were ever informed about the mass, that same nurse's note appears to contradict this claim because it states that the decedent's X-ray results were communicated to Tobin at 2:30 p.m. on November 5, 2007. In light of this evidence, we agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court's finding that there was no evidence in the record that Tobin knew about the decedent's abnormal chest X-ray is simply incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We also agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court's findings with respect to Tobin and Wolek are irreconcilable and further indication of the need for an evidentiary hearing or limited discovery, at the least, to determine jurisdictional facts. As we previously indicated, the trial court concluded that the continuing course of conduct doctrine was inapplicable to Tobin because it was undisputed that Tobin was never informed about the mass. At the same time, the trial court concluded that the doctrine was inapplicable to Wolek because it was\n   undisputed that Wolek had communicated the decedent's X-ray results to Tobin. Having reviewed the entire record, we agree with the plaintiffs that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   facts that were undisputed in the trial court are that Wolek diagnosed the decedent with congestive heart failure and a mass in her left lung, Wolek wrote in his report that his findings were \"called to the [hospital] floor at the time of the reading,\" and a note in the decedent's hospital file indicates that the decedent's X-ray results were reported to Tobin at approximately 2:30 p.m. It is also undisputed that Tobin, under Blancaflor's supervision, prescribed \"Lasix 20 mg IV\" to treat a condition or conditions relating to the decedent's congestive heart failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   What is very much in dispute, however, and what the plaintiffs have a right to explore by whichever method the trial court deems appropriate, that is, limited discovery or an evidentiary hearing, is the identity of the hospital employee who spoke to Wolek when he called the hospital floor at the time of the reading, the information that Wolek may have imparted to that individual, and the information that that individual, in turn, may have imparted to Tobin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs also must be permitted to explore whether the decedent's X-ray or Wolek's X-ray report was ever sent to any of decedent's health-care providers and, if so, when and to whom it was sent. In short, the plaintiffs have a right to\n   request from the defendants any information that bears directly on the question of what the defendants knew with respect to the decedent's November 5, 2007 chest X-ray and, of course, when they knew it.\n   The judgment in Docket No. SC 19619 is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; the appeal in Docket No. SC 19749 is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 provides in relevant part: \"(a) In any action surviving to or brought by an executor or administrator for injuries resulting in death, whether instantaneous or otherwise, such executor or administrator may recover from the party legally at fault for such injuries just damages together with the cost of reasonably necessary medical, hospital and nursing services, and including funeral expenses, provided no action shall be brought to recover such damages and disbursements but within two years from the date of death, and except that no such action may be brought more than five years from the date of the act or omission complained of....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    This court has long recognized that, in certain circumstances, a statute of limitations may be tolled under the continuous course of treatment or the continuing course of conduct doctrine, thereby extending the time within which the plaintiff must commence his or her action.
