In their appeal\n   from the Law Division's April 13, 2017 order dismissing their action against defendants Virtua - West Jersey Health System, Inc. (Virtua) (improperly pled as Virtua Health System and Virtua Voorhees\n   Hospital), Robert Gribbon, R.N. and Helen Curran, R.N., plaintiffs contend that the common knowledge exception applied because the nurses failed to take any action when a tube that was properly inserted into Linda,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in accordance with a physician's order, became dislodged.

Plaintiffs' October 6, 2016 filing of their \"medical malpractice complaint\" arose from the treatment Linda received after being admitted to Virtua on October 17, 2014, where she underwent diagnostic testing that revealed \"multiple gall stones[,]\" \"a small bowel obstruction and mild dilation of the bile ducts.\" She was diagnosed with \"acute cholecystitis [,]\" a doctor performed a procedure to remove her gallstones, and a\n   physician's order was written requiring that a nasogastric (NG) tube be inserted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the physician's order, a nurse inserted the NG tube. The order did not address reinsertion of the tube if it fell out or was otherwise removed. According to hospital records, Linda pulled out the tube less than two days later and \"refused replacement[.]\" Plaintiffs allege the nurses did not reinsert the tube nor did they contact anyone for instructions, including the physician who ordered the NG tube. Linda subsequently underwent surgery for a bowel obstruction and by the time she was discharged from the hospital, she was diagnosed with twelve different medical conditions. Afterward, Linda suffered various post-operative complications that she claims resulted from defendants' \"fail[ure] to comply with the order ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint specifically alleged that \"defendants failed to comply with the order [for the NG tube] and while the NG tube was out, [Linda] aspirated and significantly deteriorated.\" Identifying defendants' negligence, the complaint alleged that it included \"failure to properly treat ... diagnose ... [and] monitor [Linda] ....\" It also alleged \"[d]efendants failed in their duty to plaintiff including failing to properly care for [her,] follow policies and procedures and ... to notify proper medical personnel and obtain proper consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants filed an answer to the complaint on November 22, 2016, and on March 23, 2017, they filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based upon plaintiffs' failure to serve an AOM. Plaintiffs submitted their attorney's certification in opposition to the motion\n   that explained, \"[p]laintiffs have not provided an [AOM] as [they] believe that this matter presents a common knowledge case\" that relieved them of the obligation to serve an AOM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 13, 2017, the motion judge considered the parties' oral arguments and entered her order granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In her statement of reasons placed on the record on that date, the judge addressed plaintiffs' contention that the common knowledge exception applied and their reliance upon the Supreme Court's opinions in\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Estate of Chin\n   </em>\n   to support their argument that an AOM was not required in this case. The judge acknowledged that under the exception, an AOM is not required where a \"jur[or]'s common knowledge as a lay person is sufficient to enable them to use\n   ordinary understanding and experience to determine a defendant's negligence, without the benefit of the specialized knowledge of an expert.\" The judge noted, however that\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   suggested it was still in a plaintiff's interest to serve an AOM to \"prevent the risk of a dismissal if the plaintiff is unsuccessful in persuading the court that an expert is not necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The motion judge also observed that plaintiffs' claim in this case was similar to the claim made in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Chin\n   </em>\n   that \"involved the improper connection of a tube to a hysteroscope\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   used during a procedure which permitted nitrogen to enter the plaintiff's uterus.\" According to the judge, in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Chin\n   </em>\n   , the common knowledge exception applied because \"the jury was called [upon] to determine who did what with the tube line rather than with regard to any professional standard of care\" since the only issue was \"who improperly connected the tube ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Comparing the facts in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Chin\n   </em>\n   to plaintiffs' claim here, the judge found that there was \"no dispute that the [NG] tube was ... placed pursuant to the [physician's] order [but] plaintiff claims when the tube was removed that the order was continuing, and\n   there was a continuing obligation to insert the tube.\" Turning to defendant's contentions based on the medical records, the judge found that plaintiff did \"not dispute the accuracy of the[ ] records\" that stated that during the night following the placement of the tube, plaintiff pulled it out and refused to have it replaced. However, she did not consider \"it to be material to the analysis how the tube was removed or whether [Linda] actually refused replacement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judge concluded that\n   <em>\n    Estate of Chin\n   </em>\n   did not apply because plaintiffs did not dispute the fact that the tube was initially inserted in accordance with a physician's order, a fact which the judge found to be \"critical in making this determination.\" According to the judge, the factual circumstances here changed \"this matter from a case where a jury with ordinary knowledge and experience could make a determination ... to a standard of care case that requires expert testimony.\" She concluded, \"a jury cannot make a determination in this case without knowing what ... a nurse [should] do\" when an [NG] tube is inserted pursuant to an order but subsequently comes out. Under these circumstances, the judge held that the common knowledge exception did not apply and an AOM was required because a jury would be called upon not to determine whether the tube was inserted, but what is the standard of care when the NG \"tube comes out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal from the judge's order dismissing their complaint, plaintiffs argue that contrary to the motion judge's conclusion, the \"failure to reinsert ... Linda['s] ... [NG] tube falls within the 'common knowledge' exception to N.J.S.A. 2A:53A-27 [.]\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Whether plaintiff's complaint is exempt from the AOM requirement based on the common knowledge doctrine is a legal issue subject to our de novo review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triarsi v.

Defendants here are alleged to have not taken any action, not even making a telephone call to the attending physician to alert him of the NG tube's dislodgment and to seek further instructions given the circumstances. Applying the purpose of the AMS to these facts, we conclude that a layperson could determine, without expert assistance, that plaintiffs' claim based upon the nurses' failure to take any action when the NG tube became dislodged has merit in light of the fact that a physician ordered that it remain inserted.

It only means that, at this stage, there is no need to \"weed out\" plaintiffs' claim. The preservation of plaintiffs' claim is of course limited to the allegations relating to the nurses' failure to take further action after the NG tube became dislodged.
