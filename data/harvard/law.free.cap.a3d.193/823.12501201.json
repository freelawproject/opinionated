We vacate the suppression order as to the evidence found in Pagnani's jacket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the suppression order as to the evidence found in Pagnani's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In March 2017, Donna Pagnani was indicted by the Androscoggin County grand jury and charged with unlawful furnishing of scheduled drugs, Class C, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1106(1-A)(A) (2017), unlawful possession of scheduled drugs, Class C, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1107-A(1)(B)(1) (2017), unlawful possession of scheduled drugs, Class D, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1107-A(1)(C) (2017), operating after suspension, Class E, 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2412-A(1-A)(D) (2017), and one count of criminal forfeiture, 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 5826 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 3] Pagnani moved to suppress the evidence found during a search of her jacket and her vehicle, arguing that both searches were illegal and that all evidence discovered during those searches should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] A suppression hearing was held on November 7, 2017. The State presented the testimony of one witness: the arresting officer. Additionally, the State entered into evidence the video captured by the camera mounted in the officer's cruiser. On November 17, 2017, the court issued an order containing the following findings, all of which are supported by the record except where specifically noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Around noon on January 17, 2017, an Auburn police officer observed Donna Pagnani driving her vehicle away from the Androscoggin County Courthouse. The officer was familiar with Pagnani's \"extensive\" criminal history and believed that her driver's license had recently been suspended. The officer ran a license check on Pagnani but, by the time he received the results of that check-which revealed that Pagnani's driver's license was under suspension and that she had a prior conviction for operating after suspension (OAS)-Pagnani had driven away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] The officer decided to wait for Pagnani near the residence where he believed she lived. After waiting for about two\n   hours in his unmarked police car, the officer observed Pagnani driving toward her home. He activated his blue lights and initiated a traffic stop by following Pagnani's vehicle into the driveway of her residence. As Pagnani got out of her vehicle, the officer approached her and informed her that her license was suspended for failing to pay a fine, to which she replied that it was not. Pagnani provided the officer with her license, registration and insurance documents while trying to contact the Violations Bureau to verify that she had paid the fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The officer then ran another license check and confirmed that Pagnani's license was currently suspended. While the officer and Pagnani were standing in her driveway next to her vehicle, the officer, who knew that Pagnani had a pending drug trafficking case in New Hampshire, asked her about the status of that case. Pagnani told him that the case had been dropped. The officer asked Pagnani if she had any drugs or weapons on her, to which she responded that she did not. The officer then asked Pagnani if she would consent to a search of her vehicle, and she said no. The officer then told Pagnani that she was under arrest for operating after suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Pagnani did not willingly submit to arrest. She continued to tell the officer that she had \"done nothing wrong\" and continued to ask for time to speak with someone at the Violations Bureau. Several times the officer told Pagnani to put the phone down, but she continued to speak with someone on her phone and started to walk away from her vehicle. The officer advised Pagnani not to move away from him, but she walked away from the officer and toward the porch of her home. Once on the porch, Pagnani removed her jacket, placed it on the seat of a chair on the porch, and sat in the chair. Pagnani was wearing a sleeveless top. The temperature was 34 degrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The officer called for backup. When the responding officers arrived, they helped place Pagnani in handcuffs and put her into the back of the arresting officer's vehicle. Pagnani asked what she was being arrested for and was told that she was being arrested for OAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] After Pagnani was placed in handcuffs by the responding officers, the arresting officer picked up Pagnani's jacket from the chair and searched it. Specifically, the officer testified that, as another officer \"was walking Ms. Pagnani to my vehicle, I then searched the jacket that she had taken off ....\" The video of the incident shows the officer searching Pagnani's jacket almost immediately after she was handcuffed and removed from the porch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the jacket the officer found a small loose rock, which, based on his experience, training, and education, he believed was cocaine base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The officer then attempted to open Pagnani's car, but it was locked. The\n   officer asked one of the responding officers if Pagnani had the keys to her car in her hand, which she did. He advised the responding officers that he had found cocaine base in her jacket and was going to \"toss the car.\" The responding officers physically removed the keys from Pagnani's hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The officer then searched the vehicle and found a sandwich bag containing five smaller bags of a brown powder. The officer believed that the substance in the bags was heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Based on these findings, the court granted Pagnani's motion to suppress the evidence found during the search of her jacket and vehicle. The State, with the approval of the Attorney General, filed a timely notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115-A(1), (5) (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 21(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Search of the Jacket Incident to Arrest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 14] The State argues that, contrary to the court's determination, the officer's search of Pagnani's jacket was a lawful search incident to arrest because she was wearing the jacket at the time she was placed under arrest. When reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the factual findings made by the court for clear error and we review issues of law and the court's ultimate determination of whether the evidence should be suppressed de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The first question we must address, therefore, is whether the search of Pagnani's jacket was proper as a search \"incident\" to her arrest. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , \"the extent to which officers may search property found on or near the arrestee\" has been debated for nearly as long as the exception has been recognized.\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2482\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2482-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 16] The facts in this case are particularly analogous to those in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   . There, an officer on patrol spotted an individual, Robinson, driving a vehicle; the officer had reason to believe that Robinson's license to drive was suspended and confirmed that his license to drive was suspended; the officer conducted a traffic stop and arrested Robinson for driving while suspended; a post-arrest search of Robinson's coat led to discovery of a package containing illegal drugs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    414 U.S. at 220-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    94 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, however, Pagnani was wearing her jacket when advised that she was under arrest, but she removed her jacket and sat on it before she was taken into physical custody. Pagnani argues that, because she was no longer wearing the jacket at the time she was handcuffed, the warrantless search of her jacket was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 19] The holding in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   that, incident to a lawful arrest, police may, without a warrant, search an arrestee's person and items immediately associated with the person,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and seize weapons, items of contraband, or evidence of a crime found in the search, was reaffirmed in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2482\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2482-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pagnani had been wearing the jacket but tossed it on a porch chair while she was on her cell phone with the Violations Bureau to try to get information about the matter being investigated. A bit later, she sat down on the chair where she had put the jacket. She was then placed under custodial arrest. Even before the officer initiated the search, however, Pagnani was handcuffed with her arms secured behind her, and two other officers were leading her down the porch stairs\n   <em>\n    away\n   </em>\n   from the jacket and toward a police cruiser. One of those officers walked in front of Pagnani and another officer walked behind her-in other words, between her and the jacket-and held onto one of her secured arms as she was taken to and placed inside a waiting cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b6 32] In short, before the search occurred, Pagnani was restrained, she was outnumbered by police officers, and she was being led away from the porch where she had left her jacket.

That point persuasively demonstrates why the search that was\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   conducted was illegal. Pagnani was not wearing her jacket-and did not have access it-when the search occurred. Rather, the officer searched through Pagnani's jacket only after she had been put in restraints and was under the physical control of two other officers.

Rather, the jacket remained part of this encounter only because the same officer who had staked out her residence for two hours, purportedly to investigate a suspected motor vehicle violation, searched that article of clothing without any legal basis. The court committed no error by suppressing the evidence obtained through that illegal search, just as the court correctly determined that the officers' search of her vehicle was illegal.

Diana\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6956220\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/132/\">\n     2014 ME 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 11,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6956220\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/132/\">\n     89 A.3d 132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation marks omitted). Given the ongoing vitality of the analysis set out in\n    <em>\n     Chimel\n    </em>\n    , this standard of review can only lead to the conclusion that the court's order suppressing evidence obtained from the search of Pagnani's jacket is supported by a reasonable assessment of the evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    On this appeal, the State also argues that there was probable cause to search Pagnani's jacket. This argument was not meaningfully presented below because the clear focus of the State's contention was that the search was properly incident to an arrest, which makes it understandable that the court did not mention any claimed independent probable cause justification for the search.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Wheeler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8078673\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/252/455/#p458\">\n     252 A.2d 455\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 458 (Me. 1969) (\"It is a well established principle of Maine appellate procedure in criminal proceedings that questions not properly raised so as to have been considered and ruled upon by the trial judge will not be considered and passed upon for the first time on appeal.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Even if the State preserved the argument for appellate consideration, it would be unavailing for two reasons. First, the court was not compelled to find facts necessary to support the conclusion that there was probable cause to believe that the jacket constituted or contained evidence of a crime.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Bilynsky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351110\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/932/1169/\">\n     2007 ME 107\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18-25,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8351110\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/932/1169/\">\n     932 A.2d 1169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (describing the standard of review of a probable cause determination). As noted in the text,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Dissenting Opinion \u00b6 30, the Court must infer that the motion court made the findings necessary to support its ultimate determination, which, as to this aspect of the issue, was that probable cause did not exist. The record did not compel the court to accept the State's evidence about out-of-state drug-related criminal history, because there was evidence that the only such charge was dismissed, and the court was fully entitled to reject the officer's unsupported testimony that he believed the charge was still pending. That would leave the State to argue that Pagnani's handling of the jacket created probable cause-something that, in my view, was not sufficient to support such a determination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v. Michael M.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104097\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/772/1179/\">\n     2001 ME 92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 6,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104097\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/772/1179/\">\n     772 A.2d 1179\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Probable cause to search exists when there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\" (alteration omitted) (quotation marks omitted) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Second, even the existence of probable cause-which I submit is absent-would be insufficient to make the evidence admissible, because the State would also need to establish some justification for the warrantless seizure and search of the jacket.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104097\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/772/1179/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The State has not even attempted to argue any exception to the warrant requirement that would rest solely on a predicate determination of probable cause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
