There are substantial unresolved issues surrounding the petitioners' appeal filed pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 80C, and it is clear from the limited record before us that those issues must be resolved before we can consider the matter on the merits. Because an appeal of the Superior Court order mandating the implementation of only one provision of the citizen initiative expanding Medicaid coverage is interlocutory and because, on these unique facts, no exception to the final judgment rule exists, we deny\n   the motion for an expedited briefing schedule and dismiss the Department's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 2] On November 7, 2017, the voters of Maine approved a citizen initiative entitled \"An Act to Enhance Access to Affordable Health Care\" (the Act).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.D. 1039, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 A-1 to B-3 (referred to the voters, 128th Legis. 2017) (effective Jan. 3, 2018) (to be codified at 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 3174-G(1)(H)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). The Act, which expands Medicaid coverage, was not acted upon by the Legislature but nonetheless became the law after enactment by the people.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.D. 1039, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 A-1 to B-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Me.

Civ. P. 80C and 5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11001(2) (2017) based on the Department's failure to initiate the\n   implementation of the Act. As relief, petitioners requested that the Superior Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a. Declare that the Commissioner is under an existing statutory obligation pursuant to 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 3174-G(1)(H) to submit a state plan amendment to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ensuring MaineCare eligibility for people under 65 years of age who qualify for medical assistance pursuant to 42 United States Code, Section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   b.

Grant Petitioners such other and further relief as it deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On June 4, 2018, the Superior Court entered a partial judgment in favor of the petitioners on the merits of a portion of the Rule 80C appeal. In its order, the court addressed the Commissioner's argument that \"because 180 days have not passed since the effective date of [the Act], the question of whether or not the Commissioner is required to promulgate rules or provide coverage is not yet ripe\" and concluded that \"only the questions concerning the filing of the SPA are ripe, not those pertaining to rulemaking or coverage because the deadlines for those actions are still on the horizon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The court's preliminary order regarding the filing of the SPA did not address all of the requests for relief that the petitioners sought or otherwise address the Department's obligation-or lack thereof-to implement the statute's directives regarding rulemaking or the full implementation of expansion, because it concluded that those particular issues were not ripe for its review. The court therefore addressed only the relief requested pursuant to sections a and b of the petition quoted above and concluded, without factual findings, that the plain language of the statute required the Commissioner to submit the SPA by April 3, 2018. It therefore ordered the Department to submit the SPA to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, by June 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On June 7, 2018, the Department filed a notice of appeal and a motion to expedite the appeal with us. In its motion, the Department also contended that the judgment on the Rule 80C petition was automatically stayed pending the resolution of this appeal. MEJP opposed the Department's motion. On June 11, 2018, the same day that MEJP filed its opposition, we issued an order directing the Superior Court \"to determine the immediate enforceability of [its] order pending appeal or for any stay or injunction pending appeal.\" On June 15, 2018, the Superior Court denied the Department's motion for a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 7] On June 18, 2018, the Department again asked us to stay the execution of the judgment and expedite the appeal. On\n   June 20, 2018, we issued an order setting a hearing on the Department's renewed motion and issued a temporary stay in order to preserve the status quo in the interim. On July 18, 2018, we heard argument on the procedural status of this appeal. We now address the partial judgment of the trial court based on our review of the limited record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 8] \"A final judgment or final administrative action is a decision that fully decides and disposes of the entire matter pending before the court or administrative agency, leaving no questions for the future consideration and judgment of the court or administrative agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Brickley v.

No factual record was created, and the Superior Court addressed only one component of the requested relief because it concluded that certain key components and deadlines of the Act were \"still on the horizon\"-namely, the Act's mandate that the Department \"[n]o later than 180 days after the effective date of this paragraph ... shall provide\" newly eligible persons \"at a minimum, the same scope of medical assistance as is provided to a person described in paragraph E.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. On remand, the court will determine whether any ripeness issues remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Although much of the analysis developed by the parties and the court has focused on the plain language of the Act, the implementation must be done in accordance with the Maine Constitution, article IV, part 3, section 19, which states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   any measure referred to the people and approved by a majority of the votes given thereon shall, unless a later date is specified in said measure, take effect and become a law in 30 days after the Governor has made public proclamation of the result of the vote on said measure ...;\n   <em>\n    provided, however, that any such measure which entails expenditure in an amount in excess of available and unappropriated state funds shall remain inoperative until 45 days after the next convening of the Legislature in regular session.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Whether the Act has become operative, with or without any Legislative action, must be determined initially by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 11] To be clear, we do not reach the merits of this appeal at this juncture because MEJP's petition has not been disposed of in its entirety. Before an appeal to us is proper, all factual and legal issues and requests for relief must be litigated, dismissed, or withdrawn. That has not happened here, and as a result, we must dismiss this appeal as interlocutory. Because we dismiss the appeal, our stay preserving the status quo is lifted, and the Department's renewed motion for a stay and to expedite the appeal is denied. We direct the Superior Court to dispose of the remaining requests in the petition, as well as any issues that may have arisen now that the 180-day deadline has passed, in as timely a manner as possible, and we clarify that, in the interim, the June 4, 2018, and June 15, 2018, orders of the Superior Court remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appeal dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 12] We concur in the opinion of the Court dismissing the appeal as interlocutory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 13] We write separately to indicate that, although we agree with our colleague in dissent that attention must be paid to the Legislature's constitutional authority and responsibility for funding government programs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Me. Const. art. V, pt. 3, \u00a7 4, and the specific language of the Constitution addressing implementation of the people's initiative,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 19, we conclude, as has the Court, that any legal determination related to those concerns is premature. Because the order of the trial court is, in practical terms, wholly preliminary, there is no basis for the Law Court to act in this piecemeal appeal from the action of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Given the current state of the record, the trial court's mandate regarding the submission of a plan will likely have no practical effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 15] To be clear, the Legislature could have, but did not, repeal the law enacted by the people's initiative.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Opinion of the Justices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/\">\n    2017 ME 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/\">\n    162 A.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the law exists, and there are now two identified routes to resolving the conflict that is pending before the Superior Court. Either (1) the Legislative Branch can allocate a reasonable amount of appropriate funding for the expanded group of recipients, or, in the absence of such funding, (2) the Judicial Branch must analyze and effectuate the constitutional provisions that address the operation of the people's initiative and the judiciary's authority to effectuate the provisions of the Maine Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Me. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2 ; Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 19 ; Me. Const. art. V, pt. 3, \u00a7 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Neither of those events has been accomplished to date, leaving the question of funding unresolved. Yet, as the parties acknowledge, the federal Medicaid program requires that any Medicaid plan or state plan amendment must include information regarding the extent of state financing for the plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C.S. 1396a(a)(2) (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Accordingly, on the limited record before us, where the Legislature has not acted and the trial court has not even reached the constitutional analysis regarding the implementation of the initiative, it\n   is likely that any plan submitted by the Executive Branch will, by definition, have to report candidly that no legislative action or judicial adjudication regarding funding has been completed. Because such a plan appears to have no reasonable likelihood of meeting the approval of the administrators of the federal Medicaid program, there is little risk that \"substantial rights of a party will be irreparably lost if review is delayed until final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruesewitz v. Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447333\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/912/1255/\">\n    2007 ME 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447333\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/912/1255/\">\n    912 A.2d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, it is neither appropriate nor necessary for the Law Court to consider this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b6 18] As the Court indicates, the matter should be returned to the trial court for an expedited and thorough analysis of the facts and law, with a careful review of the constitutional provisions that must guide the courts in this inter-branch proceeding, particularly Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3, \u00a7 19. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Today the Court orders that \"the June 4, 2018, and June 15, 2018, orders of the Superior Court remain in effect\" and that \"our stay preserving the status quo is lifted.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6 11. With the stay lifted, the Superior Court's mandate to submit the Medicaid expansion implementation plan to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is \"in effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447333\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/912/1255/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b6 20] The deadline set for submission of the expansion plan has already passed. If the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services is unable to prepare and submit that plan almost immediately after this Court's opinion issues, the plaintiffs will be able to seek action by the Superior Court to enforce its mandate. That enforcement action could result in appointment of a receiver, or other judicial action to usurp the executive authority of the Commissioner and perhaps the Governor, to draft and submit a plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b6 21] I respectfully dissent from the Court's actions lifting the stay and freeing the Superior Court to enforce its mandate that the Commissioner prepare and file a plan to implement the authorized but unfunded Medicaid expansion approved by citizen initiative. The stay we ordered should remain in effect, and we should proceed expeditiously to address the merits of the Commissioner's appeal of the Superior Court's mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I. REACHING THE MERITS OF THIS APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b6 22] The Court holds that maintenance of the stay is not possible because the Superior Court's actions are interlocutory and many issues remain to be resolved before the Superior Court's action on the plaintiffs' complaint can be finalized. Court's Opinion \u00b6 11. I concur that there is much to be resolved-most fundamentally, the limits of judicial authority under the strict separation of powers clause, in article III of our Maine Constitution, to order submission of a plan to implement a program, without an approved appropriation, that all agree will cost tens of millions of dollars to implement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b6 23] In ordering that an implementation plan be submitted to the federal government, the Superior Court bypassed those nettlesome questions and issued a mandate that can subject state officials to a contempt sanction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 66, and/or appointment of a receiver if no plan is submitted. Beyond the risk of contempt or displacement of executive authority by a court appointed receiver, mandated filing of an implementation plan may also have significant cost implications for the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 24] The plaintiffs in this matter are represented by skilled counsel. Pending\n   our reaching the merits, we should assume that the plaintiffs have some chance of success on their claim that the courts can mandate filing of the Medicaid expansion plan. Once the plan is filed, the plaintiffs contend, the courts can and will mandate payments to those who qualify for benefits, even without any additional appropriation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b6 25] Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that once the implementation plan is submitted, qualified individuals, some of whom are already applying for benefits, may, by court order, begin receiving the expanded Medicaid payments. The plaintiffs assert that these additional costs will be paid from funds already appropriated to support those presently receiving Medicaid benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Opposition to Motion to Stay Pending Appeal, at 13:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [T]here are existing appropriations in the Medicaid accounts sufficient to fund Maine's Medicaid program and provide benefits for all eligible populations described in ... 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 3174-G(1) -including the expansion population newly added as Paragraph (H) to that subsection-through at least May of 2019....

Irreparable Injury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 32] Addressing irreparable injury first: The plaintiffs propose to fund the Medicaid expansion by taking funds already appropriated to support payments to those who qualified to receive Medicaid benefits before approval of the citizen initiative. The plaintiffs recognize that their plan will exhaust the fiscal year 2019 appropriation sometime next spring, well before the end of the fiscal year. By then, the plaintiffs argue, the Legislature and the Governor may authorize new resources to assure that benefits can be paid to all through the end of the fiscal year. In the meantime, current Medicaid beneficiaries and health care providers will be irreparably injured by longer wait times for treatment, delays in claims processing and payments, and reduced availability of out-patient and in-patient care occasioned by a large influx of new patients competing to use already too limited staff, facilities, and financial resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b6 33] The public and the taxpayers will also be harmed if shortfalls in Medicaid funding require tax increases or cuts in other programs or services to make up for the shortfall in Medicaid funding. Thus, there is a sufficient demonstration of irreparable injury to support maintaining the stay of the Superior Court's mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   B. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b6 34] Turning to the question of probable or strong likelihood of success on the merits: No matter how much the Commissioner may want to prepare and submit a Medicaid expansion plan to the federal government, federal law bars him from doing so without an identified source of funds to support the expanded program throughout the fiscal year, not just for the first nine or ten months of the fiscal year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b6 35] The lengthy and detailed federal law that governs filing a state Medicaid plan is 42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1396a (LEXIS through Pub. L. No. 115-230). Section 1396a(a)(2) directs, \"A State plan for medical assistance must ... provide for financial participation by the State equal to not less than 40 per centum of the non-Federal share of the expenditures under the plan with respect to which payments under [\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1396b ] are authorized by this title ... and ... provide for financial participation by the State equal to all of such non-Federal share or provide for distribution of funds from Federal or State sources, for carrying out the State plan, on an equalization or other basis\n   <em>\n    which will assure that the lack of adequate funds from local sources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope, or quality of care and services available under the plan.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b6 36] Later provisions in section 1396a establish that the relevant non-Federal share of required state participation in the Medicaid expansion program will be ten percent of program costs. There being no funds appropriated for Medicaid expansion, the Commissioner has no capacity to submit a plan identifying the required state financial participation, estimated to be more than $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, according to the record before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b6 37] The plaintiffs argue that there are sufficient resources to meet the plan's financial requirements by utilizing the existing Medicaid appropriation to support the expanded eligibility, and that this resource is sufficient to carry the program into next spring. That argument ignores that second part of section 1396a(a)(2), which requires that the financial plan not only serve the present but \"assure that the lack of adequate funds from local sources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope, or quality of care and services available under the plan.\" 42 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1396a. If the plaintiffs' funding plan were adopted or included in a plan ordered submitted by the court, the approved Medicaid plan to serve current Medicaid beneficiaries could be placed at risk because, by design, the plaintiffs' financial plan, by next spring, will \"result in lowering the amount, duration, scope, or quality of care and services available under the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p21\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b6 38] The plaintiffs also argue that if no appropriation of $40,000,000 is forthcoming, the state courts, or perhaps the federal courts, could order that state funds be gathered from other sources and spent to serve the needs of those made eligible for services by the Medicaid expansion law. In effect, the plaintiffs invite the courts to become a last resort appropriations process, directing funding for programs and services authorized by law but not funded, or not sufficiently funded, through the legislative and gubernatorial appropriations approval process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b6 39] Court involvement in ordering funding for statutorily authorized programs, when appropriations to support such programs fail or are viewed as inadequate to meet perceived needs, would violate Maine's strict separation of powers requirements as stated in article III of the Maine Constitution (Distribution of Powers). Article III states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 1.

Without an appropriation for the Medicaid expansion program, the separation of powers mandated by article III of the Maine Constitution bars the courts from ordering appropriation and expenditure of state funds for that new program.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Maine Revised Statutes are current only through changes made during the First Special Session of the 128th Legislature; because this bill was approved by voters on November 7, 2017, it does not yet appear in the Maine Revised Statutes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Although the parties dispute the precise effective date of the legislation, the Superior Court found that more than ninety days had passed since either date proposed by the parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In addition to MEJP, petitioners consist of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, Maine Primary Care Association, Penobscot Community Health Care, and numerous individuals newly eligible for MaineCare pursuant to the Act's provisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Sua sponte means \"[w]ithout prompting or suggestion; on its own motion.\"\n    <em>\n     Sua sponte\n    </em>\n    , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Although, in contrast to the dissent, we assume that the Executive Branch will comply with the trial court's order to submit \"a plan,\" that submission cannot, in practical terms, meet the requirements of the federal law at this stage of the trial court's proceeding.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C.S. 1396a(a)(2) (LEXIS through Pub.
