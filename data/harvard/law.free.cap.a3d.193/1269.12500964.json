Martowska, appeals from the 2016 postjudgment order of the trial court that, although allowing the plaintiff to inspect a psychological evaluation performed in 2012 as part of a then pending proceeding regarding the parties' custody/visitation matter, prevented the plaintiff from obtaining\n   a copy of the evaluation. On appeal, the plaintiff raises a number of claims regarding the court's order prohibiting the release of a copy of the 2012 evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the postjudgment order at issue is not a final judgment. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Many of the underlying facts and lengthy procedural history of this case are not relevant to the issues on appeal.

The plaintiff and his family members did, however, engage in a series of communications with judges and staff of the Superior Court. In November and December, 2014, the plaintiff sent two letters to Delinda Walden of the Hartford Superior Court, seeking confirmation of the following: the plaintiff's mother was denied a copy of the psychological evaluation, neither party may obtain a copy of the evaluation, no third parties may access the evaluation, and Walden is unable to provide a copy of the evaluation for use in a different case pending in Massachusetts. On September 11, 2015, the plaintiff again wrote to Walden inquiring whether he could obtain a copy of the psychological evaluation, and whether he could share the copy with Dr. Denise Mumley in connection with an order of a Massachusetts court. The plaintiff wrote that the psychological evaluation would\n   <em>\n    \"be used in a different case unrelated to [the defendant]\n   </em>\n   \" and further stated that the evaluation \"will be shared initially with Dr. Mumley (as part of my evaluation) and thereafter with others.\" (Emphasis added.) Also on September 11, 2015, the plaintiff's mother sent an e-mail to Walden, inquiring whether the plaintiff would be permitted to obtain a copy of the evaluation. Walden responded in part that Judge Suarez had informed her that \"we can only release the evaluation for purposes involving the case here - it is not available for any other purpose. Otherwise [the plaintiff] will need to file a motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 12, 2016, the plaintiff appeared at the Superior Court to review the 2012 psychological evaluation. According to the plaintiff, he was denied access to the evaluation. The following day, the plaintiff sent\n   an e-mail to Kevin Diadomo of the Hartford Superior Court, in which he represented that his inquiry was \"for the purpose of potentially bringing forward a motion involving the case here in CT, but I needed to review the [evaluation] before I could decide my plan of action.\" He requested that Diadomo share the e-mail with Judge Suarez. The plaintiff also sent letters to a number of judges of the Superior Court, including Judge Suarez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Suarez, J.\n   </em>\n   , then scheduled a status conference in the matter for December 6, 2016. Following the status conference, the court issued an order providing that \"[t]he plaintiff may review the psychological evaluation dated November 23, 2012, in the clerk's office. The plaintiff is reminded that the information cannot be used in any other action. He was reminded that he cannot have copies of any of the information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is from this order that the plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Before examining the plaintiff's claims on appeal, we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction.

Third, although the appellate final judgment rule is based partly on the policy against piecemeal appeals and the conservation of judicial resources ... there [may be] a counterbalancing factor that militates against requiring a party to be held in contempt in order to bring an appeal from a discovery order.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20A.3d%20686\">\n    Id., at 760-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20A.3d%20686\">\n    73 A.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With these considerations in mind, we conclude that the trial court's order in the present case does not satisfy either of the exceptions set forth in\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   .

The resolution of that issue does not constitute a separate and distinct proceeding. In fact, the order arose not out of a separate motion regarding the psychological evaluation but rather out of multiple communications from the plaintiff to the court and its staff, years after the end of the proceeding for which the evaluation had been ordered. No motions were pending in the case at the time of the multiple communications. The plaintiff represented during oral argument before this court that he sought release of a copy of the evaluation in order to determine what motions, if any, he should file. This court, however, has previously recognized in the discovery context that \"[a] party to a pending case does not institute a separate and distinct proceeding merely by filing a petition for discovery or other relief that will be helpful in the preparation and prosecution of that case.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Radzik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Children's Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415607\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/145/668/#p680\">\n    145 Conn.
