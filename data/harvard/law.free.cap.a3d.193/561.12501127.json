Taveras, appeals from the judgments of the trial court finding him in violation of his probation and revoking his probation\n   pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32, following his arrest on a charge of breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the state adduced insufficient evidence at his probation revocation hearing to establish a violation of probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Central to the defendant's claim of insufficient evidence is whether the words he used spontaneously to express\n   his frustration with his child's preschool staff, which formed the basis for his violation of probation, constituted \"fighting words\" or a \"true threat,\"\n   two forms of speech that are not protected by the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the facts and circumstances of the present case, we conclude that the defendant's speech did not constitute \"fighting words\" or a \"true threat\" and, for that reason, cannot be proscribed by \u00a7 53a-181 (a) consistent with the first amendment. We therefore agree with the defendant that the evidence adduced at his probation revocation hearing was insufficient to establish a violation of probation and, accordingly, reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the cases with direction to render judgments in favor of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following evidence, as adduced at the defendant's probation revocation hearing, is relevant to our resolution of this appeal. In May, 2012, in connection with three separate criminal matters, the defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of threatening in the second degree in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 and one count of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1). After accepting the defendant's pleas, on August 22, 2012, the trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of one year of incarceration, execution suspended after four months, followed by three years of probation. Following his sentencing, the defendant agreed to the standard conditions of probation, including the condition that he \"not violate any criminal law of the United States, this state or any other state or territory.\" The defendant's term of probation began on July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the afternoon of March 11, 2014, the defendant was late for his child's scheduled pickup time at the Head Start Program (Head Start), a preschool in Danbury. Head Start staff telephoned the defendant, who was en route, to ascertain where he was and whether he would be picking up his child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant arrived approximately forty minutes late and was reminded by staff that he needed to pick his child up on time. The defendant appeared \"a little irritated and [un]happy\" with staff as he walked to his child's classroom. As the defendant was exiting the building with his child, he argued with staff in the lobby in front of other children and their parents, and was asked to leave. After the defendant walked through the building's inner set of doors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sondra Cherney, Head Start's assistant education manager, \"said something back to him ....\" In response, the defendant said to Cherney, \"you better watch yourself, you better be careful,\" attempted\n   to reenter the building, which was locked, and then left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, Cherney called Monica Bevilaqua, Head Start's director, and reported the incident. Bevilaqua was not present when the incident occurred, but after\n   having an opportunity to hear from her staff, she called the Danbury Police Department. Danbury police officers responded to the preschool and took statements from Bevilaqua,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cherney, and other staff members. The next morning, the defendant appeared voluntarily at the Danbury Police Department, where he was arrested and charged with breach of the peace in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Christopher Kelly, the defendant's probation officer, was aware of the March 11, 2014 incident and the defendant's subsequent arrest, but chose not to charge him with violation of probation on that basis at that time. Thereafter, on April 16, 2014, in an unrelated incident, the defendant was arrested and charged with violation of a protective order. The next day, Kelly applied for a violation of probation warrant on the basis of both the March 11, 2014 incident and the April 16, 2014 arrest. On May 6, 2014, the defendant was arrested and charged in three separate informations, brought pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   with violating the condition of his probation that he \"not violate any criminal law ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on July 15 and July 16, 2015. The state's theory of the case was that on March 11, 2014, the defendant committed a breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) on the basis of his \"threatening and violent behavior\" with staff, which \"place[d] them in fear and panic.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   See footnote 1 of this opinion. The state, however, did not offer the testimony of Cherney or any other staff member who witnessed the incident. Furthermore, the state did not attempt to introduce any witness statements taken by Danbury police officers. Instead, the state relied solely on the testimony of Kelly and Bevilaqua. Kelly testified regarding the dates and conditions of the defendant's probation. Kelly further testified that he reviewed the police report regarding the March 11, 2014\n   incident, but that he did not initially charge the defendant with violating his probation on the basis of that incident because the resulting charge was a misdemeanor and he had \"had a discussion with [his] supervisor to give [the defendant] a second chance.\" At the conclusion of Kelly's testimony, the violation of probation warrant that he drafted was admitted as a full exhibit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the hearsay objections of defense counsel, Bevilaqua testified regarding Cherney's summary of the March 11, 2014 incident. Specifically, the state elicited the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: What ... was the nature of the [March 11, 2014] incident reported to you on that telephone call [with Cherney]? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The Witness]: ... That [the defendant's child] had not been picked up on time. That [staff] called [the defendant]. [The defendant] was coming down. He was not happy. When he had gotten to the school, he entered the doorway, already escalated.... [H]e walked down to the classroom to get [his child]. When he came back down the hallway and got to the doors he had words with staff members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Threatening words? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Witness]: At that point they were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Okay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Witness]: But they continued....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[The Witness]: So, he got out the front door, door shut behind him, and [Cherney] had said something back to him, and he turned and said, you better watch yourself, you better be careful, tried to get back in the door and couldn't, and then he left.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, Bevilaqua testified that there had been prior incidents at the preschool involving late pickups of the defendant's child and that her staff was familiar with the defendant. Bevilaqua further testified that this was not the first \"escalated interaction\" with the defendant and that she had previously witnessed the defendant behave in a threatening manner. Although the state attempted to elicit testimony detailing these prior interactions, it later abandoned that line of questioning upon objection by defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an oral ruling, the trial court found that the state established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated his probation by committing the crime of breach of the peace in the second degree on the basis of his \"threatening nature and ... demeanor\" at the preschool. As a result of this violation, the court revoked the defendant's probation and sentenced him to a total effective term of eighteen months incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the evidence presented at his probation\n   revocation hearing was insufficient to support the trial court's finding that he violated his probation by committing the crime of breach of the peace in the second degree. In support of his claim, the defendant primarily argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that his conduct, which consisted solely of speech, constituted fighting words or a true threat and, therefore, cannot be proscribed by statute consistent with the first amendment. In response, the state contends that the defendant's first amendment claim is \"unfounded\" and, furthermore, that it presented sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review and the legal principles applicable to probation revocation hearings. \"[R]evocation of probation hearings, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32, are comprised of two distinct phases, each with a distinct purpose.... In the evidentiary phase, [a] factual determination by a trial court as to whether a probationer has violated a condition of probation must first be made.... In the dispositional phase, [i]f a violation is found, a court must next determine whether probation should be revoked because the beneficial aspects of probation are no longer being served....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Because the present case concerns the evidentiary phase and the trial court's factual finding that the defendant violated his probation, we are guided by the standard of review applicable to that phase. The law governing the standard of proof for a violation of probation is well settled.... [A]ll that is required in a probation violation proceeding is enough to satisfy the court within its sound judicial discretion that the probationer has not met the terms of his probation.... It is also well settled that a trial court may not find a violation of probation unless it finds that the predicate facts underlying the violation have been established by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing-that is, the evidence must induce a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the defendant has violated a condition of his or her probation.... In making its factual determination, the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence.... Accordingly, [a] challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is based on the court's factual findings. The proper standard of review is whether the court's findings were clearly erroneous based on the evidence.... A court's finding of fact is clearly erroneous and its conclusions drawn from that finding lack sufficient evidence when there is no evidence in the record to support [the court's finding of fact] ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maurice M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/18/#p25\">\n    303 Conn. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201063\">\n    31 A.3d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"759944\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/285/#p301\">\n    229 Conn. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301-302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=641%20A.2d%20370\">\n    641 A.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In citing to cases involving criminal prosecutions hereafter, we acknowledge that a probation revocation hearing is not a criminal proceeding, but, instead, \"akin to a civil proceeding\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"759944\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/285/#p301\">\n    229 Conn. at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=641%20A.2d%20370\">\n    641 A.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that \"[a]lthough the revocation may be based upon criminal conduct, the constitution does not require that proof of such conduct be sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344985\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/223/#p235\">\n    299 Conn. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20A.3d%20338\">\n    9 A.3d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Megos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490936\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/120/#p139\">\n    176 Conn.

The hallmark of the\n   protection of free speech is to allow free trade in ideas-even ideas that the overwhelming majority of people might find distasteful or discomforting.... Thus, the [f]irst [a]mendment ordinarily denies a [s]tate the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught with evil consequence.... The [f]irst [a]mendment affords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as well as to actual speech....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The protections afforded by the [f]irst [a]mendment, however, are not absolute, and we have long recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the [c]onstitution.... The [f]irst [a]mendment permits restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality....

There is, however, no evidence that Cherney had previously witnessed this prior behavior or had knowledge of the defendant's prior convictions.

Therefore, in light of the unresolved ambiguity of the defendant's statement, we cannot conclude that a reasonable listener would be highly likely to interpret the defendant's statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence does not sufficiently establish that the defendant violated his probation by committing the crime of breach of the peace in the second degree, in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (3), under the true threat exception to speech that is protected under the first amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, we conclude that, under the circumstances of the present case, the evidence\n   adduced at the defendant's probation revocation hearing was insufficient to establish that the defendant's statement constituted either fighting words or a true threat.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the outset, I note a basic point of disagreement with the majority, as I do not believe that the defendant was found in violation of probation solely on the basis\n   of the words that he used on the afternoon of March 11, 2014. To the contrary, I believe that a fair reading of the trial court's oral decision indicates that the court predicated its finding on the defendant's conduct that afternoon. As the majority acknowledges, the court in its decision explicitly stated that its judgments were based in part on \"the threatening nature and demeanor of\" the defendant. In my view, the critical question is whether the record contains evidence to support a finding that the defendant, through his conduct and demeanor as the events of March 11, 2014, unfolded, engaged in threatening behavior in a public place, as \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) requires.\n   Before turning to the evidence admitted at the probation revocation hearing, I note the well established standard that governs review of the evidentiary phase of such proceedings. \"The law governing the standard of proof for a violation of probation is well settled.... [A]ll that is required in a probation violation proceeding is enough to satisfy the court within its sound judicial discretion that the probationer has not met the terms of his probation.... It is also well settled that a trial court may not find a violation of probation unless it finds that the predicate facts underlying the violation have been established by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing-that is, the evidence must induce a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the defendant has violated a condition of his or her probation.... In making its factual determination, the trial court is entitled to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence.... Accordingly, [a] challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is based on the court's factual findings. The proper standard of review is whether the court's findings were clearly erroneous based on the evidence.... A court's finding of fact is clearly erroneous and its conclusions drawn from that finding lack sufficient evidence when\n   there is no evidence in the record to support [the court's finding of fact] ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court's ruling.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maurice M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174054\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/18/#p25\">\n    303 Conn. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201063\">\n    31 A.3d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

Also admitted into evidence were various documents regarding the defendant's underlying convictions, as well as the violation of probation arrest warrant application (application) prepared by Kelly, which was admitted as a full exhibit without any objection by the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As noted in the majority opinion, the defendant arrived at the preschool approximately forty minutes late on the afternoon of March 11, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When he arrived, Bevilaqua\n   testified that the defendant was \"irritated and not happy with staff,\" and \"already escalated.\" After picking up his son from his classroom, Kelly stated, in his sworn affidavit included in the application, that the defendant \"became extremely agitated\" and then \"began to argue with staff.\" That affidavit further indicates that the argument grew so heated that \"[s]taff told [the defendant] that he had to leave because he was arguing with staff in the front lobby in front of other children and their parents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bevilaqua testified that, as the defendant exited the preschool, the assistant education manager \"said something back to him.\" In response, Bevilaqua testified, the defendant, who was then outside the locked door, \"turned and said, better watch yourself, you better be careful ....\" In the affidavit contained in the application, Kelly stated that the defendant was yelling as he made those remarks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Kelly's affidavit indicates, preschool staff reported that the defendant was \"so enraged\" and \"intimidating\" at that time. Moreover, after uttering those remarks, Bevilaqua testified that the defendant attempted \"to get back in\" the preschool, but could not penetrate the\n   locked door. Although the majority correctly notes that there is no evidence describing precisely how the defendant attempted to open the door, I believe the critical import of the evidence of his attempted reentry is that it demonstrates that the defendant's shouted remarks not only were made while he was in an enraged state, but were accompanied by a physical gesture that the court reasonably could infer to be aggressive in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court also was presented with evidence of the reaction that the defendant's conduct and demeanor caused among preschool staff that afternoon. Bevilaqua testified that when she arrived at the preschool shortly after the altercation, her staff informed her that they had been threatened by the defendant and, as a result, were \"shaken up\" and very concerned. Bevilaqua testified that she personally had observed the defendant behave in a threatening manner on a prior occasion, which informed her response to the reports of her staff. Bevilaqua explained that the preschool's \"internal policy\" was to contact police \"when something escalates\" to the point of \"[s]taff being threatened.\" Consistent with that policy, Bevilaqua testified that she contacted the Danbury Police Department, whose officers took statements from staff members. Questioned as to how she differentiates between \"a small threat, like ... I hate this place,\" and something \"larger\" and more substantial, Bevilaqua testified that she was \"trained to know the difference.\" In making the determination to contact law enforcement, Bevilaqua also indicated that she was cognizant that this \"certainly wasn't our first escalated interaction\" with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Bevilaqua was present as police officers took statements from her staff regarding the incident. She also confirmed that the altercation had an effect on people within the preschool for the remainder of that\n   day. In light of the defendant's conduct at the preschool, Bevilaqua asked the Danbury Police Department to\n   ensure that the defendant \"not be allowed back on\" the preschool property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also looked into \"whether or not we could get a restraining order\" against the defendant because she was \"that concerned about his behavior.\" Later that night, Bevilaqua was informed by an officer of the Danbury Police Department that the defendant had been arrested. Despite that arrest, Bevilaqua nevertheless took further actions to protect the preschool, testifying that \"[w]e hired a police officer to be there the next morning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At the probation revocation hearing, Kelly testified that \"[the defendant] and I had a conversation after his breach of peace arrest\" stemming from the defendant's conduct at the preschool on March 11, 2014. In that conversation, Kelly and the defendant discussed the defendant's need \"to cool it\" and \"not be as confrontational in situations.\" Also in evidence before the trial court was documentation of the convictions underlying the defendant's probation. The record indicates that the defendant had pleaded guilty, under separate dockets, to two counts of threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 and one count of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1). That evidence was admitted without objection by the defendant and properly informed the court's perspective as trier of fact in the present case.

In its oral decision, the court credited Bevilaqua's testimony, finding that she took steps to secure the preschool on March 11, 2014, which included immediately contacting law enforcement, due to the \"threatening nature and the demeanor\" of the defendant that afternoon. In so evaluating Bevilaqua's testimony, the court observed details that the record before us does not reflect. We therefore are obligated to defer to the court's assessment of the credibility of, and proper weight accorded to, that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, it is fundamental to our law that the finder of fact is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence before it.

What the defendant fails to appreciate is the precise context in which his remarks arose. This is not a case of a bystander alerting a pedestrian to an errant vehicle. Nor is it a case, as the defendant's counsel hypothetically suggested at the revocation hearing, of a parent who simply \"comes to the school [and] gets mad and says ... you better watch it ....\" Rather, the evidence adduced at the revocation hearing indicates that this is a case in which those remarks were made by an individual on probation for committing, inter alia, the crime of threatening in the second degree. This is a case in which the evidence indicates that the defendant arrived at the preschool \"already escalated\" and, after picking his son up from his classroom, engaged in an argument with preschool staff in front of other students and parents. The record further indicates\n   that while arguing with staff, the defendant \"became extremely agitated,\" to the point that staff informed the defendant that he had to leave the premises. In addition, the record indicates that when the defendant made the remarks in question, he was yelling at the preschool staff, and then immediately attempted to penetrate the locked door and reenter the preschool, conduct which the court reasonably could infer to be an aggressive physical gesture.\n   The court was presented with evidence that the staff present during the altercation with the defendant described him as \"so enraged\" and \"intimidating\" at that time. The court also heard testimony that the preschool staff was so shaken and alarmed by the behavior of the defendant that they called the police, explored the possibility of obtaining a restraining order against the defendant, and then hired a police officer to be present at the preschool the following day. The defendant's probation officer testified that, following that incident, he and the defendant discussed the defendant's conduct at the preschool and his need to \"cool it\" and not be so \"confrontational.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Given that evidence, which provides the necessary context in which this altercation arose, I believe that the trial court reasonably could find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant violated his probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32 (a) by having committed a breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1).

This case involves a probation revocation hearing, however, at\n   which a less burdensome standard of proof applies. In such proceedings, the trial court, as finder of fact, draws inferences and makes predicate factual findings to which every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of their correctness.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maurice M.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174054\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/18/#p25\">\n    303 Conn. at 26-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%201063\">\n    31 A.3d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the probation revocation hearing, however, the state proceeded under the theory that the defendant had committed a breach of the peace on the basis of his \"threatening and violent behavior\" at his child's preschool, and referred to the statutory language of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) in its closing argument. Section 53a-181 (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of breach of the peace in the second degree when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person ...

We address the defendant's sufficiency of the evidence claim before we address any other claim because if a defendant prevails on such a claim in the context of a violation of probation proceeding, the appropriate remedy is to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendant.

Bevilaqua, however, did not testify regarding any threatening conduct while the defendant was inside the preschool. In fact, at oral argument before this court, when asked to \"talk about the conduct that constitutes the threat\" the state was unable to direct us to any physical conduct other than the defendant's attempt to open the preschool's inner set of doors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    To that extent, we reiterate that Bevilaqua testified that the defendant, in response to a comment made by Cherney, said, \"you better watch yourself, you better be careful\"; whereas, Kelly, in his affidavit accompanying the warrant, averred that the defendant yelled to unidentified staff, \"you better watch your back ....\" See footnote 11 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    We disagree with the dissent's position that the defendant's prior convictions, which were admitted into evidence, \"properly informed the court's perspective\" in determining that the defendant engaged in certain conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a). Evidence of the defendant's prior bad acts or uncharged misconduct was irrelevant to the trial court's determination regarding the nature of his alleged conduct at the preschool. As we subsequently explain in part II of this opinion, Head Start staff's knowledge of the defendant's prior convictions may have been relevant; however, no such testimony was elicited by the state.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Although the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Baccala\n    </em>\n    was convicted under a different subdivision of the breach of the peace statute, \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5), we note that the case was analyzed under the fighting words exception.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    We note that elements of breach of the peace in the second degree are identical to the elements of disorderly conduct, except that breach of the peace in the second degree requires that the proscribed conduct occur in a public place.

At the same time, I agree with the majority that the state's theory of the case at trial was that the defendant had committed a violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) due to his threatening behavior at the preschool on the afternoon of March 11, 2014. I also agree with the majority that the court, in its oral decision, ultimately found that the defendant \"violated his probation by committing the crime of breach of the peace in the second degree on the basis of his 'threatening nature and ... demeanor' at the preschool.\" In light of the foregoing, the court's decision reasonably may be construed to conclude that the defendant violated \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1).
