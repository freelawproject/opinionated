The Tax Court denied the Borough's\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:37-2(b) motion, finding plaintiffs had overcome the presumption of the validity of the assessments; rejected the Borough's cost approach for valuing the property, finding it not unique or special purpose; rejected the reliability of improvement costs generated by computer software; accepted plaintiffs' expert's hybrid approach to valuation but found the appraiser lacked adequate objective evidence to support his adjustments; and determined there was not sufficient competent evidence in the record to permit the court to make an independent finding of true value, resulting in the assessments being affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs appeal, arguing their expert \"provided solid evidence of value based on reliable market data which was adequate to determine value,\" and the Tax Court should have applied its expertise to the substantial evidence in the record to determine true value and fix the assessment for the years in question. The Borough cross-appeals, arguing the Tax Court should have adopted its \"cost approach as the appropriate method of valuation\" and that the cost data relied on by its appraiser \"was admissible,\n   reliable, relevant and persuasive.\" We reject those arguments and affirm, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Fiamingo in her written opinion, which is reported at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20N.J.%20Tax%20245\">\n    29 N.J.

We note only the properties, commonly known as the Palisadium, consist of the unusual combination of a banquet hall and fitness center in one building located along the edge of one of the cliffs of the Palisades and a detached four-story parking garage. The combined area of the two lots is over four acres. The property has unobstructed views of the Hudson River and the New York City skyline. Its total assessed value for each year in question was $17,251,000, with equalized values of $17,251,000 in 2011, $19,285,634 in 2012 and $18,692,166 in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tax Court rejected the Borough's cost approach to value, finding none of the reasons typically supporting such an approach\n   applied.\n   <em>\n    Palisadium\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20N.J.%20Tax%20245\">\n    29 N.J.
