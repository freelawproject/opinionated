Item 9, Notes of Testimony, August 8, 2017 (N.T. 8/8/17) Ex. C-1. The underlying circumstances that led to\n   Claimant's resignation stem from Employer accusing Claimant of theft resulting in Employer suspending Claimant without pay from May 26, 2016 through June 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 1, 2016, while Claimant was on suspension, her collective bargaining representative, Council 13, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (Union), filed a grievance on her behalf concerning the suspension. On June 8, 2016, the Union and Employer entered into a last-chance settlement agreement (Agreement), pursuant to which Claimant received a final warning for a work rule violation and was notified that any further misconduct of a similar nature would result in her discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T. 8/8/17 Ex. C-2. The Agreement specified: \"Acceptance of this [Agreement] will dispose of all issues associated with the [ ] grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant returned to work on June 13, 2016 pursuant to the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant acknowledged that she received the Agreement upon her return to work that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Due to Claimant's persistent and interruptive lobbying of Employer to have the discipline removed from her record, and contacting co-workers about the settled matter, Claimant's direct supervisor warned her that she may be subject to a disciplinary conference and instructed her to go home. Claimant did not follow her supervisor's instructions to go home. On April 27, 2017, Claimant resigned her employment, asserting she could no longer do her job because of extreme emotional distress caused by ongoing harassment and discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Claimant applied for UC benefits. On July 13, 2017, the Erie UC Service Center (UC Service Center) concluded: \"[A]lthough [Claimant] had a necessitous and compelling reason for quitting, there were alternatives to resolve the situation. Since [she] did not exhaust all alternatives prior to quitting, she has not sustained her burden of proof and benefits must be denied under Section 402(b) [of the Law].\" UC Service Center Determination at 1. Claimant appealed, and Referee hearings were held on August 8 and 23, 2017. On September 1, 2017, the Referee affirmed the UC Service Center's determination, holding that Claimant did not have a necessitous and compelling reason for quitting,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   she did not make a reasonable effort to preserve her employment. Claimant appealed to the UCBR. On February 28, 2018, the UCBR adopted the Referee's findings and conclusions, and affirmed the Referee's decision. Claimant appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimant argues that the UCBR erred by concluding that she failed to prove she had a necessitous and compelling reason for voluntarily quitting her job. She also claims that since she only appealed from the portion of the UC Service Center's determination that she failed to exhaust all of her alternatives before resigning, the Referee and the UCBR erred by re-examining and overturning the UC Service Center's conclusion that she had a necessitous\n   and compelling reason for quitting in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As an initial matter, Section 101.87 of the UCBR's Regulations specifies that, \"[i]n hearing the appeal [from the UC Service Center's determination,] the tribunal shall consider the issues expressly ruled upon in the decision from which the appeal was filed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20101.87\">\n    34 Pa. Code \u00a7 101.87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has specifically declared that although the UC Service Center concludes in a claimant's favor that she voluntarily left her employment with cause of a necessitous and compelling nature and the claimant did not intend to reopen that issue, it remains a proper area of inquiry for the referee.\n   <em>\n    Lenz v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n   </em>\n   , 61 Pa.Cmwlth. 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=432%20A.2d%201149\">\n    432 A.2d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981). Moreover, Section 101.107(b) of the UCBR's Regulations further specifies, in relevant part: \"The [UCBR] shall consider the issues expressly ruled upon in the decision from which the appeal was filed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20101.107\">\n    34 Pa. Code \u00a7 101.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Based thereon, this Court has held that when a referee expressly rules on an issue, the UCBR has jurisdiction to rule on it.\n   <em>\n    Jordan v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review\n   </em>\n   , 119 Pa.Cmwlth. 375,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1376606\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/119/375/#p813\">\n    547 A.2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (1988). Accordingly, the Referee in the instant matter properly considered whether Claimant had a necessitous and compelling reason for quitting, and the UCBR properly reviewed the Referee's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Regarding the merits of Claimant's appeal, Section 402(b) of the Law states that an employee shall be ineligible for compensation for any week \"[i]n which h[er] unemployment is due to voluntarily leaving work without cause of a necessitous and compelling nature[.]\" 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(b). This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Whether a claimant had cause of a necessitous and compelling nature for leaving work is a question of law subject to this Court's review. A claimant who voluntarily quits h[er] employment bears the burden of proving that necessitous and compelling reasons motivated that decision. In order to establish cause of a necessitous and compelling nature, a claimant must establish that (1) circumstances existed that produced real and substantial pressure to terminate employment, (2) like circumstances would compel a reasonable person to act in the same manner, (3) the claimant acted with ordinary common sense, and (4) the claimant made a reasonable effort to preserve her employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Middletown Twp. v.

However, Pennsylvania law is clear that \"[m]ere dissatisfaction with one's working conditions does not constitute cause of a necessitous and compelling nature for terminating one's employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunswick Hotel &amp; Conference Ctr., LLC v.

Claimant explained: \"I didn't want to stay at work with the conditions of [the disciplinary] letter ... I disagreed with the whole letter.\" C.R. Item 12, Notes of Testimony, August 23, 2017 (N.T. 8/23/17) at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Claimant admitted that, although she worked for approximately ten months after receiving the disciplinary letter on June 13, 2016, she persisted in challenging the terms of the Agreement that resulted in her final warning. Based upon the evidence presented at the hearings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Referee concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Claimant] argues that she quit employment due to a hostile work environment.
