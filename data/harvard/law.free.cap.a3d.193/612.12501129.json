On appeal, he claims that the trial court improperly (1) precluded the introduction of evidence that one of the firearms used in the shooting of the victims was eventually found in the possession of a third party, (2) excluded evidence of a text message conversation he claims was relevant to third-party culpability in violation of his right to present a defense pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution, and (3) admitted into evidence maps depicting the location of cell phones,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and related testimony, without first conducting a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts that provide the context for this appeal. At approximately 2:30 p.m. on September 10, 2013, a group of individuals-LaChristopher Pettway, Aijholon Tisdale, Jauwan Edwards, Leroy Shaw, and Tamar Hamilton-congregated outside the Trumbull Gardens housing project, located in the north end of Bridgeport. At this same time, two men approached the group, and one of them said, \"y'all just came through the Ave shooting Braz, you all f'd up.\" The two men then pulled out nine millimeter handguns\n   and shot at the group. One bullet struck Pettway in the back, piercing his lung; Pettway later died from his gunshot wound. Tisdale, Edwards, Shaw, and Hamilton were also struck by bullets; each of them survived the assault. After the shooting, the two men ran away toward a nearby street. During the\n   ensuing police investigation into the shooting, Hamilton, Shaw, and Tisdale identified the defendant as one of the men who shot at them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By way of an amended long form information, the state charged the defendant with one count of murder, one count of conspiracy to commit murder, and four counts of assault in the first degree. A jury found the defendant guilty of all counts. The court accepted the jury's verdict, rendered judgment, and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of forty-five years imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the court improperly precluded him from introducing evidence that one of the firearms used in the shooting of the victims was eventually found in the possession of a third party. Because we conclude that the defendant failed to preserve this evidentiary claim for appeal, we decline to address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant. On the basis of the police investigation, the state also charged Raashon Jackson, a codefendant, with the same crimes as the defendant. The court consolidated their cases for trial. During the course of the consolidated jury trial, on October 22, 2015, the state filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude Jackson from introducing evidence that one of the two firearms used in the September 10, 2013 shooting was found in the possession\n   of a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state argued that such evidence was not relevant as third-party culpability evidence because it failed to demonstrate a \"direct connection\" between the third party and the subject shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court heard argument regarding the state's motion in limine, at which time Todd A. Bussert, counsel for Jackson, made two interrelated arguments regarding the proffered evidence. First, the firearm was relevant simply because it was one of the firearms used in the September 10, 2013 shooting, and second, \"it is significant that it wasn't found in\n   <em>\n    Mr. Jackson's\n   </em>\n   possession or [in] any way tied to him.\" (Emphasis added.) Following argument, the court granted the state's motion in limine and precluded the introduction of such evidence. The defendant and his counsel, James J. Pastore, remained silent throughout oral argument. When the court inquired whether \"\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   defendant intend[s] to put on any other evidence [regarding the firearm found in the third\n   party's possession]\"; (emphasis added); Bussert and Pastore both indicated that they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[T]he standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial.... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491628\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/770/#p464\">\n    327 Conn. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464-65,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491628\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/770/#p464\">\n    174 A.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant concedes that he did not independently object to the state's motion in limine. He also\n   concedes that he did not attempt to introduce the evidence proffered by Jackson. Nonetheless, he argues that he \"was not ... required to obtain a second ruling on the same issue in order to preserve the record for review.\" We disagree. A defendant who wants to preserve a nonconstitutional issue for appeal raised by a codefendant in a consolidated trial must either join the claim advanced by his or her codefendant or otherwise separately make the claim.

Accordingly, the defendant did not preserve this issue for appeal and, therefore, we decline to address it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly precluded him from introducing certain third-party\n   culpability evidence in violation of his right to present a defense pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution. He argues that the trial court improperly prevented him from cross-examining David Anderson, a witness for the state, about a text message conversation that allegedly appeared on Anderson's cell phone. According to the defendant, \"[e]vidence that ... Anderson had been seeking ammunition eight days before the shooting would have been relevant to support the defendant's theory that ... Anderson was one of the shooters ....\" In response, the state contends that the defendant did not raise the specific relevance claim he pursues on appeal and, therefore, that the evidentiary basis for his claim is unreviewable. Alternatively, the state argues that, even if we were to review the defendant's claim in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   it fails to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's\n   second, third, and fourth prongs. Because we conclude that the defendant's claim hinges on an unpreserved relevancy argument, we agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Anderson, the defendant's cousin, testified at trial on behalf of the state. According to him, on September 10, 2013, he drove the defendant and Jackson in his white 2004 Nissan Maxima to the north end of Bridgeport at approximately 2 p.m. The defendant instructed him to drive to an area near the Trumbull Gardens housing project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Anderson was driving on a street near the Trumbull Gardens housing project, the defendant said that \"he [had] seen someone he knew,\" and that Anderson should park the car and then wait for him and Jackson until they returned. The defendant and Jackson then exited the car and headed toward whomever the defendant recognized. Shortly thereafter,\n   Anderson heard \"firecracker sounds.\" Approximately two minutes after Anderson parked his car, the defendant and Jackson returned and entered Anderson's Nissan Maxima, and the defendant told Anderson, \"[a]ll right, go ahead.\" Anderson heard sirens as he then drove the defendant and Jackson away from the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During cross-examination, Pastore, counsel for the defendant, sought to question Anderson about a text message conversation that allegedly appeared on Anderson's cell phone. Pastore asked Anderson, \"[w]ho is Popa Anderson?\" Anderson did not answer that question, however, as the prosecutor immediately objected and claimed that the inquiry was not relevant. Outside the presence of the jury, Pastore represented to the court: \"There's a text message from Mr. Anderson's phone from a Popa Anderson to another individual by the name of Los Des, and I'm asking and inquiring of who those individuals are.\" The following colloquy then took place:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The Court: Well, what else-what else would you have though to make that relevant?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[Pastore]: Well, depending on how the person answers the questions, the relevancy-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The Court: I mean, what's your proffer?

Bring the jurors back in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Following the court's ruling, Pastore cross-examined Anderson on different matters. The defendant now claims on appeal that the trial court deprived him of his right to present a defense under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"It is fundamental that the defendant's rights to confront the witnesses against him and to present a defense are guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.... A defendant's right to present a defense is rooted in the compulsory process and confrontation clauses of the sixth amendment.... Furthermore, the sixth amendment rights to confrontation and to compulsory process are made applicable to state prosecutions through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"These sixth amendment rights, although substantial, do not suspend the rules of evidence.... A court\n   is not required to admit all evidence presented by a defendant; nor is a court required to allow a defendant to engage in unrestricted cross-examination.... Instead, [a] defendant is ... bound by the rules of evidence in presenting a defense.... Nevertheless, exclusionary rules of evidence cannot be applied mechanistically to deprive a defendant of his rights.... Thus, [i]f the proffered evidence is not relevant ... the defendant's right[s] to confrontation [and to present a defense are] not affected, and the evidence was properly excluded.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491832\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/514/#p593\">\n    327 Conn. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491832\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/514/#p593\">\n    175 A.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

Accordingly, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The defendant's final claim is that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence maps depicting the location of cell phones and related testimony. More specifically, he argues that the court improperly declined to hold a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine the admissibility of testimony and maps developed by Andrew Weaver, a witness for the state, which described the defendant's movements on September 10, 2013, according to his cell phone use. The defendant maintains that the court was required to hold a\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   hearing \"to determine whether the software program ... Weaver used to create the map[s] showing the location of the defendant's cell phone was reliable.\" According to the defendant, the court abused its discretion when it failed to do so, and such evidence substantially affected the verdict. The state argues that the defendant's claim is unreviewable and, alternatively, that any error was harmless. We agree with the state that the claim is unreviewable and, even if it were reviewable, any error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The following additional facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a\n   motion in limine seeking to \"[preclude] the admission of cellular telephone tower 'ping' evidence. In the alternative, the defendant request[ed] a hearing pursuant to ...\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   to determine the scientific reliability of said evidence.\" The defendant's motion was dated July 17, 2014, and was filed with the court that same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On October 20, 2015, after trial began, the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury in connection \"with the motion in limine to preclude testimony of Sergeant Andrew Weaver\n   <em>\n    filed by Mr. Jackson's counsel, dated October 7\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    2015\n   </em>\n   ].\" (Emphasis added.) The court initially understood Jackson's motion to challenge Weaver's testimony as being based on two grounds. First, the state's disclosure of Weaver's anticipated testimony was late or incomplete, and second, the software used by Weaver to generate certain maps was \"problematic.\" The court also noted: \"The other area [it wanted to address], in fairness to the defense, is the reliability of this GeoTime software [used by Weaver] and whether ... Weaver is qualified as an expert to do what he's done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Responding to the court's statements, Bussert stated in relevant part: \"Just two things, Your Honor.... In terms of ... Weaver's qualifications to testify as an expert and the state's memorandum in opposition, which seems to focus largely on the issue of whether or not the proffer purpose of ... Weaver's testimony was generally inadmissible ... I don't think we ever really contested that this type of information can be presented to a jury if coming in through a proper expert. And in terms of ... Weaver's qualifications, we would just like to voir dire him during his testimony if he's allowed to testify. So, that's not really a basis. And then also-and I think there was one issue.... One issue\n   that we see as substantive with respect to the-to the PowerPoint presentation slideshow that he-that Sergeant Weaver has presented to us for review, and that is in particular the second page, which is that entire summary page.\"\n   Weaver testified during the hearing and, following the hearing, the court denied the motion in limine and permitted the state to introduce Weaver's testimony and the maps he created. Although he was present during this hearing, Pastore did not ask any questions, nor did he oppose Weaver's proposed testimony or the maps he had prepared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The state thereafter called Weaver to testify at trial. He testified, on direct examination, that he had prepared certain maps based on \"GPS [global positioning system] material for a person by the name of Mr. Anderson\" and \"data from three different cell phones\" provided by the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Weaver, the maps, which were contained in a PowerPoint presentation that was admitted into evidence, portrayed Anderson's specific movements before and after the September 10, 2013 shooting. Weaver testified that those maps were partially based on location data he received from the state that derived from a GPS bracelet Anderson wore on his ankle. Weaver also testified that the maps depicted, generally, where the defendant and Jackson made or received certain calls on their cell phones before and after the shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   These maps demonstrated that Anderson, the defendant, and Jackson were\n   in the area of the shooting when it took place, and left the area soon after the shooting. At trial, the defendant did not object to Weaver's testimony, nor did he object to the PowerPoint presentation containing the maps Weaver prepared using the GeoTime software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We now set forth the legal principles governing our review of the defendant's claim. \"We review a trial court's decision [regarding the admission of] expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.... If we determine that a court acted improperly with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony, we will reverse the trial court's judgment and grant a new trial only if the impropriety was harmful to the appealing party.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490923\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/797/#p32\">\n    176 Conn.

Anderson testified that he picked up the defendant and Jackson in his white Nissan Maxima, drove them to an area near the September 10, 2013 shooting at the Trumbull Gardens housing project, dropped them off at a nearby street at approximately the same time the shooting occurred, and then drove them away from the area after hearing \"firecracker sounds\" and approaching sirens. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , supra, 325 Conn. at 134,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489325\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/506/\">\n    156 A.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (evidentiary error deemed harmless because, even without improperly admitted cell phone data and maps, jury could conclude that defendant was in area when robberies occurred based on other unchallenged evidence). Although the defendant disputes Anderson's credibility on appeal, he does not challenge the admissibility of his testimony. Additionally, during the police investigation and at trial, some of the victims positively identified the defendant as one of the men who shot them.

The maps Weaver created demonstrated that Anderson was in the area of the shooting when it happened,\n   based on a GPS ankle bracelet that Anderson wore at the time. According to Weaver, the GPS logs provided the \"[s]pecific\" location of an individual. On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the admissibility of this GPS evidence. The state also introduced surveillance camera footage depicting Anderson's white Nissan Maxima traveling toward the Trumbull Gardens housing project at approximately the time of the shooting, being within ninety-one yards of the shooting approximately when it happened, and that two men exited the car at approximately 2:31 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Weaver also testified that cell phone data can only approximate the cell phone's location to a general \"coverage area.\" In other words, he acknowledged the limited accuracy of the challenged evidence. Bussert even cross-examined him on the fact that cell phone data can only provide an \"approximation\" as to a cell phone's location. And although Pastore's cross-examination of Weaver was limited, Weaver acknowledged that the location of the defendant's cell phone was not depicted in some of the slides contained in Weaver's PowerPoint presentation.
