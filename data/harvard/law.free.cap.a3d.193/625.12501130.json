In the petitioner's criminal trial, however, the jury never received important evidence of a cooperating witness' interest in the outcome. This appeal requires us to examine a situation where a necessary cooperating witness, the only one who put the defendant at the crime scene with the likely murder weapon in his hand, falsely denied before the jury any promise from the state in exchange for his testimony and such falsity was not disclosed to the jury, but the prosecutor argued in summation to the jury that the witness had \"everything to lose, nothing to gain,\" by giving statements to the police and testifying. We hold this scenario to be antithetical to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The petitioner, Christopher Gaskin, filed this appeal following the denial of his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the habeas court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court: (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal; (2) erred in finding that the petitioner's due process claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was procedurally defaulted;\n   and (3) in addressing the merits, erred in finding that the state did not deprive the petitioner of his due process rights when it did not correct a witness' known false testimony at the underlying criminal trial. We agree with all of the petitioner's claims as they pertain to his underlying convictions of murder and conspiracy to commit murder under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54 and 53a-48, respectively. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the habeas court and remand the case to the habeas court with instruction to render judgment granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, vacating the petitioner's underlying convictions of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, and ordering a new trial on those charges. We affirm the judgment as to the petitioner's underlying conviction of tampering with a witness under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The underlying criminal proceedings stem from the shooting death of Kendall Williams-Bey in Hartford on July 6, 1998. The petitioner eventually was charged with Williams-Bey's murder and with tampering with a witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, only two witnesses implicated the petitioner in Williams-Bey's murder: Benjamin Ellis and Evelyn Douglas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ellis, a cooperating witness, testified that he drove the petitioner and another man, later identified as\n   Trevor Bennett,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   past the crime scene and then parked nearby. While Ellis waited in the car, the petitioner and Bennett got out of the vehicle carrying guns, the petitioner carrying a revolver and Bennett carrying an \"automatic.\" Shortly thereafter, Ellis testified that he heard gunshots and then the petitioner and Bennett returned. Ellis then drove his passengers away from the area and dropped them off at various points in Hartford. James Stephenson, the state's firearms identification and testing expert, testified that the bullet that killed Williams-Bey was fired from a revolver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Douglas, the petitioner's girlfriend with whom he lived at the time, testified that the petitioner admitted to her that he shot Williams-Bey. She testified that, prior to the shooting, the petitioner arrived home with a busted lip and told Douglas he had gotten into a fight with London Johnson at a nightclub in Springfield, Massachusetts. She stated that the petitioner said he was going to \"get\" Johnson. She said that when\n   the petitioner came back to her apartment later, he said, \"I just f- - - -d up.... I didn't mean to shoot Kendall.\" She testified that he meant to shoot Johnson, who was near the crime scene when Williams-Bey was shot. Douglas' testimony did not tie the petitioner to the murder scene or possession of a revolver of the kind that killed the victim. Only Ellis' testimony established that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Many times prior to Ellis' trial testimony, the petitioner's trial counsel asked for any information on agreements or promises the state may have made with any witnesses, particularly Ellis. Because Ellis also was being charged with Williams-Bey's murder, the petitioner's trial counsel wanted to know if the state had promised anything to him in exchange for his testimony. The prosecutor denied that any deal had been made. Just\n   prior to trial, the following colloquy between the trial court and the prosecutor took place:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The Court: ... Now, was anything offered to [Ellis]?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: No, Your Honor. It's standard routine, no offers are made. When I have a case, they are told that I will not make any agreement with them. They have to testify, and if they expect something that's within their-it's not-not something-I-I do not or neither does my inspector, anybody involved with me, make any offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The Court: Right. Well, in the old days what used to be done was, the phrase, as I recall it, was, make your truthful cooperation-truthful and full cooperation known to the sentencing judge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [The Prosecutor]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Court: Was that done in this case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Yes. The sentencing judge would be told that he gave a statement, but the thing he was told is he has to tell the truth, and it's not within my province, it's within the sentencing judge's province, which is the standard procedure ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the trial, the prosecutor asked Ellis whether he was made any promises in exchange for his testimony, which Ellis denied. The prosecutor asked Ellis why he gave his statements to the police, to which Ellis replied that he \"felt bad about the incident.\" Ellis also stated that he was happy he was \"doing the right thing.\" On cross-examination, the petitioner's trial counsel engaged in the following questioning of Ellis:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Q. ... Have you met with [the prosecutor] at any time in this case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"A. With [the prosecutor] and my lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Q. Okay.... The answer to that, I take it, is yes?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"A. Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Q. Okay. And was it your understanding as a result of the meeting that the state wanted you to testify truthfully?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"A. Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Q. Okay. And was it your understanding that if you testified truthfully, the state would take that into consideration in deciding what would happen in the case in which you're charged?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"A. No. I wasn't made any promises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Q. I didn't ask you, sir ... if you were made any promises. What I asked you was-was it your understanding that if you testified truthfully, the state would take that into consideration in deciding the outcome of your case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"A. I'm not sure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Q. You're not sure?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"A. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Q. Was it discussed?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"A. No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Later, the petitioner's trial counsel questioned Ellis as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Q. Is it your understanding that after you testify, by truthful testimony, that the state will bring your cooperation and truthfulness to the attention of the court?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"A. I was never told that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Q. And you don't have that expectation?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"A. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Q. And you are aware, because of your experience in the system, that the state can change any of the charges it wants against you ...? Do you want me to rephrase that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"A. No. I understand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Q. You are aware of that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"A. I wasn't sure of that, but now I know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During closing argument, after Ellis had given testimony inculpating the petitioner in the killing, the prosecutor stated that Ellis \"wanted to get [his testimony] off his chest. He knew and knows that his statements put him in the mix.\" On rebuttal, the prosecutor then argued that Ellis \"had everything to lose, nothing to gain, by giving these statements\" and that Ellis \"has been charged with this crime, too. And his position is he's only the driver, he had nothing to gain by giving both statements. He clearly said he wasn't made any promises. Does he expect something? That's in his mind. I don't know. But the reality is: he is in the mix.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The record reveals that the prosecutor never corrected Ellis' testimony before the jury in which Ellis told the jury that he had never been told that, after he testified truthfully, the state would bring his cooperation and truthfulness to the attention of the sentencing court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On July 7, 2003, the jury found the petitioner guilty of all the charges. He was sentenced to a total effective sentence of sixty years imprisonment. On December 30, 2003, the petitioner filed a direct appeal. His appointed counsel later moved to withdraw as appellate counsel, filing an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   brief on December 29, 2004, in which she stated that there were no nonfrivolous issues for\n   appeal, and was permitted to withdraw by a judge of the Superior Court on September 11, 2006. The petitioner then represented himself pro se until withdrawing his direct appeal seven years later on April 10, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After testifying at the petitioner's and Bennett's criminal trials, Ellis, on November 4, 2004, pleaded guilty to violating General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), accessory to assault in the first degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor, the same as in the petitioner's case, recommended a sentence of twenty years, suspended after five years, with five years probation, to run concurrently with a sentence Ellis then was serving for the commission of an unrelated crime. As promised, the prosecutor made the sentencing judge aware of Ellis' involvement in the petitioner's criminal trial. On September 7, 2005, Ellis' sentence was reduced to twenty years, execution suspended after three years, with five years probation. Ellis' prior sentence, which he was serving at the time of the petitioner's criminal trial, also later was reduced in 2005 by three years on the prosecutor's recommendation for \"[s]ubstantial aid and cooperation in several serious felony cases.\" That sentence could only be modified\n   by reduction pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which requires the assent of the prosecuting authority prior to its reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On September 10, 2012, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Then, after counsel\n   was appointed, the petitioner filed his operative petition on December 9, 2014. The petitioner alleged that the prosecutor violated his constitutional rights in failing to correct Ellis' false testimony and in failing to disclose exculpatory materials. Specifically, the petitioner alleged that Ellis lied at the petitioner's criminal trial when he testified that he did not receive or expect to receive any consideration for his testimony against the petitioner. The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, filed his amended return on February 11, 2015, denying the allegations and claiming that the petitioner procedurally defaulted on his claim because he did not directly appeal his underlying criminal conviction on the grounds raised in his petition and that he established neither cause nor prejudice for his procedural default. In his reply, filed February 26, 2015, the petitioner denied procedurally defaulting his claim, but also stated that, if he did procedurally default his claim, there was cause and prejudice for doing so. Specifically, the petitioner stated that cause existed because \"at the time his appeal was pending, there was no additional evidence available to the petitioner or his appellate attorney which could have shown that Benjamin Ellis received consideration for his testimony. It was not until later that evidence became available to prove this claim.\" The petitioner stated that he also was \"prejudiced because the jury hearing his criminal trial did not know of Benjamin Ellis' self-serving motivations for testifying against the petitioner, and the [prosecutor] allowed him to testify in an untruthful manner without correcting his testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The matter proceeded to a habeas trial, which included the testimony of Ellis; John L. Stawicki, Ellis' attorney at the time of his testimony and in his subsequent pleas; and Victor Carlucci, Jr., the prosecutor in the petitioner's criminal trial and Ellis' later pleas. Ellis testified that he was made no promises for a reduction\n   in his charges or anything else in exchange for his testimony, although he said that he hoped his testimony would help him. Stawicki and the prosecutor both testified that the prosecutor made no specific promises, other than to convey Ellis' cooperation to his sentencing judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its memorandum of decision dated June 23, 2016, the habeas court denied the petition on the ground that the petitioner procedurally defaulted his claim and failed to establish cause and prejudice for his default. Nonetheless, the court also addressed the merits of the petitioner's claim, finding that, although Ellis testified falsely, the prosecutor had disclosed his promise to Ellis to the petitioner's trial counsel, which obviated any need to correct the false testimony. The petitioner requested certification to appeal, which was denied by the habeas court on July 6, 2016. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal; erred in finding that the petitioner's due process\n   claim was procedurally defaulted; and in addressing the merits, erred in finding that the state did not deprive the petitioner of his due process rights when it did not correct a witness' false testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial and then subsequently relied on that testimony in closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Before we turn to the petitioner's claims we set forth our standard of review for habeas corpus appeals. The underlying historical facts found by the habeas court may not be disturbed unless the findings were clearly erroneous.... Historical facts constitute a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators.... Questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact receive plenary review.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768135\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/165/#p174\">\n    294 Conn. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20A.2d%20620\">\n    982 A.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The petitioner\n   generally does not challenge the habeas court's factual findings. Thus, each of his claims raises either questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact, over which we exercise plenary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The petitioner first claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the denial of his habeas petition. Specifically, he argues that both the issue of procedural default and the issue of whether his due process rights were violated are debatable among jurists of reason, could be resolved in a different manner and are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Faced with the habeas court's denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner's first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court's ruling constituted an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/608/#p612\">\n    230 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%20126\">\n    646 A.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

We note that the petitioner's trial counsel thoroughly cross-examined Ellis regarding the state's promise to him, to no avail, and that information regarding Ellis' sentencing only became available after the conclusion of the petitioner's criminal trial. Given the ambiguous\n   and contradictory statements of the prosecutor regarding any promise to Ellis, we fail to see how the petitioner could \"properly raise\" his claim on appeal from the record. Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the petitioner's appellate counsel was granted permission by the Superior Court to withdraw because she concluded there were no nonfrivolous claims to raise on appeal.

The petitioner argues that there was cause for his procedural default because \"[t]he factual basis for [his] claim was not reasonably available to [appellate] counsel, and it was the state's conduct at trial that made raising the claim on direct appeal impracticable.\" Specifically, the petitioner argues that it was reasonable for his appellate counsel to rely on the prosecutor's statements during the criminal proceedings denying that any consideration had been offered, to rely on the prosecutor to disclose all exculpatory materials and to rely on the prosecutor not to present false testimony or then to correct any false testimony. The petitioner claims that it was only when the prosecutor and Stawicki testified at the habeas trial that it became clear that Ellis' testimony was false because prior to their testimony, the prosecutor had repeatedly denied promising Ellis anything, despite the repeated requests for information by the petitioner's trial counsel about any discussions with or incentives offered to Ellis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The respondent counters that \"all of the predicate facts necessary to litigate a\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   were available to the petitioner before appellate counsel withdrew from [the] case and long before the petitioner withdrew his appeal.\" (Footnote added.) In addition, the respondent argues that the state disclosed any exculpatory materials, and so there can be no cause attributable to the state's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court disagreed with the petitioner's argument that the evidence necessary to support his claim was not available at the time his direct appeal was pending. The court found that \"[t]he evidence presented by the petitioner at the habeas trial that provides the basis for his claims ... was known or knowable from November 23, 2005, until April 23, 2013. Given how long the appeal was pending before it was withdrawn, the petitioner could have filed, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-55, a petition\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a new trial based on newly discovered\n   evidence. Section 42-55 expressly authorizes action on the\n   petition for [a] new trial even though an appeal is pending. The record from any proceedings conducted by the criminal court, the correct forum for the petitioner's claims, could then augment the record of the direct appeal.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In looking at the habeas court's reasoning, we must first conclude that it was error to suggest as support for a lack of cause that the petitioner could petition for a new trial. Because the respondent's return asserted only that the petitioner procedurally defaulted on the basis of his not having directly raised on appeal his due process claim, a fact the habeas court acknowledged just two paragraphs prior to its cause analysis, the court could not suggest then that the petitioner should have moved or petitioned for a new trial. A motion or petition for a new trial is not part of a direct appeal. See footnote 11 of this opinion.

The cooperating witness denied having received any consideration from the prosecutor in exchange for his testimony. Id., at 262-64. In fact, the witness had told the petitioner that he had been promised leniency on a gun possession charge in consideration for his testimony. Id., at 265. The petitioner informed his trial counsel, but the conversation was not brought to the court's or the prosecutor's attention before or during trial, at which the petitioner was convicted on the underlying murder charge. Id. After the\n   trial, the petitioner's trial counsel inspected the transcript of the cooperating witness' weapons possession proceedings. Id. At those proceedings, the prosecutor revealed that he had promised several times to \"see what [he] could do to help [the witness].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The petitioner then instituted a coram nobis proceeding in state court, at which the prosecutor \"repeatedly insisted that no specific offer had been extended.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Id. After being confronted with the transcript of the dismissal of the witness' weapons charge indictment, however, he conceded that a promise had been made. Id. The court, thereafter, granted the writ of coram nobis. Id., at 266. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed the granting of the writ of coram nobis, holding that, although the prosecutor had committed gross impropriety, any error was harmless because \"the jury was made fully aware of [the witness'] prior criminal record, of the pending gun charge and of the fact that he had consumed a large quantity of alcohol on the day of the murder.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed that decision on the ground that \"the defendant and his counsel, with knowledge of the facts, stood silently by and did nothing themselves to remedy the situation ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The petitioner then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court. Id., at 267. The District Court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the basis of the trial and coram nobis judge's finding that the evidence was sufficient to convict the petitioner even absent the cooperating witness' testimony. Id. The Second Circuit, thereafter, reversed the judgment of the District Court. Id. The Second Circuit determined, after its own review of the record, that the witness' testimony was \"the coup de gr\u00e2ce, unequivocally placing [the petitioner] at the scene of the crime with the\n   murder weapon in his pocket, the robbery proceeds in his hands, and a confession in his mouth.\" Id., at 267-68. In contrast, the other witnesses' testimony \"was far from overwhelming.\" Id., at 267. The court also noted that the jury was deadlocked prior to finding the petitioner guilty and that, \"[c]learly, it [was] reasonable to conclude that [the cooperating witness'] testimony tipped the balance ....\" Id., at 268. The court also held that \"it\n   would be inappropriate not to permit [the petitioner] to challenge the egregious and highly damaging prosecutorial misconduct solely because he and his lawyer may have failed to utilize all available means for exploring the prosecutor's highhandedness at the trial.\" Id. The court thought a different result might occur in a case \"where the possible harm was less pronounced\"; id. ; but noted that \"[t]he harm ... was caused not so much by unawareness that [the witness'] testimony may have been perjured as by inability to respond effectively in view of [the prosecutor's] silence.\" Id., at 268 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Here, in the present case, the respondent similarly argues that the petitioner had all of the predicate facts available to him to raise his due process claim on direct appeal; however, much like in\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   , the harm stemmed not from unawareness of the falsity of Ellis' testimony but from Ellis' truculence and the petitioner's inability to respond effectively in light of the prosecutor's silence. In addition, and also like\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   , it was not until the prosecutor himself testified at the habeas trial that there was a complete factual record to prove the petitioner's claim. We also note that, as in\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   , Ellis was the key witness who put the petitioner at the crime scene with the likely murder weapon, a revolver, in his hand. Thus, we are persuaded by the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   that it would be inappropriate not to permit the petitioner to challenge the prosecutor's knowing use of Ellis' false testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Therefore, the petitioner established cause for any procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The petitioner also argues that he has established the prejudice necessary to overcome procedural default because his claimed due process violation by the state was material to his conviction. The respondent does not present any argument or citation that would counter this claim. In fact, in the respondent's brief, he unequivocally states that \"[b]ased on [his] review of the trial record, the [respondent] concedes that if this court were to overturn the habeas court and find a\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   violation, the prosecution's failure to correct Ellis' false testimony was material to the petitioner's convictions of murder and conspiracy to commit murder because the state's case was not strong without Ellis' testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   This concession of materiality also concedes the prejudice necessary to overcome procedural default. See\n   <em>\n    Hinds\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%2056\">\n    321 Conn. at 84-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%20596\">\n    136 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although we are not bound by\n   the respondent's legal conclusions, we agree that Ellis' testimony was material to the petitioner's convictions for murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Ellis' testimony was the only testimony that placed the petitioner at the crime scene with the likely murder weapon, a revolver, in his hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The habeas court, however, found that the petitioner did not establish prejudice because Ellis was \"extensively questioned by [the petitioner's trial counsel] about his possible motivations for testifying,\" and the trial judge's instructions to the jury also addressed those potential motivations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court further found\n   that the state had no obligation to correct Ellis' false testimony because the state disclosed to the defense its promise to make Ellis' sentencing judge aware of his cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We will examine more fully the parameters of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materiality, particularly disclosure,\n   in part III of this opinion, but we note that, although the petitioner's trial counsel indeed did question Ellis about his motivations, Ellis repeatedly stonewalled him. Trial counsel was unable to get Ellis to admit to the jury that he had some promise from the state regarding his cooperation. We do not know what more the petitioner's trial counsel could have done to present the state's promise to Ellis to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, despite whatever awareness the petitioner might have had of the prosecutor's promise to\n   Ellis, this situation is inapposite to that in which defense counsel is actually aware of false testimony and fails to bring it to either the jury's or the court's attention, which raises \"the assumption ... that he did so for strategic reasons,\" because when a \"defendant [is] prevented from raising or pursuing the issue at trial by circumstances essentially beyond his control,\" that presumption of strategy is undermined.

Cir. 1981). The court's jury instructions regarding witnesses' cooperation could not obviate the prejudice emanating from Ellis' false testimony. That is so because the jury did not hear at all about the state's promise to Ellis, however limited it was. Additionally, the prejudice was not obviated because the prosecutor's statements in closing arguments suggesting that Ellis had \"everything to lose, nothing to gain,\" invited the conclusion that Ellis had no interest in the outcome of the case and this sharpened the prejudice of the testimony itself. Likewise, we are not convinced that the impeachment of Ellis through knowledge of his criminal convictions would suffice to mitigate any prejudice.

The respondent concedes both that Ellis' testimony was false and that it was material to the petitioner's convictions, but argues, nonetheless, that the prosecutor disclosed the full extent of the cooperation agreement on the record outside of the jury's presence, and, thus, that the prosecutor satisfied his due process obligations to the petitioner. We agree with\n   the petitioner that the prosecutor's use of Ellis' false testimony coupled with his statements in summation suggesting Ellis had no interest in the outcome violated the petitioner's due process rights.

Setting aside the disclosure issue, which we address in part III B of this opinion, we conclude that Ellis' testimony was material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor in the present case was also the prosecutor in Ellis' guilty pleas after the petitioner's criminal trial. Thus, there could not be a logical claim that the prosecutor was unaware of the promises made to Ellis, because he promised to bring Ellis' testimony to the attention of the sentencing judge. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , however, Ellis denied having received any consideration, despite\n   defense counsel's repeated efforts to get him to admit the benefits he would receive from the prosecutor for his testimony against the petitioner. The prosecutor in this case then used his closing argument to enhance Ellis' credibility by arguing that Ellis had everything to lose and\n   <em>\n    nothing to gain\n   </em>\n   and that he was \"in the mix.\" He also claimed that he did not know if Ellis expected anything, even though he had told Ellis that the state would bring Ellis' testimony to the attention of his sentencing judge. At that point, Ellis already had testified in a manner favorable to the prosecution. He was also the only witness tying the petitioner to the murder scene at the time of the killing. He was also the only witness to place a revolver in the petitioner's hands at the time and place of the shooting. There was no physical evidence in this\n   case that would tie the petitioner to the crime scene. In\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , at least there was one piece of physical evidence, a yellow jacket. Here, the prosecutor knew that he had promised Ellis that he would bring the fact of his cooperation to the attention of his sentencing judge if he testified truthfully at the petitioner's criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In addition, in the present case, the state's case arguably was weaker than it was in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   As opposed to\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , where there were at least two eyewitnesses, Ellis, who was not even an eyewitness to the shooting, was the only witness who placed the petitioner at the crime scene. He is also the only witness who put a revolver, which expert testimony established was the likely murder weapon, in the petitioner's hand. The respondent points out that Douglas also testified in a manner that implicated the petitioner; however, her testimony was based on an alleged admission to her by the petitioner. She was not an eyewitness to the murder. She was unhappy with the petitioner for personal reasons; her testimony made clear that she was angry at the petitioner for alleged infidelities. One of her letters to him stated, \"I will take your f-ing freedom you bitch.\" For these reasons, we conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that Douglas' testimony alone would have been insufficient to convict the petitioner of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. When the issues with Douglas' testimony are considered with Ellis' tainted testimony, and the complete lack of physical evidence that would tie the petitioner to the crime scene, we conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood of a different result because Ellis' false testimony, or the reliance on it by the prosecutor in his closing argument, could have affected the verdict of the jury.

The petitioner originally had been convicted of conspiracy to commit murder on the basis of the testimony from a cooperating witness, who had denied receiving any consideration\n   from the state for his testimony.

Prior to his criminal trial, the petitioner filed discovery motions seeking exculpatory information or material, which the court granted, but the state represented that it had none. Id., at 1277. After the petitioner was convicted, the cooperating witness testified in another trial, where the petitioner's trial counsel learned that the witness \"had made a deal with the state and federal governments that, in return for his giving evidence at [the] petitioner's trial and others, [the] pending state felony charges against him would be dropped, he would receive leniency on a bank robbery charge and immunity from prosecution for crimes to which he confessed while supplying information to the government.\" Id. The District Court found \"that the state's misbehavior in [the] case could have affected the outcome of the trial\" because the cooperating witness \"was the state's chief witness against [the petitioner]. His testimony was all that directly tied [the] petitioner to the shooting ....\" Id., at 1279. The court also found that the witness' credibility had been \"subjected to considerable scrutiny,\" but that \"testimony of the complete deal would not have been merely cumulative.... In the face of [the witness'] denial as to the existence of any promise and the suppression by the prosecution of the full terms of the deal, defense counsel's argument challenging [the witness'] motive and interest was reduced to speculation and inference.\" Id. The court also found that \"if the full terms of the agreement had been presented accurately\n   <em>\n    to the jury\n   </em>\n   , that evidence would have created a reasonable doubt as to the petitioner's guilt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   Id., at 1280-81.

Once Ellis had testified, however, and did not recant his statements, but, indeed, inculpated the petitioner, it would have been clear then to the prosecutor that the state's agreement with Ellis to bring his level of cooperation to the sentencing judge was favorable to Ellis. The prosecutor's closing and rebuttal arguments, therefore, could not fairly suggest to the jury, as did the prosecutor, that Ellis had everything to lose and nothing to gain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, Ellis could have expected to have advanced beyond mere hope to an expectation of some favorable treatment in his own case. Such information should have been made known to the jury so that, in weighing the testimony of Ellis, it could have weighed any potential effect that the promise of the prosecutor to bring Ellis' cooperation, at that point in a favorable manner, to the attention of the sentencing judge might have had on Ellis' testimony. For the prosecutor to argue that Ellis had everything to lose and nothing to gain when Ellis had testified favorably for the prosecution and had been promised that his testimony would be disclosed\n   to his sentencing judge cannot be justified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, we address the respondent's argument that should we find a due process violation, we, nonetheless, should uphold the petitioner's separate conviction on the tampering with a witness charge. The respondent contends that none of the evidence emanating from Ellis' testimony had any bearing on the tampering charge. The petitioner argues that the conviction of tampering \"is buoyed by the assumption that the petitioner is guilty\" of the murder and conspiracy to commit murder charges. We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In order to be convicted of tampering with a witness, the state must prove that a defendant, \"believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted ... induces or attempts to induce a witness to testify falsely, withhold testimony, elude legal process summoning him to testify or absent himself from any official proceeding.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In the petitioner's criminal trial, evidence was introduced of letters the petitioner had sent to Douglas. In one letter to Douglas, the petitioner wrote: \"If anybody come trying to talk to you to death like you know me, and, shit, of course you know me and what not, but\n   <em>\n    you don't tell nobody that you don't know shit and don't want to\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) In another letter, the petitioner wrote that \"I'm schooling you on keeping your head right ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Given the elements required to prove tampering with a witness, we conclude that the jury reasonably could\n   have found that the petitioner attempted to induce Douglas to withhold testimony. Despite the petitioner's argument that the conviction is \"buoyed\" by his other convictions and Ellis' false testimony regarding them, tampering with a witness can be established even absent other convictions.

A \"petition\" for a new trial, which is commenced by a separate civil action, is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 and may be granted for, inter alia, \"the discovery of new evidence ....\" Because it is the Superior Court that grants a petition for a new trial, such a petition is clearly not part of an appeal. In addition, the statute governing the appeal rights of defendants, General Statutes \u00a7 54-95, makes clear that a defendant \"may be relieved by appeal, petition for a new trial or writ of error ....\" The disjunctive \"or\" in the statute further crystalizes our conclusion that a petition for a new trial is not part of an appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Additionally, the rules of practice concerning motions for a new trial, Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 42-53 to 42-55, are contained in the chapter pertaining to trial procedure in criminal matters before the Superior Court, not in the chapter containing our rules of appellate procedure.

There are two reasons why we are not swayed by this dictum. First, the respondent's return in this case claimed only procedural default through the petitioner's failure to directly appeal his due process claim, so anything that the petitioner's trial counsel could have done at trial simply is irrelevant. Second, in\n    <em>\n     Vincent\n    </em>\n    , the petitioner learned of the witness' deal from the witness himself, unlike in this case where the prosecutor responded affirmatively to the trial court's question regarding whether he would make Ellis' sentencing judge aware of his statement. Because we also conclude that the petitioner's trial counsel exhausted his available means of exposing the prosecutor's promise to Ellis; see footnote 21 of this opinion; we fail to see another way that the jury would have learned of Ellis' uncorrected false testimony. And, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Vincent\n    </em>\n    , the prosecutor in this case bolstered Ellis' credibility by suggesting to the jury that Ellis had nothing to gain, sharpening the already substantial prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    It bears mentioning that the court found Ellis' testimony to be false, and the respondent also conceded its falsity during oral argument before this court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Bennett, the other man charged with and tried for Williams-Bey's murder, did not testify at the petitioner's criminal trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    In a comprehensive charge, the trial court instructed the jury concerning Ellis' testimony as follows: \"[I]n weighing the testimony of Benjamin Ellis, who is, as I mentioned, a self-confessed criminal, you should consider that fact. It may be that you would not believe a person who's committed a crime as readily as you would believe a person of good character. In weighing the testimony of an accomplice who has not yet been sentenced, or whose case, actually, to say correct[ly], has not yet been disposed of, it's still pending; you should keep in mind that he\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be looking for some favorable treatment in the sentence or disposition of his own case. Therefore his testimony\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    have been colored by that fact. You must look, with particular care, at the testimony of an accomplice and scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it. There are many offenses that are of such character that the only persons capable, however, of giving useful testimony are those who themselves were implicated in the crime. It's for you to decide ... what credibility you will give to Mr. Ellis, who has admitted his involvement in criminal wrongdoing, whether you will believe or disbelieve the testimony of Mr. Ellis, who, by his own admission, contributed to the crime charged by the state here. Like all other questions of credibility, this is a question you must decide based on all the evidence presented to you. You had an extensive opportunity to observe his demeanor on the stand. He was cross-examined extensively. His testimony, I must caution you, must be scrutinized carefully and if you find that he ... intentionally assisted in the commission or aided in the commission of the offense or offenses, [with] which [the petitioner] is charged, you must be particularly careful in regard to his testimony. In weighing Mr. Ellis' testimony you should bear in mind that his charges arising from this incident are still pending. The ultimate charges he will face have not yet been determined. They\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be the same. They\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be changed. You should keep in mind that he\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be looking for favorable treatment in the disposition of his own case. You may consider whether his testimony was colored by that fact and look, with particular care, upon his testimony and scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it. In addition, in considering his credibility, you may consider any motive he had for testifying falsely to implicate the accused. While Mr. Ellis has been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder of Kendall Williams-Bey, he's not yet been tried on those charges. In viewing this, you may consider the fact that the state's attorney\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    , without approval of the court, [change the] charges or possibly even drop [them] if the state's attorney states a reason for that ... on the record. I have no indication,\n    <em>\n     nor is there any evidence, that that will be done.\n    </em>\n    But Mr. Ellis was cross-examined on those issues in general and in particular and you got the opportunity to evaluate his credibility. You may consider all of this in deciding whether Mr. Ellis has any interest in the outcome of this case or any bias ... or prejudice concerning any party or any matter involved in the case.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    We note that the trial court stated that there was no evidence that the prosecutor would change or drop any charges in Ellis' pending case. At the later trial of this habeas petition, it became evident that the prosecutor dropped or reduced Ellis' charges, a fact that obviously is not in the petitioner's criminal trial record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    In his brief, the respondent highlights the attempt of the petitioner's trial counsel to impeach Ellis with his false testimony. At oral argument, the respondent's counsel was asked what else the petitioner's trial counsel could have done when Ellis persisted with false testimony in light of the prosecutor's silence. Counsel argued that the petitioner's trial counsel could have asked for a stipulation or an instruction, or could have presented Ellis with the transcript of the proceeding in which the prosecutor put the agreement on the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Given the prosecutor's persistent denial of any promise, it is unlikely that he would have stipulated to the fact that Ellis' testimony on the issue was false, particularly in light of his later capitalization on Ellis' lie in closing argument. We similarly are unconvinced that any requested instruction would have been probable because it would have required the trial court to take judicial notice of the truth of a statement that it could not validate, as the court was not a witness to the promise made to Ellis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    In his operative petition, the petitioner framed his claim as follows: \"Pursuant to the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments [to] the United States constitution, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution, [\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    ] and [\n    <em>\n     Adams\n    </em>\n    ], the petitioner's constitutional rights were violated because the prosecuting authority failed to correct [the] false testimony of Benjamin Ellis and/or failed to disclose exculpatory materials.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    At the habeas trial and in his appellate briefs, the petitioner referred to his claim as a violation of\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Napue\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Giglio\n    </em>\n    .
