Morgan (\"Wife\") and Daniel T. Morgan (\"Husband\") both appeal from the September 27, 2016 Order, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , reduced Husband's alimony obligation. Husband also appeals the January 12, 2017 Order that denied his Motion to Strike the September 27, 2016 Order. After careful review, we vacate the September 27, 2016 Order and remand this case with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Husband and Wife were married on May 18, 1984, and have three adult children; the youngest suffers from autism and requires supervision and care. During the marriage, Husband earned various advanced degrees, including a Law Degree, Masters in Business Administration, Masters of Laws in Taxation, and a Certified Public Accountant certification; Wife earned her Bachelors of Science in Nursing. At the time of the parties' separation, Husband earned a salary of $144,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 18, 2003, the parties entered into a Marital Settlement Agreement (\"Agreement\") on the record, which provided that Husband would pay Wife $5,000 per month in alimony until at least June 30, 2007. After July 1, 2007, either party could petition the Court to modify the amount of alimony, restricted only by the provision that the trial court could not reduce alimony below $1,000 until July 1, 2007 or later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 20, 2003, the parties were divorced pursuant to a Judgment of Divorce entered in Montgomery County, Maryland, which incorporated, but did not merge, the parties' Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 3, 2007, Husband filed a certified copy of the Divorce Decree in Franklin County, PA. On May 4, 2007, Husband filed a Petition to Modify Alimony to $1000 per month. Wife filed a cross-petition to increase alimony above $5000 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 5, 2007, the trial court granted Husband's Petition and reduced Husband's alimony obligation to $1000 per month. Wife timely appealed. On appeal, this Court vacated a portion of the Order, remanded the case, and instructed the trial court to require Husband to demonstrate \"a substantial change in circumstances that justify reducing the award\" and then analyze the requisite factors set forth at 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(b)(1)-(17).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Morgan v. Morgan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , No. 50 MDA 2008,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=965%20A.2d%20312\">\n    965 A.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , unpublished memorandum at 11 (Pa. Super. filed November 13, 2008) (\" MORGAN I\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 14, 2011, after a hearing, the trial court issued an Order again granting Husband's Petition to Modify Alimony and reducing alimony to $1000 per month retroactive to July 1, 2007. (\"January 2011 Hearing\"). Wife timely appealed the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While Wife's appeal was pending, Wife discovered that at the January 2011 Hearing, Husband produced to the court false documentation and testimony regarding his income, including two sets of false tax returns. Wife filed in this Court a Motion to Supplement the Record and a Motion for Immediate Interim Relief. Superior Court denied these motions and affirmed the decision of the trial court.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Morgan v.

Super. 2011) (unpublished memorandum)(\" MORGAN II\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 24, 2012, Wife filed with the trial court a Petition to Modify Alimony based on Husband's fraud. At the hearing, the parties stipulated that Husband's income was, in fact, higher than Husband had presented at the January 2011 Hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also stipulated that Wife's 2015 annual income was $43,200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties further stipulated that 1) the hourly rates that Wife's attorneys charged were reasonable; 2) Husband would not challenge line-item charges from Wife's attorneys; and 3) it was not necessary for Wife to call an expert witness to testify as to the services provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although the trial court acknowledged that Husband willfully presented false evidence of his income at the January 2011 Hearing and characterized Husband's conduct as \"despicable,\" the trial court determined that it was bound by the factors listed in 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701 and issued the same Order that it had issued at the January 2011 Hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, dated 9/27/16. Husband's alimony obligation remained at $1000 per month from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2022.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties had stipulated that attorney's fees that Wife incurred were reasonable. The trial court, however, only required Husband to reimburse Wife for 75% of those fees. Moreover, the trial court only required Husband to reimburse Wife for those fees Wife incurred from the date she discovered Husband's fraud, not from the date he committed the fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wife filed a timely Notice of Appeal. Wife and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P 1925. Husband filed a timely cross appeal, but failed to serve the appeal on the trial court. Consequently, the trial court did not order Husband to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 11, 2017, Husband filed a Motion to Strike the September 27, 2016 Order. On January 12, 2017, the trial court denied Husband's Motion to Strike. Husband timely appealed. Both Husband and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. Upon Motion from Husband, this Court consolidated the above-captioned appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES RAISED ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wife's Issues\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Wife raises the following issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and err as a matter of law in concluding that an inequitable result would occur if it applied the doctrine of unclean hands to preclude analysis of the alimony factors, despite the trial court finding that the doctrine was applicable to the case and that [Husband]'s fraudulent conduct was within the purview of the doctrine?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and err as a matter of law in determining that the amount of counsel fees to be considered for reimbursement were only the fees\n   accumulated subsequent to the discovery of [Husband]'s fraud, therefore denying any consideration of the counsel fees accumulated while [Husband] perpetrated his fraud, despite determining that [Husband] was not entitled to a reduction in his alimony for the same period due to his fraud, and in arbitrarily awarding only 75% of the counsel fees incurred subsequent to the discovery of [Husband]'s fraud?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   III. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and err as a matter of law where it correctly recognized the applicability of the\n   <em>\n    falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\n   </em>\n   doctrine where [Husband]'s fraud was material to the alimony modification determination, but declined to apply the doctrine to any of the likely and necessarily fraudulent testimony and production of [Husband], and in finding any of [Husband]'s testimony credible where in every instance where there was a way to check the veracity of [Husband]'s testimony, it was proven to be false?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   IV. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and err as a matter of law in concluding that despite [Husband]'s fraud, [Husband] established a substantial and continuing change to meet the threshold requirement for alimony modification?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   V. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and err as a matter of law in finding, after reanalysis of the alimony factors in light of [Husband]'s fraud, [Husband] to be entitled to any reduction to his alimony obligation, let alone a reduction in his alimony obligation after July of 2011, where [Husband]'s fraud was committed from the outset of the case, [Husband] perpetuated his fraud through the proceedings well after July of 2011, and where the trial court's Opinion of January 14, 2011 was premised upon findings of fact that were determined by the trial court based on fraudulent testimony and production from [Husband] which the trial court failed to fully recognize and address in its reanalysis of the factors in its Opinion and Order of September 27, 2016?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   VI. Did the trial court abuse its discretion and err as a matter of law in determining that [Husband]'s fraudulent testimony and fraudulent production was not arbitrary, vexatious, or in bad faith?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Wife's Brief at 5-7 (reordered for ease of disposition; some capitalization omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Husband's Issues\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1. A court cannot alter a contract, and a judgment without subject matter jurisdiction is void. The trial court has determined, three times, that the parties contracted, in March 2003, that alimony would end in July 2007; nonetheless, the trial court has altered the contract by adding four years of alimony. Could the court alter the contract?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   2. A judgment without subject matter jurisdiction is void. The trial court altered the parties' alimony contract based on Domestic Relations Code section 3701(b), which applies when alimony is awarded by a court. Did such statute provide the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   3. Relitigation of a final judgment is precluded, and a judgment without subject matter jurisdiction is void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court allowed its final judgment to be relitigated, resulting in the judgment on appeal. Could the final judgment be relitigated?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   4. Jurisdiction of appeals from trial court orders lies with the Superior Court, exclusively, and a judgment without subject matter jurisdiction is void. After the Superior Court affirmed the trial court's final order, the trial court altered the affirmance. Did the trial court have jurisdiction to alter the affirmance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   5. A trial court has a maximum of 30 days to modify an order, but cannot do so after the order has been appealed, and a judgment without subject matter jurisdiction is void. After appeal of the trial court's (final) order, the trial court modified such order by entering the order on appeal. Was such modification permissible?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   6. Orders were entered based on a judgment without subject matter jurisdiction.

Wife's Brief at 21. Wife asserts that Husband committed intentional and premeditated fraud upon the trial court for the last ten years and \"in every instance where there was a way to check the truth or falsity of [Husband]'s testimony, it was proven to be false.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 26, 28. Wife argues that the application of the doctrine of unclean hands is the only equitable recourse, and the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to apply the doctrine, vacate its decision to grant Husband's Petition to Modify, and determine that the doctrine completely bars Husband's request for the reduction of his alimony obligation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 23, 27.

The doctrine of unclean hands generally operates only to deny equitable, and not legal, remedies.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Universal Builders, Inc. v.

It is well settled that a party \"who comes into a court of equity must come with clean hands.

Finally, the doctrine of unclean hands \"gives wide range to the equity court's use of discretion in refusing to aid the unclean litigant\" and in exercising this discretion, the equity court is free to refuse to apply the doctrine if consideration of the record as a whole convinces the court that application of the doctrine will cause an inequitable result.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Shapiro v.

Our review of the record supports the trial court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Despite the trial court characterizing Husband's deceitful conduct over a period of more than five years as \"despicable actions\" and a \"fraud upon the court,\" the trial court declined to apply the doctrine of unclean hands. The trial court refused to assert its equitable powers and instead applied the alimony factors using Husband's new evidence that he presented after his Wife discovered the fraud.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11. We find this to be an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When Husband filed his Petition to Modify Alimony, he was requesting that the court use its equitable powers to modify his alimony obligation. In light of the fraud that Husband committed not only on the court, but also to the parties and judicial system itself, the trial court should have invoked the doctrine of unclean hands and denied Husband's request to modify Husband's alimony obligations. Although this conclusion involves disregarding the Section 3701(b) factors, Husband committed a fraud on Wife and the judicial system on the most important issue in the Petition to Modify. This fraud is particularly egregious because Husband, as an attorney, is an officer of the court and has a professional obligation to not \"knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.\" Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   While it is hard to quantify the far-reaching effects of Husband's years of fraud upon the court and Wife, the fraud resulted in multiple lower court hearings and two appeals to this Court over the past ten years. This was unquestionably detrimental to Wife.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terraciano, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 237. Husband's misconduct was not limited to a small or unimportant portion of the case; rather, for five years, most of the evidence that Husband fraudulently produced and testified to dealt with his financial status, the most significant issue in the Petition to Modify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This Court finds Husband's conduct to be appalling; it most certainly shocks the moral sensibilities of this Court. We agree with Wife that the only equitable result is to deny Husband's Petition to Modify Alimony\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , i.e., from the beginning.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4352(e) (stating that a support obligation may be modified retroactively \"if the petitioner was precluded from filing a petition for modification by reason of a ... misrepresentation of another party or other compelling reason and if the petitioner, when no longer precluded, promptly filed a petition.\"). The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant this relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Trial Court Abused its Discretion When it Failed to Award Wife the Full Amount of Attorneys' Fees that Wife Incurred From the Inception of Husband's Fraud\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In her next issue, Wife avers that she is entitled to a full award of attorneys' fees from the inception of Husband's fraud. Wife's Brief at 60. The trial court only awarded Wife attorneys' fees from the date Wife discovered the fraud, not when Husband began perpetrating the fraud, and only awarded 75% of such fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The parties stipulated that the hourly rates that Wife's attorneys charged were reasonable, Husband had no objection to line items on the bills and there was no necessity for Wife to call an expert witness to testify as to the services provided. In light of the stipulations, the trial court should have limited its analysis to whether Wife was entitled to the stipulated amount of attorneys' fees. Once the trial court did so, it should not have overridden the parties' stipulation and made a separate determination of the reasonableness of those fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to grant or deny attorney's fees for an abuse of discretion.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brody v.
