We conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that the company is not an intended third-party beneficiary of the insurance contract and therefore lacks standing to bring a direct action against the insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff, Hilario's Truck Center, LLC, appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting the motion to dismiss filed by the defendant, Nationwide Insurance Company (Nationwide), as to counts one and three of the complaint. Those counts alleged breach of contract on the basis of Nationwide's refusal to pay for towing services provided to the defendant Laura Rinaldi.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claims on appeal that the court improperly granted Nationwide's motion to dismiss because the plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary to the insurance\n   contract between Nationwide and Rinaldi and therefore has standing to bring claims directly against Nationwide for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history, as recited by the trial court in its memorandum of decision, are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On March 17, 2015, Rinaldi was involved in a motor vehicle accident on Route 34 in Newtown. Rinaldi's vehicle left the roadway, traveled over a rock wall, rolled over, and landed in a wooded area some distance from the road. Newtown Police responded to the scene and, shortly thereafter, requested the plaintiff's services to recover and tow Rinaldi's vehicle. Removal of the vehicle required a heavy duty wrecker and a flatbed truck. The plaintiff provided these services, as well as \"a crush wrap to protect the vehicle\" while it was towed from the accident scene. The plaintiff submitted invoices for its towing services to Nationwide. At the time the court issued its decision, neither defendant had paid the\n   plaintiff for its services, and Rinaldi's vehicle was stored on the plaintiff's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff commenced the underlying action against the defendants to recover for the towing and vehicle recovery expenses that it incurred as a result of Rinaldi's motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff brought a three count complaint. The first count alleges breach of an implied contract against both defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that \"[t]he law implies a contractual obligation to pay the cost of services rendered\n   on the automobile owner,\" and that the defendants breached this implied contract by refusing to pay the plaintiff for its services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The second count sounds in unjust enrichment against Rinaldi. It alleges that Rinaldi \"received the benefit of having the vehicle removed from the scene and towed to the plaintiff's storage facility\" and continues \"to enjoy the benefit of the plaintiff's recovery, towing and storage services for [her] vehicle despite not paying the plaintiff just compensation for [its] services, to the plaintiff's detriment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The third count alleges breach of contract against Nationwide on the theory that Nationwide is liable for money damages to the plaintiff because it is a third-party beneficiary of Rinaldi's insurance contract with Nationwide. The third count incorporates by reference the allegations of the first two counts and further alleges that, despite being properly notified of the plaintiff's claims for services provided to Rinaldi, Nationwide wrongfully has refused to pay the plaintiff's invoice for those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to the complaint, Nationwide filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff did not have standing to bring claims directly against it. In its memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss,\n   Nationwide claimed that the plaintiff lacked standing because it is not a party to the insurance contract between Nationwide and Rinaldi and neither party intended to assume a direct obligation to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Nationwide argued that the contract at issue excludes coverage for towing expenses, and, therefore, even if the plaintiff had standing to bring an action pursuant to the contract, Nationwide is not liable for the cost of the towing services rendered by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion and a memorandum in support of the objection. Following oral argument on\n   the motion, the court,\n   <em>\n    Truglia, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the motion to dismiss in a written memorandum of decision. In that decision, the court concluded that the plaintiff was not a third-party beneficiary to the contract and, therefore, did not have standing to sue Nationwide for breach of the insurance contract. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court improperly granted Nationwide's motion to dismiss because the plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary to the insurance contract between the defendants and, therefore, has standing to bring a direct claim against Nationwide. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable principles of law and standards of review. \"A motion to dismiss ... properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.... A motion to dismiss tests, inter\n   alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Beecher\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951437\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/130/#p134\">\n    282 Conn. 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=918%20A.2d%20880\">\n    918 A.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ; see Practice Book \u00a7 10-30 (a) (1) (\"[a] motion to dismiss shall be used to assert ... lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[L]ack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found in any one of three instances: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court's resolution of disputed facts.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Columbia Air Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146394\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/342/#p347\">\n    293 Conn. 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20636\">\n    977 A.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).

Damages must involve ... property damage or ... bodily injury.\" The insurance contract defines property damage as the \"(a) destruction of tangible property; (b) damage or injury to it; and (c) loss of its use.\" As a factual matter, the plaintiff argues that because Rinaldi's automobile came to rest following the accident on the real property of a third person, Rinaldi incurred liability to the property owner for damage to the real property and the plaintiff mitigated Rinaldi's liability by removing the vehicle from the property and towing it away. From these facts and the language of the contract providing coverage for property damage, the plaintiff leaps to the legal conclusion that Rinaldi and Nationwide intended that Nationwide assume a direct obligation to the property owner, and by further extension, to the plaintiff itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We disagree with the plaintiff that the provision of liability coverage in the contract for property damage evinces an intent to create a direct obligation by Nationwide to any third person or entity, known or unknown, (1) who suffers property damage as a result of Rinaldi's use of her vehicle or (2) who, although not suffering property damage itself, expends funds on Rinaldi's behalf to mitigate property damage suffered by others. The plaintiff's assertion simply confounds the distinction between those persons or entities that might foreseeably benefit from Rinaldi's contractual receipt of liability coverage\n   with those persons or entities to whom both Rinaldi and Nationwide specifically intended that Nationwide would assume a direct obligation. As we previously have discussed, \"the fact that a person is a foreseeable beneficiary of a contract is not sufficient for him to claim rights as a third party beneficiary.\"\n   <em>\n    Grigerik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sharpe\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"247167\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/247/293/#p317\">\n    247 Conn. at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=721%20A.2d%20526\">\n    721 A.2d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see\n   also\n   <em>\n    Macomber\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Property &amp; Casualty Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828548\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/620/#p642\">\n    261 Conn. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=804%20A.2d%20180\">\n    804 A.2d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (in context of settling claims, insurer owes no fiduciary duty to third-party claimant because \"such a duty would interfere with the insurer's ability to act primarily for the benefit of\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   insured\" [emphasis in original] ).

(\"[a] policy provision requiring the insured to protect the vehicle from harm or damage following a collision permits the insured to recover expenses of towing the vehicle to a place of safety\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We do not find these cases relevant. Both cases involve actions brought by or against the named insured under the respective insurance policies. Neither case involved the question of whether a towing company should be deemed a third-party beneficiary to an insurance contract between the automobile owner and an\n   insurance company. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Spurgeon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Toro\n   </em>\n   , the courts' public policy conclusions relied on the fact that the named insured was seeking coverage. This reasoning does not, as the plaintiff argues, extend to \"the service professionals who cleared the damage from the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Limiting the availability of direct breach of contract actions against insurers to those third persons or entities to whom the parties to the contract intend to create a direct obligation will not, contrary to the plaintiff's assertion, discourage third parties from mitigating property damage. If a towing company renders services after an accident, other avenues exist for the towing company to seek recovery for those services. We may presume that in many instances, the insurance company will pay for the services if the policy provides for such coverage. If there is no coverage for towing expenses, the towing company can seek recovery from the owner of the vehicle directly. Importantly, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   if the towing company obtains a judgment in a direct action against an insured and the insured was entitled to coverage for such a loss, the judgment creditor towing company is subrogated to the rights of the insured and may bring a direct action against the insurer to recover on the insurance policy.

Other than under the third-party beneficiary doctrine, the plaintiff has made no arguments on appeal regarding its standing to bring a direct claim against Nationwide for breach of an express or implied contract between the plaintiff and Nationwide.
