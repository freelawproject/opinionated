On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to disclose redacted portions of the victim's mental health records following the court's in camera review of the records pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Esposito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684573\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/192/166/\">\n    192 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%20949\">\n    471 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), thereby violating his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to confrontation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The defendant resided with the then twelve year old victim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the victim's mother, and the victim's two younger siblings in an apartment in New Britain. The defendant was in a relationship with the victim's\n   mother. During one unspecified night in March, 2011, the defendant came into the victim's room while she was sleeping on two separate occasions. During one encounter, he touched her buttocks, and during the other encounter, he touched the victim's vagina and attempted to pull down her pajama pants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The incident was not reported to the police until April, 2012, when the victim disclosed the abuse to her father and his fianc\u00e9 while visiting them in New York. At this time, the victim spoke to a New Britain police officer over the phone. The victim's allegations prompted the New York Administration for Children's Services and the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (department) to conduct an investigation. Members of the department interviewed the victim as part of its investigation. The victim also received treatment at the Wheeler Clinic in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73a(a)(1)(A) and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to obtain records from the department and the Wheeler Clinic pertaining to the victim's mental health pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Esposito\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684573\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/192/166/\">\n    192 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%20949\">\n    471 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bruno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"392492\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/236/514/\">\n    236 Conn. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20A.2d%201117\">\n    673 A.2d 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), arguing that the records were probative of the victim's mental capacity to know or correctly relate the truth and had the potential to show motive or bias. The court granted the motion and, after the victim consented, the court conducted an in camera review of the victim's department file and her Wheeler Clinic file. The court found that portions of the records were probative of the victim's mental capacity to know or correctly relate the\n   truth and had the potential to show motive or bias. As a result, the court disclosed redacted copies of the records to the defendant. At trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to all charges. The court subsequently sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of eight years of incarceration and twelve years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We first address whether the defendant's claim that the court violated his right to confrontation by failing to disclose redacted portions of the victim's mental health records following its in camera review of those records is reviewable. We note, at the outset, that the defendant failed to preserve this issue at trial. Our Supreme Court has indicated that, when a court has conducted an in camera review and has disclosed only a portion of the material sought, it is necessary for the defendant to object to any of the court's redactions at the trial stage before raising the claim on appeal.

Accordingly, the defendant's claim is reviewable. His claim fails, however, under\n   <em>\n    Golding's\n   </em>\n   third prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We set forth the applicable principles necessary to review the defendant's claim on the merits. \"The need to balance a witness' statutory privilege to keep psychiatric records confidential against a defendant's rights under the confrontation clause is well recognized.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Slimskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963460\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/842/#p855\">\n    257 Conn. 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 855,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=779%20A.2d%20723\">\n    779 A.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Our Supreme Court has set forth the procedure used to strike this balance. \"If ... the claimed impeaching information is privileged there must be a showing that there is reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the information is likely to impair the defendant's right of confrontation such that the witness' direct testimony should be stricken. Upon such a showing the court may then afford the state an opportunity to secure the consent of the witness for the court\n   to conduct an in camera inspection of the claimed information and, if necessary, to turn over to the defendant any relevant material for the purposes of cross-examination. If the defendant does make such showing and such consent is not forthcoming then the court may be obliged to strike the testimony of the witness. If the consent is limited to an in camera inspection and such inspection, in the opinion of the trial judge, does not disclose relevant material then the resealed record is to be made available for inspection on appellate review. If the in camera inspection does reveal relevant material then the witness should be given an opportunity to decide whether to consent to release of such material to the defendant or to face having her testimony stricken in the event of refusal.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Esposito\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684573\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/192/166/\">\n    192 Conn. at 179-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%20949\">\n    471 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Upon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness' capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences....

Accordingly, we review the trial court record, including the records that were disclosed and those portions that were not provided to the defendant, to determine whether the court abused its discretion in limiting the defendant's access to the victim's mental health records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to the teaching of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Esposito\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684573\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/192/166/\">\n    192 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%20949\">\n    471 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court conducted a review of the undisclosed portions of the records at issue. On the basis of that review, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in its selection of records to disclose and those portions to withhold from the defendant. We conclude, as well, that the records provided to the defendant secured his constitutional right to confront the victim at trial. In sum, the court properly disclosed all materials especially probative of the witness' capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect, and narrate relevant occurrences. As a result, the defendant was able to utilize pertinent details disclosed in the records to thoroughly cross-examine the victim. During the trial, the defendant was able to question the victim about her past self-injurious behavior and her resultant hospitalization, her depression, the contents of her journal, her strained relationship with her mother, her long held desire to live in New York with her father, her dislike of the defendant, and her knowledge of the fact that her neighbor's niece had made false sexual assault allegations in an attempt to extricate herself from her living situation. The defendant was thus able to fully and effectively cross-examine the victim about her possible motives, biases, and capacity to relate the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual assault and the crime of risk of injury to a child, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim's identity may be ascertained.
