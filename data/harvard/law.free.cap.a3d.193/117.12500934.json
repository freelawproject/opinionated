In 2011, following a grant of certification to appeal by the habeas court, the petitioner appealed to this court from the judgment of the habeas court denying his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which challenged a conviction of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2). The petitioner\n   claimed that the habeas court improperly rejected his claim that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to inform him that if he were convicted of the crime of assault in the second degree, his conviction would result in his certain deportation. In 2015, this court dismissed the appeal on mootness grounds.\n   <em>\n    St. Juste\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%20164\">\n    155 Conn.

In 2018, following a grant of certification to appeal, our Supreme Court reversed the judgment of this court and remanded the case to this court with direction to consider the merits of the petitioner's appeal.\n   <em>\n    St. Juste\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492046\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1144/#p219\">\n    328 Conn. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492046\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/1144/#p219\">\n    177 A.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Having done so, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts and procedural history were set forth in this court's prior opinion, as follows: \"On July 26, 2010, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he alleged that, on December 17, 2007, he pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), and guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-211. He was represented by Attorney Howard Ignal. On January 28, 2008, he was sentenced pursuant to a plea agreement to a total effective sentence of five years incarceration, execution suspended after eighteen months, followed by five years of probation. On July 27, 2009, the petitioner, represented by Attorney Anthony Collins, filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas on the ground that at the time he entered them, he did not understand their immigration consequences. On November 17, 2009, the court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"In his two count amended petition, the petitioner alleged that Ignal rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because, among other deficiencies, he (1) failed to educate himself about the immigration consequences of the pleas, (2) misadvised the petitioner with respect to the immigration consequences of the pleas, and (3) failed to meaningfully discuss with the petitioner what immigration consequences could and/or would flow from the pleas. The petitioner alleged that Ignal's representation was below that displayed by attorneys with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law, and that but for such representation, he would not have pleaded guilty and he would have resolved the case in a way that would not result in 'deportation consequences.' In the second count of his petition, the petitioner alleged that his pleas were not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made because he made them under the mistaken belief that his conviction would not subject him to deportation. The petitioner alleged that '[a]s a result of his conviction, [he] has been ordered removed from this country by an immigration judge, and the judge's order has been\n   affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.' Additionally, the petitioner alleged that '[t]he basis for the removal order was the conviction for assault in the second degree and possession of a sawed-off shotgun.'\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Following an evidentiary hearing, the habeas court orally rendered its decision denying the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In relevant part, the court stated that it accepted as true the testimony of the petitioner's trial attorney, Ignal. The court stated: '[Ignal] clearly saw all of the problems\n   with this case, and they all spelled the word \"immigration.\" From day one, I think, he was alerted to this and did everything he could, from what I can see, to try to avert the ultimate result.' The court found that Ignal was well aware of the adverse consequences of the pleas insofar as they involved deportation, and that he had thoroughly discussed that issue with the petitioner. The court rejected the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Later, the court granted the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnotes in original.)\n   <em>\n    St. Juste\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%20164\">\n    155 Conn.

We observe that the court's ruling was based on its finding that the petitioner failed in satisfying his burden to demonstrate that Ignal's performance was deficient. The court did not reach the issue of whether the petitioner sustained his burden of demonstrating that he was prejudiced by Ignal's representation. Moreover, we observe that the petitioner's claim on appeal is limited to representation afforded to him in connection with his guilty plea for assault in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his principal appellate brief, the petitioner argues that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed because, under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed. 2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ignal rendered deficient representation in that, prior to entering the plea agreement, Ignal\n   failed to advise him \"that his [assault]\n   conviction would make him subject to automatic deportation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the petitioner argues that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of the ineffective representation because there is a reasonable probability that, if he had known the adverse immigration consequences of his plea, he would not have pleaded guilty but would have proceeded to trial.

It is a settled proposition that, prior to\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , appellate courts in Connecticut also had concluded that advice concerning collateral consequences such as deportation was not within the scope of the constitutional protection afforded by the sixth amendment. See\n   <em>\n    Thiersaint\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%2089\">\n    316 Conn. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20829\">\n    111 A.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), and cases cited therein. As our Supreme Court has explained, \"even if professional norms [prior to\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ] required that trial counsel inform a noncitizen criminal defendant of a plea's virtually mandatory deportation consequences, the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   was a new rule under Connecticut law because more than one Connecticut court had noted ... that such advice was not constitutionally required.\" Id., at 116-17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20829\">\n    111 A.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the petitioner cannot demonstrate that advice concerning deportation consequences was constitutionally required prior to\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , he has failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating that Ignal's representation was constitutionally deficient or that it rendered his plea unintelligent or involuntary in a constitutional sense.
