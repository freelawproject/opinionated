Oliver, II (Oliver) and Nicole Jernigan, individually and as personal representatives of the Estate of Randy N. Oliver, appeal, and Eastern Maine Medical Center cross-appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court (Penobscot County,\n   <em>\n    A. Murray, J.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   n.4. Oliver and Jernigan challenge the part of the judgment concluding that EMMC was not negligent when it discharged their father, Randy N. Oliver (Randy), because the discharge was contrary to the instructions they gave to the hospital in their capacity as his court-appointed guardians. Because the court did not err in its conclusions that, at the time he was discharged, Randy had regained capacity to make his own health-care decisions and that EMMC's discharge plan met the standard of care, we affirm the judgment on the liability claim. EMMC appeals the court's denial of its request for costs for expert witness fees and expenses incurred during the prelitigation screening panel process. We also affirm that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] The following facts are drawn from the court's findings, which are supported by competent record evidence, and from the procedural record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Evelyn A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328376\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/914/\">\n    2017 ME 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328376\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/914/\">\n    169 A.3d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On March 21, 2013, Randy's daughter, Nicole Jernigan, and his ex-wife, Patricia Oliver, found Randy severely intoxicated in his home and took him to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. Jernigan and Patricia told EMMC staff that Randy lived alone in his home, which had no running water and presented significant sanitation issues. They also informed hospital staff that Randy had been defrauded of money by scammers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Randy was admitted to EMMC with diagnoses that included hepatic encephalopathy (liver-related brain damage), possible alcohol withdrawal, deterioration of functional status, and a neglected state. At the time of the admission, Randy had burns on his hands. During Randy's resulting hospitalization, Jernigan and Patricia provided staff with photographs of Randy's home, which showed fire hazards inside. Jernigan also told the staff that items in the home had caught fire more than once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Randy remained hospitalized for nearly two months on a medical admission. Throughout that time, he asked to be discharged. Because of Randy's expressed and ongoing desire to leave, the hospital assigned him a one-on-one aide to prevent him from leaving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] On March 22, the day after Randy's admission, a psychiatrist conducted an emergency psychiatric evaluation of Randy, during which Randy expressed a lack of understanding about why he was in the hospital. The psychiatrist concluded that Randy's alcohol addiction was \"potentially lethal,\" that Randy likely suffered from \"significant cognitive impairment that would be slow to resolve,\" and that a guardian might eventually need to be appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Nearly a week later, on March 28, a neuropsychologist, Anthony Podraza, examined Randy. Dr. Podraza found that Randy was a \"fairly accurate historian,\" although Randy reported that his biggest problem was a faulty water heater at his\n   house. Dr. Podraza was unable to complete the testing process because of Randy's poor motivation and lack of effort, but he was able to conclude that Randy did not have \"capacity to manage simple or complex finances independently\" or \"to make informed decisions regarding his health.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] On April 5, Oliver and Jernigan filed a petition in the Waldo County Probate Court to be appointed Randy's co-guardians. In support of the petition, they submitted a report of a physician who had examined Randy on April 1 and concluded that Randy's prognosis was \"probably poor for recovery of appropriate insight necessary for self care.\" The court scheduled a guardianship hearing for May 7. In the interim, a visitor appointed by the Probate Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-303(b), (c) (2017), interviewed Randy and wrote a report recommending that a guardian be appointed and that Randy be placed in a secured dementia facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] On May 7, the Probate Court (\n   <em>\n    Longley, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a hearing on the guardianship petition and, based on the physician's report generated by the April 1 evaluation, appointed Oliver and Jernigan as Randy's co-guardians. Importantly for this action, the order stated that the guardians were authorized to \"act only as necessitated by [Randy's] actual mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting this procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 10] With the treatment provided at EMMC, Randy's condition began to improve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day as the guardianship hearing, an EMMC hospitalist who was involved in Randy's care ordered another neuropsychological examination after observing Randy and questioning the need for ongoing inpatient care. Dr. Podraza, who had examined Randy more than a month earlier, conducted the examination that day. As the court described it, Dr. Podraza's findings in his second evaluation were \"strikingly different\" from those of the March 28 assessment. Dr. Podraza described Randy as \"alert, friendly, pleasant, and very cooperative.\" Randy informed Dr. Podraza that he was anxious to return to his home and planned to quit drinking although without therapy or group support. After conducting the examination, Dr. Podraza concluded that Randy had capacity to \"manage simple or complex finances independently\" and \"make better informed decisions regarding his health.\" Dr. Podraza requested that a community case manager be referred to Randy as a condition of his release from EMMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 11] After Dr. Podraza's second neuropsychological evaluation, EMMC concluded that Randy no longer needed acute medical care and that the hospital was possibly holding him there against his will. Oliver and Jernigan, however, disputed Dr. Podraza's conclusion that Randy had regained capacity, opposed his discharge from the hospital to any setting other than a locked facility, and wanted a second opinion but were unable to find an evaluator not affiliated with EMMC. Although EMMC offered to have Randy evaluated by an EMMC practitioner, Oliver and Jernigan ultimately informed EMMC that they did not want another evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 12] EMMC's vice president and in-house legal counsel initially concluded that EMMC could not discharge Randy without his guardians' consent. The attorney then reconsidered the issue after reviewing the Probate Court's guardianship order and, based on the provision of the order that limited the guardian's authority to make\n   decisions for Randy only when Randy himself was not capable of doing so, recommended that EMMC could release Randy if and when he regained capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 13] During this time, Randy's assigned social worker at EMMC assisted Randy with filling out a petition to terminate the guardianship and a motion for appointment of counsel, which included an indigency affidavit. Although Randy independently obtained information needed for the paperwork, it was never filed with the Probate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 14] On May 16, a certified nurse practitioner at EMMC who was providing direct care to Randy assessed whether he should be discharged. Based on his own assessment and his review of Randy's medical record, including Dr. Podraza's opinion following his May 7 assessment, the certified nurse practitioner concluded that Randy had sufficient capacity to manage his own affairs and decided to discharge him. The discharge plan included referrals to Randy's primary care provider, a pain clinic, and community case management, and a recommendation to participate in substance abuse treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 15] That day, Randy's EMMC-based social worker left a message for Oliver informing him of EMMC's decision to discharge Randy and allow him to go home that day. The social worker also called and spoke directly with Jernigan, who, again, told him that neither she nor Oliver had authorized Randy's discharge. The social worker offered to arrange for a taxi to take Randy to her residence, but Jernigan declined that offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 16] EMMC went forward with its plan to discharge Randy, and he left the hospital that day with a friend. Jernigan and Patricia visited Randy at his home twice that night. When they left Randy for the final time at around 9:00 p.m., he was intoxicated. Randy died later that night as the result of a fire that destroyed his entire home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Oliver and Jernigan, individually and as representatives of Randy's Estate, filed a complaint, later amended, against EMMC in the Superior Court in late 2014. Although in its final form the complaint contained a number of counts, each of them was predicated on a claim of negligence except for a count alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court (\n   <em>\n    A. Murray, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a five-day bench trial in June of 2016. In a judgment entered on August 8, 2016, in which the court set out extensive findings of fact and a thorough legal analysis, the court concluded that EMMC was not negligent when it discharged Randy over the objection of his guardians and that the discharge plan met the standard of care. On all counts of the amended complaint, the court therefore entered judgment for EMMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b6 18] On August 15, EMMC filed a bill of costs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   14 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 to 1502-C (2017), which included expert witness fees and expenses from the prelitigation screening panel hearing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   24 M.R.S. \u00a7 2854 (2017). On August 22, Oliver and Jernigan filed a consolidated motion for amended or additional findings, for modification of the judgment, and for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Civ. P. 52, 59. On September 20,\n   the court denied their motion. After the parties filed additional argument on costs, on November 18 the court entered an order awarding some costs to EMMC but not those associated with the screening panel process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 19] EMMC filed a notice of appeal on December 2, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2(b)(3) (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 8, Oliver and Jernigan filed a cross-appeal and, in the alternative, a motion to enlarge the time in which to file the notice of appeal, claiming they had not received notice of the order denying their August 22 motion because the clerk had not sent the order to their attorney. Without determining whether Oliver and Jernigan's appeal was timely, the court denied the motion to enlarge, and Oliver and Jernigan filed a separate notice of appeal from that order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 20] The principal issues on appeal are Oliver and Jernigan's challenge to the court's conclusion that EMMC was not negligent and EMMC's challenge to the court's denial of some of its costs. Before considering those contentions, we address the question of whether the notices of appeal were filed in a timely way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Timeliness of Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 21] Because EMMC and Jernigan and Oliver filed their notices of appeal more than twenty-one days after the entry of judgment, we must consider whether the notices were timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 22] To be timely, a notice of appeal must be filed within twenty-one days after the judgment is entered in the docket, absent exceptions that are not present here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2(b)(3) (Tower 2016). Here, the judgment on the merits of the complaint was entered on August 8, 2016. EMMC then filed a timely bill of costs on August 15, and the court entered an order allowing some costs and denying others on November 18. On December 2-a date within twenty-one days after the entry of the court's order on costs-EMMC filed its notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 23] In a case where there are several trial court judgments or other dispositive orders, we will \"review each to determine at what point the court fully decided and disposed of the whole matter leaving nothing further for the consideration and judgment of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal Ventures v. Alsham Plaza, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286763\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/1/416/\">\n    2010 ME 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286763\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/1/416/\">\n    1 A.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations omitted) (quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E. Perry Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. City of Portland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429475\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/896/956/\">\n    2006 ME 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429475\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/896/956/\">\n    896 A.2d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, at least as to EMMC, the judgment did not become final until November 18, when the court resolved the request for an award of costs. Until the court issued that order, there was nothing on which EMMC could present the challenge it pursues here, namely, its contention that the court erred by denying an award of some of the costs it sought to recover from Jernigan and Oliver. EMMC's notice of appeal, filed within twenty-one days after the court's order on costs, was therefore timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 24] Jernigan and Oliver then filed a cross-appeal on December 8-six days after EMMC filed its notice of appeal. If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party is entitled to file a notice of appeal within fourteen days after the first notice of appeal is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   M.R. App. P. 2(b)(3) (Tower 2016). The notice of appeal filed by Jernigan and Oliver therefore was timely because the deadline for their appeal is measured by the date of EMMC's appeal and not the date when the judgment was entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 25] EMMC argues that any issues on appeal are limited to the November 18 order on costs because the time to appeal as calculated from August 8-the date when the judgment was entered-had long passed by December 8. The Maine Rules of Appellate Procedure state, however, that \"[a]n appeal from a judgment, whenever taken, preserves for review\n   <em>\n    any claim of error\n   </em>\n   in the record.\" M.R. App. P. 2(b)(4) (Tower 2016) (emphasis added). Jernigan and Oliver are therefore permitted to pursue their challenge to the judgment on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B. Oliver and Jernigan's Claims against EMMC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 26] Oliver and Jernigan assert that, by rejecting their claim against EMMC, the court erred in several respects: by concluding that the Probate Court's guardianship order did not preclude EMMC from discharging Randy, given the contrary instructions they had given in their capacity as Randy's court-appointed guardians; by concluding that Randy had regained capacity to make the decision to be discharged; and by concluding that EMMC's discharge plan was reasonable. We first review the statutory framework applicable to guardianships in these circumstances and then consider the strands of Oliver and Jernigan's argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   1. Guardianship Statutes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 27] \"We review issues of law de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Levesque v. Cent. Me. Med.

Specifically, when considering issues of statutory interpretation, we will \"examine the entirety of the statute, giving due weight to design, structure, and purpose as well as to aggregate language.\"\n   <em>\n    Dickau v. Vt. Mut. Ins.

The appointment of a guardian affects the incapacitated person's personal liberties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guardianship of Collier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7875320\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/653/898/#p900\">\n    653 A.2d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 900 (Me. 1995). Consequently, when entering a guardianship order, the court is required to exercise its appointment authority in a way that \"encourage[s] the development of maximum self reliance and independence of the incapacitated person and make[s] appointive and other orders only to the extent necessitated by the incapacitated person's actual mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting the procedure.\" 18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-304(a). To implement this objective, in appropriate circumstances a court may-as the Probate Court did here-appoint a limited guardian, which is a category of guardians \"established to assure flexibility in dealing with special circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    In re James John L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11942392\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/601/630/#p631\">\n    601 A.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631 (Me. 1992) (quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-105 (2017). Section 5-105 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In any case in which a guardian can be appointed by the court, the judge may appoint a limited guardian with fewer than all of the legal powers and duties of a guardian. The specific duties and powers of a limited guardian shall be enumerated in the decree or court order. A person for whom a limited guardian has been appointed retains all legal and civil rights except those which have been suspended by the decree or order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b6 29] Pursuant to the Probate Code, when a guardian's authority extends to health-care decisions, the guardian may \"give or withhold consents or approvals related to medical or other professional care ... for the ward.\" 18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-312(a)(3) (2017). In doing so, however, the guardian must \"make a health-care decision in accordance with the ward's individual instructions, if any, and other wishes expressed while the ward had capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b6 30] The Probate Code contains the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act (UHDA) as adopted in Maine,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5-801 to 5-818 (2017), which outlines the obligations of a health-care provider with regard to a patient's health-care decisions, including where a guardian has been appointed for the patient.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11942392\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/601/630/#p631\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-807.

Effect of the Guardianship Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b6 31] The letters of guardianship appointing Oliver and Jernigan as guardians for Randy stated, \"Unless limitations appear above, [Jernigan and Oliver] shall have custody of [Randy] and all other duties of a Guardian under law until further order of this Court or until [Randy's] need for a guardian is otherwise terminated.\" This grant of authority, however, was made subject to a condition that Oliver and Jernigan \"act only as necessitated by [Randy's] actual mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting this procedure.\" Oliver and Jernigan assert that this language in the order did not limit their authority to make health-care decisions while the order remained in effect and that the order barred EMMC from acting on Randy's own decision to leave the hospital. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b6 32] The limiting language contained in the guardianship order is derived from section 5-304(a). That statute is directed to\n   <em>\n    the court\n   </em>\n   's exercise of authority in setting the terms of the guardianship in a way that does not interfere excessively with the ward's autonomy. Here, however, the court chose to use that limiting language to define the scope of\n   <em>\n    the guardians'\n   </em>\n   authority to act on Randy's behalf. Although Oliver and Jernigan seek to diminish the significance of that limitation by characterizing it as a boilerplate provision of the order, the words chosen by the court have effect and must be given their plain meaning,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnell v. Burnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314138\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/390/\">\n    2012 ME 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314138\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/390/\">\n    40 A.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as the clear terms of that provision establish, Oliver and Jernigan-as guardians-were authorized to make health-care decisions for Randy \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to the extent\n   <em>\n    necessitated\n   </em>\n   by [Randy's] actual mental and adaptive limitations.\" (Emphases added.) This language is more than precatory. Rather, set in concrete terms, the order circumscribed the scope of the guardians' authority and the circumstances in which they had authority to make decisions for Randy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b6 33] Therefore, the court did not err by determining that the Probate Court's guardianship order did not, as a matter of\n   <em>\n    law\n   </em>\n   , preclude EMMC from acting on Randy's wish to be discharged from in-patient hospitalization. The next question is whether, as a matter of\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   , Randy had regained capacity that would activate the limitation in the guardianship order, thereby stripping the guardians of their authority-while Randy had capacity-to make health-care decisions for him and correspondingly allowing him to make his own decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3.

Although the evidence on that issue was disputed, the record fully supports the court's ultimate and closely analyzed determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v. Cheskin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335219\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/82/1221/\">\n    2013 ME 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335219\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/82/1221/\">\n    82 A.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We defer to the trial court's determination of witnesses' credibility and its resolution of conflicts in testimony.\"). A number of EMMC providers who interacted with Randy during his hospitalization reached that conclusion and testified to the reasons they determined that Randy had capacity. For example, based on the evaluation conducted on May 7, Dr. Podraza-who had the benefit of having assessed Randy more than a month earlier and in fact was assigned to conduct the May 7 evaluation for that reason, and whose evaluation, according to expert witnesses called by EMMC, met the standard of care-concluded that Randy had regained capacity. The court also credited the testimony and conclusion reached by the certified nurse practitioner, who was providing direct care for Randy during the last few days of Randy's admission and determined that Randy had \"sufficient insight and judgment to manage his person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b6 36] As the court also noted, Randy's hospital records showed that his behavior and engagement with others in the hospital setting showed significant improvement-he had become fully oriented, his physical condition had improved, he was eating and sleeping well, he was engaged in an exercise program, and he was attending to his hygiene. Randy's planning and behavior leading up to and immediately following the discharge-for example, arranging for a ride from a friend rather than from family members who might be expected to interfere with his discharge, and going to a store to purchase specific items he needed-are indicative of capacity. Further, two expert witnesses-a psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist-explained that Randy had capacity to be discharged. The court's finding that Randy had capacity as of May 16 is well supported by the evidence and not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 37] Oliver and Jernigan assert that the Probate Court's determination, which was a predicate to the guardianship order, that Randy had \"capacity conditions which warrant an appointment of a guardian\" barred both EMMC and, later, the court from concluding differently. This contention is undermined by the very terms of the guardianship order, which framed the guardians' authority as a function of Randy's \"\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting this procedure.\" (Emphasis added.) The order signals an expectation, not of stasis, but of a dynamic situation where changes in Randy's condition-his \"actual\" level of capacity-would define the nature and extent of the guardians' authority. This would necessarily call for an ongoing assessment of Randy's capacity, which is what both EMMC and the court properly did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b6 38] For these reasons, the court did not err by concluding that EMMC properly complied with the directive made by Randy-a patient with capacity-that he\n   be discharged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   4. Adequacy of Discharge Plan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b6 39] Finally, the parties do not dispute that EMMC was required to provide Randy with a safe and reasonable discharge plan. The court thoroughly analyzed the evidence on this issue, including expert testimony and evidence of the events leading up to Randy's discharge. On that basis, not only did the court conclude that Oliver and Jernigan did not prove that the discharge plan was deficient, but the court found affirmatively that the discharge plan was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b6 40] The discharge plan included an appointment, made by EMMC, at a pain clinic;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   an appointment, also made by EMMC, for Randy to see his primary care physician four days after discharge; and contact information given to Randy for case management services. The discharge plan also included a strong recommendation to Randy that he stop drinking and attend group meetings, and EMMC offered substance abuse counseling. By the time he was discharged, Randy had come to admit that he was an alcoholic and stated that he would try to stop drinking although without substance abuse counseling or attendance at group meetings. The court found that this acknowledgement showed insight and significant progress and that, because Randy was medically stable and had capacity when he was discharged, EMMC was obligated to comply with his wish to leave, notwithstanding the prospect that he would resume drinking-a decision Randy was entitled to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b6 41] Before he was discharged, Randy's nurse reviewed the discharge plan with him, and he indicated that he understood. Finally, the social worker working with Randy at the time of the discharge notified Jernigan that Randy was about to be released. The court considered the relatively short amount of notice provided to Jernigan but concluded, without error, that EMMC was required to act on Randy's insistence to leave the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 42] The court did not commit clear error by concluding that EMMC provided Randy with a safe and reasonable discharge and was not negligent in discharging him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C. EMMC's Bill of Costs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b6 43] We turn finally to EMMC's assertion that the court erred by denying its bill of costs for expert witness fees and expenses incurred during the mandatory prelitigation panel proceedings held pursuant to 24 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2851 - 2859 (2017). \"We review issues of law de novo,\"\n   <em>\n    Levesque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312750\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/52/933/\">\n    2012 ME 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312750\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/52/933/\">\n    52 A.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but review \"the decision of the court to award costs for an abuse of discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Poland v.

From this, it is apparent that the Probate Court intended the guardianship to be limited. As noted in the text, section 5-105 requires the court, when creating a limited guardianship, to \"enumerate[ ]\" the \"specific duties and powers\" of the limited guardian. The order here did not do so. Rather than affirmatively and specifically delineating the guardians' duties and powers created by the order, it stated in a non-specific way that the guardians would have \"custody\" of Randy and \"all other duties of a Guardian under law.\" This stands in contrast to the provisions of 18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 5-312 (2017), which lists, in specific terms, the powers and duties that a court may grant to a guardian. The order here then purports only to set two\n    <em>\n     limitations\n    </em>\n    on the non-specific grant of authority to the guardians, namely, that the guardians were entitled to \"act only as necessitated by [Randy's] actual mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting this procedure\" and that the guardians were to assure that Randy's right to vote was \"honor[ed].\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Oliver and Jernigan and EMMC have not challenged the validity of the guardianship order as measured by the requirements of section 5-105-something that is understandable given that much of their argument to the court and on this appeal is predicated on that order.
