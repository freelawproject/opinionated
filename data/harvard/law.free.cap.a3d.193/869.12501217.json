Judge James H. Pickering, Jr. conducted the trial, entered the order, and rendered a sixty-six page written decision. He concluded that plaintiff unlawfully removed the children from New Jersey without first complying with N.J.S.A. 9:2-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff gave defendant less than one day's notice about the move, and although defendant objected, plaintiff moved to South Carolina without first obtaining an order permitting the relocation. Defendant filed an order to show cause (OTSC) seeking custody and the return of the children to New Jersey. The judge found plaintiff knew the statute required that he obtain an order permitting the removal before relocating to South Carolina, but he removed the children anyway, because he feared the court might grant defendant's pending motion for overnight visits with the children. After losing the trial, plaintiff sought reconsideration of the order under review, and for the first time, requested a best interests analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold - because defendant had objected to the South Carolina move - that N.J.S.A. 9:2-2 required plaintiff to first obtain an order permitting the removal of the children from this jurisdiction before the actual relocation. The time for the judge to determine whether plaintiff had established \"cause\" for the removal of the children would have been before the relocation occurred. Requiring the judge to analyze whether \"cause\" existed after the relocation ignores the unambiguous plain text of the statute, plaintiff's ultimate burden of proof to demonstrate \"cause\" before the move occurs, and the important Legislative purpose for requiring a showing of cause - that is, to preserve the rights of a noncustodial parent to maintain and develop her familial relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We therefore affirm. Our affirmance is without prejudice, however, to plaintiff seeking an appropriate order under N.J.S.A. 9:2-2 should he decide to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties were never married. They had two children together, born in 2007 and 2009. In approximately 2011, they agreed to joint physical custody of the children, and for eighteen months, they shared parenting time. In October 2013, plaintiff became the parent of primary residence. At all relevant times, they shared legal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Initially, plaintiff developed an interest in relocating with the children to Florida. On May 1, 2015, the parties entered into a limited consent order (the May 2015 order) permitting plaintiff to relocate with the children from New Jersey to Florida. The May 2015 order - which mentioned Florida seven times and omits any reference to South Carolina - contemplated defendant's parenting time before and after the expected move to Florida. Plaintiff never relocated to Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2015, while the children remained in New Jersey, defendant filed a motion seeking overnight parenting time with the children. The motion had been initially returnable in February 2016, but the parties asked the judge to adjourn that\n   date so they\n   could negotiate. The judge carried the return date to March 2016, but plaintiff requested the judge relist argument for April 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While the motion was pending, at 8:37 p.m. on Sunday, April 3, 2016, plaintiff told defendant he and the children would be moving to South Carolina the next day, and he offered her ten minutes in the morning to say goodbye. Although defendant adamantly objected, plaintiff relocated with the children to South Carolina on the morning of April 4, 2016, without obtaining an order permitting the move.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the April 7 return date, a motion judge (the motion judge) - not the judge who entered the order under review - conducted oral argument on defendant's motion for overnight parenting time. The motion judge learned for the first time that plaintiff had taken the children to South Carolina three days earlier, and informed plaintiff's counsel that the May 2015 order did not authorize the move to South Carolina. In response, plaintiff's counsel presented a proposed consent order, signed only by plaintiff, the purpose of which was to permit the move, albeit after the fact. Defendant repeated her strong objection and refused to sign the proposed order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also on the April 7 return date, the motion judge, as an interim measure to deal with the new information she had just learned, temporarily allowed the children to remain in South Carolina \"until further order\" of the court. As part of that order, she did not perform - nor was she asked to do so - a best interests analysis or otherwise determine, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 9:2-2, whether \"cause\" existed for plaintiff to remove the children from New Jersey. The motion judge made no findings of fact or conclusions of law as to plaintiff's decision to relocate to South Carolina. Importantly, the motion judge stated that she allowed the removal only on a temporary basis and that the relocation \"procedurally may have been defective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The children remained in South Carolina for approximately two months. In June, plaintiff and the children returned to New\n   Jersey, but again on July 28, 2016 - without obtaining defendant's consent or a court order - plaintiff returned to South Carolina with the children. Defendant then retained counsel to petition the court for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In September 2016, defendant filed her OTSC. With counsel's assistance, defendant requested the court do two things: (1) require plaintiff return the children to New Jersey, and (2) award her sole custody. By this time, she did not know where in South Carolina the children resided, or have any other basic information about the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the initial return of the OTSC, the judge ordered electronic communication between defendant and the children. The judge confirmed plaintiff's address in South Carolina and established parenting time for defendant. The judge then tried the case on five days between February and May 2017. Thereafter, Judge Pickering made numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the unlawful removal and defendant's request for custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to the relocation, the judge concluded that plaintiff violated N.J.S.A. 9:2-2. The judge found plaintiff moved out of State without defendant's consent, knowing that the May 2015 order applied only to Florida. The judge found that the proposed order, the one only plaintiff signed and presented to the motion judge, added additional proof that plaintiff understood that the May 2015 order did not authorize the move to South Carolina. After assessing credibility issues, he found that plaintiff intentionally left New Jersey on April 4,\n   knowing it was illegal. The judge entered a parenting plan, and then directed plaintiff to consult with defendant about all \"issues to which [defendant] is entitled to have input [on] as a joint custodian,\" such as where in New Jersey the children would reside. The order required the children be returned within ten days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The judge then denied defendant's request to modify the custody arrangement after applying the governing case law and factors\n   listed in N.J.S.A. 9:2-4(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge used these factors solely for his custody analysis. Although the factors are relevant for determining whether \"cause\" exists under N.J.S.A. 9:2-2, a judge undertaking such an evaluation may supplement the \"cause\" analysis by considering other factors as appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Bisbing v. Bisbing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302066\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/230/309/#p338\">\n    230 N.J. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302066\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/230/309/#p338\">\n    166 A.3d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The judge considered the N.J.S.A. 9:2-4(c) factors using the evidence relevant to custody. Plaintiff never asked the judge - before the move, during the trial, or before the August 17, 2017 order - to determine whether he had \"cause\" to relocate to South Carolina. Thus, the failure to do so deprived the judge from supplementing his findings and conclusions regarding the N.J.S.A. 9:2-4(c) factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff then moved for reconsideration of the August 17, 2017 order requiring that he return the children to New Jersey. As part of his motion, plaintiff requested - for the first time - that the judge perform a best interests of the child analysis. Up until this point, plaintiff had never requested such an analysis, be it one guided by\n   <em>\n    Baures\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Bisbing\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff did not ask the judge on\n   reconsideration to evaluate whether he had \"cause\" to remove the children to South Carolina. It was too late for that. Instead, plaintiff contended that before the judge ordered him to return the children to New Jersey, defendant had the burden to show it would be in the best interests of the children to do so. Judge Pickering rejected plaintiff's burden-shifting\n   argument and denied reconsideration rendering a twenty-page written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff argues that the May 2015 order authorized the move to South Carolina. He contends that even if that was not the case, then the motion judge's temporary order permitting the children to remain in South Carolina satisfied the requirements of N.J.S.A. 9:2-2. Plaintiff asserts that the language of this statute does not require he first obtain an order permitting the relocation before the actual move. The premise of his argument is that a parent could remove his children from this State - without the other parent's consent or a court order - and then after the move, make the other parent demonstrate on her motion to return the children to New Jersey that it would be in their best interests to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We begin by interpreting N.J.S.A. 9:2-2.

Applying these standards, we have no reason to disturb the judge's findings of fact or conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The judge found that the May 2015 order (which did not alter the parties' joint custody) authorized plaintiff and the children to relocate only to Florida. The judge reached that finding after taking testimony from the parties and reading the order. The judge found that in March 2014, plaintiff began living with an individual who had two children of her own. He married her (the wife) in the summer of 2014, and plaintiff wished to take his children to Florida, to care for the wife's mother. The parties then negotiated the terms of the May 2015 order, which included\n   parenting time in New Jersey and Florida. Defendant testified that she understood the relocation would be around the Orlando area, where the wife's mother lived. The parties' negotiations had nothing to do with the children living in South Carolina under any circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But while still living in New Jersey with plaintiff in November 2015, the wife (who has since divorced plaintiff) and her two children left plaintiff and moved to Florida. The judge found that plaintiff then moved to South Carolina, while defendant's motion for overnight parenting time was pending, \"to deny defendant parenting time,\" specifically to \"avoid the possibility that the [motion judge would grant] overnight visits with defendant.\" He found plaintiff \"took actions to be sure defendant did not have sufficient time to get a court order to stop the move.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Furthermore, in addition to the plain terms of the May 2015 order, the judge found plaintiff knew he lacked defendant's consent to move to South Carolina. Two weeks before plaintiff relocated to South Carolina, plaintiff retained counsel to prepare the proposed order seeking defendant's consent, which she never gave. And only plaintiff signed the proposed order on the morning he took the children to South Carolina. The judge therefore found that plaintiff moved to South Carolina \"knowing full well that he was doing so against the law of the State of New Jersey and the May 1, 2015 [c]onsent [o]rder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, plaintiff's contention that the motion judge's ruling satisfied N.J.S.A. 9:2-2 ignores, in the absence of defendant's consent, the statute's requirement that he show \"cause\" before removing the children from New Jersey. The motion judge made no such finding, and stated that plaintiff's relocation to South Carolina was essentially procedurally deficient. The temporary order entered by the motion judge did not satisfy the statute, especially because its issuance ignored plaintiff's ultimate burden of proof obligation. And there is no suggestion that defendant had consented to her children remaining in South Carolina, as ordered\n   by the motion judge. In fact, the temporary arrangement led to defendant's OTSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff argues that once he relocated with the children to South Carolina - without defendant's consent or a court order - defendant had the burden to show that plaintiff lacked cause to remove them from New Jersey before the judge could mandate their return. Plaintiff suggests that defendant would do that by demonstrating that it would be in the best interests of the children to return them to New Jersey. According to plaintiff's logic, defendant would need to file a motion to return the children, who he had removed in violation of N.J.S.A. 9:2-2, and as part of that motion, assume the burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Such an approach would encourage individuals to first remove children from this jurisdiction, then later seek court approval. When the other parent objects beforehand, the process envisioned by N.J.S.A. 9:2-2 is for the parent seeking to relocate to first apply for an order permitting relocation, establish \"cause,\" then relocate only if permitted by the court. The process does not permit a parent to relocate and then attempt to shift the burden to the other parent to show on an application to return the children that it would be in their best interests to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When the other parent objects, the parent seeking removal of the children has the ultimate burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence. Requiring the burden of proof to shift to defendant to show that it would be in the children's best interests, as a condition precedent to returning them to New Jersey, ignores the Legislature's reason for requiring a preliminary demonstration of \"cause\" under N.J.S.A. 9:2-2 before the actual removal. It is to \"preserve the rights of the noncustodial parent and the child to maintain and develop their familial relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Bisbing\n   </em>\n   , 230 N.J. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302066\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/230/309/#p338\">\n    166 A.3d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Under the facts of this case, preserving defendant's rights to maintain and develop her familial relationship with the\n   children required - by the plain text of N.J.S.A. 9:2-2 - that plaintiff first obtain an order, before removing the children, by showing \"cause\" existed for the relocation to South Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff had numerous opportunities to apply for an order permitting the move before relocating to South Carolina. He could have filed such an application after the parties consented to the May 2015 order, when it became apparent to him that he would not be following through on his intention to live in Florida with the wife.
