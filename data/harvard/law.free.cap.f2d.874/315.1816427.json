SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">During an investigation into alleged fraud by a United States government contractor, Veterans Administration (VA) officials surreptitiously taped a series of conversations among undercover government agents, employees of the contractor, and third parties. In response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, for transcripts of the tapes, the government released copies of the transcripts from which it deleted (1) identifying information regarding the suspects and third parties and (2) medical information about one particular third party. The district court ordered the government to produce unredacted copies of the transcripts; because we conclude that the information withheld by the government comes within the FOIA exemption for \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes [the disclosure of which] ... (C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(C), we reverse and render.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">In 1984, Santa Fe Engineers, Inc. (\u201cSanta Fe\u201d), contracted with the VA to renovate two VA medical centers; Santa Fe in turn subcontracted a portion of this work relating to asbestos removal to All Professional Services, Inc. (APS). During the course of the work, APS alleged, Santa Fe sent a letter to APS suggesting that the two firms bill the government for more than the contract price \u2014 $30 per cubic foot removed \u2014 and split the excess. APS perceived this suggestion as a kickback proposal, and so informed the VA Office of Inspector General.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">In response to the tip, the Inspector General, working with APS employees, began an undercover investigation of Santa Fe. During the investigation, the Inspector General had APS employees or an undercover federal agent wear hidden microphones to tape, secretly, conversations with Santa Fe employees. Six transcripts, totaling 198 pages, were made from these tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">After the investigation was completed, the Inspector General recommended to the Justice Department that criminal indictments be sought against Santa Fe and three of its employees. The United States Attorney\u2019s Office, after reviewing the evidence and the Inspector General\u2019s recommendation, declined to prosecute, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe lack of sufficient evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">Bernard Halloran, an attorney, began representing APS in 1985, while the investigation was underway. During this time, Halloran, on behalf of APS, sought to collect money from Santa Fe for work performed by APS on, <em>inter alia, </em>the VA project. Currently, the dispute between APS and Santa Fe over the amount due APS for its work on the VA project is the subject of a civil lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">Pursuant to the FOIA, Halloran requested that the VA release to him, <em>inter alia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the transeipts of the conversations secretly taped during the Inspector General\u2019s investigation. Although it notified Halloran that it was processing his request, the YA failed to produce the transcripts within the statutory period, and Halloran filed the instant suit. Shortly thereafter, the VA released redacted copies of the transcripts; these redactions are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The YA made two sets of deletions from the transcripts. First, it deleted the names of, and other identifying information relating to, forty-two individuals, i.e., the three unindicted suspects of the investigation, other persons participating in the conversations, and third parties mentioned in the conversations, including one federal employee who was not involved in the investigation. The VA did not delete from the transcripts the names of APS employees mentioned in Halloran\u2019s FOIA request or the federal special agents who worked with APS during the investigation. Second, the VA deleted medical information, relating to one person, that had been revealed during the course of one of the conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Halloran objected to the deletions, contending that the information deleted was not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. After performing an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the unedited transcripts, the district court concluded that the FOIA exemptions under which the VA sought to justify the deletions were not applicable. Accordingly, it ordered the VA to produce the deleted information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The VA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The VA argues that its refusal to release the identifying and medical information is justified under both FOIA exemption 6, which excepts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), and exemption 7(C), which excepts \u201crecords or information compiled for law enforcement purposes ... [the disclosure of which] could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). We conclude that the district court erred by rejecting the VA\u2019s argument that the deleted information was protected from disclosure under exemption 7(C); for that reason, we do not reach the issue of whether the same information is also within the scope of exemption 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Although the FOIA embodies \u201ca general philosophy of full agency disclosure,\u201d <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 360, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1598-99, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) (quoting S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1965)), the Act also reflects Congress\u2019s awareness that other concerns may require a departure from this general philosophy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">The Act expressly recognizes ... that public disclosure is not always in the public interest and consequently provides that agency records may be withheld from disclosure under any one of the nine exemptions defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-14\"><em>Baldrige v. Shapiro, </em>455 U.S. 345, 352, 102 S.Ct. 1103, 1108, 71 L.Ed.2d 199 (1982). One of the most important concerns counterbalancing the public\u2019s general interest in disclosure is the desire to protect individuals\u2019 privacy interests; it is for this reason that two out of the nine exemptions, exemptions 6 and 7(C), refer explicitly to \u201cprivacy,\u201d with several others motivated by privacy concerns as well.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Congress contemplated that in applying these exemptions, courts would reconcile these competing interests by balancing all while ignoring none. It is not, Congress noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">an easy task to balance the opposing interests, but it is not an impossible one either.... Success lies in providing a workable formula which encompasses, balances, and protects all interests, yet places emphasis on the fullest responsible disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">S.Rep. No. 813 at 3 (quoted in <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 80, 93 S.Ct. 827, 832-33, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973)). If more proof of this fact is needed, an explicit statutory warrant to engage in such guided balancing can be found in the language of the exemptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Reviewing courts have decided FOIA cases using precisely the sort of structured balancing test contemplated by Congress. <em>See Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 1476, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989); <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 370-73, 96 S.Ct. at 1603-05; <em>Senate of Puerto Rico v. Department of Justice, </em>823 F.2d 574, 587 (D.C.Cir.1987). The first step is to identify and evaluate the specific privacy interests implicated by the information encompassed by the disclosure request. <em>See Reporters Committee, </em>109 S.Ct. at 1476-80; <em>Lesar v. Department of Justice, </em>636 F.2d 472, 488 (D.C.Cir.1980). Conversely, the next step is to identify and evaluate the particular public interests that may be served \u2014 or disserved \u2014 by disclosure of the information. <em>See Reporters Committee, </em>109 S.Ct. at 1480-83. Only after first examining each interest do we perform the actual weighing of the interests for and against disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">This balancing process must be guided by the nuances of the statutory text. Prior to 1986, exemption 7(C), like exemption 6, applied to disclosures that \u201cwould constitute\u201d an invasion of privacy. In 1986, Congress amended exemption 7(C), substituting for the phrase \u201cwould constitute\u201d the phrase \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute.\u201d In the Court\u2019s view, the amendment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">represents a considered congressional effort 'to ease considerably a Federal law enforcement agency\u2019s burden in invoking [Exemption 7]\u2019.... [I]n determining the impact on personal privacy from disclosure of law enforcement records or information, the stricter standard of whether such disclosure \u2018would\u2019 constitute an unwarranted invasion of such privacy gives way to the more flexible standard of whether such disclosure \u2018could reasonably be expected to\u2019 constitute such an invasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-13\"><em>Reporters Committee, id. </em>at 1473 n. 9 (quoting 132 Cong.Rec. S16504 (Oct. 15, 1986) (statement of Sen. Hatch)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">There is another crucial difference between the language in exemptions 6 and 7(C) that guides our application of the exemption 7(C) balancing test. Unlike exemption 6, which requires that an invasion of privacy be \u201cclearly unwarranted\u201d before nondisclosure is authorized, exemption 7(C) omits the adverb \u201cclearly,\u201d requiring only that the invasion of privacy be \u201cunwarranted.\u201d This omission, the product of explicit bargaining between the President and Congress, has been interpreted to mean that Congress intended that \u201cthe standard for evaluating a threatened invasion of privacy interests resulting from the disclosure of records compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d be somewhat broader than that used for exemption 6. <em>See Reporters Committee, id. </em>at 1472-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">From the district court\u2019s opinion on summary judgment, we can discern three alternative conclusions regarding the privacy interests that would be implicated by disclosure of identifying information in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>transcripts. First, it concluded that the exemptions were not \u201capplicable\u201d because \u201c[t]he conversations are about business activities,\u201d which we take to be a conclusion that the individuals identified in or by the transcripts have no privacy interests regarding such activities. Second, the court concluded that no invasion of privacy would occur because much of the information in controversy was already public insofar as APS, a nongovernmental entity, was involved in the investigation. Finally, the court reached the blanket conclusion that, as to the twenty-eight individuals who were identified in the transcripts only by their first names, no invasion of privacy would occur because \u201c[f]irst names are not intimate information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">Because the district court based its decision not upon the unique facts of this case, but upon categorical rules regarding what does and does not constitute an invasion of privacy for FOIA purposes, we treat its conclusions as conclusions of law, and thus review them <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As to each of the district court\u2019s conclusions, we disagree. Based upon past precedent and the statutory purposes underlying the FOIA, we find the privacy interests involved in this case to be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">As an initial matter, we note that we are not required to determine with absolute certainty the effects of releasing the information in controversy. Indeed, as already noted, exemption 7(C) requires only that we find that the disclosure of the records or information \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute\u201d an unwarranted invasion of privacy before nondisclosure is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Thus, courts have accepted, as valid, affidavits from government officials that identify the privacy interests at stake only in general terms, as <em>\u201c </em>\u2018[i]t is difficult if not impossible, to anticipate all respects in which disclosure might damage reputations or lead to personal embarrassment and discomfort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lesare, </em>636 F.2d 472, at 488 (D.C.Cir.1980) (quoting and <em>affirming Lesar v. Department of Justice, </em>455 F.Supp. 921, 925 (D.D.C.1978)). We thus do not require that the government detail the precise harm which disclosure would inflict upon the privacy interests of each individual; rather, it must only show that release of the information \u201ccould reasonably\u201d result in an unwarranted invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u2018There can be no clearer example of an unwarranted invasion of privacy than to release to the public that another individual was the subject of [a criminal] investigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Senate of Puerto Rico, </em>823 F.2d at 588 (quoting <em>Baez v. Department of Justice, </em>647 F.2d 1328, 1338 (D.C.Cir.1980)). This fact has long been recognized in the FOIA context, and has often served as the basis for excepting information from disclosure under exemption 7(C).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, as to the three unindicted suspects of the investigation\u2014and other Santa Fe employees who, although not technically considered \u201csuspects,\u201d may have been objects of investigative concern\u2014-we conclude that the privacy interests working against disclosure are substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Similarly, courts have recognized that persons who are not the subjects of the investigation may nonetheless have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>connection with the investigation. \u201cExemption 7(C) is intended to protect the privacy of any person mentioned in the requested files, not only the person who is the object of the investigation.\u201d <em>McCorstin v. Department of Labor, </em>630 F.2d 242, 245 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 999, 101 S.Ct. 1705, 68 L.Ed.2d 201 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In this case, many of the nonsuspects who are identified or referred to in the transcripts have discernible privacy interests in not having their thoughts, comments, and views regarding their work, their job performance, and their co-workers, clients, and friends released to the public. Moreover, merely being associated with a criminal investigation may lead to further embarrassment and difficulties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The affidavits from two VA officials explaining their refusal to release the redacted names and identifying information cite, for each individual, precisely these concerns; again, we conclude that the district court\u2019s refusal to acknowledge that there are any privacy interests threatened by disclosure constitutes legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We thus reject as overbroad the district court\u2019s declaration that there were no privacy interests implicated by the transcripts because the participants discussed only \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d The extent of one\u2019s privacy cannot be determined merely by making an isolated assessment of the subject nature of the information; thus, for example, it is incorrect to cabin the concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d by restricting a person\u2019s right to invoke it to only the personal or intimate details of his or her life.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Reporters Committee, </em>the Supreme Court used the following broad definition of \u201cprivacy\u201d for the purposes of the FOIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">[Information may be classified as \u2018private\u2019 if it is \u2018intended for or restricted to the use of a particular person or groups or class of persons: not freely available to the public.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">109 S.Ct. at 1476 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1804 (1976)) (footnote omitted). Our analysis is thus based not solely upon the subject matter of the information, but also upon the manner in which the information relating to the individuals was obtained and whether they have a reasonable interest in preventing its public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">We similarly reject as overly simplistic the district court\u2019s conclusion that the release of the first names of twenty-eight individuals would not implicate any privacy interests because first names are not \u201cintimate\u201d information. In both FOIA and other contexts involving privacy concerns, it has long been the rule that our concern is not with the identifying information <em>per se, </em>but with the connection between such information and some other detail \u2014 a statement, an event, or otherwise \u2014which the individual would not wish to be publicly disclosed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Finally, the district court reasoned that because APS, a nongovernmental entity, had participated in the investigation, no invasion of privacy could occur because the information was already \u201cknown to the public.\u201d There are two flaws in the court\u2019s reasoning. First, there is no support in the record for the proposition that APS\u2019s knowledge is sufficient to, as it were, \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d in the transcripts such that it can attribute all of the references and comments in the transcripts to specific individuals. Undoubtedly, to the extent that APS employees actually participated in some of the conversations, they may have some memory of with whom they were talking and the topics discussed, although the conversations took place over five years ago. That fact, however, does not destroy any specific individual\u2019s privacy interest in having specific comments unambiguously attributed to them by government-released records.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Second, that otherwise-private information may have been at one time or in some way in the \u201cpublic\u201d domain does not mean that a person irretrievably loses his or her privacy interests in it. In <em>Reporters Committee, </em>a case decided after the district court rendered its decision in this case, the Court held that individuals retained privacy interests in \u201crap sheets\u201d \u2014 files collating a person\u2019s criminal history \u2014 maintained by the FBI, despite the fact that all of the information contained in the files was gleaned from public records scattered throughout the country. The Court\u2019s reasoning is instructive here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">In an organized society, there are few facts that are not at one time or another divulged to another. Thus the extent of the protection accorded a privacy right at common law rested in part on the degree of dissemination of the allegedly private fact and the extent to which the passage of time rendered it private....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">In addition to the common-law and dictionary understanding, the basic difference between scattered bits of criminal history and a federal compilation, federal statutory provisions, and state policies, our cases have also recognized the privacy interest inherent in the nondisclosure of certain information even where the information may have been at one time public....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">109 S.Ct. at 1476-78.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">It was thus incorrect for the district court to conclude categorically that the individuals identified in the transcripts lost all privacy interests in the information relating to them in the transcripts merely because some other individuals may have knowledge of the conversations. To the contrary, our discussion, <em>supra, </em>of these privacy interests indicates that the identified individuals still retain substantial interests in preventing the further dissemination of the information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Admittedly, without knowing in detail the particular facts of each individual\u2019s life and relationships with employers, clients, and co-workers, it is difficult to conclude that the privacy interests of those persons mentioned only in passing are without doubt substantial, such that they may be overcome by only the greatest public interests. It must be remembered, however, that we have as of yet looked at only one side of the scale; even a small and potentially uncertain invasion of privacy engendered by the release of identifying information may nonetheless be \u201cunwarranted\u201d if there are no public interests supporting disclosure of the particular information. It is thus to the other side of the scale that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In its memorandum opinion, the district court identified the primary public interest supporting disclosure of the redacted information as the \u201ccompelling interest in federal contractors, irrespective of evidence of fraud.\u201d Although we agree with the court that, in general, the public does have an interest in obtaining information regarding the government\u2019s interaction with federal contractors, merely stating that the interest exists in the abstract is not enough; rather, the court should have analyzed how that interest would be served by compelling disclosure in this case. After review of the record, we conclude that this interest would be little served by compelling disclosure of the identifying information in the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Our inquiry into whether the public interest would be served by disclosure in this case is guided by the salutary underlying rationale of the FOIA, which is \u201cto open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 1604. In <em>Reporters Committee, </em>the Court eloquently reaffirmed this central principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aia\">In our leading case on the FOIA, we declared that the Act was designed to create a broad right of access to \u2018official information.\u2019 <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 80, 93 S.Ct. 827, 832, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). In his dissent in that case, Justice Douglas characterized the philosophy of the statute by quoting this comment by Henry Steele Commager:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u2018 \u201cThe generation that made the nation thought secrecy in government one of the instruments of Old World tyranny and committed itself to the principle that a democracy cannot function unless the people are permitted to know <em>what their government is up to.\u201d\u2019 Id., </em>at 105, 93 S.Ct., at 845 (quoting from The New York Review of Books, Oct 5, 1972, p. 7) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ann\">This basic policy of \u2018 \u201cfull agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language,\u201d \u2019 <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S., at 360-361, 96 S.Ct., at 1599 (quoting S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1965)), indeed focuses on the citizens\u2019 right to be informed about \u2018what their government is up to.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">109 S.Ct. at 1481 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">A corollary to this principle is that, because our focus must be upon whether disclosure serves the general public\u2019s interest in governmental affairs, the specific motives of the party making the FOIA request are irrelevant. If the general public has a legitimate, albeit abstract, interest in the requested information such that disclosure is warranted, disclosure must be made despite the fact that the party actually requesting and receiving the information may use it for less-than-lofty purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Conversely, if disclosure of the requested information does not serve the purpose of informing the citizenry about the activities of their government, disclosure will not be warranted even though the public may nonetheless prefer, albeit for other reasons, that the information be released. <em>See Reporters Committee, id. </em>at 1480-82 (\u201cOur previous decisions establish that whether an invasion of privacy is warranted cannot turn on the purposes for which the request for information is made.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, that Halloran wishes to use the transcripts in civil litigation against Santa Fe is irrelevant to our inquiry<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; our discussion of the public interests served or disserved by disclosure must focus solely upon whether disclosure of the identifying information in the transcripts fosters the public\u2019s legitimate interest in the affairs of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Viewing the matter in this light, we cannot find any significant public interest, relevant for the purposes of the FOIA, in disclosure of the identifying information in the transcripts. Undoubtedly, the public has an interest in learning about the nature, scope, and results of the VA\u2019s investigation of, and its relationship with, one of its contractors. That interest, however, has already been substantially served by the release of the redacted transcripts and the VA\u2019s report on the investigation, from which the full nature and extent of the VA\u2019s actions, as well as whatever the VA learned from its surreptitious recording of the conversations, can be discerned. Disclosure of the identities of the individual suspects employed by Santa Fe, and the identities of others unrelated to the investigation, will add little to the public\u2019s understanding of \u201cwhat [its] government is up to.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We do not mean to belittle the fact that redactions \u2014 particularly of names and identifying information \u2014 may nonetheless impede knowledge and understanding of the government\u2019s actions. A review of the transcripts and the VA\u2019s report, however, leads to the inescapable conclusion that Halloran\u2019s claim that the redactions have rendered the transcripts \u201cincomprehensible\u201d is off the mark.

In so holding, we emphasize that we find it unnecessary to employ the sort of categorical balancing used by the Supreme Court in <em>Reporters Committee </em>to justify the nondisclosure of an entire class of documents, namely, rap sheets. <em>See </em>109 S.Ct. at 1483-85. Rather, our holding is based upon an evaluation, in light of the underlying circumstances of the case, of the specific transcripts at issue and the affidavits submitted by the government supporting nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">We thus REVERSE the judgment of the district court and RENDER judgment in favor of the Veterans Administration in No. 88-6180, and vacate the judgment in No. 89-2055.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">.
