The issues presented are whether the appellant\u2019s confession resulted from an illegal arrest and police coercion, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and whether Harris\u2019 lawyers rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The victim, Essie Daniels, a seventy-three year old woman, was found dead in her Miami home on the morning of March 22, 1981. An autopsy revealed that she had been stabbed approximately fifty times and had been beaten with a blunt instrument. Police officers found blood spattered over the walls and furnishings of the bedroom, living room and kitchen, indicating that Daniels had attempted to escape the assailant while she was being attacked. A subsequent criminal investigation focused on Theodore Harris as a suspect, and on April 14, 1981, the police arrested the appellant pursuant to a warrant. Harris first denied his involvement in the murder, but after a six hour interrogation, he confessed to having killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">Harris told the police that he had gone to the victim\u2019s home in order to rob her, not to kill her. Upon entering the home, however, Essie Daniels, carrying a kitchen knife in her hand, confronted Harris. A violent struggle ensued, and the victim struck the appellant with the knife first, severely lacerating his hand. Harris then seized the knife, whereupon he repeatedly stabbed the victim. After the attack ended, Harris proceeded to the victim\u2019s bedroom, emptied her pocket book, and took approximately $30.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">On April 28, 1981, a Dade County, Florida, grand jury indicted Harris for murder in the first degree, as well as for burglary with assault and robbery. Prior to trial, the defense moved to suppress the appellant\u2019s confession, and the judge held an evidentiary hearing. At that hearing, Harris argued that the confession had resulted from an unlawful arrest and police coercion. In attacking the arrest, the appellant relied on <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), contending that the investigating police officer had made deliberate misrepresentations of material facts in the affidavit of probable cause used to obtain the arrest warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court rejected this claim, however, finding that <em>Franks </em>had not been satisfied since \u201cthere was no deliberate falsity or reckless disregard by the investigating police agencies_ Moreover, assuming arguendo, there even was a falsity or disregard, there remains sufficient contents within the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">The appellant also challenged the legality of the confession by arguing that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>involuntary. Evidence at the suppression hearing established that at the time of arrest, Harris had a cast on his right forearm which interfered with his wrists being handcuffed behind his back, as police regulations required. So, the police handcuffed Harris\u2019 right elbow to his left wrist behind his back. The appellant remained handcuffed while sitting in an aluminum chair throughout the six hour interrogation. Harris testified that during this time the police beat, tortured and threatened him to obtain his confession. However, police officers testifying for the state denied that Harris had been physically or emotionally abused in any way. The officers stated that Harris stayed calm, unemotional throughout the interrogation, that he never complained of discomfort or pain and did not request an attorney although receiving the warnings mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), several times. The state court found the officers\u2019 version of the interrogation more credible and concluded that Harris had confessed voluntarily-</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Harris neither testified nor did the defense call any witnesses during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. The jury convicted the appellant of first-degree murder, burglary and robbery. During the penalty phase of the trial, the state presented medical testimony concerning the nature of the victim\u2019s injuries and the resulting pain that she had suffered. The state introduced additional evidence that Harris had previously been convicted of robbery and was on parole at the time of the murder. Harris presented no evidence in mitigation or rebuttal. Subsequently, the jury rendered a recommendation of death by a vote of eight to four, and the judge imposed the death penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the convictions and the death sentence. <em>Harris v. State, </em>438 So.2d 787 (Fla.1983), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>466 U.S. 963, 104 S.Ct. 2181, 80 L.Ed.2d 563 (1984). The court agreed that Harris had not satisfied <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>in proving an unlawful arrest and found that the record supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the confession was voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 793-94. Thereafter, Harris filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Florida alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel which the court denied. <em>Harris v. Wainwright, </em>473 So.2d 1246, 1247 (Fla.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The appellant then filed a motion for post-conviction relief in the state trial court pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his two trial lawyers, Alfred Williams and Pedro Echarte, had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial by failing to investigate, prepare or present any mitigation evidence. The state court held an evidentiary hearing in June, 1988, at which Williams and Ec-harte testified. Both lawyers stated that neither one of them had properly investigated Harris\u2019 background. Neither lawyer had obtained Harris\u2019 school or military records. Neither one had traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, Harris\u2019 hometown, to meet the appellant\u2019s parents, sister, brother-in-law, niece, friends, employers and neighbors to learn whether they could offer beneficial mitigation evidence. In fact, the lawyers\u2019 testimony demonstrated that, prior to the day of sentencing, neither had performed any investigation in advance for the penalty hearing. Their testimony indicates that their failure to investigate occurred because each believed that the other was preparing the penalty phase of the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">Q. Now, Mr. Williams, who was responsible for the preparation of the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>phase of this ease as between yourself and Mr. Echarte?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-4\">A. Mr. Echarte.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">Q. Mr. [Echarte], between you and Mr. Williams, which of you was responsible for the preparation of the penalty phase in this trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">A. Mr. Williams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Other testimony indicated that the lawyers employed an investigator to assist them in preparing the Harris case. However, no evidence demonstrated that Williams or Echarte ever received or relied on background information developed by the investigator concerning the penalty phase. Williams testified, for example, that he assumed that Echarte and the investigator were working jointly to develop mitigation evidence. But, Echarte testified to the contrary, stating that he neither assigned the investigator to research Harris\u2019 background nor did the work himself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">As a result, the lawyers had no evidence to offer in mitigation at the commencement of the sentencing hearing on Saturday, September 26, 1981. Williams thus requested a continuance, which the court granted until Tuesday, September 29. In that time, the record demonstrates that the attorneys attempted to contact Harris\u2019 ex-wife and one of his Miami friends to obtain some mitigation testimony. However, the ex-wife\u2019s hospitalization in Jacksonville precluded her from appearing at the penalty hearing and the friend, according to Williams, refused to testify. The record is unclear as to whether the lawyers made any other attempts to contact witnesses. Thus, at the Tuesday hearing, no friends or relatives testified on Harris\u2019 behalf, and Williams explained the absence of family members to the sentencing jury in his closing statement by stating that Harris\u2019 \u201cfamily has turned against him because he was accused of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">However, at the Rule 3.850 hearing in state court, the appellant contended that Williams had mischaracterized the Harris family\u2019s feelings about the appellant. Harris presented witnesses, including his sister, brother-in-law, niece, ex-wife and a minister, who stated that they would have gladly testified at the sentencing hearing on Harris\u2019 behalf. With the exception of Harris\u2019 ex-wife, who had been hospitalized at the time of the hearing, the witnesses blamed their absence on the fact that neither of Harris\u2019 lawyers nor the investigator had contacted them in regard to the penal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>ty phase. The witnesses also stated that, given the opportunity, they would have described Harris to the sentencing jury as a kind, decent man, a dependable employee, a family man, dedicated to his son, his niece and his ex-wife\u2019s other children. All of the witnesses found value in the appellant\u2019s life, despite his incarceration and prior criminal conduct. Echarte testified at the Rule 3.850 hearing that he would have presented these witnesses at sentencing had he known about their existence. Williams stated that the failure to seek out this evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">The state trial court denied Harris\u2019 motion for post-conviction relief, finding that counsel had rendered effective assistance, and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed. <em>Harris v. State, </em>528 So.2d 361 (Fla.1988). Harris subsequently filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2254 in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The district court also denied relief, finding that the affidavit of probable cause did not violate <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>and that Harris had confessed voluntarily. The district court also concluded that Harris\u2019 lawyers had rendered adequate assistance of counsel during the penalty phase. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">A. <em>The Confession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Appellant contends that the confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest because a police investigator submitted a false and misleading affidavit of probable cause. While not saying so expressly in the brief, Harris raises the <em>Franks </em>Fourth Amendment issue once again. However, Harris has fully and fairly litigated this claim in the state courts of Florida. Thus, under the principles of <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), federal habeas review of this claim is precluded. As the Court stated in <em>Stone, </em>\u201cwhere the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 96 S.Ct. at 3052 (footnotes omitted). Accordingly, the district court erred in considering the appellant\u2019s <em>Franks </em>claim. The Florida courts\u2019 conclusions that Harris\u2019 arrest comported with the Fourth Amendment resolved this issue. <em>See also Cardwell v. Taylor, </em>461 U.S. 571, 103 S.Ct. 2015, 76 L.Ed.2d 333 (1983) (holding the <em>Stone </em>preclusion applicable to confessions challenged on Fourth Amendment grounds); <em>Williams v. Brown, </em>609 F.2d 216 (5th Cir.1980) <em>(Stone </em>prevented federal habeas review of a <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>claim).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Next, the appellant claims that the police engaged in a coercive, protracted interrogation, vitiating the voluntariness of his confession. Our analysis begins with the well-settled rule that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the government\u2019s use of involuntary confessions. <em>Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 109, 106 S.Ct. 445, 449, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985); <em>Leon v. Wainwright, </em>734 F.2d 770, 772 (11th Cir.1984). A confession is voluntary if, under the totality of the circumstances, it is the product of the defendant\u2019s free and rational choice. <em>Id. </em>This means that the confession must not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, or obtained by any direct or implied promises, or by the exertion of any improper influence. <em>Id. </em>Although the ultimate issue of volun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>tariness is a legal question requiring independent federal determination, state court findings of fact are afforded a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Miller, </em>474 U.S. at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 451. As the Court stated in <em>Miller, \u201c... </em>subsidiary factual questions, such as ... whether in fact the police engaged in the intimidation tactics alleged by the defendant ... are entitled to the \u00a7 2254(d) presumption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">In rejecting Harris\u2019 motion to suppress the confession, the state trial court found that the police had not threatened, beaten, tricked or harmed the appellant in any way and that pictures taken of him shortly after giving the confession confirmed the absence of physical harm. The court also concluded that Harris\u2019 demeanor throughout the interrogation remained calm, and that although he received three sets of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he did not request an attorney. Also, the court found that Harris read and made corrections on his written confession, evidencing a desire to confess. Because these factual determinations are fairly supported by the record, we must afford them a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Miller, </em>474 U.S. at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 451. Consequently, accepting the state court\u2019s findings as fact, we conclude that Harris gave a voluntary and reliable confession.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">B. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right of effective assistance of counsel during a capital sentencing hearing. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686-87, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063-64, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Appellant claims that his lawyers\u2019 failure to investigate, prepare and present mitigation evidence tending to show his good character denied him this right. Our analysis under <em>Strickland </em>has two components: First, Harris must show that his lawyers rendered deficient performance by specifying acts and omissions which allegedly fell outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 687-90, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-66. Second, Harris must demonstrate that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. That is, the appellant must show that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">The state contends that the appellant has failed to prove either deficient performance or prejudice. It argues that Williams and Echarte relied on their investigator in preparing for the penalty phase, and such reliance, as opposed to interviewing the witnesses themselves, was not an unreasonable performance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to prejudice, the state contends that the introduction of evidence of appellant\u2019s good character through testimony of his relatives and friends would have provided a \u201cspringboard\u201d for the prosecutor to inquire into Harris\u2019 numerous prior crimes. Those pri- or crimes include convictions for burglary, assault and battery, a drug offense and a robbery in which the appellant broke an elderly woman\u2019s arm by snatching her purse. In addition, Harris\u2019 military records disclose that he received an undesirable discharge from the Army. Thus, the state urges that Harris suffered no prejudice from the omission of mitigation evidence since the prosecutor was prevented from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>introducing evidence of Harris\u2019 unfavorable record.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">An attorney is not obligated to present mitigation evidence if, after reasonable investigation, he or she determines that such evidence may do more harm than good. <em>Smith v. Dugger, </em>840 F.2d 787, 795 (11th Cir.1988). Moreover, the attorney is not necessarily required to investigate every evidentiary lead; an attorney\u2019s decision to limit his or her investigation may be reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. However, such decisions must flow from an informed judgment. Here, counsel\u2019s failure to present or investigate mitigation evidence resulted not from an informed judgment, but from neglect. Each lawyer testified that he believed that the other was responsible for preparing the penalty phase of this case. Thus, prior to the day of sentencing, neither lawyer had investigated Harris\u2019 family, scholastic, military and employment background, leading to their total\u2014and admitted\u2014ignorance about the type of mitigation evidence available to them. Such ignorance precluded Williams and Echarte from making strategic decisions on whether to introduce testimony from Harris\u2019 friends and relatives. We conclude, therefore, that the lawyers rendered inadequate assistance of counsel. <em>See Blake v. Kemp, </em>758 F.2d 523, 533 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 998, 106 S.Ct. 374, 88 L.Ed.2d 367 (1985) (\u201cIt should be beyond cavil that an attorney who fails altogether to make any preparations for the penalty phase of a capital murder trial deprives his client of reasonably effective assistance of counsel by any objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we reject the state\u2019s contention that counsel based a strategy on information supplied to them by an investigator. The record simply does not support the state\u2019s position. Williams, who admittedly did not investigate Harris\u2019 background, <em>assumed </em>that Echarte and the investigator were developing background information. However, Echarte\u2019s testimony that he neither labored with an investigator nor accomplished the work himself belies the accuracy of Williams\u2019 assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Yet, if the failure to investigate did not deprive the appellant of beneficial evidence, there may be inadequate assistance but no prejudice and thus no constitutional deprivation. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691-92, 104 S.Ct. at 2066-67. Here, the prejudice component in <em>Strickland </em>requires close scrutiny. It is critical to the reliability of a capital sentencing proceeding that the jury render an individualized decision. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 206, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2940, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976); <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2965, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978); <em>Armstrong v. Dugger, </em>833 F.2d 1430, 1433 (11th Cir.1987). Thus, the jury\u2019s attention should be focused on the \u201cparticularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 206, 96 S.Ct. at 2940. In this case, the sentencing jury knew much about the crime, having just convicted Harris of a brutal murder, but little about the characteristics of the defendant. They did not know that family members would contend that Harris was a devoted father, husband and brother. They did not know that these relatives and a minister would describe Harris as a decent, loving man whose life was important to them. To the contrary, appellant\u2019s lawyer erroneously told the jury that Harris\u2019 family had \u201cturned against him.\u201d Thus, the jury did not assess \u201cthe information needed to properly focus on the particularized characteristics of this petitioner.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>833 F.2d at 1433.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Evidence tending to show Harris\u2019 good character might well have been beneficial to the defense. Many death penalty cases involve planned murders,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but here the evidence fails to show that the appellant set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>out to kill Essie Daniels when he entered her home. Instead, the appellant appears to have embarked on a weaponless burglary during which he was surprised by the victim who produced the knife and apparently struck the first blow. The murder was brutal, but the absence of murder as a part of the initial design may have rendered the circumstances of this crime somewhat less egregious in the minds of the jurors. Thus, evidence seeking to show appellant\u2019s character as being good may have had a greater impact on a jury deciding whether to impose the death penalty for this crime \u2014 a burglary gone horribly awry \u2014 as opposed to one involving murder as the intended goal from the inception of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">It does appear that injecting Harris\u2019 character as an issue during sentencing was fraught with danger. Although the prosecutor told the jury that Harris committed murder while on parole, the introduction of evidence about Harris\u2019 character would have allowed the state to further explore the appellant\u2019s other felony convictions as well as his dishonorable discharge from the Army. Nevertheless, on this record, we cannot conclude that effective counsel would have made a strategic decision to forego testimony about Harris\u2019 good character merely because its use would have permitted the state to add some prior unlawful acts to the proof already in the case. Indeed, one of Harris\u2019 lawyers conceded that he would have used the evidence had he known about it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Testimony about the appellant\u2019s good character constituted the only means of showing that Harris was perhaps less reprehensible than the facts of the murder indicated. Because we find that a reasonable probability exists that a jury hearing this evidence would have recommended life, Harris suffered prejudice from counsel\u2019s errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">We conclude that Harris\u2019 lawyers rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The writ of habeas corpus must be granted insofar as the death penalty is concerned, subject to the holding of a new sentencing proceeding within a reasonable period of time to be set by the district court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\">. In <em>Franks, </em>the Supreme Court held \"that, where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant's request. In the event that at that hearing the allegation of perjury or reckless disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and, with the affidavit\u2019s false material set to one side, the affidavit's remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.\u201d 438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676-77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-5\">. The trial judge found the following aggravating circumstances: (1) Harris was under a sentence of imprisonment when he committed the murder; (2) he had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence; (3) Harris committed the murder while engaged in a robbery or burglary; (4) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious and cruel; and (5) Harris committed murder in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner. The Supreme Court of Florida rejected the last aggravating circumstance as unsupported by the evidence. However, the court held that the improper finding did not require a new sentencing hearing. <em>Harris v. State, </em>438 So.2d 787, 798 (Fla.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 963, 104 S.Ct. 2181, 80 L.Ed.2d 563 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">.

On cross-examination, Williams stated his opposition to the death penalty. He was a public defender, had defended a number of capital cases and Harris was his only client to have reached death row. However, given the state trial judge\u2019s endorsement of the lawyer\u2019s ability during the Rule 3.850 hearing, we do not, and cannot, second-guess the credibility of Williams\u2019 statements. Moreover, because ineffectiveness is a question which we must decide, admissions of deficient performance by attorneys are not decisive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b835-12\">.
