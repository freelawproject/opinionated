Appellant Assalone, a resident of Pennsylvania, sues the trustees of the Welfare and Retirement Fund of 1950, United Mine Workers of America, claiming that his application for a pension from that Fund was wrongfully denied and in the alternative that he should be paid the sum of $29,300, same being the monies paid into the Welfare and Retirement Fund because of his efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">Appellant\u2019s complaint alleges that he has been a member of the United Mine Workers union for a long period of time, that he was born on February 28, 1906; started working in the coal industry in March, 1926 and continued working in the coal industry until January, 1956 when he retired because of ill health. In support of this latter allegation he attaches a certificate of a medical doctor dated \u201c10-28-69\u201d stating that he \u201cwas advised to stop working in the coal mines January 6, 1956 because of miner\u2019s asthma and anthrosclerosis.\u201d Appellant also alleges that for many years the coal company operators by whom he was employed deducted and paid from his wages 30^ (later 40^) a ton into the Welfare and Retirement Fund of which the appellees are trustees and that the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>total amounts so deducted from his wages was $29,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Appellant filed his application for a pension dated October 27, 1969 on January 14, 1970 and it was denied by the \u201cReview Unit, Pension Benefits\u201d on July 6, 1970. The written \u201cDenial of Pension\u201d stated that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">APPLICANT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED PROOF OF TWENTY (20) YEARS\u2019 CLASSIFIED SERVICE IN THE COAL INDUSTRY WITHIN THE THIRTY (30) YEAR PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE HIS APPLICATION WAS RECEIVED AT THE FUND \u2014 January 14, 1940 to January 14,1970. APPLICANT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED PROOF OF REGULAR EMPLOYMENT IN A CLASSIFIED JOB IN THE COAL INDUSTRY IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO MAY 29, 1946.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">Applicant claims no employment in the coal industry during 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970; no credit can be given for these years. He has not submitted any evidence to establish that he was employed in a classified job from 1940 through 1956; no credit was given for these years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">In view of the foregoing, he does not meet the requirements set forth in # 1 and # 2 above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5v\">In the event applicant does submit satisfactory evidence to verify employment in a classified job from 1940 through 1956, he still would not meet the requirement outlined in # 1 above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">App. p. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">While appellant contends there was something improper in that the Review Unit, instead of the trustees, denied his pension, we see no difficulty with this contention because the denial by the Review Unit is ratified by the trustees in this litigation. With full knowledge of all the facts the trustees in this action adopt the action of the Review Unit as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">On the foregoing facts appellant contends that the denial of his pension application was in breach of his rights in the pension fund; that he has reached the age of retirement and is equitably entitled to an award; and that the denial thereof is arbitrary, capricious and illegal. The trustees of the Fund by answer denied the validity of appellant\u2019s contentions and subsequently moved for summary judgment. This motion was granted by the district court. The pleadings and the motion set forth the essential facts upon which we must rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">The following is a copy of Assalone\u2019s work record as filed with his retirement application to the fund:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">From To Mo.

We previously summarized these requirements thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">Pursuant to this authority the trustees met on April 5, 1950 and drafted Resolution No. 10 for the purpose of setting guidelines for eligibility for and payment from the Fund. This resolution provided that an applicant shall be eligible for a pension if he (1) has attained the age of sixty (60) years, (2) retired after May 29, 1946, (3) had been employed for one year in the bituminous coal industry immediately prior to retiring, and (4) had completed twenty (20) years of service in the coal industry in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Gaydosh v.

We have summarized the changes thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">On January 28, 1953, the Trustees adopted Resolution No. 30, which superseded Resolution No. 10 as the governing regulation with respect to pension eligibility requirements. The new resolution was made- effective forthwith, that is to say, January 29, 1953. The significant change which it made, for purposes of this proceeding, was to prescribe that the requisite 20 years of service must have taken place within the 25-year period immediately preceding the filing of a pension application. A few weeks later, on March 13, 1953, the Trustees, by Resolution No. 31, amended Resolution No. 30, retroactively effective as of January 29, 1953, by enlarging from 25 to 30 years the period immediately preceding application within which the 20 years of service must have occurred. This change was perpetuated in a further amending resolution, No. 32, adopted by the Trustees on May 12, 1953.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Kosty v. Lewis, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 345, 319 F.2d 744, 746 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">While these requirements also called for attainment of the age of sixty and establishment of twenty years service in the coal industry, subsection (c) required that the applicant must have \u201cretired from work in the * * * Industry <em>after </em>May 28, 1946, <em>following a period of regular employment in the Coal Industry immediately preceding May 29, 1946. </em>* * * <em>\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)

It is clear that Assalone would not meet the requirements of those latter resolutions. Thus, he argues that under the rationale of Lavella v. Boyle, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 444 F.2d 910, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 850, 92 S.Ct. 84, 30 L.Ed.2d 89 (1971), his benefits should be determined by No. 10. The distinguishing feature is that unlike Lavella, Assalone was not permanently disabled when Resolution 10 was changed and he continued to work in the industry until 1956 when a new set of eligibility requirements was placed in effect <em>(i. e., </em>No. 32, which is essentially the same as No.- 63, except that No. 63 provided for retirement at age 55 instead of 60).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The only way one could find that No. 10 still applies to Assalone would be to hold that once a miner has complied with all of a set of pension requirements except for the age requirement, and is subsequently prohibited by disability from complying with more onerous requirements imposed by a subsequent resolution, then the subsequent change in the requirements will be ineffective and he will be entitled to benefits upon compliance with the earlier resolution. However, this position not only goes considerably beyond Lavella,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but it contradicts specific language in <em>Gaydosh, supra, </em>133 U.S.App.D.C. at 277, 410 F.2d at 265, <em>i. </em>e.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">Appellant next argues that Gaydosh had qualified, in all respects, under Resolution 10 with the exception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>mere \u201cchronological age,\u201d and that this qualification clothed him with rights that equity would protect. We do not find this to be so. The age requirement is not merely a procedural device, arbitrarily set and easily waived. It is something more. Economic reality requires a reasonable cut-off date as to age lest the fund be exhausted by comparatively premature retirement. Pragmatically speaking, when a miner retires at the age of fifty-six and seeks to await the tolling of four years before filing for a pension, those years are productively carried by the sweat of the other miners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Had Assalone met all of the requirements under No. 10 prior to 1953 (when Nos. 30, 31 and 32 were adopted) including the age requirement, then there would be a much stronger case for holding that having qualified under those requirements his pension could not be denied by promulgation of new requirements. This was the situation in Kosty v. Lewis, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 319 F.2d 744 (1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 964, 84 S.Ct. 482, 11 L.Ed.2d 414 (1964), in which we held that to change the requirements without giving an opportunity for filing claims under the old requirements before the new ones went into effect was an abuse of the trust powers granted the trustees, but that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The 30-year qualifying period here falls between January 14, 1940 and January 14, 1970, when the application was filed. It is undisputed that Assalone retired from the coal industry in 1956 as an assistant foreman. It was thus mathematically impossible for him to meet the 20 out of the prior 30-year requirement since he was not employed in the coal industry during the 14 years immediately preceding the filing of his pension application. There is also no proof in this record that his employment from June, 1948 to January, 1956 as an \u201cAsst. Foreman\u201d was not in a nonclas-sified position for which no credit is allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He thus only proves 7 years\u2019 service during his qualifying period. Moreover, Assalone was not permanently disabled when he left the mining industry in 1956. He worked outside the coal industry from 1956 into the second quarter of 1969. He thus presents a substantially different case than Lavella, who qualified in all respects for his pension, with the exception of age, under the resolution in effect when he was forced to retire in 1952 for disability. Under such circumstances we held that he did not have to comply with the changed requirements with which his work-connected disability prevented him from complying. Assalone, however, did not meet the requirements for retirement benefits which were imposed by Resolution 32, in effect when he left the coal industry. He was substantially deficient in years of service within the prior 30 years\u2019 period and he failed to meet the requirement of being in regular employment in the coal industry in a classified job immediately preceding May 29, 1946.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Gaydosh, supra, </em>133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>U.S.App.D.C. at 274, 410 F.2d at 265, we held that the trustees did not abuse their authority when they amended the retirement requirements to specifically require regular employment in the coal industry immediately prior to May 29, 1946.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We accordingly conclude that the rule we applied in <em>Lavella </em>is not applicable to the facts of this case and that it was not arbitrary or capricious for the trustees to apply the eligibility standards of Resolution No. 63 to one in Assalone\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">As for appellant\u2019s complaint that the denial of his claim constitutes an illegal and inequitable forfeiture of approximately $29,300 that he \u201cpaid into the trust fund,\u201d the actual fact is that plaintiff himself paid no money into the fund. Only the signatory bituminous coal operators contribute to the fund. The trust instrument provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\"><em>Title to all the monies paid into and or due and owing said Fund shall be vested in and remain exclusively in the </em>Trustees of the Fund, and it is the intention of the parties hereto that said Fund shall constitute an irrevoca-I ble trust and that no benefits or moneys payable from this Fund shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt so to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall be void. <em>The moneys to be paid into said Fund shall not constitute or be deemed wages due to the individual mine worker, </em>nor shall said moneys in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the parties entitled to such money, i. e., the beneficiaries of said Trust under the terms of this Agreement. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">The Sixth Circuit in 1958 held that the fund was in the nature of a charitable trust, that present employees who are potential beneficiaries had an \u201cinterest\u201d for certain purposes, but that they did not have a \u201cpresent \u2018interest\u2019 in the trust <em>res\u201d </em>for certain purposes. Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 259 F.2d 346, 355 (6th Cir. 1958), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 361 U.S. 459, 80 S.Ct. 489, 4 L.Ed.2d 442 (I960).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-19\">It is thus clear that individual miners do not have a sufficient interest in the actual moneys paid into the fund by the coal operators to justify a claim of forfeiture under the facts here present. Such a claim is denied by the fact that the trust instrument specifically prohibits the beneficiaries from anticipating the benefits, i. e.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-20\">[N]o benefits or moneys payable from this Fund shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-21\">Appellant\u2019s claim in this respect must, therefore, also be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-43\">.
