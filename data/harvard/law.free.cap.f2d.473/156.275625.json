George Hyman filed a third-party complaint against the subcontractor under the following indemnity agreement contained in the subcontract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-24\"><em>Ninth. </em>The sub-contractor agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Owner and General Contractor against loss or expense by reason of the liability imposed by law upon the Owner or General Contractor for damage because of bodily injuries, including death at any time resulting therefrom; accidentally sustained by a person or persons or on account of damage to property arising out of or on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of or in consequence of the performance of this contract, whether or not such injuries to persons or damage to the property are due or claimed to be due to any negligence of the Sub-contractor, his employees, his agents or servants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Following an award of $70,000 in favor of Bland, trial of the third-party complaint resulted in judgment in favor of George Hyman, from which the third-party defendant subcontractor appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">Appellant argues that this indemnity provision should be construed to exclude damages clearly resulting from the general contractor\u2019s own negligence. The principles to be applied in interpreting such agreements are set forth in our opinions in Moses-Ecco Co. v. Roscoe-Ajax Corp., 115 U.S.App.D.C. 366, 320 F.2d 685 (1963) and Maiatico v. Hot Shoppes, Inc., 109 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 311-312, 287 F.2d 349, 350-351 (1961). Those cases require a finding that this provision amply evidences an intent to encompass these losses. Paragraph \u201cNinth\u201d is not distinguishable in any meaningful way from the provision under scrutiny in the <em>Moses-Ecco </em>case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s arguments are essentially those of Judge Miller\u2019s dissent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, while this certainly represents a respectable position, we are constrained to follow the reasoning of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"AP4\">Since the provision provides for indemnity for losses \u201cimposed by law\u201d upon the general contractor for damages \u201cwhether or not . . . due to any negligence of the sub-contractor, his employees, his agents or servants,\u201d it must necessarily refer to damages arising from the general contractor\u2019s own negligence as the only other significant party besides the subcontractor in a position to cause any losses \u201carising out of or on account of or in consequence of the performance of this contract.\u201d Especially in view of the fact that there would be indemnity for any losses resulting from the subcontractor\u2019s negligence even in the absence of any contractual provision, to exclude losses caused by the general contractor\u2019s negligence would be to adopt an interpretation which would largely strip the clause of any meaning. Appellant also seeks to have us split hairs when he argues that the case should be decided on the ground that the clause only referred to \u201closs\u201d and not \u201cany loss,\u201d and that injuries received while on the job by employees of the subcontractor should be considered as resulting from their mere presence and not as \u201carising -out of . the performance of the contract.\u201d The common sense of the contract supports the interpretation given by the trial court. For these reasons we conclude that Paragraph \u201cNinth\u201d requires the subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for losses caused by the sole negligence of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">. <em>Moses-Ecco </em>dealt with the following provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">\u201cThe Subcontractor [Moses-Ecco] agrees in the performance of this contract * * * that he will at all times indemnify and save harmless the Owner and the Contractor [Roscoe-Ajax] against any loss, because of injury or damage to persons or property arising or resulting from the performance of this contract, including any and all loss, cost, damage or expense which the Owner and/or Contractor may sustain or incur on account of any claim, demand or suit made or brought against them or either of them by or on behalf of any employee of [Moses-Ecco] * * * <em>tt</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-24\">. 115 U.S,App.D.C. at 376-378, 320 F.2d at 695-697.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
