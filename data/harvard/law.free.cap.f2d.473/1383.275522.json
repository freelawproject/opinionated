We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-22\">The appellant filed his habeas petition in the court below alleging that his rights to counsel and to confront witnesses were violated when the trial court allowed the victim to make an in-court identification of the appellant after the victim, on the previous day, had been shown appellant\u2019s photograph by the state with neither appellant nor his counsel present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant also alleged that the same issue had been raised on his direct appeal, but that the appeal had been pending for a year. The district court dismissed the habeas petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-23\">While the appeal has been pending in this Court, the Florida appellate court affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction, finding that the victim\u2019s in-court identification was based upon her recollection from the time of the offense, not upon the photograph. Fuller v. Wainwright, Fla.1972, 268 So .2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-24\">The district court acted correctly in dismissing without prejudice appellant\u2019s habeas petition. So long as his direct appeal remained pending and absent a showing that his state appeal remedy was inadequate, his state remedies had not been exhausted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Bryant v. Bailey, 5th Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 560; Jackson v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 289; Buel v. Decker, 5th Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 1314; Perry v. Decker, 5th Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 773. Appellant\u2019s direct appeal having now been decided, he may refile his habeas petition in the court below for consideration on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">. Appellant also raises, for the first time on appeal, the contention that the state trial court wrongfully denied his motion for a continuance. Since this contention was not presented to the court below, we do not reach it here. Walker v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 1311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1444-28\">. We of course intimate no view on the merits of appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
