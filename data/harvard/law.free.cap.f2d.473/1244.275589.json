(Columbia) appeals from a judgment entered in the Southern District of New York, Inzer B. Wyatt, District Judge, 334 F.Supp. 1279 (S.D.N.Y.1971), granting the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing the complaint in a tax refund action brought by Columbia to recover federal corporate income taxes and interest for the taxable years 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958 in the aggregate amount of $244,084.33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>claimed to have been erroneously assessed and collected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqQ1\">Three essential issues are involved on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALQU\">(1) Whether the conversion of debentures into Columbia\u2019s common stock as provided in a certain indenture constituted payment by Columbia of interest accrued on the debentures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-6\">(2) Whether, on conversion, Columbia realized income in the form of discharge of indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1306-7\">(3) Whether, for the taxable years 1955 and 1956, the refusal of the Commissioner to accept Columbia\u2019s consents to a reduction in the basis of its assets under Section 108(a) of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">Since we agree with the district court\u2019s application of the law to the undisputed facts, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-11\">In view of the district court\u2019s clear, comprehensive and detailed statement of the facts based on a stipulation by the parties, 334 F.Supp. at 1280-81, it is sufficient for our purpose to set forth here only such facts as are necessary to an understanding of our rulings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-12\">Under a 1954 indenture, Columbia issued $50,000,000 principal amount of 3%% subordinated debentures due 1964. Interest on the debentures was payable semiannually on May 10 and November 10. The debentures were convertible into Columbia\u2019s common stock at the rate of $13% per share, or 7% shares per $100 principal amount of debentures, with cash adjustments to be made in lieu of fractional shares. The indenture provided that \u201c[tjhere shall be no adjustments in respect of interest or dividends on the conversion of any Debenture or Debentures.\u201d Each debenture provided that \u201c[n]o adjustment is to be made on conversion for interest accrued hereon or for dividends on securities issued on conversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-19\">Columbia used the accrual method of accounting. Each month it entered on its books as accrued interest debt the amount of interest earned on the debentures, and transferred to capital surplus the amount of interest accrued on debentures converted during the monthly accounting period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-20\">On its federal income tax returns for the taxable years 1955 through 1958, Columbia deducted<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as interest expense all of the interest accrued on the debentures, including the amount accrued on those debentures converted during the particular year. The District Director found this improper. His audit of the returns for the years 1955 and 1956 resulted in the determination of a deficiency of $127,910.64, plus $38,669.97 interest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the ground that Columbia, by failing to report its discharge of indebtedness as gross income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had understated its taxable income. An audit of the returns for the years 1957 and 1958 resulted in the determination of a further deficiency of $60,082.80, plus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>$17,420.92 interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the same end was reached for the years 1957 and 1958 as for the years 1955 and 1956, the route was by disallowance of the deduction rather than by an addition to gross income. The additional tax for the years 1955 and 1956 was paid on July 31, 1961; that for the years 1957 and 1958 was paid on March 29,1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Refund claims for the taxable years 1955 and 1956 were filed by Columbia on September 26, 1962, together with consents to reduce the basis of its assets pursuant to \u00a7 108(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Refund claims for the taxable years 1957 and 1958 were filed in March 1965, but not accompanied by \u00a7 108(a) consents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">The District Director disallowed the refund claims for each of the four years. He also refused to give effect to the \u00a7 108(a) consents on the ground that they had not been filed with the income tax returns for the years to which they related.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">In January 1968, Columbia commenced the instant tax refund action in the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) (1970), to recover $244,-084.33 in income taxes and interest claimed to have been erroneously assessed and collected for the taxable years 1955-1958. The parties in due course filed a joint stipulation of facts. Each moved for summary judgment. In a well reasoned opinion, the district court held that on conversion the accrued interest was discharged and not paid; and that the Commissioner had not abused his discretion in refusing to accept the consents for the taxable years 1955 and 1956. Summary judgment was entered in favor of the government dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-17\">If, on conversion of the debentures, Columbia may be deemed to have <em>paid its accrued interest debt, </em>then the deduction for interest expense under \u00a7 163(a) of the Internal Revenue Code was wrongfully disallowed. On the other hand, if on conversion the accrued interest was <em>discharged as indebtedness </em>of Columbia, then such accrued interest should be included as income to Columbia. We believe that the latter is the correct construction and accordingly we uphold the ruling of the District Director and the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-18\">In Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. United States, 434 F.2d 1357 (Ct.Cl.1970), the court ruled on a question strikingly similar to that presented here. There, Bethlehem had issued debentures, payable semiannually on May 1 and Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>ber 1, convertible at the holder\u2019s option into Bethlehem\u2019s common stock. The indenture included a \u201cno-adjustment\u201d clause similar to that in the instant case, under which no credit would be given to the debenture holder for interest accrued or dividends payable. Bethlehem, like Columbia, used the accrual method of accounting. It deducted the interest accrued on debentures converted during the taxable year. The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deductions, except as to interest actually paid and interest accrued on debentures not yet converted at the close of the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">There, as here, the taxpayer placed considerable reliance on the line of cases consisting of Hummel-Ross Fibre Corp., 40 B.T.A. 821 (1939); Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Corp., 42 B.T.A. 1016 (1940); and Central Electric &amp; Telephone Co., 47 B.T.A. 434 (1942). The Court of Claims, in an opinion by Judge Davis, rejected that line of eases as dealing with the separable situation of a \u201cmutual <em>ad hoc </em>evaluation and trade-off of relevant elements at the time of the conversion-exchange\u201d, 434 F.2d at 1359, rather than the situation of pre-fixed terms of conversion, as in the case before that court. We agree with that view of the <em>Hummel-Ross </em>line. In each of those eases, there was no prearranged terms of exchange; instead, the various companies, in subsequent endeavors at reorganization and recapitalization, effected an exchange of securities for outstanding indebtedness \u2014 an exchange in which accrued interest specifically was an integral part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">Here, we fail to perceive that essential element. The terms of exchange were prefixed and static. They took no account of the actual increase in accrued interest resulting from the passage of time between interest payments. They were not the subject of bargaining subsequent to the purchase of the debentures. The fluctuation in the price of the stock, while indeed always higher than the conversion price, was not at all affected by the increase in accrued interest during an interest period. These facts, in our view, make the instant case indistinguishable from <em>Bethlehem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">Columbia argues that, while <em>Bethlehem </em>may not be distinguishable, it should not be followed here because it was wrongly decided. Specifically, Columbia contends that the Court of Claims violated the basic principle that the substance, rather than the form, of a transaction should control its tax treatment. In <em>Bethlehem, </em>according to Columbia\u2019s argument, the court \u201cviewed the deducti-bility or nondeductibility of accrued interest as turning solely on the language of the indenture\u201d. We do not so read the <em>Bethlehem </em>opinion. On the contrary, Judge Davis appears to have given conscientious attention to the \u201csubstance\u201d of the transaction and to the surrounding circumstances. The distinction drawn between <em>Bethlehem </em>and the <em>Hummel-Ross </em>line was based on the <em>substantively </em>different fact of prefixed,, as opposed to subsequently bargained for, conversion terms. Throughout the opinion, moreover, there are many indications that the court painstakingly grappled with \u201call the factors <em>pro </em>and <em>con\u201d. </em>434 F.2d at 1359 (emphasis by the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">It is for us to determine, of course, whether the <em>policy </em>of <em>Bethlehem </em>should be followed by us. At the core of the <em>Bethlehem </em>decision, as we read it, is the salutary view that, where the countervailing contentions on both sides are as substantial as they are here, a solution reflecting the equities should be sought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHMV\">\u201cIn this closely-balanced situation one cannot forget that Bethlehem was itself the drafter and the master of the trust indenture and of the debenture form. If it had written something like, \u2018On conversion, unpaid accrued interest on a debenture shall be deemed to be paid through receipt of the common stock exchanged for the debenture being converted\u2019, then it seems plain that the rule of Hummel-Ross Fibre Corps., 40 B.T.A. 821 (1939), <em>supra, </em>and Shamrock Oil &amp; Gas Co., 42 B.T.A. 1016 (1940), <em>supra, </em>would apply. That language would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>control the bargain struck \u2014 the accrued interest would be considered to have been paid on the conversion, and an interest deduction authorized. On the other hand, if the indenture had said, \u2018On conversion, any unpaid accrued interest on any debenture being converted shall be cancelled, forfeited, and not paid\u2019, then the principle of Capento Securities Corp.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would govern, and no interest deduction would be allowed. See I.T. 2884, XIV-1 Cum.Bull. 151 (1935); Rev. Rui. 68-170, 1968-1 Cum.Bull. 71. Instead of using either of these unmistakable alternatives, Bethlehem put into the indenture the imprecise and unclear language: <em>\u2018No adjustment shall be made </em>for interest accrued on any Debenture that shall be converted * * *\u2019 (emphasis added). The fuzzy words, \u2018no adjustment shall be made\u2019, are subject to either of the two polar interpretations for which the parties have been battling. The wording can, in reason, be read both ways, and a good argument can be made for each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-8\">The preferable solution is to charge this ambiguity against Bethlehem, as the one responsible for the wording of the clause and the indenture.\u201d 434 F.2d at 1360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">The foregoing reflects more than a policy based on the mere formality of contractual language. Rather, it reflects a considered realization that the drafter of an agreement is in the best position to relieve a potentially ambiguous provision of such ambiguity; and in fairness no one is better placed to bear the consequences of the drafter\u2019s failure to state the contractual terms in language favorable to it than the drafter itself. United States v. Seckinger, 397 U.S. 203, 216 (1970); J. W. Bateson Co. v. United States, 450 F.2d 896, 902 (Ct. Cl.1971). Here, Columbia was certainly capable of framing the \u201cno-adjustment\u201d clause to avoid the very confusion that has given rise to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">Like the district court, we view <em>Bethlehem </em>as a decision which we are \u201cunable to distinguish from the case at bar and which [we are] prepared to accept.\u201d 334 F.Supp. at 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-13\">Columbia next argues that, even if the accrued interest is not held to have been paid on the conversion of the debentures, no income was realized by Columbia in the form of discharge of indebtedness under \u00a7 61(a) (12) of the Internal Revenue Code. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-14\">The inquiry in this regard does not differ significantly from that concerning the propriety of a \u00a7 163(a) deduction. In either case, a critical question in the determination of whether there was payment or cancellation of indebtedness is whether the parties had reached an agreement as to the treatment of interest upon the exercise of the conversion option. In Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the terms of conversion were established when the debentures were issued; those terms, as we have indicated above, included a fixed rate and a \u201cno-adjustment\u201d clause, under which the amount of accrued interest was immaterial to the conversion price. The Court of Claims viewed the interest as not paid, and the extinction of the debenture was deemed incidentally to discharge the accrued interest in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>debtedness. In our view, the present case is on all fours with <em>Bethlehem. </em>We reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">The bankruptcy cases relied on by Columbia that hold otherwise do not compel the opposite result here. In Commissioner v. Motor Mart Trust, 156 F.2d 122 (1 Cir. 1946), for example, the court affirmed a decision of the Tax Court that had held the retirement of all existing securities of a bankrupt corporation, and the consequent issuance of new securities, to be a reorganization which gave rise to no taxable income. See also Tower Building Corp., 6 T.C. 125 (1946); Alcazar Hotel, Inc., 1 T.C. 872 (1943); Rev.Rul. 179, 1956-1 Cum.Bull. 187. Cf. Los Angeles Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp. v. United States, 289 F. 2d 222 (9 Cir. 1961). These rulings, while undoubtedly correct in the context of the issues there involved, in our view are not illuminating on the entirely distinct question whether the conversion of a debenture of a solvent corporation, under terms established at the time of the issuance of the debenture, constitutes a reorganization or recapitalization. We are unaware of any authority holding that a reorganization or recapitalization results from such a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Columbia points to Liquid Carbonic Corp., 34 B.T.A. 1191 (1936), as a ease in support of its position. There, the Board said that \u201cthe conversion of bonds into capital stock of the obligor is purely a capital transaction; that is, a readjustment of the. obligor\u2019s capital structure, which does not result in either a deductible loss <em>or a taxable gain. </em>The obligor does not pay out anything. It merely readjusts its capital.\u201d 34 B.T.A. at 1196 (emphasis added). The issue there, however, related to the deductibility of unamortized bond discount and expense, not of interest accrued. It is distinguishable on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">The critical aspect of this issue, as with the question of a deduction under \u00a7 163(a), is a factual one. In Alcazar Hotel, Inc., <em>supra, </em>for example, the court concluded that the facts disclosed no intent to discharge the interest indebtedness. In Capento Securities Corp., 47 B.T.A. 691 (1942), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 140 F.2d 382 (1 Cir. 1944), on the other hand, the Board concluded that the absence of a contrary explanation indicated an intent to cancel the accrued interest. Here, the district court implicitly found that the contractual terms and the surrounding circumstances of the conversion transaction evidenced an intent to discharge the indebtedness. 334 F.Supp. at 1281. We find no basis for overturning that finding as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">We hold that Columbia realized income from the discharge of indebtedness under \u00a7 61(a) (12), and that the deficiency assessment accordingly was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">Finally, Columbia claims that the Commissioner abused his discretion in refusing to accept Columbia\u2019s consents to a reduction in the basis of its assets for the taxable years 1955 and 1956. We hold that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-12\">Under \u00a7 108(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a corporate taxpayer may exclude from its gross income the amount of discharged indebtedness, upon the filing, and acceptance by the Commissioner, of a consent to the reduction in the basis of the taxpayer\u2019s assets. The Treasury has promulgated regulations regarding the timeliness of such consents, in both normal and \u201cspecial\u201d cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-13\">\u201cIn order to take advantage of the exclusion from gross income provided by section 108(a), a taxpayer must file <em>with his return for the taxable year </em>a consent to have the basis of his property adjusted in accordance with the regulations prescribed under section 1017 which are in effect at the time of filing such return. See \u00a7\u00a7 1.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>1017-1 and 1.1017-2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>In special cases, however, where the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner reasonable cause for failure to file the necessary consent with his original return, he may file the consent with an amended return or claim for credit or </em>refund; and in such eases, the consent shall be to the regulations which, at the time of filing the consent, are applicable to the taxable year for which such consent is filed . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.108 (a)-2 (1956) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">Columbia filed \u00a7 108(a) consents for the years 1955 and 1956 with its claims for refunds for those years.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It claims that this was permissible since this is a \u201cspecial case\u201d under Regulation \u00a7 1.-108(a)-2, and that the Commissioner therefore wrongfully refused to accept the consents. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">Both Congress, in \u00a7 108(a), and the Treasury, in Regulation \u00a7 1.108(a)-2, have indicated a clear intent to vest in the Commissioner broad discretion regarding the acceptance of late-filed consents. By the terms of the Regulation, the taxpayer must establish \u201cto the satisfaction of the Commissioner reasonable cause for failure to file the necessary consent with his original return . . . . \u201d The \u201creasonable cause\u201d asserted by Columbia is that- at the time of the filing of the original returns \u201cit was unaware of the possibility that it might be deemed to have realized income from the discharge of indebtedness upon conversion of its Debentures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">The question of whether Columbia\u2019s \u201creasonable cause\u201d is sufficient under the Regulation is a close one. Its argument that under the Code there are \u201cat least 78 elections\u201d that a taxpayer must make in order fully to anticipate every possible adverse ruling by the Commissioner, is well taken. What set this election apart, in our view, was the predictability of the Commissioner\u2019s challenge to Columbia\u2019s return. \u201cReasonable cause\u201d is not defined in the Regulation. It seems unlikely, however, that the phrase was meant to be so broad as to encompass this claim which is based at worst upon mere hindsight or at best upon an unexpected ruling by the Commissioner. We are unable to perceive any more involved here. Columbia, moreover, was at all times fully aware of all of the material facts of the transaction. Cf. Denman Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Commissioner, 192 F.2d 261 (6 Cir. 1951). True, no decision had squarely held accrued interest to be income and not deductible. But it is also true that considerable doubt surrounded the application of \u00a7\u00a7 163(a) and 61(a) (12) to the conversion of Columbia\u2019s debentures. Prudence would seem to have demanded that the \u00a7 108(a) consents be filed against the possibility that the Commissioner would reach a conclusion other than that sought by Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">In any event, we are unable to say, in view of the broad discretion vested in the Commissioner under Regulation \u00a7 1.-108(a)-2, that he abused his discretion, and much less that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that he did not.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ajy-dedup-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">.

Another court, in Kean v. Commissioner, 469 F.2d 1183 (9 Cir. 1972), recently has overturned a refusal to accept a consent under \u00a7 1372 as an abuse of discretion. There, however, the \u201creasonable cause\u201d for the failure to file was much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>clearer. A shareholder was refused an extension of time to file a Suhchapter S election because of a co-shareholder\u2019s non-consent. The co-shareholder was not a shareholder of record, and did not consider his consent necessary. The other shareholders, the taxpayers in the case, had no reason to suspect that the consent of the co-shareholder might have been necessary, and therefore knowledge of the material facts could not be imputed to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>MANSFIELD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<author id=\"Ayc\">(concurring and dissenting):</author>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">I dissent from that part of the majority opinion which deals with the taxpayer\u2019s attempt to reduce the basis of its assets for the years 1955 and 1956 by filing consents pursuant to \u00a7 108(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 108(a). In my view the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to give effect to the consents filed by Columbia on the ground that they had been filed too late was, under the circumstances in this case, plainly arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">With the aid of hindsight we are able to say that Columbia should have filed the consents at the time when it filed its 1955 and 1956 returns. But looking at the situation as of that time it must be recognized that the 1954 Internal Revenue Code offered at least 74 elections as to the configuration in which the Commissioner might seek to restructure a transaction described in a taxpayer\u2019s return. See Budlong, How to Avoid \u2014 Or Amend \u2014 Improper Tax Elections Despite the Many Uncertainties, 21 J.Taxation 298, 302 (1964) (list of 78 elections) ; Schwanbeck, Elections and Options Available to Taxpayers in the 1954 Code, 32 Taxes 748, 752 (1954) (list of 74 elections). I believe it is unreasonable and unrealistic to assert that the taxpayer should have anticipated in 1955 and 1956 that the District Director would years later contend that income had been realized from cancellation of indebtedness upon conversion of the Debentures, much less the specific ground on which the contention would be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">When Columbia, concededly acting in good faith, filed the returns, it had no reason to believe that the transaction was one which might require the filing of consents since it reasonably believed that accrued interest was paid by the delivery of its common stock upon conversion of the Debentures. It was not until years later, when its returns were audited, that the deduction for interest paid or accrued, which had been taken by the taxpayer pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 163(a), was disallowed. Thereupon Columbia promptly paid the additional taxes assessed, filed its claims for refunds, which were disallowed, and promptly filed the consents pursuant to \u00a7 108(a). It was not until the Government later filed its memorandum of law in the present suit that the Commissioner\u2019s theory finally came to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">The first definitive decision on the merits of the central issue before us was not handed down until 1970, Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. United States, 434 F.2d 1357, 193 Ct.Cl. 459 (1970). As Judge Davis wrote in that case, the issue of whether conversion of debentures would represent in part the payment of accrued interest was a \u201cclosely-balanced\u201d one in which the taxpayer had \u201csubstantial grounds for its stance,\u201d adding: \u201cWe do not find the choice readily foreordained or easy to come by. The scales continue to sway from side to side and do not promptly come to rest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1360. Since Columbia acted in good faith and could not reasonably have anticipated the position later taken by the Commissioner, there was no reason for it to file the consents in 1955 and 1956 against the possibility that its deduction of the interest might be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-10\">Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.108(a)-(2), promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 108, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-11\">\u201cIn special eases, however, where the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner reasonable cause for failure to file the necessary consent with his original return, he may file the consent with an amended return or claim for credit or refund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>Viewed in context, the taxpayer\u2019s predicament clearly constituted a special case in which there obviously was \u201creasonable cause for failure to file the necessary consent with [its] original return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">Although the Commissioner has discretion as to whether to allow late filing, his discretion is not absolute. In my view his refusal to accept the late filing in this case was arbitrary and unreasonable. See Kean v. Commissioner, 469 F.2d 1183 (9th Cir., filed Nov. 14,1972); Calavo, Inc. v. Commissioner, 304 F.2d 650 (9th Cir. 1962); Mamula v. Commissioner, 346 F.2d 1016 (9th Cir. 1965); The Welworth Realty Co., 40 B. T.A. 97 (1939), acquiesced in 1939-2 Cum.Bull. 39. In recently holding that the District Director abused his discretion in refusing under similar circumstances to allow a taxpayer an extension of time in which to file consents, the Ninth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-5\">\u201cThere was reasonable cause for Mur-dock MacPherson\u2019s failure to file a timely consent. Murdock MacPherson was not a shareholder of record. He believed that whatever ownership interest he had in the shares did not necessitate his consent to Bowl\u2019s election.' When the Internal Revenue Service disagreed with this position, the petitioners sought a judicial determination. Until the Tax Court issued its opinion, Murdock MacPherson did not know that his consent was required to consummate Bowl\u2019s election under \u00a7 1371.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-7\">\u201cThe District Director abused his discretion by arbitrarily refusing to allow petitioners an extension of time in which to file their consent to Bowl\u2019s Subchapter S election.\u201d Kean v. Commissioner, <em>supra </em>469 F.2d 1189.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1313-8\">The case of Denman Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Commissioner, 192 F.2d 261 (6th Cir. 1951), relied upon by the Government, is clearly inapplicable for the reason that it predated the promulgation in 1953 of the above-quoted regulation authorizing the Commissioner to permit late filing of a consent upon a showing of \u201creasonable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision to the extent that it upheld the Commissioner\u2019s refusal to give effect to the late-filed consents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
