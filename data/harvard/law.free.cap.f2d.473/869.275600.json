App. \u00a7 459(d), filed separate suits under 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 459<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>their employer Aerodex, Inc., to recover back wages allegedly due them by virtue of certain periodic wage increases incorporated in various applicable collective bargaining agreements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court, holding that the suits were equitable proceedings and being guided by the Florida three-year statute of limitations applicable to liabilities created by statute, found for the veterans but limited their recovery to those wages which accrued within the three years immediately preceeding the bringing of the suits. Because we feel that each suit was time-barred under the Florida one-year statute of limitations, which is applicable to suits for the recovery of wages,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judgments of the district court are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\"> Because the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7\u00a7 451 et seq., which enumerates the reemployment rights of veterans, contains no statute of limitations of its own, the federal courts must look to the statutes of limitations of the state in which the controversy arose. Blair v. Page Aircraft Maintenance, Inc., 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 815; <em>accord, </em>Hire v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 6 Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 546; Delman v. Federal Products Corp., 1 Cir. 1958, 251 F.2d 123. Deciding which statutory period is appropriate, however, is a two-step process. First with reference to federal law, we must determine the \u201cessential nature\u201d of the claim. Then we refer to the state court interpretations of that state\u2019s \u201cstatutory catalogue\u201d to ascertain which period would be applicable to a claim similar to the one before the court. <em>Blair, supra. See also, </em>Sewell v. International Association of Machinists, 5 Cir. 1971, 445 F.2d 545, 549, cert. denied, 1972, 404 U.S. 1024, 92 S.Ct. 674, 30 L.Ed.2d 674; McGuire v. Baker, 5 Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 895, 898, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 820, 91 S. Ct. 37, 27 L.Ed.2d 47; Beard v. Stephens, 5 Cir. 1967, 372 F.2d 685, 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">From the pleadings and briefs filed herein it is clear that the only relief requested, and the only alleged benefit not completely restored by Aerodex, was back wages. As counsel for the claimants, the Government acknowledges the limited relief sought, but argues that the nature of these claims is permeated with the remedial character of the whole act because a veteran \u201csues not simply as an employee under a collective bargaining agreement, but as a veteran asserting special rights bestowed upon him in furtherance of a federal policy to protect those who have served in the Armed Forces.\u201d McKinney v. Missouri-K.T.R.R., 1958, 357 U.S. 265, 268-269, 78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>S.Ct. 1222-1225, 2 L.Ed.2d 1305. The Government concludes by asserting that, since it is the unusual suit in which a veteran is seeking only wages, determining the \u201cessential nature\u201d of the claim by looking solely to what is in fact being claimed will lead to inconsistencies in the application of statutes of limitations to veterans reemployment eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\">We recognize that calling this a \u201cwage case\u201d might lead to a result different from that which would be reached if we termed the case a \u201csuit for the restoration of veterans rights,\u201d but such a difference is nowhere proscribed by federal law. In fact, it is just such differences in the remedy sought that dictate whether the case will be considered an action at law or a proceeding in equity. <em>Compare Blair, supra </em>(back wages), <em>Hire, supra </em>(severance pay), and Alvado v. General Motors Corp., S.D.N.Y.1961, 194 F.Supp. 314, aff\u2019d, 2 Cir. 1962, 303 F.2d 718, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 925, 83 S.Ct. 293, 9 L.Ed.2d 233 (vacation allowance pay), <em>with </em>Witty v. Louisville &amp; N.R.R., 7 Cir. 1965, 342 F.2d 614 (seniority), Leonick v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 2 Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 48 (reinstatement plus damages), <em>and </em>Conseglio v. Pennsylvania R.R., S.D.N.Y. 1962, 211 F.Supp. 567 (seniority). <em>But cf. </em>Donner v. Levine, 2 Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 185. <em>See also Delman, supra </em>(reinstatement plus damages); Hicks v. United States Radiator Co., E.D.Mich.1955, 127 F.Supp. 429 (reinstatement plus damages). Consequently, cognizant of the fact that the remedial nature of the Act requires that it be liberally construed (see Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &amp; Repair Corp., 1946, 328 U.S. 256, 284-285, 66 S.Ct. 1105, 90 L.Ed. 1230), we conclude that because only back wages are sought, the essential nature of each <em>claim </em>is one for wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">We now turn to the question of which statute of limitations is applicable. Because these controversies arose in Florida we are asked to choose from one of two Florida time periods; section 95.11(5) (a) provides a three-year period for liabilities created by statute and section 95.11(7) (b) establishes a one-year period for actions \u201cfor the recovery of wages, overtime, or damages and penalties accruing under laws respecting the payment of wages and overtime.\u201d The Government contends that, although the actions are for wages, they are not for wages \u201caccruing under a law respecting the payment of wages.\u201d However reasonable this interpretation may seem, it has been specifically precluded by the Florida Supreme Court decision in Broward Builders Exchange, Inc., v. Goehring, Fla.1970, 231 So.2d 513. That court stated that even though 95.11(7) (b) may have been partially aimed at suits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act <em>(see </em>Ott v. Freeman &amp; Son, Inc., S.D.Fla.1946, 68 F. Supp. 445), when the FLSA acquired its own statute of limitations <em>(see </em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Mauldin, Fla.App.1969, 218 So.2d 210), the Florida statute of limitations continued to apply to other claims for wages. The opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">[t]hus we hold that \u00a7 95.11(7) (b) was intended to apply to <em>all </em>suits for wages or overtime, <em>however accruing, </em>as well as to suits for damages and penalties accruing under the laws respecting the payment of wages and overtime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">231 So.2d at 515 (emphasis added). Because these suits are essentially claims for back wages, we hold that the Florida one-year statute of limitations is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Before discussing the application of this one-year period to the facts before us, it is necessary to state the effect of this requirement. The district court considered the action to be an equitable proceeding and used the statute of limitations as a guide in the application of laches to limit recovery. Because only monetary relief was sought, however, the action is one at law. <em>Blair, supra. </em>As such, unless each individual's suit was commenced within one year of the accrual of his cause of action, that suit will be barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Ordinarily, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff could first have successfully maintained a suit based on that cause of action. In the absence of a contrary suggestion from either party, this would normally occur in a reemployment case when the veteran is first denied the full measure of his rights. From the face of the record, it is clear that no claimant brought his suit within one year of the date of his return to employment with Aerodex,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and from the trial transcript, it is equally clear that when rehired, or soon thereafter, each veteran was informed that he was not going to receive the now disputed wage rate increases. Howard, for example, was the last to return to work for Aerodex, reclaiming his old job without the pay increases on December 17, 1968. In most situations, this would start the running of the statute of limitations. The seven suits were not filed, however, until March 15, 1971. Thus the delays ranged from two years and three months in Howard\u2019s ease, to over thirteen years in Racz\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\"> The Government has advanced three theories to avoid the absolute bar of the limitation period. First, it contends that the one year of \u201cmandatory reemployment\u201d required by the Selective Service Act delays the accruing of each veteran\u2019s cause of action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Secondly, it argues that, from each veteran\u2019s date of reemployment to the date-in the fall of 1969 when the cases were submitted to the United States Department of Labor, the statute of limitations was tolled because of the alleged misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment by Aerodex of the meritorious nature of the veterans\u2019 claims for wage rate increases and because of the veterans\u2019 \u201cblameless ignorance\u201d of their rights. Finally, the Government originally contended that its own two and one-half year delay in bringing the suits should not be attributed to the veterans, but should instead toll the running of the statute. It now concedes, however, that <em>Blair </em>has foreclosed this contention and that that decision requires us to charge the Government\u2019s delay against the veterans it represents. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, assuming, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>without deciding, that we should delay the accruing of each veteran\u2019s cause of action for one year, and further assuming that, prior to the submission of the cases to the Department of Labor, the statute of limitations was tolled by misrepresentations or blameless ignorance, the Government\u2019s delay until March 15, 1971, bars all seven veterans from any recovery in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The judgments of the district court are reversed and the cases are remanded with directions to dismiss the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-14\">. 50 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 459(c) (2) provides, in part, that a returning veteran:</p>\n<p id=\"ay1-dedup-0\">should be so restored in such manner as to give him such status in his employment as he would have enjoyed if he had continued in such employment continuously from the time of his entering the armed forces until the time of his restoration to such employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-6\">. The veterans sought to have the time they spent in the armed forces credited to their \u201cactive service\u201d time with Aerodex. This would have increased their pay under the collective bargaining agreements in two ways. First, Aerodex employees receive a $.01 per hour wage increase for every year of active service over four, up to a maximum increase of $.10 per hour. Secondly, employees receive a $.05, $.06, or $.07 wage rate increase (depending on the agreement) for every six months of active service with Aerodex, until the maximum rate for an employee\u2019s classification is attained. Aerodex refused to credit the military time and argued in the district court, and here on a cross appeal, that these raises are related solely to proficiency acquired through on-the-job experience. Proof of this relationship, they contend, is found in the record and allows them to deny granting the increases. <em>Compare </em>Altgens v. Associated Press, 5 Cir. 1951, 188 F.2d 727, <em>with </em>Moe v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 5 Cir. 1957, 246 F.2d 215, cert. denied, 1958, 357 U.S. 936, 78 S.Ct. 1380, 2 L.Ed.2d 1550.
