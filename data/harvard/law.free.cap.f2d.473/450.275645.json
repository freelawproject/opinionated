For the reasons set forth below, we affirm each of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"A9Ki\">I. No. 72-1397 \u2014 Willis</p>\n<p id=\"ahh-dedup-1\">As his grounds for appeal, Appellant Willis claims that the District Court erred as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ack-dedup-0\">(1) In ruling that a barn located some 14 miles from his home and owned by his deceased mother\u2019s estate did not fall within Willis\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights;</p>\n<p id=\"AkBc\">(2) In ruling that Appellant Willis\u2019 written consent to a search of the above barn waived any Fourth Amendment rights which he might assert with respect to the search ?</p>\n<p id=\"Attn\">(3) In refusing to require disclosure of the informer who assertedly advised the federal agents that the stolen goods might be found in the barn; and</p>\n<p id=\"Ahk\">(4) In denying, without a hearing, his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AM_\">The District Court\u2019s determination that Willis was \u201cnot entitled to claim an unlawful search\u201d of the barn does not appear to comport with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 263-365, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960), and Mancusi v. DeForte, 392 U.S. 364, 367-370, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1968). <em>See, also </em>Combs v. United States, 408 U.S. 224, 92 S.Ct. 2284, 33 L.Ed.2d 308 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"Af4\">We nonetheless conclude that the District Court properly denied Willis\u2019 motion to suppress any evidence obtained in the search of the barn on the ground that Willis effectively waived his Fourth Amendment rights by signing the written consent to search form. The language of that consent form is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"axd-dedup-1\">The transcript of the hearing on Willis\u2019 motion to suppress is barren of any evidence to support Willis\u2019 present claim that the consent to search was not know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ingly and intelligently given. Rather, that transcript reveals that the federal agents approached Willis at his home, told him that they had information that there might be stolen whiskey in the barn, and advised him that he need not consent to the search. In response, Willis disclaimed any knowledge of such whiskey, willingly signed the consent form in the presence of witnesses, and accompanied the agents to the farm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">We find no merit in Willis\u2019 third claim that the District Court erred in refusing to require disclosure of the name of the informer who assertedly advised the federal agents that the stolen whiskey might be found in the barn. The motion for disclosure was made during the hearing on Willis\u2019 motion to suppress, and it was supported by no allegations that the requested disclosure would in any way assist Willis in his defense on the merits. This claim is thus controlled by Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 534-535, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964), wherein the Supreme Court upheld a District Court\u2019s denial of a similar motion for disclosure made in the context of a motion to suppress and unrelated to the petitioner\u2019s defense on the merits. <em>Compare </em>Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S. Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957); United States v. Lloyd, 400 F.2d 414 (6th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Finally, we turn to Willis\u2019 claim that the District Court abused its discretion in denying, without a hearing, Willis\u2019 motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. This motion was supported by the affidavit of a former Elkton, Kentucky, policeman, who stated that he had witnessed a warrantless search of the barn by the Elkton Police Chief, a deputy sheriff, and an unknown individual prior to the time the federal agents secured the consent to search. Because this affidavit was uncontradict-ed and the District Court conducted no hearing thereon and made no findings of fact with respect thereto, we must accept the statements in the affidavit as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">We nonetheless conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Willis\u2019 motion for a new trial. We do not accept Willis\u2019 argument that the prior, unlawful search by local officials rendered Willis\u2019 written consent to the subsequent search by federal agents any less knowing or intelligent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, we hold that even in view of the evidence of the prior, unlawful search \u2014 of which the federal agents may or may not have had knowledge \u2014 the search by the federal agents pursuant to Willis\u2019 written consent was reasonable, and therefore the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial without conducting a hearing. <em>See </em>United States v. Crowder, 351 F.2d 101, 104 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">II. No. 72-1398 \u2014 Loftin</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Appellant Loftin claims that the District Court erred as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">(1) In ruling that he had no standing to challenge the reasonableness of the search of co-defendant Willis\u2019 barn;</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">(2) In refusing to conduct an in camera hearing on his motion for disclosure of the identity of the asserted informer; and</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>(3) In denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Although Appellant Loftin asserted no possession or control of the barn, it appears that the District Court erred in refusing to recognize his standing to challenge the search under the rule enunciated in Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 263-265, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960) (affording such standing to any defendant charged with a substantive crime consisting of possession of contraband).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Whereas Loftin thus may have had standing to challenge the search, co-defendant Willis\u2019 consent to the search precludes Loftin from making such a challenge. It is clear that a search pursuant to the consent of one co-defendant is reasonable as to other co-defendants holding an interest in the premises equal to or lesser than that of the informer. <em>See </em>Friedman v. United States, 381 F.2d 155, 158-159 (8th Cir. 1967); Drummond v. United States, 350 F.2d 983, 989 (8th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 944, 86 S.Ct. 1469, 16 L. Ed.2d 542 (1966); United States v. Sferas, 210 F.2d 69, 74 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 935, 74 S.Ct. 630, 98 L. Ed. 1086 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Loftin\u2019s second claim \u2014 that the District Court, erred in refusing to conduct an in camera hearing on his motion for disclosure of the identity of the asserted informer \u2014 is without merit for the reasons set forth under the comparable claim asserted in Willis\u2019 appeal above.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Nor is there any merit to Loftin\u2019s final claim that the District Court erred in denying his motion for acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a jury verdict of guilty. Two witnesses testified that they had seen Loftin near the Willis farm. Two witnesses \u2014 one of them an independent witness and the other an accomplice who had pleaded guilty \u2014 testified that Loftin had approached them individually and offered each of them money if they would drive a White tractor-trailer to Clarksville, Tennessee. The stolen White tractor-trailer was subsequently found in a junkyard, the owner of which testified that he had done business with Loftin on prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Beyond this circumstantial evidence \u2014which, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), is \u201cintrinsically no different from testimonial evidence\u201d [see <em>also </em>United States v. Bradley, 421 F.2d 924, 926 (6th Cir. 1970)] \u2014 the testimony of co-defendant Willis inculpated Loftin with the theft and the unloading of the whiskey at the barn. Moreover, Loftin admitted many of the above facts, and merely asserted that he had no knowledge that the whiskey was in the barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Without weighing the evidence, and taking the view of it, and all inferences which may reasonably and justifiably be drawn from it, most favorable to the Government, we conclude that there was clearly sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict that Loftin was guilty of wilfully and knowingly possessing the stolen whiskey. <em>See </em>Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1941); United States v. Conti, 339 F.2d 10, 13 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">III. No. 72-1399 \u2014 Fish</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Appellant Fish asserts that the District Court erred in:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">(1) Denying his motion for acquittal on the ground that the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices alone cannot sustain a guilty verdict, and</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">(2) Rejecting a requested instruction respecting accomplice testimony and, while cautioning the jury respecting such testimony, advising the jury that they should not be concerned with defense counsel\u2019s references to the possibility that the accomplice who pleaded guilty and served as a Government witness might receive a lighter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">The evidence inculpating Fish with the theft and possession of the whiskey consisted primarily of the testimony of accomplice Paul Martin, who pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>guilty and served as a witness for the Government. The testimony of accomplice and co-defendant Willis also implicated Fish, albeit to a much less significant degree than that of Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Under his first claim, Fish urges us to overrule this Court\u2019s longstanding rule that the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice may be sufficient to uphold a conviction. <em>See </em>United States v. Haynes, 403 F.2d 54 (6th Cir. 1968); United States v. Callis, 390 F.2d 606 (6th Cir. 1968); Continental Baking Company v. United States, 281 F.2d 137, 155 (6th Cir. 1960); Nichols v. United States, 276 F.2d 147 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 815, 81 S.Ct. 45, 5 L.Ed.2d 47 (1960). Assuming that it is within our power to change this rule <em>[see </em>Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470, 495, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917)], we decline to do so on the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As to Fish\u2019s second claim, we hold that the District Court did not err in refusing to give the requested jury instruction respecting accomplice testimony. Rather, the following instruction given by the Court adequately cautioned the jury respecting that testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cNow, we have had in this case the testimony of two witnesses, Mr. Brown and Mr. Martin, who by their own admissions participated in this crime and committed the crime themselves in connection, as they stated, with other persons, some one or more of the other defendants at times. Under the law a person who is an accomplice who by his own admission is a part of the offense and has committed the offense, his testimony should be viewed with caution and suspicion; where he, himself, admits committing the crime, that fact should be taken into consideration by the jury. However, you may \u2014 you heard these witnesses testify, you saw their demeanor on the witness stand, you may find that they told you the truth and what they said was true, and the mere fact that they were accomplices in your judgment may not be sufficient fact to ignore what they said or to question what they said. But the Court instructs you that they are accomplices and you are to take that fact into consideration in considering the evidence which they offer here from the witness stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\"><em>Compare </em>United States v. Haynes, <em>supra, </em>403 F.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Nor do we find that Fish was in any way prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s advising the jury that since the sentencing of Martin would be entirely within the discretion of the Court, they need not concern themselves with defense counsel\u2019s reference to the fact that Martin had pleaded guilty and was awaiting sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed as to each of the three Appellants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AFr\">. \u201cNovember 9, 1970 at Elkton, Ky. I, John G. Willis, having been informed of my constitutional rights not to have a search made of the premises hereinafter mentioned without a search warrant, and of my rights to refuse to consent to such a search, hereby authorized Arthur S. Webb and Willard O. Thorpe, Special Agents of the F.B.I., department of Justice, to conduct a complete search of my premises located at Clifty, Kentucky, Route 3, Elkton, Kentucky. These agents are authorized by me to take from my premises any letters, papers, materials or other property which they may desire.</p>\n<p id=\"avs-dedup-1\">This written permission is being given by me to the above-named Special Agents voluntarily and without threats or promises of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"atl-dedup-0\">/s/ John G. Willis\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">. Although in his motion for a new trial Willis presented evidence that in securing his consent to the search the federal agents may have withheld knowledge of a prior unlawful search of the bam by local officials, no such evidence was before the District Court at the hearing on the motion to suppress. This evidence, therefore, is relevant only to Willis\u2019 final claim that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Willis\u2019 motion for a new trial without conducting a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-14\">. Had the federal agents\u2019 search for and seizure of the stolen whiskey been undertaken pursuant to a search warrant, requiring a showing of probable cause, we have no doubt that the District Court would have been required to resolve any claim that the probable cause for the warrant emerged from a prior, unlawful search of the premises. That is not the case before us, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
