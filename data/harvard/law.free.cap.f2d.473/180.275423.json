The District Court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">I. <em>Facts; and District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Mr. Finley was employed on October 25, 1965, by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), now a part of HUD. His position, Employee Relations Specialist, Employee Relations and Security Section, Personnel Division, was not then classed as security \u201csensitive,\u201d but on November 22, 1965, the head of FHA designated it \u201csensitive.\u201d For three years previous to his employment by FHA, Finley had been employed at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, in a position designated \u201csensitive,\u201d and held an Air Force security clearance at the level \u201csecret.\u201d However, \u00a7 3(b) of Executive Order (Ex.O.) 10450 (April 27, 1953), as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that \u201cany position so designated [as sensitive] shall be filled or occupied only by a person with respect to whom a full field investigation has been conducted,\u201d and it made every agency head responsible for establishing a program to insure that employment and retention of any civilian employee be \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d The FHA accordingly requested the CSC to conduct a full-field investigation (FFI). This was completed in late March 1966, and the CSC furnished the investigative report to HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">A few days later, Finley\u2019s supervisor <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>approached him, stating he had the results of the FFI and wished to discuss them with Finley. This superior informed Finley that the FFI had uncovered witnesses who reported that two of his associates had \u201chomosexual mannerisms.\u201d In Finley\u2019s account, this conversation came after his work load fell off, and he was paid \u201cjust to sit there\u201d without any work. Finley described the encounter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-17\">[H]e said to me, \u201cthe investigation report reveals that two of your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>friends have homosexual mannerisms. I asked [the supervisor] to explain his remarks, but he only said to me, \u201cWe know the kind of person you are. Come on now, confess, who are these people?\u201d Then he began to berate me. Things worsened after this incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The Government does not contradict Finley\u2019s account of the confrontation, but refers to it as an opportunity provided to him pursuant to Instruction 62 of the Federal Personnel Manual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">A person being considered for a sensitive position should have, whenever appropriate, an opportunity to explain or refute derogatory security information developed in an investigation before being rejected or nonse-lected on security grounds. Otherwise, persons may be unjustly rejected or nonselected on security grounds because of mistaken identity or because certain mitigating circumstances were not known to the prospective employing agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The record shows that, subsequent to the meeting with his superior, Finley filed a statement under oath with respect to the witness\u2019 disclosures; but it does not set forth the content of that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">On June 15, 1966, some 2% months after completion of the FFI, the FHA Commissioner \u201crequested that the sensitive designation be removed\u201d from Finley\u2019s position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The next day, FHA\u2019s Personnel Security Officer \u201cdetermined that [Finley] is granted clearance for a non-sensitive position.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Shortly thereafter, Finley commenced a series of unavailing efforts, personally and through counsel, to discover the exact nature and sources of the information on the mannerisms of his friends. These efforts included correspondence with Congressmen and Senators and, in the Executive Branch, with the President and with various officials in FHA, HUD and the Civil Service Commission. He also sought unsuccessfully for relief through the FHA grievance appeal process. He was denied an appeal on the ground that he had not suffered pay or grade impairment, suspension or removal, and hence was not the subject of \u201cadverse action\u201d for purposes of the grievance appeal process, see 5 C.FJEt. \u00a7 772.-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Finley\u2019s complaint prayed (a) an order directing HUD and the CSC to expunge the (allegedly) derogatory material from his files (HUD personnel file and CSC investigative file); (b) a declaration that he was eligible for a \u201csecret\u201d clearance insofar as such (allegedly) derogatory information is concerned; or (c) an order directing defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>grant a hearing at which he could cross-examine those who supplied the information on his friends\u2019 mannerisms. On appeal he has limited himself to a claim for expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The District Judge, while agreeing that the information given by unnamed witnesses pertaining to the mannerisms of Finley\u2019s friends could not lawfully be made the basis for adverse action,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that Finley could not base a claim merely on the existence in the investigative file of comments received during the full-field investigation; and since Finley had not suffered a grade or pay impairment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014 and indeed has received several promotions since the incident with his superi- or \u2014 the court concluded he had not suffered injury from any action taken by the Government.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II. <em>Applicable Legal Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We agree with the District Court that plaintiff has not shown any cognizable legal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s case is responsive to the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-18\">\u201cestablished principle that to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained, or is immediately in danger of sustaining, a direct injury as the result of that action. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">See Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 2325, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972), dismissing a claim that plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights were violated by the maintenance of an Army data-gathering system, which plaintiffs challenged as involving the surveillance of lawful civilian political activity. There is constraint upon the courts both from the constitutional requirement of a justicia-ble case or controversy<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and from the limitations appropriate to the exercise of a court\u2019s equitable powers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is particularly apposite in circumstances, like the present case, where the present injury, if any, is ephemeral in nature and the prospect of future harm is remote and speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">We take up, <em>seriatim, </em>the various bases that Finley advances for the maintenance of his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>1. Finley contends that the gathering and retention of information concerning his acquaintances and their mannerisms has a \u201cchilling effect\u201d upon the exercise of his right to freedom of association.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cAllegations of a subjective \u2018chill\u2019 are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm. . . . \u201d Laird v. Tatum, <em>supra, </em>at 13-14, 92 S.Ct. at 2325. See also, United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947) (cited with approval in Laird v. Tatum); Davis v. Ichord, 143 U.S.App. D.C. 183, 442 F.2d 1207 (1970). Thus, to present a justiciable controversy, it must be shown that the asserted inhibition upon the exercise of constitutional rights arises in the context of an extant or imminently threatened governmental sanction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the question remains whether Finley has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">2. Finley may be unhappy about the presence in his file of adverse and perhaps untrue comments by persons interviewed, even though he cannot establish concretely the possible consequences of these comments. But the court cannot strike such material from his file, or take any action, in the absence of a real threat of injury in the form of a Government action or a finding on the basis of such material.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no allegation that the data were unlawfully acquired. When the plaintiff sought federal employment he impliedly consented that Government investigators interview others concerning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">3. Given the existence in the investigative file of the comments of the persons interviewed, the disclosure to Finley did not constitute either legal harm or a basis for judicial intervention. If anything, such disclosure to an employee is an advantage, giving him the benefit of knowing what is in his file, for good or ill, enabling him to adduce such matters as he considers pertinent in rebuttal, and putting him on the alert to discern adverse action in the future. This may be subject to a psychological offset of unease and concern, but the law cannot assume that a Government employee would rather be an ostrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">4. Finley alleges he suffered injury when his position was declassified upon completion of the FFI. The fact remains, however, that he was not separated from employment or demoted. Indeed, he was thereafter promoted on at least two occasions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Finley does not contend that either his original position at HUD or any subsequent HUD position, including that held when the complaint was filed (Deputy Chief, Career Development and Training Branch, Personnel Division of the Federal Housing Administration), were in fact \u201csensitive\u201d. When the appropriate Government official reconsidered whether a security classification and clearance was appropriate and decided that the position was not security sensitive, the Government had no need to evaluate the information allegedly concerning plaintiff\u2019s friends or to determine whether this would block a security clearance or require a further investigation before a security clearance could be granted. This is simply not the same, either in form or substance, as the denial of a security clearance. It is rather a reasonable conclusion by a responsible official that the agency\u2019s earlier decision to classify the position had been unwarranted. The action taken in rectifying this error carries no stigma for the plaintiff. He may assert, truthfully as to the spirit as well as the letter, that he has never been denied a security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The record before us contains a statement of HUD\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration: \u201cThere is no record in said folder [plaintiff\u2019s official personnel folder] or file [investigative file] of any \u2018adverse action\u2019 having been recommended, suggested or proposed with respect to plaintiff.\u201d <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We have considered the suggestion that, even though Finley cannot directly invoke the procedure provided by statute (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7532) and regulation in the event of suspension or removal taken in the interest of national security, the court should vindicate his right to a hearing on the declassification of Finley\u2019s position because it may be considered tantamount to the denial of a security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Confronted with such a claim, the courts must focus on the effect of a security clearance, or its denial in a concrete context, and not abstractly. The critical importance of this approach is underscored by a comparison of Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959) with Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961). Both of these cases involved civilian employees of defense contractors who were dismissed after loyalty investigations resulted in adverse findings. In <em>Greene, </em>the Court interpreted the relevant Executive Order so as to prohibit the revocation of a security clearance in the absence of an adequate hearing procedure; while the decision is technically one of statutory construction, the Court strongly intimated that a contrary result would run afoul of the due process clause, 360 U.S. at 496-497, 507-508, 79 S.Ct. 1400. In <em>Cafeteria Workers, </em>on the other hand, the Court held that the Constitution did not preclude denial of a security clearance, which summarily barred an employee from access to a naval installation, without benefit of either notice or a hearing. As the Court saw it, the distinction between the two cases lay in the impact that the denial of a security clearance had on the respective employees\u2019 ability to earn a livelihood. Greene had been an aeronautical engineer. Following his discharge, he had been effectively barred from employment in any sphere of the aero-space industry and was forced to eke out a living \u2014 at greatly reduced salary \u2014 as an architectural draftsman. Mrs. Brawner, whose exclusion from the Naval Gun Factory premises was upheld in <em>Cafeteria Workers, </em>was a short-order cook. Her employment at a defense installation had been merely in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>cidental, and the Court found that her transfer to a snack bar located in less sensitive environs did not appreciably detract from her earnings or her convenience. What emerges from these cases is the principle that the courts will, in considering whether there is a case for judicial intervention, examine the practical impact upon the employee of the holding or denial of a security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Finley has made no showing that the declassification action had any impact upon him. He has suffered no loss of pay, seniority, grade, or like tangible benefit. He makes no claim that access to classified documents is now or ever was required by the nature of his position in HUD. The positions he has held and now holds at HUD, both originally and after two promotions, are of middle-level responsibility in the civil service. No claim has been made that the lack of a security clearance in any way hampers or restricts him in the discharge of these responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">5. This brings us to the possibility that the information contained in Finley\u2019s security file may be used at some future date to foreclose his opportunities. Implicit in this argument are two premises, and to prevail the appellant must establish both of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">He must first show threatened injury \u2014at least that some official might be inclined to take action merely on the basis of the comments that led to this lawsuit. District Judge Hart dismissed this as a substantial possibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">The information as related is pure silly, just silly. Why anybody would pay attention to it all . . . I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">While Judge Hart\u2019s observation is sound as far as it goes, the fact that officials should not take action on the basis of such information does not mean that they will not, and it is to gain such assurance that plaintiff seeks judicial relief. Middle-level bureaucrats may react to this kind of information out of an excess of timidity. Even higher level officers declined to dismiss the comments of the informants as valueless.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, they did not go so far as to say that the information was a reasonable predicate for any personnel action. And we have no basis, other than pure speculation, to conclude that material like the \u201cmannerisms\u201d statements, unsupported by additional and significant material, would actually be made the basis of an adverse personnel decision by a Government official.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">More significantly, we have no basis other than speculation to discern the possible shape of future circumstances that would bring about an actual threat of prejudicial action to Finley\u2019s detriment. There is no evidence or tender that the ability to obtain a security \u25a0clearance has or is likely to have any practical value to a man in Finley\u2019s position. The Government asserts that HUD is in the process of declassifying positions for which a \u201csensitive\u201d designation is no longer necessary or appropriate. For all that appears, Finley\u2019s natural course of advancement in HUD, in accordance with his capabilities, may lie wholly outside the realm of classified jobs. Finley does not allege that he is now in fact seeking or planning to seek a classified position. The prospect of Finley\u2019s suffering harm by being refused nomination to a sensitive position is, therefore, doubly remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">This is not a case where the threat to the Government employee has been made concrete by a denial of a security clearance, or by some finding doubting his loyalty. That is a cardinal point in the case before us, and one which distinguishes Newell v. Ignatius, 132 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>S.App.D.C. 252, 407 F.2d 715 (1969). Newell brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that while he was a college student the Navy had disenrolled him from the Naval Reserve Officers Candidate Program \u201cbecause he was characterized by Navy officials as \u2018disloyal\u2019.\u201d He sought an order invalidating the disenrollment and expunging from his naval records any statement impugning his loyalty or security status. The District Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiff sought summary reversal in order that the references in his record might be deleted by the time of his entry into the civilian job market. While this court denied that motion, except to the extent it provided an expedited briefing and argument schedule, it made provision for some immediate relief, after taking note of the following: (a) The \u201charsh impact such statements could have on appellant\u2019s future\u201d, (b) The Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s advice to Newell\u2019s counsel, subsequent to the references by Navy officers that troubled plaintiff, \u201cSeaman Newell\u2019s loyalty is not questioned. * * *\u201d [T]here is no basis to allege that Seaman Newell is a security risk.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This court called for a statement by the Navy concerning the actions taken to expunge from its records all references to Newell\u2019s \u201cdisloyalty\u201d or \u201csecurity.\u201d The Navy duly reported on the physical expungement from Newell\u2019s records of the documents containing references by Navy officers, not merely comments by outsiders to Navy investigators.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">When this court, by order of February 25, 1969, granted appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, the court noted that defendants had expunged from the Navy\u2019s records the disenrollment order, \u201cand have also expunged the Navy\u2019s files which stated or implied that any of the beliefs, associates, and opinions of appellant Newell referred to in said dis-enrollment order suggested doubt as to his loyalty to the United States.\u201d Finding that this expungement protected Newell \u201cfrom any adverse effect of the said documents on his civilian employment opportunities,\u201d the court dismissed the appeal as moot.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Finley\u2019s file does not contain any determination or assertion by Government personnel concerning plaintiff or his fitness to continue in federal employ; it merely records what others had said to Government investigators. The information has never been given a hallmark of significance. In <em>Newell, </em>on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>hand,, the court had before it references by Navy officials made in the course of appraisals of applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">We summarize our appraisal of Finley\u2019s ease by beginning with the axiom that any rights of a Government employee or applicant must be founded on a Congressional statute, expressly or by fair implication, Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959), or a constitutional imperative. Congress has given substantial procedural protection to Government employees who are separated or demoted, and this protection extends to adverse personnel actions taken on security grounds, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7532(c). We do not think this extends to a managerial action like the declassification of a position as sensitive in the absence of a claim that this was merely a disguise for an adverse action, like a transfer, demotion, or denial of security clearance directed against the employee personally, or a showing that it operated with the practical impact of denying a security clearance and in fact foreclosing or curtailing employment opportunities. We discern no right to demand the expungement of lawfully acquired information merely because of the speculative possibility that it might be given unwarranted emphasis under some hypothetical future state of facts. Nor can we discern the shape of a legal right to demand, in effect, that a security hearing be held in order to \u201cclear\u201d the record against any possibility of such adverse consequences. Courts do not resolve hypothetical controversies or render advisory opinions; and when there is no showing of a security sensitive position, in being or in prospect, the courts cannot build on a speculative possibility of harm to require the Executive Department to convene a \u201cmoot court\u201d to appraise all or part of the employee\u2019s file. This, we think, is the clear implication of the authoritative jurisprudence that governs this court. Laird v. Tatum, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-13\">. Ex.O. 10450 as issued appears at 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (1953), and as amended at 5 U.S.C.

We do not think retention of a lawful investigation report in the security file becomes the subject of a justiciable controversy because of the pesky problem that some of its contents may generate gossip. Finley claims that the \u201cevidence\u201d developed by the FFI unleased a flurry of gossip in his office with the result that he became the subject of harassment by his fellow employees.

SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ADN\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Having been a member of the panel of this court in Newell v. Ignatius, 132 U. S.App.D.C. 252, 407 F.2d 715 (1969), I must respectfully dissent. In <em>Newell </em>an enlisted man on active duty in the United States Naval Reserve brought suit to have expunged from his naval records statements \u201cimpugning his loyalty or security status.\u201d 132 U.S.App.D.C. at 253, 407 F.2d at 716. After dismissal of his action by the District Court, in this court he argued that since he was soon to leave the Navy, these references in his military record might adversely affect his opportunities in the civilian job market. The Navy admitted that the statements were in his Navy file, but stated further: \u201cSeaman Newell\u2019s loyalty is not questioned. * * * [T]here is no basis to allege that Seaman Newell is a security risk.\u201d 132 U.S.App.D.C. at 254, 407 F.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">On the basis of that record, and approaching the matter pragmatically, this court made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">\u201cFrom this statement of the Navy Department and from the representation of the Government at argument, we conclude that the Navy is fully prepared and willing, if indeed it has not already done so, to take all necessary actions to expunge all references which in any way allude to \u2018disloyalty\u2019 or \u2018security.\u2019 We therefore -accept the Government\u2019s representation that these steps will be consummated forthwith if that has not already been done; Government counsel will promptly confirm these representations by appropriate communication to this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-16\">\u201cSo ordered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-17\"><em>Ibid. </em>In due course the Government counsel confirmed that all the objectionable references had been physically expunged from Newell\u2019s military record.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-18\">In <em>Newell </em>appellant initially sought, not only expungement of the adverse references in his file, but also a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>order invalidating his disenrollment from the Naval Reserve Officer Candidate Program. As here with respect to appellant\u2019s failure to obtain security-clearance, the Navy in <em>Newell </em>assured the court that the adverse information in the file was unrelated to Newell\u2019s dis-enrollment from the Program. Nevertheless, the court ordered the Navy to expunge the adverse information from Newell\u2019s record. I think we should do the same thing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">With the Newell<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> precedent before them, why appellees here refuse to expunge the silly (except to silly people) statements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in suit from appellant\u2019s record is a mystery to me, unless, of cours\u00e9, appellees intend to use them again against appellant in the event he is ever considered again for a job requiring security clearance. If this is the reason for the apparent bureaucratic intransigence, and the Government\u2019s brief on appeal clearly so indicates,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> then the harm to appellant is obvious and continuing. The questioned statements not only denied him a security clearance at the inception of this litigation ;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they preclude the reasonable possibility that he will ever even be considered for a job requiring security clearance as long as he is in Government service. Thus appellant\u2019s case' is significantly stronger than that of the ' employee of the Government contractor in Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S. Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pellant here is a career Government employee, whereas Greene was a private employee working on a Government contract. At the very least, as in <em>Greene, </em>appellant is entitled to an appropriate hearing. The nearest he came to a hearing here was a confrontation with his supervisor who berated him: \u201cWe know the kind of person you are. Come on now, confess, who are these people?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Expunging the objectionable statements here will not, as the Government suggests, open all the dossiers being kept on Government employees to inspection by the Government employees concerned, and thus stimulate an avalanche of lawsuits designed to have objectionable file information expunged. The objectionable material in appellant\u2019s file surfaced because it resulted in his being denied security clearance. Appellant did not even know of the information until he in effect was charged by his supervisor with being a homosexual.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\">. The Government attempts to distinguish <em>Newell, </em>stating in its brief, p. 21, that this \u201ccourt ordered the Navy to expunge baseless references to appellant\u2019s loyalty from naval records\u201d because \u201cthere was no showing that the naval record was required to be \u2018maintained in confidence.\u2019 \u201d The question of maintaining Newell\u2019s naval records in confidence was not an issue in the case. Moreover, anyone who has been around government any length of time knows how \u201cconfidential\u201d derogatory personnel records are, particularly where the employee is in effect charged with being a homosexual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\">. The statements were to the effect that two of appellant\u2019s friends \u201chave homosexual mannerisms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. The Government argues that the gathering of the type of information in suit is specifically authorized. Its Brief at p. 11 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">\u201c * * * The information consists of statements of persons who were of the opinion that some of plaintiff\u2019s associates appeared to them to have mannerisms which are often those associated with persons who are homosexual' or who appear to be homosexual. Of course, this information is clearly relevant to the investigative criteria of Section 8 (a) (1) (iii) of Executive Order 10450, to wit: \u2018Any . . . infamous immoral or notoriously disgraceful conduct ... or sexual perversion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The Government also argues that the information must be maintained for future use. At pp. 16-17 the Government brief reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">\u201cThus, we see that Section 9(c) of Executive Order 10450 <em>requires </em>the physical retention of the investigative material concerning plaintiff. The interest of the government in preserving such information is apparent. * * * If a future clearance were sought there would be delay, and also the investigation might be thwarted by reason of the fact that persons interviewed concerning him previously were no longer available, and persons having information <em>favorable </em>[or unfavorable] to him <em>might not be </em>available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-14\">. The Government piously argues that the homosexual information in his file was not responsible for denying appellant security clearance. According to its brief, pp. 14-15, it appears that after considering the information it was decided by the Secretary that appellant\u2019s job did not require security clearance after all. An inference, perhaps <em>nearer to the </em>truth, would be that the Secretary did not have either the nerve or the stomach to fire him on the basis of this information so he redesignated appellant\u2019s job as nonsensitive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b250-15\">. The Court in <em>Greene </em>did not rest its decision on constitutional grounds. It held that the Secretary had no authority from the President or Congress to deny Greene security clearance which <em>cost him his </em>job \u201cin a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and crossexamination.\u201d 360 U.S. at 508, 79 S.Ct. at 1420. Even the substantial due process accorded Green was insufficient. Here appellant had no hearing; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>he was not told who his accusers were or even which of his friends were allegedly homosexual. He was merely told by his supervisor, acting, we are advised by the Government, not as his supervisor but as \u201cChief of the Employee Relations and Security Section \u2014 Deputy Personnel Security Officer,\u201d that he should confess and name hi\u00a7~homosexual friends.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
