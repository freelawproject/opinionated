The books concerned drug traffic, drug problems, and people involved in drugs. The factual circumstances requiring the remand order and the directions given to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing appear in our prior opinion, Paz v. U. S., 462 F.2d 740 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-21\">The trial judge has conducted an evi-dentiary hearing as directed, the transcript thereof<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions have been certified to us, and the parties have filed briefs on the remand issue. In the hearing each juror and alternate was interrogated out of the presence of the other jurors. As each appeared the court interrogated him first and then gave counsel the opportunity to examine. Following the hearing the trial judge entered a lengthy order containing detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-22\">The procedure followed by the trial judge and the standards employed by him complied with our remand directions. We find no error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that there is no reasonable possibility that the books \u2014 \u25a0 brought to the court by an alternate juror who did not participate in the jury\u2019s deliberations \u2014 affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-23\">The evidentiary hearing brought to light the possibility that a pamphlet, received by the same alternate juror (a dentist) in his professional capacity and listing the names of some drugs, may have been brought into the jury room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The District Court reached the conclusion that there was no reasonable possibility that the pamphlet \u2014 if brought into the jury room at all \u2014 affected the verdict. We find no error in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The findings and conclusions of the District Court on remand are affirmed. This requires that the convictions under Count I be, and they hereby are, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-24\">.
