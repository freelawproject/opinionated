The origin of the dispute lies in that round of contract negotiations between the Nation\u2019s railroads and four of the six railroad shop craft unions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was ultimately concluded only upon enactment by Congress of Public Law 91-226 on April 9, 1970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-18\">Public Law 91-226 placed into effect\u2014 \u201cas though arrived at by agreement of the parties under the Railway Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>Act\u201d \u2014 a Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter Memorandum), relating to the dispute between the parties that had been agreed to by the bargaining representatives of all four parties to the negotiation, but which had failed of ratification by the membership of one of the unions, the Sheet Metal Workers. This Memorandum included an \u201cincidental work rule\u201d by which the bargaining representatives of the unions agreed, subject to ratification by their respective members, to relax the formerly rigid classification of\u25a0 work rules to the extent of permitting a carefully limited crossing of normal craft lines at \u201crunning repair work locations\u201d on the Nation\u2019s railroads for the performance of tasks \u201cincidental\u201d to a \u201cmain work assignment.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\">Following the enactment of Public Law 91-226 the railroads concluded a national agreement with the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen (Carmen), one of the other shop craft unions, containing an identically phrased \u201cincidental work rule.\u201d Shortly after consummation of this agreement with the Carmen the Washington Terminal Company began assigning \u201cincidental work\u201d normally falling within the Electricians\u2019 classification to employees belonging to the Carmen\u2019s union. The Electricians immediately complained to the Company and, after direct discussions had led to no satisfactory resolution, this suit was initiated by the IBEW (Electricians) on September 15, 1970. The objective of the litigation is to prevent the Company from continuing to use Carmen to perform any incidental work of Electricians. On September 29, the District Court denied a temporary restraining order, and after hearing oral argument on October 6, the District Judge ruled from the bench that a preliminary injunction against the Company was not warranted. An order formally stating that conclusion was entered October 19, and this appeal followed. We believe the request for preliminary injunction was properly denied and accordingly we affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"pAHe1\">A. <em>National Negotiations Leading to Passage of Public Law 91-226 </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">This dispute represents another episode in the long-running struggle over work rules between the nation\u2019s railroads and the labor organizations who represent railroad employees. Negotiations were initiated in November 1968 when four of the shop craft unions \u2014 the Machinists, Electricians, Boilermakers and Sheet Metal Workers (IAM, IBEW, IBBB and SMWI) \u2014 and the railroads exchanged notices pursuant to section 6 of the Railway Labor Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The unions\u2019 notices requested only increases in wage rates; the railroads\u2019 notices proposed a broad range of changes in work rules, including a rule which would eliminate work classification distinctions between the four unions and create, in essence, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>composite mechanic\u2019s classification. Bargaining on these proposals proceeded through the entire range of procedures provided by the Railway Labor Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with the only appreciable progress coming through Emergency Board No. 176\u2019s recommendations for narrowing the issues to be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">Having exhausted the procedures of the Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in a last ditch attempt to avoid the consequences of a nationwide rail strike, intensive bargaining through the mediation efforts of the Department of Labor was commenced. The major breakthrough in these negotiations occurred when the Unions presented a draft of an \u201cincidental work rule\u201d in substantially the same form as it appeared in the final memorandum. Following this dramatic shift in the unions\u2019 position the carriers responded with significantly increased wage offers and a Memorandum of Understanding was reached and initialed by all parties on December 4, 1969. However, by prior agreement among the unions this Memorandum was submitted to each union\u2019s membership for ratification with the understanding that all four unions must ratify or n\u00f3n\u00e9 would sign a formal contract embodying the terms of the Memorandum. On December 17, the ratification votes were announced; the Sheet Metal Workers had rejected the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">The key to this agreement, the source of dissatisfaction to the Sheet Metal Workers, and the source of the dispute before us here, was the \u201cincidental work rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">\n<em>The Incidental Work Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">The principal part of the rule provides <footnotemark>8</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-12\">At running repair work locations which are not designated as outlying points where a mechanic or mechanics of a craft or crafts are performing a work assignment, the completion of which calls for the performance of \u201cincidental work\u201d (as hereinafter defined) covered by the classification of work rules of another craft or crafts, such mechanic or mechanics may be required, so far as they are capable, to perform such incidental work provided it does not comprise a preponderant part of the total amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>of work involved in the assignment. W\u00f3rk shall be regarded as \u201cincidental\u201d when it involves the removal and replacing or the disconnecting and connecting of parts and appliances such as wires, piping, covers, shielding and other appurtenances from or near the main work assignment in order to accomplish that assignment. Incidental work shall be considered to comprise a preponderant part of the assignment when the time normally required to accomplish it exceeds the time normally required to accomplish the main work assignment. In no instance will the work of overhauling, repairing, modifying or otherwise improving. equipment be regarded as incidental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">The carriers considered this rule to be both a major milestone in their efforts to achieve more efficient utilization of manpower, and the quid pro quo essential to the wage increases they had offered. The Sheet Metal Workers were unwilling to consider any lower wages than those offered, yet their opposition to the incidental work rule was so implacable that they contended no wage increase would be sufficient to induce them to accept the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Faced with these respective bargaining positions, further Labor Department mediation efforts were futile and the parties prepared to resort to self-help. The unions struck the Union Pacific on January 31, 1970; the railroads promptly announced a nationwide lockout to take effect at 10:00 p. m. the same date; and both parties brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to restrain the action of the other. Temporary restraining orders were entered that afternoon halting the strike and forestalling the lockout.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These orders were subsequently extended 'through March 2, when a preliminary injunction against selective strikes by the unions was issued.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">Negotiations sponsored by the Labor Department continued during this period, with two significant changes taking place. Recognizing the implacable opposition of the Sheet Metal Workers to the agreement reached in December, the other three unions \u2014 Electricians, Machinists and Boilermakers \u2014 offered to sign a contract embodying the terms of the Memorandum without the Sheet Metal Workers joining. When the carriers rejected this offer, the Carmen indicated their willingness to sign such a contract and the representatives of the three other unions offered to replace the Sheet Metal Workers with the Carmen and sign the contract with those four unions. This proffered agreement without the Sheet Metal Workers was also rejected by the carriers. Meanwhile, the Sheet Metal Workers withdrew authority from the national union bargaining team to represent them, and they declared that any further negotiations would have to be conducted with one of their own officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">When the District Court announced its injunction against selective strikes on March 2, 1970, all of the original four unions declared their intention to commence a nationwide rail strike at midnight on March 4th. The President responded to this threat to the nation\u2019s economic well-being by requesting legislation from Congress that would place the December 4, 1969 Memorandum of Understanding into effect as the contract between the parties.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>however, was unwilling, on such short notice, to force a contract on the still recalcitrant Sheet Metal Workers. Thus Public Law 91-203,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> enacted on March 4, 1970, froze the existing situation by prohibiting either a strike or a lockout prior to April 11, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">During the next month further negotiations were held under the mediation efforts of both the Labor Department and members of Congress. The Sheet Metal Workers union remained adamant in its opposition to the incidental work rule and the railroads refused to budge from their insistence that the wage increases offered were immutably tied to that rule and that any agreement must cover all four of the unions that were the original parties to the dispute. Recognizing this impasse, both the House and Senate committees considered the limited range of alternatives available to them and ultimately recommended passage of the President\u2019s March 3rd proposal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On April 9, 1970, Senate Joint Resolution 91-190 was enacted as Public Law 91-226. The operative language of the Joint Resolution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-10\"><em>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, </em>That the memorandum of understanding, dated December 4, 1969, shall have the same effect (including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>preclusion of resort to either strike or lockout) as though arrived at by agreement of the parties under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.) and that February 19, 1970, shall be deemed the \u201cdate of notification of ratification\u201d as used in this memorandum of understanding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">That a joint resolution was used to accomplish the intended result does not detract from the legislative character of the action. Congress legislates through \u201cacts\u201d and \u201cjoint resolutions.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Resolutions are recognized in the Constitution,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and a joint resolution is a bill within the meaning of the congressional rules and the processes of the Congress.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> With the exception of joint resolutions proposing amendments to the Constitution,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> all such resolutions are sent to the President for approval and have the full force of law. They are ordinarily used for what may be called the incidental, unusual, or inferior purposes of legislating but are used as well for the highest style of legislation \u2014 proposing amendments to the Constitution and abrogating treaties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">B. <em>Local Events Subsequent to Public Law 91-226</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">Upon passage of Public Law 91-226 the Washington Terminal Company be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>gan assigning incidental work among members of the four unions whose representatives had initialed the December 4, 1969 memorandum. The Company also, bargaining nationally along with the other railroads, signed an agreement with the Carmen that contained an incidental work rule that was identical to the rule in the Memorandum of Understanding that Congress had passed into effect by Public Law 91-226. Shortly after April 24, 1970, when this agreement with the Carmen took effect, the Company assigned as incidental work under the rule some electrical work to carmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">On May 1, Mr. S. A. Lloyd, General Chairman of the Electricians\u2019 local at the Company, filed a time claim, contending that \u201cThis work properly belongs to the electricians.\u201d App. 57.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Company denied this claim in a letter dated May 28 from Mr. J. E. McCabe, Master Mechanic, on the ground that the work was properly performed in accordance with the incidental work rule contained in the agreement implemented by Public Law 91-226. App. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">The following day, May 29, Mr. Lloyd wrote the Manager of the Company as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-11\">The practice of assigning work belonging to electricians at the car shop to the Carmen\u2019s Craft is in violation of Title I, Section 2, Paragraph 7 of the Railway Labor Act and constitutes a major dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-12\">Unless this practice is stopped, it will be necessary to resort to self help.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">App. 12.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Upon receipt of this strike threat, a meeting with Mr. Lloyd was arranged. The Company explained its contention that the dispute was a \u201cminor\u201d one concerning interpretation of the incidental work rule, and urged Mr. Lloyd to follow the procedures mandated by Section 3 of the Railway Labor Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, the Company agreed to stop assigning incidental work to ear-men pending a further meeting of national bargaining representatives of the railroads and the four unions who were parties to the December 4, 1969 memorandum. That meeting was scheduled for July 8, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>At approximately the same time as the conference between Mr. Lloyd and the Washington Terminal Company, the Southern Pacific began assigning incidental electrical work to carmen. The Electricians\u2019 local at that railroad protested, and after a conference failed to resolve the dispute the union announced that a strike of the Southern Pacific would take place on June 29, 1970. On that date the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California issued a restraining order, followed on July 9, 1970 with a preliminary injunction against the union.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the order granting that injunction the United States District Court in California found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-4\">the disputes and grievances which are the basis of defendant\u2019s strike do not concern changes in agreements, but instead concern the interpretation and application of existing agreements covering rates of pay, rules and working conditions and are minor disputes for which defendants have an appropriate administrative procedure for handling with plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">App. 67. Accordingly, the order was made conditional</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1225-6\">upon the submission of this dispute, within five (5) days of the date hereof, to the National Railroad Adjustment Board, or a Public Law Board [<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>] as provided for in the Railway Labor Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">App. 69. The Southern Pacific subsequently submitted the dispute to the Adjustment Board, where it remains pending at this date.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-13\">The July 8 meeting of the national bargaining representatives failed to achieve any further clarification or agreement concerning the incidental work rule. However, relying in large part on the fact that the District Court in the Southern Pacific litigation did not require that railroad to stop using carmen to perform incidental work, Washington-Terminal informed Mr. Lloyd that the Company intended to resume the practice of assigning incidental work to carmen. Approximately 17 such assignments were made from August 3-September 14,1970. App. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">This case was initiated on September 15, 1970 when the Electricians Union (IBEW) filed its complaint requesting declaratory and injunctive relief against the Company\u2019s use of anyone other than members of the Machinists, Boilermakers or Sheet Metal Workers unions to perform incidental work in the craft of electrical work. After denying a requested temporary restraining order on September 29, argument was heard on the Union\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction on October 6, 1970. At the conclusion of this hearing the District Court ruled from the bench, denying the requested injunction and on October 19, 1970 filed written findings, conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>and an order denying the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">The denial, as formulated in the written findings of October 19, 1970,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> was based on the District Court\u2019s assessment that the Electricians had not shown a probable likelihood of ultimate success on the merits to warrant an injunction. Three factors were singled out as leading to this conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-5\">First, that the Company\u2019s implementation of the \u201cincidental work rule\u201d under its agreement with the Carmen and under Public Law 91-226 implementing the Memorandum of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-16\">Agreement, and the electricians\u2019 challenge thereto, involves a \u201cminor dispute\u201d only and not a change in agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">Second, that the electricians had an adequate administrative remedy for the resolution of the issue by the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-18\">Third, that if the District Court were to interpret the Act it would hold that Congress intended the Memorandum of Agreement to apply \u201cacross the board,\u201d as opposed to a limited application to only those [four] . . craft unions involved in the negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>tions culminating in [the] Memorandum of Understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">In addition the court found the similar conclusions of the United States District Court in California in the Southern Pacific case to be quite persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">We affirm the order denying injunctive relief on the sole ground that the dispute is one which should be resolved under the \u201cminor dispute\u201d procedures of the Railway Labor Act. With this independent ground for affirmance, we need not decide the issues presented by the arguments of the parties concerning the proper interpretation of the Memorandum of Agreement or the precedential role of the Southern Pacific decision in the District Court's consideration of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">This court has recently considered the scope of our review of orders pertaining to preliminary injunctions in Delaware &amp; H. Ry. v. United Transp. Union, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 142, 158-161, 450 F.2d 603, 619-622 (1971). We discussed there the particular importance of the trial court\u2019s assessment of the movant\u2019s probability of success on the merits, and we noted that frequently the finding of irreparable injury on which an injunction is based \u201cdepends on an appraisal of the validity, or at least the probable validity, of the legal premise underlying the claim of right in jeopardy of impairment.\u201d 146 U.S.App. D.C. at 158-159, 450 F.2d at 619-620. This is such a case, for the Electricians contend that the Company\u2019s assignment of incidental electrical work to Carmen is a unilateral change in major conditions of employment which can only be made under the section 6 notice and negotiation procedures of the Railway Labor Act. The District Court concluded that the Electricians were unlikely to be able to establish the validity of that legal premise in a trial on the merits, because while the assignment of incidental electrical work to the Carmen was a change from the practices permitted under the old agreements, it did not constitute a change from practices that were arguably permitted by the incidental work rule as set forth in the Understanding implemented by Congress and in the Agreement with the Carmen. Actually the unilateral change in major conditions of employment was made previously by Congress when it implemented the Memorandum of Agreement by legislation not by the railroad when it acted in conformance therewith. In <em>Delaware &amp; H. Ry. </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-10\">Insofar as the action of the trial judge on a request for preliminary injunction rests, on a premise as to the pertinent rule of law, that premise is reviewable fully and de novo in the appellate court. The matter stands in a different posture from that involved when there is no question or disagreement as to the legal principle involved, and the element of probability of success on the merits depends on a forecast as to the shape of the facts likely to emerge at trial. If the appellate court has a view as to the applicable legal principle that is different from that premised by the trial judge, it has a duty to apply the principle which it believes proper and sound.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">146 U.S.App.D.C. at 159, 450 F.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\"> One of the reasons the District Court found the Electricians\u2019 chances of success on the merits to be doubtful was its conclusion that if it were to interpret Public Law 91-226<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it would be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>quired to hold that Congress intended the Act to apply not only to personnel of the four shop craft unions that were negotiating but also \u201cacross the board\u201d to include personnel of the other two shop \u201ccraft\u201d unions as well. App. 73. Thus, in the view of the trial court, the legal premise urged by the Electricians was barred by Public Law 91-226. We interpret the Railway Labor Act as conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the Adjustment Board to decide this question and hence conclude that the determination of this issue is not within the jurisdiction of the District Court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Electricians, however, contend that the issue should be judicially determined. Were we to do so on the <em>record </em>and arguments here presented we would agree with the general result reached by the trial court but we believe that neither the parties nor the court have articulated precisely the proper interpretation to be given to the incidental work rule as implemented by the Act and to the identical rule in the Carmen\u2019s agreement, as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The Electricians contend that the application of the incidental work rule should be restricted <em>completely </em>to the four signatory unions that initialed the original Memorandum because, they argue, it is part of Public Law 91-226 that was intended only to settle a labor dispute between the four unions and the carriers. We believe, however, that this is too narrow a view of the rule as implemented by the Act. We recognize that the Act covers the four signatory unions completely, but we also consider that the provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement as originally initialed by the unions, and as implemented by congressional action, were intended to apply in some instances to the entire working relations of these four unions with the carriers and thus necessarily encompassed some of the working relations of the four signatory unions with the other shop crafts, and possibly others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Under the operative provision of the \u201cincidental work rule,\u201d as implemented by Congress, the four signatory crafts are deemed to have agreed that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak3W\">mechanic of a craft . . . may be required, so far as they are capable, to perform . . . incidental work . covered by the classification of work rules of another craft or crafts at running repair stations . . . . (Not in sequence.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">By these provisions the negotiators for the four shop craft unions agreed upon broad language that encompasses work situations involving \u201cmechanics\u201d and \u201ccrafts\u201d generally and not just those \u201cmechanics\u201d and \u201ccrafts\u201d who belonged to the four unions that initialed the original Memorandum. When this language was formulated by the parties in the original Memorandum neither side had any idea that an attempt would be made to restrict its application because it subsequently became involved in the set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>tlement of a strike by the four participating unions. When the rule was first drafted (and its terminology has not been changed since) the parties contemplated a normal application of the rule to the normal operations of the railroad. Had the parties desired to limit the operation of the Memorandum to the bargaining \u201ccrafts,\u201d they could have easily done so by specific language. Failing to do so, the clear implication is that they did not intend their general provisions to be so restricted. There is thus nothing in the language of the agreement to restrict the meaning of \u201cmechanic\u201d or \u201ccraft\u201d to members of the four shop craft unions that initialed the original Memorandum or to restrict the incidental work that can be compelled at running repair stations only to work of the four signatory crafts. The language used makes the rule a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d applicable to any person or incidental work that satisfies the \u201cmechanic\u201d and \u201ccraft\u201d requirements. It would thus encompass incidental work of both the Electricians and the Carmen, which is the sole issue presented to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-4\">In its argument the Electricians overly emphasize the fact that the Act was passed to stop a strike involving the four unions only and they generally ignore the plain meaning of the words used in the Memorandum. In our view, Public Law 91-226 only operates <em>compulsively </em>on the four signatory craft unions. By this we mean that only the four signatory unions could be <em>compelled </em>because of Public Law 91-226 to perform incidental work of other crafts and to allow other crafts to perform incidental work in their craft. However, the clear intent of the language used in the incidental work rule, to the extent that it was implemented by Public Law 91-226, requires personnel of the four signatory unions at running repair stations to perform incidental work in <em>all </em>the shop \u201ccrafts\u201d and also requires them to allow <em>all </em>the shop \u201ccrafts\u201d to perform incidental work in their \u201ccraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Conversely stated, the Understanding which the Act implements does not operate to <em>compel </em>personnel of the two non-signatory shop craft unions to perform incidental work in the other crafts or to compel the non-signatory unions to accede to other crafts performing incidental work in their craft. This interpretation is fortified by the fact that the carriers and the Carmen did voluntarily agree on an identical rule shortly after the passage of the Act. If the Act had covered all shop cr,afts <em>compulsorily </em>there would have been no necessity for the railroads to sign a separate agreement with the Carmen. Thus, prior to the time that the Carmen agreed to the incidental work rule, they were free to object to the other four shop crafts doing work in their craft under the incidental work rule as implemented by the Act and the Carmen could not be compelled to perform incidental work in the other crafts. But, when the Carmen signed the agreement containing an identical \u201cincidental work rule\u201d they placed themselves in the same position as the four signatory unions, without in any way changing the situation of the earlier signatory unions except that thereafter when the personnel of the original four signatory unions performed incidental work in the Carmen\u2019s craft, they would be doing incidental work that the Carmen had agreed they could do. In our view this is the plain meaning of the \u201cincidental work rule\u201d in Public Law 91-226 and the Carmen\u2019s agreement as applied to the Electricians and the Carmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">So were we to construe the legislation and the Carmen\u2019s agreement we would reach the same result as the trial court. However, when Congress provided that the \u201cMemorandum . . . shall have the same effect ... as though arrived at by <em>agreement </em>of the parties under the Railway Labor Act\u201d (P.L. 91-226), it obviously intended that jurisdiction to interpret the provisions of that Memorandum of Agreement would be in the Adjustment Board as with other \u201cdisputes . . . growing out of . . . the interpretation or application of agreements. . . . \u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153, first (i). Thus, in our opinion this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>phase of the dispute is a matter for the Adjustment Board and they are free to adopt a different approach. The parties may seek to support their particular interpretation by evidence as to usage, practice and custom, and the Adjustment Board is peculiarly fitted and specifically designated to deal with such matters.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">This brings us to the body of doctrine developed under the Act in order to determine whether the ^Company\u2019s use of Carmen to perform incidental electrical work constitutes a \u201cunilateral change in major conditions of employment,\u201d as contended by the Electricians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">The first reason given by the District Court for concluding that the Electricians were unlikely to succeed on the merits was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-7\">1. That the defendant\u2019s implementation of the \u201cincidental work rule\u201d contained in the Memorandum of Understanding of December 4, 1969, as implemented by Public Law 91-226, and the plaintiff\u2019s challenge thereto does not involve a change in an agreement, but instead involves a question of the interpretation and application of an existing agreement covering rates of pay, rules and working conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">This is tantamount to saying that this is a minor as contrasted with a major dispute and therefore one which is properly cognizable by the Adjustment Board. App. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">The Railway Labor Act, as amended in 1934, created two independent procedures for resolution of disputes between carriers and the labor organizations representing their employees. Under the procedure initiated by a section 6 notice, summarized in note 6, <em>supra, </em>negotiations proceed through the Mediation Board and if necessary an Emergency Board, and may ultimately result in economic self-help. The alternative procedure, under section 3, leads to a final and binding determination of the dispute by the Adjustment Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">This difference in treatment under the two procedures is dramatic, so that much litigation has evolved out of the attempt to distinguish between the types of disputes which are to be handled under each procedure. The leading case on this point is Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886 (1945), where the Court distinguished the two procedures as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-13\">The first relates to disputes over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them. They arise where there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one, and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy. They look to the acquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-14\">The second class, however, contemplates the existence of a collective agreement already concluded or, at any rate, a situation in which no effort is made to bring about a formal change in terms or to create a new one. The dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation or to an omitted ease . . . In either case the claim is to rights accrued, not merely to have new ones created for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-16\">In general, the difference is between what are regarded traditionally as the <em>major </em>and the <em>minor </em>disputes of the railway labor world. . . . 325 U.S. at 723, 65 S.Ct. at 1290. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-18\">The difference between major and minor disputes<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> is important not only for the differing statutory procedures for ultimate resolution, but also for the differing approaches to interim relief pending that ultimate resolution. The major disputes procedure is marked at every stage by provisions for mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>nance of the status quo pending ult\u00edmate agreement. Because of these provisions for preserving the status quo the federal courts may enjoin carriers from implementing changes until the statutory procedures have been exhausted.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-4\">The Act\u2019s status quo requirement is central to its design. Its immediate effect is to prevent the union from striking and management from doing anything that would justify a strike. In the long run, delaying the time when the parties can resort to self-help provides time for tempers to cool, helps create an atmosphere in which rational bargaining can occur, and permits the forces of public opinion to be mobilized in favor of a settlement without a strike or lockout. Moreover, since disputes usually arise when one party wants to change the status quo without undue delay, the power which the Act gives the other party to preserve the status quo for a prolonged period will frequently make it worthwhile for the moving party to compromise with the interests of the other side and thus reach agreement without interruption to commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Detroit &amp; T. S. L. R. R. v. United Transp. Union, 396 U.S. 142, 150, 90 S.Ct. 294, 299, 24 L.Ed.2d 325 (1969). What makes these provisions so effective is the intentionally near-interminable procedures for resolving major disputes: \u201c[T]he procedures of the Act are purposely long and drawn out, based on the hope that reason and practical considerations will provide in time an agreement that resolves the dispute.\u201d Brotherhood of Ry. <em>&amp; </em>S. S. Clerks v. Florida East Coast Ry., 384 U.S. 238, 246, 86 S.Ct. 1420, 1424, 16 L.Ed.2d 501 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">The so-called minor disputes, on the other hand, involving grievances, affect the smaller differences which inevitably appear in the carrying out of major agreements and policies or arise incidentally in the course of an employment. They represent specific maladjustments of a detailed or individual quality. They seldom produce strikes, though in exaggerated instances they may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">Elgin, J. &amp; E. Ry. v. Burley, <em>supra,, </em>325 U.S. at 724, 65 S.Ct. at 1290. Accordingly, the procedures for settling minor disputes are much shorter and simpler, and there are no equivalent status quo provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-11\">The Congress having vested jurisdiction to resolve railway labor disputes in specialized administrative bodies, <em>e. g., </em>the Mediation and the Adjustment Boards, courts have been reluctant to intervene. Where judicial intervention has been necessary to protect fundamental interests under the Act, it has been authorized,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> but the more common practice in minor disputes has been to deny judicial intervention through enforcement of equitable remedies in deference to the operation and decisions of the Adjustment Board.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-12\">The availability of equitable relief to judicially forestall actions taken by either the carriers or the labor organizations thus will often depend on the characterization of the dispute between the parties as a major or minor one. Such is the case here, for if the District Court were to conclude on the merits that the Company\u2019s action constitutes a unilateral change in major conditions of employment \u2014 making the dispute a major one \u2014the Electricians would be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>injunctive relief under the status quo provisions of the Act. If, however, the dispute is characterized as minor, then the injunction may properly be denied unless irreparable injury is shown separately.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This distinction between major and minor disputes and the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the present dispute is a minor one, is the legal premise which we are reviewing here under the principles enunciated in <em>Delaware &amp; H. Ry.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The purpose and effect of Public Law 91-226 was to convert the December 4, 1969 Memorandum of Understanding between the negotiators into the equivalent of a contract agreement governed by the same principles as any other agreement reached under the procedures of the Railway Labor Act. Thus, while it may be said that the whole situation is the result of a statute and we are interpreting a statute, still Congress has directed that it be handled as an \u201cagreement\u201d and in our opinion this \u201cstatute\u201d has the effect of conferring jurisdiction on the Adjustment Board when the interpretation of that \u201cagreement\u201d involves a minor dispute. So whether a statute or an agreement is involved the Adjustment Board has jurisdiction of a minor dispute therein. Accordingly, we must determine under the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Elgin </em>standards whether the dispute over use of Carmen to perform incidental electrical work</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-5\">arise [s] where there is no . agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one . [or whether] [t]he dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation . 325 U.S. at 723, 65 S.Ct. at 1290.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">Predictably, the Electricians here contend that by extending the incidental work rule imposed by Public Law 91-226 to the Carmen, who originally were not parties to that dispute, the Company was unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment prescribed in that \u201ccontract.\u201d Equally predictably, the Company contends that all that is at issue is the meaning or application of the phrases \u201cmechanic or mechanics of a craft or crafts\u201d and \u201ccovered by the classification of work rules of another craft or crafts\u201d as those phrases are used in the \u201ccontract.\u201d In similar circumstances the Ninth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-12\">It is true, as the union points out, that a controversy, although couched in terms of a disagreement as to interpretation of a contract, may under some circumstances be regarded as a major dispute. This result may be reached if it can be said that the change being imposed by one side on the other <em>is in nowise contemplated or arguably covered by the agreement. </em>The provisions of the Railway Labor Act may not be avoided merely through the device of unilateral action which the actor purposefully intends shall not become a part of the agreement. The major-minor dispute dichotomy does not relate to artfully contrived formalistic demands or responses, but to matters of substance. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-13\">But where the position of one or both of the parties <em>is expressly and arguably predicated on the terms </em>of the agreement, as illuminated by longstanding practices, the question of whether the position is well taken involves a minor dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\">Switchmen\u2019s Union v. Southern Pac. Co., 398 F.2d 443, 447 (9th Cir. 1968) (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-15\">The proper judicial test of a minor dispute is thus a narrow one, for as Chief Judge Matthes of the Eighth Circuit has recently pointed out,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>Act vested exclusive jurisdiction over resolution of such disputes in the Adjustment Board, and where the dispute is even arguably a minor one that administrative body should have the first opportunity to evaluate and decide it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3A\">[T]he test to be applied is that if the contract is reasonably susceptible to the interpretations sought by both the carrier and union, the dispute is minor and within exclusive adjustment jurisdiction. . . . <em>Only if </em>. . . <em>the contract were not reasonably susceptible to the carrier\u2019s contention would this be a % 6 dispute proper for a \u201cstatus quo\u201d injunction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">United Transp. Union v. Burlington Northern, <em>supra </em>note 3, 458 F.2d at 357 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">Applying these tests to the present dispute we find ample support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that this is a minor dispute suitable for resolution by the Adjustment Board. To begin, the contention of the Company is \u201cexpressly and arguably predicated on the terms of the agreement,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the Memorandum of Understanding. The Memorandum refers to \u201cmechanics\u201d and \u201ccrafts\u201d without any words of limitation. that would narrow these terms to the four parties to the negotiations who tentatively initialed the Memorandum. Furthermore, the \u201clong-standing practice\u201d was for all six of the shop craft unions to bargain together or at the very least to bargain for substantially identical contracts.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It is certainly arguable, then, that the rule authorizes performance of incidental work in any of the six shop \u201ccraft\u201d unions here involved by any of the \u201cmechanics\u201d whose unions are bound by the incidental work rule either by contract or by Public Law 91-226. This encompasses both the Electricians and the Carmen and the work of their crafts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">We also believe that the possibility that mechanics in other crafts might be brought within the scope of the incidental work rule through subsequent agreements containing similar rules was clearly within the contemplation of the parties. When proposals were being considered in Congress for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding for the three ratifying unions and leaving the Sheet Metal Workers to some form of arbitration or continuing negotiation, the question was raised about implementation of the incidental work rule. Mr. Winpisinger, vice president of the Machinist\u2019s Union, expressed his view as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-12\">Mr. WINPISINGER. I don\u2019t think the fact- should be ignored that there is a substantial interplay under this rule as between the three of the organizations who propose to sign the agreement. Incidental work does not affect only the Sheet Metal Workers. It affects all of our organizations. There would be an interplay as between the three of us if it were in effect at this point. Obviously, it is contemplated I think from the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 proposal that they would not be bound by the rule, and therefore interplay [between the other three crafts and the Sheet Metal Workers] would be held at least in limbo until the arbitration came down and we found out whether or not they were party to the rule and whether they were bound by that rule.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">From this it is at least arguable, then, that once the four unions were bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>the rule, interplay between them and a fifth might be accomplished by having that fifth union agree to the same identical rule. This conclusion is fortified by the language of the incidental work rule being in nowise restrictive as to \u201cmechanics\u201d or \u201ccraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">There is additional testimony in the congressional hearings that demonstrates this was precisely what the carriers had intended to do and that the unions had advance notice of such intention. Mr. John W. O\u2019Brien, General Vice President of the Sheet Metal Workers, and their principal spokesman in this dispute, testified before the congressional committee that it had been his understanding that the negotiations related solely to the locomotive departments of the railroads.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> He contended that in the February 1970 bargaining sessions Mr. Hiltz (representing the carriers) revealed for the first time the railroads\u2019 intent to expand the rule <footnotemark>41</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-5\">During the week of February 8, about February 12, in response to a union offer, Mr. Hiltz told Assistant Secretary [of Labor] Usery that the rail bargainers and management would extend the incidental work rule proposed to cover all running repairs in all departments, including passenger, freight departments, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-6\">* -x- * * -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-7\">He said \u2014 Mr. Hiltz, I am talking about \u2014 \u201cThis is to apply to all running repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-8\">The question was asked, \u201cWhat about Mr. George O\u2019Brien\u2019s union, the carmen, they are not party to this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-9\">He said, \u201cI intend to discuss this with Mr. O\u2019Brien and have it apply to him, too\u201d \u2014 I guess write the same rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">Mr. Hiltz in subsequent testimony denied the element of surprise and explained the basis of the carriers\u2019 contention :<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgcD\">This rule was written by the unions in the handwriting of one of the union negotiators. Mr. O\u2019Brien was there when this rule was presented to us\u2014 and [as] subsequently accepted by management reads, and I will quote: \u201cAt running repair work locations which are not designated as outlying points where,\u201d et cetera, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-13\">\u25a0 It does not say at running repair work locations where locomotives are repaired or where doodlebugs are repaired or anything else. It says at running repair work locations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-14\">This language does not even suggest that this work is restricted to locomotive repairs inasmuch as running repairs are performed on all types of equipment on which these unions do work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-15\">We, of course, need not resolve this question \u2014 that is the task solely of the Adjustment Board once we determine, as we have, that this exchange and our interpretation of Public Law 91-226 and the Agreement with the Carmen wholly prevents us from finding that the contention of the carriers here was \u201cin nowise contemplated or arguably covered by the agreement.\u201d On the contrary, the agreement was \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d of the carriers\u2019 approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-16\">One further factor enters into our analysis of whether the Company\u2019s position on this appeal was reasonably within the contemplation of the parties to this agreement. If there were a significant difference in either the skill- or pay-level of the carmen from the other four unions, a very plausible argument could be made that the original four would never accede to an agreement bringing the carmen within the scope of the rule. If the carmen were low-skill or low-pay employees, the carriers would have a strong incentive to replace the more expensive mechanics with carmen. In such a situation the low-pay union would be eager to sign the additional agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>because they could envision more work for their membership; the other four, however, would be vehemently opposed to participation of the low-pay union within the scope of the rule because their jobs would be directly threatened. If all five unions received approximately the same wages, then the only incentive for the carriers to use one union\u2019s men to perform incidental work in another union\u2019s craft is to improve the overall efficiency of the shop. In this situation, there would be no strong economic incentive either for the Carmen to join the agreement or for the other four to oppose their participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\">One could argue that the Electricians\u2019 opposition to the Carmen in this ease results from such economic factors and demonstrates that the interplay between the Carmen and the others was not within the contemplation of the other four when proposing the incidental work rule. We find evidence in the record here, however, to refute such a position. When the February 1970 negotiations were stalled by the adamant opposition of the Sheet Metal Workers, the other three unions, <em>including the appellant, </em>the Electricians offered to break the deadlock by replacing the Sheet Metal Workers with the Carmen in the Agreement. This demonstrated willingness to participate in an incidental work rule with the Carmen wholly undercuts the Electricians\u2019 present arguments \u2014 at least to the extent necessary for us to find that this is a minor dispute that should go to the Adjustment Board for ultimate resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">We do not in any way intend to suggest an opinion as to whether or not the Company should be permitted to employ Carmen to perform incidental work in the other four unions\u2019 crafts. Our task, as was the District Court\u2019s is the much narrower one of determining whether the work rules implemented by Public Law 91-226 are reasonably susceptible to such an interpretation when coupled with identical rules agreed to by the Carmen. We agree with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s expression of the proper legal premise to apply here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-8\">Only if . the contract were not reasonably susceptible to the carrier\u2019s contention would this be a \u00a7 6 dispute proper for a \u201cstatus quo\u201d injunction.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">We believe the action of the District Court in denying the preliminary injunction requested by the Electricians conforms to that premise, and we therefore affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AG1u\">CHRONOLOGY</p>\n<p id=\"A3S\">Nov. 8, 1968 IBEW, IAM, IBBB, &amp; SMWI served \u00a7 6 notices on virtually all railroads requesting wage changes and suggesting national handling if local settlements could not be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"A8q\">Nov. 9, 1968 Railroads, including Washington Terminal, served \u00a7 6 notices on IBEW, IAM, IBBB, &amp; SMWI proposing .changes in work rules.</p>\n<p id=\"AMxA\">Mar. 17, 1969 Failing local agreements, national bargaining commenced between Employees Conference Committee and National Railway Labor Conference.</p>\n<p id=\"AGz5\">Apr. 10, 1969 Failing national agreement, parties jointly applied for services of National Mediation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"als-dedup-2\">Aug. 19, 1969 Mediation Board requested parties to submit dispute to voluntary arbitration; unions refused.</p>\n<p id=\"ame-dedup-0\">Sept. 3, 1969 Mediation Board relinquished jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"apk-dedup-1\">Sept. 3-Oet. 3, 1969 Unions announce intention to strike 7 carriers; carriers announce intention to lock-out nationally if anyone struck.

The two shop craft unions who did not participate in these negotiations were the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen (BRC, or Carmen), and the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers (Firemen).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1218-20\">.

I am taking similar action to protect the public interest today.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay7X\">The legislation I propose is closely related to the facts of this dispute. After all the procedures of the Railway Labor Act had been exhausted, and after extensive mediation under the auspices of the Secretary of Labor, the parties finally reached an agreement incorporated in a Memorandum of Understanding dated December 4, 1969. That Memorandum was ratified by an overall majority of all the members voting as well as by the majority of those voting in three of the four unions.</p>\n<p id=\"AXXR\">However, the majority of the voting members of one union, the Sheetmetal Workers\u2019 International Association, failed to ratify the Memorandum. I am forwarding to you today <em>legislation that merely makes that Memorandum the contract between the parties. </em>We must not submit to the chaos of a nationwide rail stoppage because a minority of the affected workers rejected a contract agreed to by their leadership. The public interest comes first.</p>\n<p id=\"ast-dedup-0\">Four days ago, I sent to the Congress a measure to protect the public interest in cases where a strike or lockout in the transportation industry imperils the national health and safety. In that message I stressed two principles: first, that the health and safety of the Nation must be protected against damaging work stoppages ; second, that collective bargaining should be as free as possible from Government interference.</p>\n<p id=\"agy-dedup-1\">The legislation I am submitting with this message to resolve this dispute, abides by those two principles. We will protect the national interest, and we will limit Government interference to enforcing the contract to which responsible agents of the parties agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"AACJ\">I urge the Congress to act quickly on my proposal, so that a crippling stoppage * * can be averted and the Nation\u2019s travelers and shippers can depend on uninterrupted service.</p>\n<p id=\"A1yo\">RICHARD NIXON.</p>\n<p id=\"avl-dedup-0\">THE WHITE HOUSE, <em>March 3, 1970.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIqZ\">U.

That the defendant\u2019s implementation of the \u201cincidental work rule\u201d contained in the Memorandum of Understanding of December 4, 1969, as implemented by Public Law 91-226, and the plaintiff\u2019s challenge thereto does not involve a change in an agreement, but instead involves a question of the interpretation and application of an existing agreement covering rates of pay, rules and working conditions;</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">2. That the plaintiff has an adequate administrative remedy for the resolution of the issue raised herein pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, et seq., and more particularly pursuant to 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First (i). In this respect, the Court finds that the National Railroad Adjustment Board would be particularly qualified to handle a dispute of the type involved herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">3. That assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the question of coverage of the Memorandum of Understanding, implemented by Public Law 91-226, was a proper one for construction by the Court, it would appear that the Court would find that the intent of the Congress assumed a broad coverage of the same, as opposed to a limited application to only those several shop craft unions involved in the negotiations culminating in said Memorandum of Understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-21\">4. That in related litigation, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California (in Southern Pacific Transportation Company v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, et al. Civil No. S-1699) has found the dispute to involve the interpretation and application of an existing agreement, and ordered the dispute submitted to the National Railway Adjustment Board, which has been done by the carrier in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-22\">5. That by virtue of the foregoing, plaintiff has failed to show a probable likelihood of ultimate success in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-23\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-24\">1. That the issue presented herein constitutes a \u201cminor dispute\u201d within the meaning of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., which provides an appropriate and exclusive forum for the resolution thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-25\">2. That plaintiff has failed to make the requisite showing that would entitle it to the extraordinary relief which it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-26\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-27\">Upon consideration of the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is, by the Court, this 19 day of October, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-28\">ORDERED, that the Motion of the plaintiff for a Preliminary Injunction be, and the same is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-29\">App. 75-76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1226-30\">. <em>See </em>n. 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">.
