Defendant contends as a matter of fact that plaintiffs were not discharged for any such reason and as a matter of law that such a reason is sufficient until political tradition \u2014 -at least the patronage aspects of the \u201cspoils\u201d system \u2014 is superseded by appropriate legislation. We conclude that neither defendant\u2019s factual nor his legal defense has been established in this case. We start with the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">The individual plaintiffs were employed by the late Paul Powell in the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s office; all of them held non-civil service positions as building employees, clerical workers, license examiners and the like. After the defendant John W. Lewis was appointed by Governor Ogilvie to fill the unexpired term of Paul Powell, the plaintiffs received letters terminating their employment; the letters stated no reasons for the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-19\">The plaintiffs later filed this action claiming that they were discharged because of their political affiliations, i. e., because they refused to become Republicans or to support the Republican Party and that a hearing would so show; plaintiffs claim that such discharge violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>predicated federal jurisdiction upon the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and sought relief reinstating plaintiffs to their jobs, awarding them back pay and enjoining future discharges of other employees such as the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The motion was supported by defendant\u2019s affidavit describing in detail conditions of widespread inefficiency and confusion which he found to exist in the Secretary of State\u2019s Office when he was appointed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s affidavit stated that \u201cthe efficiency of the office was at such a low ebb that in order to protect the public and to prevent a total breakdown of the Secretary of State\u2019s Office, it was vitally and immediately necessary to make large scale changes in the manner in which the office was being run and in the ranks of personnel that were then employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">In opposing defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs sought to develop evidence which would dispute defendant\u2019s factual theory. They propounded written interrogatories to the defendant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and filed 94 affidavits of discharged employees. Each affiant described his duties and set forth facts tending to indicate that his job performance was satisfactory and that his discharge had been politically motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Five of the affiants said that they had been contacted and requested to change their affiliations to the Republican Par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ty. Thus, as an example, the handwritten affidavit of the plaintiff William Perry states that he was employed as a janitor in the Illinois State Building from October 1, 1965, to March 5, 1971,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was told by his supervisor, Mr. Reed, that he would be able to keep his job if he joined the Republican Party. Affiant Betty Jean Sikes swore that she \u201cwas approached by Mr. W. Estes of the Republican Party \u2014 who filled out a paper \u2014and said I would be retained in my present position but I would have to vote Republican.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Robert D. Wise, a driver\u2019s license examiner who conducted road tests in Joliet, Illinois, swore that he \u201cwas approached by Mr. Hall, of the Republican Party, and he told me I would have a better chance of staying if I would change over to the Republican Party or Republican sponsorship. This was told to all members of the station at 4:30 P.M., at a meeting conducted by Mr. Hall, who also said that we would be replaced as soon as they acquired new employees (Republicans).\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">The district court entered summary judgment for defendants and also entered \u201cfindings of fact\u201d and conclusions of law. In substance, the court found that defendant\u2019s version of the facts was correct. Implicitly the court held that plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits were insufficient as a matter of law and that the answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories (which had not yet been filed) could not lead to the discovery of relevant evidence creating a material issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">It is, of course, well settled that a district court may not resolve issues of fact on a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor should such a judgment be entered until the party opposing the motion has had a fair opportunity to conduct such discovery as may be necessary to meet the factual basis for the motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is especially important to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>observe these procedural requirements when evidence of motivation is of critical importance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the extent, therefore, that the district court\u2019s decision is predicated on a rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 version of the facts, it plainly cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">We, of course, do not decide that plaintiffs\u2019 version of the facts is the correct one. But since there has been no trial, in order to test the legal sufficiency of their claims, we must assume that they can prove their case. Thus, our analysis of the law assumes that plaintiffs were performing their jobs competently, that they have no responsibility for determining policy, that they were discharged simply because they are Democrats, and that, in at least some instances, they were offered continued employment if they would actively support the Republican Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The legal issue which is therefore presented is whether a non-policy making employee, such as a janitor or a driver\u2019s license examiner, may be discharged for refusing to transfer his political allegiance from one political party to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">There are three objections to our consideration of this issue which should first be frankly identified. It is urged (1) that the issue is \u201cpolitical\u201d and therefore unfit for judicial determination; (2) that federal judges may not impose a civil service system on the State of Illinois; and (3) that a tradition of almost 200 years of uninterrupted acceptance of the \u201cpatronage system\u201d may not be overcome by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">1. This controversy between the plaintiffs and their former employer does not present the kind of \u201cpolitical question\u201d that is non justiciable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">By application of the \u201cpolitical question\u201d doctrine, the Supreme Court has decided that certain kinds of issues are unfit for federal judicial determination. In situations in which the Court recognized the paramount interest in attributing finality to determinations by the political departments of the federal government \u2014 as in matters dealing with war, foreign affairs, the preservation of Indian tribal organizations, or rival claims to recognition as the lawful government of a State \u2014 the Court has described the issue as a \u201cpolitical question\u201d and therefore non justiciable. In those cases the Court has also stressed the absence of judicially manageable standards for resolving the dispute or fashioning appropriate relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>It is well settled that our duty to accord appropriate respect to a state\u2019s sovereignty does not require us to accord finality to a decision to dismiss an employee for an impermissible reason, or to a policy of discrimination against members of a particular race, religion, or political faith in the award or withholding of public benefits. Nor is there any lack of judicially manageable standards in cases of this kind. The motivation for the dismissal of state employees was the critical issue in a wide range of cases which the Supreme Court has routinely treated as justiciable. The underlying rationale for the \u201cpolitical question\u201d doctrine plainly has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Of course the word \u201cpolitical\u201d may be applied to several facets of this dispute. The plaintiffs may have acquired their jobs for \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons; they seek to vindicate a \u201cpolitical\u201d right; the outcome of the litigation will have \u201cpolitical\u201d consequences; and, perhaps of greatest significance, defendant\u2019s alleged employment practices are supported by ancient and respected \u201cpolitical\u201d tradition. But, as Mr. Justice Holmes so aptly stated, an \u201cobjection that the subject-matter of the suit is political is little more than a play upon words. Of course the petition concerns political action but it alleges and seeks to recover for private damage. That private damage may be caused by such political action and may be recovered for in a suit at law hardly has been doubted for over two hundred years, . . . .\u2019\u2019Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 540, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L.Ed. 759. We are satisfied that the case before us is not within \u201cthat class of political controversy which, by the nature of its subject, is unfit for federal judicial action.\u201d Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. at 330, 82 S.Ct. at 771 (Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">2. Neither this court nor any other may impose a civil service system upon the State of Illinois. The General Assembly has provided an elaborate system regulating the appointment to specified positions solely on the basis of merit and fitness, the grounds for termination of such employment, and the procedures which must be followed in connection with hiring, firing, promotion, and retirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A federal court has no power to establish any such employment code.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">However, recognition of plaintiffs\u2019 claims will not give every public employee civil service tenure and will not require the state to follow any set procedure or to assume the burden of explaining or proving the grounds for every termination. It is the former employee who has the burden of proving that his discharge was motivated by an impermissible consideration. It is true, of course, that a prima facie case may impose a burden of explanation on the State. But the burden of proof will remain with the plaintiff employee and we must assume that the trier of fact will be able to differentiate between those discharges which are politically motivated and those which are not. There is a clear distinction between the grant of tenure to an employee \u2014 a right which cannot be conferred by judicial fiat \u2014 and the prohibition of a discharge for a particular impermissible reason. The Supreme Court has plainly identified that distinction on many occasions, most recently in Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Unlike a civil service system, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>tion does not provide job security, as such, to public employees. If, however, a discharge is motivated by considerations of race, religion, or punishment of constitutionally protected conduct, it is well settled that the State\u2019s action is subject to federal judicial review.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is no merit to the argument that recognition of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim would be tantamount to foisting a civil service code upon the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">3. Finally, our answer to the constitutional question is not foreclosed by the fact that the \u201cspoils system has been entrenched in American history for almost two hundred years.\u201d Alomar v. Dwyer, 447 F.2d 482, 483 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1020, 92 S.Ct. 683, 30 L.Ed.2d 667.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For most of that period it was assumed, without serious question or debate, that since a public employee has no constitutional right to his job, there can be no valid constitutional objection to his summary removal. See Bailey v. Richardson, 86 U.S.App. D.C. 248, 182 F.2d 46, 59 (1950), affirmed per curiam by an equally divided Court, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct. 669, 95 L.Ed. 1352; Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485, 72 S.Ct. 380, 96 L.Ed. 517. But as Mr. Justice Marshall so forcefully stated in 1965 when he was a circuit judge, \u201cthe theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.\u201d Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 345 F.2d 236, 239 (2d Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The development of constitutional law subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s unequivocal repudiation of the line of cases ending with Bailey v. Richardson and Adler v. Board of Education is more relevant than the preceding doctrine which is now \u201cuniversally rejected.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>We therefore abjure argument founded only on political tradition in the State of Illinois or on notions of policy which may or may not lead to the extension of the civil service system; such arguments are properly the concern of the General Assembly of the State of Illinois. Our concern is with the First Amendment rights of a citizen named Perry whose sovereign offered him a choice between professing allegiance to the Republican Party or surrendering his position as a janitor in the State House.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If he can prove that his employment was terminated because he made the wrong choice, has any right protected by the First Amendment been abridged? We think the Supreme Court has answered this question for us in rather plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">In 1949 a closely divided Supreme Court upheld a statute prohibiting federal civil service employees from taking an active part in partisan political .activities. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754. The dissenting Justices felt that such an abridgment of First Amendment rights could not be justified.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The majority, however, concluded that the government\u2019s interests in not compromising the quality of public service and in not permitting individual employees to use their public offices to advance partisan causes were sufficient to justify the limitation on their freedom.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">There was no dispute within the Court over the proposition that the employees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>interests in political action were protected by the First Amendment. The Justices\u2019 different conclusions stemmed from their different appraisals of the sufficiency of the justification for the restriction. That justification \u2014 the desirability of political neutrality in the public service and the avoidance of the use of the power and prestige of government to favor one party or the other\u2014 would condemn rather than support the alleged conduct of defendant in this case. Thus, in dicta, the Court unequivocally stated that the Legislature could not require allegiance to a particular political faith as a condition \"of public employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">\u201cAppellants urge that federal employees are protected by the Bill of Rights and that Congress may not \u2018enact a regulation providing that no Republican, Jew or Negro shall be appointed to federal office, or that no federal employee shall attend Mass or take any active part in missionary work.\u2019 None would deny such limitations on Congressional power but, because there are some limitations it does not follow that a prohibition against acting as ward leader or worker at the polls is invalid.\u201d 330 U.S. 75, 100, 67 S.Ct. 556, 570.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">In 1952 the Court quoted that dicta in support of its holding that the State of Oklahoma could not require its employees to profess their loyalty by denying past association with Communists. Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 191-192, 73 S.Ct. 215, 97 L.Ed. 216. That decision did not recognize any special right to public employment;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> rather, it rested on the impact of the requirement on the citizen\u2019s First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We think it unlikely that the Supreme Court would consider these plaintiffs\u2019 interest in freely associating with members of the Democratic Party less worthy of protection than the Oklahoma employees\u2019 interest in associating with Communists or former Communists.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">In 1961 the Court held that a civilian cook could be summarily excluded from a naval gun factory. Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, AFL-CIO v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230. The government\u2019s interest in maintaining the security of the military installation outweighed the cook\u2019s interest in working at a particular location. Again, however, the Court explicitly assumed that the sovereign could not deny employment for the reason that the citizen was a member of a particular political party or religious faith \u2014 \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>she could not have been kept out because she was a Democrat or a Methodist.\u201d 367 U.S. at 898, 81 S.Ct. at 1750.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In 1968 the Court held that \u201ca teacher\u2019s exercise of his right to speak on issues of public importance may not furnish the basis for his dismissal from public employment.\u201d Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 574, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1738, 20 L.Ed.2d 811. The Court noted that although criminal sanctions \u201chave a somewhat different impact on the exercise of the right to freedom of speech from dismissal from employment, it is apparent that the threat of dismissal from public employment is nonetheless a potent means of inhibiting speech.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The holding in <em>Pickering </em>was a natural sequel to Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s comment in dissent in Shelton v. Tucker that a scheme to terminate the employment of teachers solely because of their membership in unpopular organizations would run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment. 364 U.S. 479, 496, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In 1972 the Court reaffirmed the proposition that a nontenured public servant has no constitutional right to public employment, but nevertheless may not be dismissed for exercising his First Amendment rights. Perry v. Sinder-mann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed.2d 570 (1972). The Court\u2019s explanation of its holding is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cFor at least a quarter century, this Court has made clear that even though a person has no \u2018right\u2019 to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not act. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests \u2014 especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to \u2018produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\u2019 Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460. Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201cWe have applied this general principle to denials of tax exemptions, Speiser v. Randall, <em>supra, </em>unemployment benefits, Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404-405, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-1795, 10 L.Ed.2d 965, and welfare payments, Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 627 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1327, 22 L.Ed.2d 600; Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 374, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1853, 29 L.Ed.2d 534. But, most often, we have applied the principle to denials of public employment. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 100, 67 S.Ct. 556, 569, 91 L.Ed. 754; Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 192, 73 S.Ct. 215, 219, 97 L.Ed. 216; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 485-486, 81 S.Ct. 247, 250-251, 5 L.Ed.2d 231; Torasco v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 495-496, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 1683-1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 982; Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers, etc. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 894, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U.S. 278, 288, 82 S.Ct. 275, 281, 7 L.Ed.2d 285; Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377; Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 17, 86 S. Ct. 1238, 16 L.Ed.2d 321; Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 605-606, 87 S.Ct. 675, 684-685, 17 L. Ed.2d 629; Whitehill v. Elkins, 389 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 184, 19 L.Ed.2d 228; United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508; Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed. 2d 811. We have applied the principle regardless of the public employee\u2019s contractual or other claim to a job. Compare Pickering v. Board of Education, <em>supra, </em>with Shelton v. Tucker, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201cThus the respondent\u2019s lack of a contractual or tenure \u2018right\u2019 to reemployment for the 1969-1970 academic year is immaterial to his free speech claim. \u2022 . . . \u201d 408 U.S. at 597, 92 S.Ct. at 2698, 33 L.Ed.2d 570.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">This circuit has given full effect to this principle. In Kiiskila v. Nichols, in his opinion for the court sitting <em>en banc, </em>Chief Judge Swygert explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cA citizen\u2019s right to engage in protected expression or debate is substantially unaffected by the fact that he is also an employee of the government and, as a general rule, he cannot be deprived of his employment merely because he exercises those rights. This is so because dismissal from government employment, like criminal sanctions or damages, may inhibit the propensity of a citizen to exercise his right to freedom of speech and association. Pickering v. Board of Education, <em>supra </em>391 U.S. at 574, 88 S. Ct. 1731. To protect society\u2019s interest in uninhibited and robust debate the first amendment demands that government be prohibited from inhibiting or suppressing speech by indirection through discharge of a government employee when the same objective could not constitutionally be achieved by criminal sanctions or other direct means. United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508.\u201d 433 F.2d 745, 749 (7th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">And more recently Judge Hastings succinctly stated \u201cthat public employment may not be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights.\u201d Donahue v. Staunton, 471 F.2d 475, p. 480 (7th Cir. 1972). See also Hanover Township Federation of Teachers Local 1954 (AFL-CIO) v. Hanover Community School Corp., 457 F.2d 456, 459-460 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Accepting the premise, as United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754, holds, that state interests may justify some curtailment of the political activities of public employees, it seems perfectly clear that the abject and complete surrender of a citizen\u2019s First Amendment rights could never be justified. No state interest could justify a requirement that an employee falsely swear allegiance to an offensive religious or political faith, or a requirement that he actively work for, or speak out in favor of, a political cause he deemed obnoxious. The basic rights of citizenship survive acceptance of public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">If the conditions attached to public employment merely involve some curtailment \u2014 as opposed to abject surrender \u2014 of First Amendment rights, interests of the State \u201cif strong enough\u201d may justify the condition.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As a procedural matter, the burden of establishing such justification rests upon the defendant. In view of the importance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>which the Court has consistently attached to the First Amendment rights of the citizenry, that burden is a heavy one. Without such justification, the foregoing cases demonstrate that plaintiffs have alleged an impermissible basis for their discharge. We must therefore consider the matter of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Three separate justifications have been brought to our attention: (1) plaintiffs themselves are the beneficiaries of the patronage system and should not be heard to complain of its routine and foreseeable consequences \u2014 as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania stated, those who \u201clive by the political sword must be prepared to die by the political sword.\u201d American Federation of.State, County and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO v. Shapp, 443 Pa. 527, 280 A.2d 375, 378 (1971); (2) political affiliation may be a relevant and proper qualification for certain positions; and (3) in all events, effective administration of departments of government requires public, like private, executives to have broad latitude in appointing, replacing, and discharging personnel \u2014 any rule that provides the nontenured employee with an easily alleged cause of action for wrongful discharge necessarily inhibits that managerial discretion. Each of these three points is substantial and warrants separate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">But the factual assumption may or may not be valid. Even if judicial notice of such matters were proper, it would be unreasonable for us to assume that every nontenured public servant was employed on such a purely political basis. In Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the Supreme Court refused to accord any greater constitutional protection to the non-tenured teacher\u2019s prospects of future employment than to such prospects of other public employees. We cannot properly differentiate between teachers and highway maintenance workers, pilots, law clerks, driver\u2019s license examiners or janitors on the hasis of mere judicial assumptions about the circumstances attending their respective employment. The particular factual basis for a waiver defense may vary as between different plaintiffs and different job classifications, and may, at best, limit the scope of relief rather than foreclosing the claim altogether.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">1. The first argument is predicated on factual assumptions not now a matter of record in this case. In essence, it is suggested that each discharged employee accepted his job with knowledge that he would be fired if, and when, the appointing officer was replaced by a member of the opposite political party. If so, perhaps each plaintiff has waived any right to object to the fully anticipated event which has n\u00f3w come to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The colorful phrasing of the waiver defense by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suggests that the right which may have been waived is a right to continued public employment. But we have assumed that no such right exists. The right which plaintiffs seek to vindicate is their constitutional right of association protected by the First Amendment. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly indicated that a waiver of constitutional rights will not lightly be assumed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, until a factual basis for a waiver defense is supported by evidence, we may not determine either its sufficiency or its effect. We are satisfied, however, that the possibility that such a defense may be asserted cannot provide the basis for an affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">2. The second suggested justification will also have different validity for different employees. Plaintiffs properly do not challenge the public executive\u2019s right to use political philosophy or affiliation as one criterion in the selection of policy-making officials. Moreover, considerations of personal loyalty, or other factors besides determination of policy, may justify the employment of political associates in certain positions. It is difficult to believe, however, that any such justification would be valid for positions such as janitors, elevator operators or school teachers. Thus, again, justification is a matter of proof, or at least argument, directed at particular kinds of jobs. The possibility of such valid justification for some positions does not afford a basis for dismissing all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims without a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">3. The third possible justification would appear to have the greatest force. It is given concrete factual support by defendant\u2019s detailed affidavit and legal support by opinions recognizing that a public employer, like his private counterpart, has a significant interest in effective supervision of his employees. The factual question, however, must await the outcome of the trial since, as we have already noted, plaintiffs have not completed their discovery and have filed affidavits which, if true, tend to undermine the broad position asserted by defendant, or at least to impeach his justification in particular instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">The legal proposition that the State has a strong interest in allowing its executives to exercise broad discretion in the performance of their managerial functions is, of course, well established.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The State\u2019s interest in avoiding the interference with managerial discretion which may result from litigation brought by dismissed employees would appear especially strong because the number of employees potentially affected by the rule at issue in this ease is so large. It is therefore not frivolous to suggest that the State\u2019s interest in the efficient administration of its affairs justifies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>rule of law which would defeat all claims such as plaintiffs\u2019. However, there are several considerations which, we believe, foreclose such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"AE-i\">If a government department is, in fact, managed on a nonpolitical basis, there is little likelihood that litigation alleging that dismissals-were politically motivated would seriously hamper the administration of that department. There is always some risk of such litigation, but that risk is inherent in the performance of the work of government. It is now axiomatic \u201cthat the state and federal governments, even in the exercise of their internal operations, do not constitutionally have the complete freedom of action enjoyed by a private employer.\u201d Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, AFL-CIO v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 897-898, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 12, 30. The price which a government must pay to protect the constitutional liberties of its employees is some loss of the efficiency enjoyed by private employers; the Supreme Court has repeatedly decided that the value of those individual liberties is well worth the cost.</p>\n<p id=\"AdR\">That cost will loom large only if it is assumed that political considerations will motivate a large number of employment decisions. Unquestionably, to the extent that department heads in fact employ or dismiss\u2019 -highway maintenance workers, elevator operators, janitors, and comparable employees on the basis of their political affiliation, they may find it necessary to defend litigation and burdensome to explain their decisions. But to the extent employment decisions are based on political considerations, they involve a factor not normally present in the private sector; the tendency of that factor quite clearly is in the direction of less, rather than more, efficiency.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, reflection persuades us that in the long run the State\u2019s strong interest in efficient management is at least consistent with, and may well favor, the recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>nition and protection of the constitutional rights asserted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Of greater significance is the fact that as the number of employees affected is increased, the importance of preserving their First Amendment freedoms likewise grows. Indeed, when numbers are considered, it is appropriate not merely to consider the rights of a particular janitor who may have been offered a bribe from the public treasury to obtain his political surrender, but also the impact on the body politic as a whole when the free political choice of millions of public servants is inhibited or manipulated by the selective award of public benefits. While the patronage system is defended in the name of democratic tradition, its paternalistic impact on the political process is actually at war with the deeper traditions of democracy embodied in the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The preceding section of this opinion raises questions about the plaintiffs\u2019 apparent assumption that all of their claims have equal merit. Their complaint was filed \u201con behalf of the entire class of union members employed by the Defendant, as Secretary of State.\u201d No doubt the class action would have been proper if plaintiffs' procedural due process claim were still in the ease. Whether the district court should now determine that a class action is appropriate, or if so, how the class or classes should be defined, either for discovery or trial purposes, are matters b\u00e9st appraised by the district court in the first instance. Other than identifying the problem, we express no opinion on such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Nor do we make any decision about the nature or scope of relief which may be appropriate if one or more of the plaintiffs should prevail. We merely hold that the district court committed error when he entered summary judgment for the defendant. The record does not support a factual finding that no plaintiff was dismissed for an impermissible reason or the legal conclusion that defendant was justified in prescribing active support of the Republican Party as a condition of continued public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Plaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to prove their case. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-12\">. Relying on this circuit\u2019s decisions in Roth v. Board of Regents, 446 F.2d 806 (7 Cir. 1971), and Shirck v. Thomas, 447 F. 2d 1025 (7 Cir. 1971), plaintiffs also claimed that they could not be discharged without first being afforded the procedural due process rights of prompt notice and hearing. After oral argument we entered a hold order because the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in <em>Roth. </em>The Supreme Court reversed this circuit in <em>Roth, </em>Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), and vacated our judgment in <em>Shirck, </em>Thomas v. Shirck, 408 TJ.S. 940,. 92 S.Ct. 2848, 33 D.Ed.2d 746 (June 29, 1972). The Court held that a non-tenured teacher had no Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d right to continued employment and was therefore not entitled to a pretermination notice and hearing. The Court said that to have a \u201cproperty\u201d interest in a benefit a person \u201cmust have more than an abstract need or desire for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d 408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. One who takes a \u201cpatronage\u201d job may not even have an expectation of keeping it when the appointing officer is replaced, let alone a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to such a job. <em>Roth </em>did indicate that different considerations might apply if a state, in dismissing or refusing to rehire an employee, made charges tending to damage his \u201cgood name, reputation, honor or integrity.\u201d We assume that the loss of a patronage job would in no sense reflect adversely on the discharged employee\u2019s reputation. And here, of course, no charges of misconduct were made \u2014 the discharges were made without any reasons being given. It is true that the reasons given by the Secretary in his affidavit might be construed as charging mismanagement, inefficiency and perhaps misconduct. However, the affidavit speaks in general terms and does not accuse any particular individual of dishonesty or lack of integrity. Moreover, charges made only in an effort to defend a lawsuit cannot be used to require a \u201cnotice and hearing\u201d at a time before such charges were made. The hearing on any such charges is afforded by the judicial proceeding which provoked them. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Roth </em>requires that we reject the \u201cnotice and hearing\u201d aspect of plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">.

The district court might have considered the issue \u201cimmaterial\u201d on the theory that plaintiffs would have no claim even if they had been discharged for \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons.

Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P., clearly contemplates that interrogatory answers may be considered on a motion for summary judgment.

Indeed, I must, for such a result is dictated by the sweeping holding of the Supreme Court in Perry v. Sinder-mann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\"><em>Sindermann </em>is arguably distinguishable from this case on its facts; it did not involve a discharged public employee who alleged, as here, that his dismissal was predicated upon his political party affiliation or activities. Rather, the plaintiff there, a state college teacher, claimed that his employment was terminated because of his statements criticizing the college\u2019s Board of Regents, purportedly made in the exercise of his First Amendment right of free expression. The case was thus similar to prior decisions in the special and delicate area of \u201cacademic freedom,\" such as Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Pick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811, and could have been decided, in my view, within the framework of such precedents. However, the language of <em>Sin-dermann </em>is not so circumscribed but appears far-reaching and manifestly unequivocal. Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cFor if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to \u2018produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\u2019 Speiser v. Randall, 375 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460. Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.\u201d (408 U.S. 597, 92 S.Ct. at 2697.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\"><em>Sindermann </em>was decided after briefing and argument of the case at bar and, as I have stated above, prompts me to concur in the result reached by Judge Stevens\u2019 thoughtful opinion. I am constrained at the same time, however, to candidly express several observations that I believe are highly relevant, if not critical, concerning the import and effect of our ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">First, it cannot be doubted that our decision stands in sharp and irreconcilable conflict with the decision of the Second Circuit in Alomar v. Dwyer, 447 F.2d 482 (1971), and the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO v. Shapp, 443 Pa. 527, 280 A.2d 375 (1971). Both of those Courts squarely rejected, as a matter of law, the precise claim made by the plaintiffs here, <em>i. e., </em>that they were discharged from their government jobs because of their allegiance to one political party and refusal to join or support another, and that such discharge violated their First Amendment rights of free association. Both <em>Alomar </em>and <em>Shapp </em>were decided within a year prior to <em>Sindermann. </em>Indeed the Supreme Court without a dissenting voice denied certio-rari in <em>Alomar </em>on January 10, 1972, <em>only six months </em>prior to that Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sindermann. </em>Alomar v. Dwyer, 404 U.S. 1020, 92 S.Ct. 683, 30 L.Ed.2d 667. Too, discussion or even citation of <em>Alo-mar </em>or <em>Shapp </em>was conspicuously omitted from the <em>Sindermann </em>opinion (or in the concurring and dissenting opinions).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Thus, as matters now stand, the declared law of the Second Circuit and of the State of Pennsylvania is diametrically opposed to the law of this Circuit, as so ably formulated and announced herein.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Moreover, it can reasonably be expected that the conflict and attendant confusion will grow and multiply as other courts are called upon to consider the same issue. Indeed, it should be noted that at least two District Judges in this Circuit have recently followed the <em>Alomar </em>and <em>Shapp </em>decisions, and thus have rejected claims that public employees cannot be discharged because of their political party affiliations without violating the First Amendment. In Burns v. Elrod, (No. 71C607, N.D.Ill., May 31, 1972), Judge Bauer dismissed a complaint alleging that the newly elected Democratic Sheriff of Cook County violated the First Amendment by discharging Republican employees who refused to become Democrats.- And in Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County, (No. 69 c. 2145, N.D.Ill.1972), Judge Marovitz held, in reliance upon <em>Alomar </em>and <em>Burns, </em>that, \u201cpolitical considerations in public employment are only forbidden where those considerations affect voter-candidate-taxpayer rights and in all other respects patronage employees may be hired or fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>based on political affiliation.\u201d (Slip Opinion p. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The conflicting and confused state of the law is troubling enough, but I am even more concerned over the impact of today\u2019s decision in thrusting the federal courts into the administration and daily operations of state and local governments. It seems to me that the inevitable effect will be to convert the federal courts into \u201csuper civil service commissions\u201d for all state and local government employees not covered by state or local civil service l\u00e1ws. Any and all such employees who are discharged can state an actionable claim in the federal district court by simply alleging (as plaintiffs have done here) that the discharge was caused by political party affiliations or activities. The federal courts will then be obliged to conduct full trials on the merits to determine whether the claims are factually well founded, and the resulting decisions will of course be ap-pealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In this case alone, the number of trials and appeals could total as high as 1,946\u2014 the. number of employees that the defendant Lewis claims he \u201cfound it necessary to discharge\u201d after he became Secretary of State \u201cbecause of the laxity, inefficiency and confusion prevailing in the Office.\u201d And this represents the possible number of trials and appeals arising from but <em>one </em>department of a State\u2019s government and <em>one </em>change of administration in that department! Considering that there are thousands of state, county and municipal employees not covered by civil service, and that changes of political administration occur in many departments of state and local government after every election, the volume of potential litigation which could result from our decision truly becomes catastrophic.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The scope and complexity of the litigation problems created by our ruling are not lessened by our limiting its applicability to \u201cnon-policy making\u201d government personnel. It is simple enough to say that janitors, clerk-typists and elevator operators are \u201cnon-rpolicy making\u201d employees, but how far up in the bureaucratic, echelon can the distinction be judicially drawn ? What about a janitorial supervisor, the director of a stenographic pool, a personnel manager, a deputy assistant division head, a deputy director, or even a secretary to a top-echelon director or department head who may have access to confidential information? As Judge Stevens so aptly states, there may be instances when political affiliation constitutes a proper qualification for public employment, particularly in the selection and appointment of \u201cpolicy-making\u201d officials. Indeed, no one has challenged the right of an elected official to appoint to such positions and for whatever reasons he deems proper, persons in whose loyalty and competence he has the highest confidence. The difficulty arises in attempting to fashion an appropriate and workable judicial standard for distinguishing between \u201cpolicy-making\u201d and \u201cnon policyr-making\u201d positions. In my judgment, the constitution would permit a public official to hire or dismiss on the basis of political association any employee engaged directly or indirectly in the formulation or implementation of the policies of the particular governmental office or agency. A more precise standard is difficult to articulate and thus the true impact of today\u2019s decision must necessarily await case by case determination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Another vexing and potentially troublesome problem which emerges from our ruling concerns the practical application of the burden of proof standard. It goes without saying, of course, that the burden belongs to and remains with the dismissed employee. It seems equally clear that since a civil service system may not be judicially imposed upon a state or local government, that a public employer cannot be compelled to explain the reasons for termination. Indeed, the imposition of such a \u201cburden of explanation\u201d would run counter to the precise holding of the Supreme Court in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,-92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). Thus, if a public employer desires to stand silent by way of a general denial to the employees\u2019 allegations, the employee must demonstrate by the clear and convincing weight of the evidence that his dismissal resulted solely because of his political associations. Such a burden is a heavy one but in my view is necessitated by the limited nature of the right <em>Sindermann </em>compels us to recognize <em>today </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the right to be free from summary dismissal <em>only </em>where the dismisal is based solely upon a reason expressly proscribed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Therefore, based upon the broad holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Sindermann, </em>I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">. Although my remarks are confined to the First Amendment aspects of today\u2019s ruling, I agree fully with Judge Stevens that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) forecloses the plaintiffs\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment claim that they were entitled to \u201cnotice\u201d and a \u201chearing\u201d before their employment could be terminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-18\">.

In addition to the inherent difficulty of defining the term, \u201cnon-policy making employee\u201d, another problem comes to the surface that is equally perplexing and is of constitutional dimension. If we must judge whether or not an employee may be discharged for exercising his First Amendment rights of free political association on the basis of his job classification, are we not saying that some employments are entitled to greater constitutional protection than others. Are the constitutional rights of an individual to be defined solely With reference to the nature of his employment? I know of no precedent in our system for imposing a \u201csliding scale\u201d of importance upon the constitutional rights of individuals according to their rank, title, job description or duties, whether in or out of government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b639-5\">KILEY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"a6t-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">No case decided by this court, and none relied upon by the majority, is a precise precedent for the holding of the majority that plaintiffs\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> discharges for partisan political reasons were constitutionally \u201cimpermissible.\u201d The Second Circuit in Alomar v. Dwyer, 447 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1971), holds to the contrary. The majority opinion\u2019s disavowal of <em>Alomar </em>is based upon footnote 9 in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), which the majority thinks laid to rest the \u201cpremise\u201d in Bailey v.

In my opinion the <em>Alomar </em>court\u2019s decision on the First Amendment issue before it is unaffected by what is said in the Supreme Courts footnote 9 in the <em>Roth </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">I am persuaded by the decision in <em>Alomar. </em>In my opinion, the district court, in the case now before us, did not err in deciding as a matter of law that plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment right of \u201cfree political association\u201d was not violated by their discharge by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The majority opinion\u2019s asserted \u201cdemise\u201d of <em>Bailey </em>in my view has no foundation in the <em>Roth </em>footnote. Justice Stewart\u2019s comments in footnote 9, considerations essential to <em>Roth, </em>are directed to the procedural due process decision, not to the First Amendment decision, in <em>Bailey. </em>He broadens the scope of the footnote by quoting Justice Black-mun\u2019s remark in Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 374, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed. 2d 534 (1971), that the Supreme Court \u201cnow has rejected the concept that constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental benefit is characterized as a \u2018right\u2019 or as a \u2018privilege.\u2019 \u201d In addition to <em>Graham, </em>Justice Stewart cites Shapiro v.

That doctrine in essence forbids the government from imposing conditions on government employment which would require the employee to surrender a right which he would be entitled to exercise as a private citizen. It is the implementation of the doctrine that results in the \u201crejection\u201d of the \u201cright\u201d v. \u201cprivilege\u201d dichotomy where First Amendment issues are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The unconstitutional conditions doctrine has what Professor Van Alstyne calls a \u201cbasic flaw\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">The basic flaw in the doctrine is its assumption that the same evil results from attaching certain conditions to government-connected activity as from imposing such conditions on persons not connected with government. In many cases this may be true, but the connection with the government may in certain circumstances make otherwise unreasonable conditions quite reasonable. 81 Harv.L.Rev. at 1448.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">It is this \u201cflaw\u201d that is implicitly recognized in <em>Bailey\u2019s </em>discussion of the First Amendment claim and which is implicitly acknowledged in <em>Alomar. </em>It was the First Amendment decision in <em>Bailey, </em>not the procedural due process decision, which the Second Circuit relied upon in rejecting the claim of Daisy Alomar that she had been discharged in violation of her associational right: \u201cIt is next said that the appellant\u2019s dismissal impinged upon the rights of free speech and assembly protected by the First Amendment, since the dismissal was premised upon alleged political activity * * * But the plain hard fact is that so far as the Constitution is concerned there is no prohibition against the dismissal of Government employees because of their political beliefs, activities or affiliations.\u201d Alomar v. Dwyer, 447 F.2d 482, 483 (2nd Cir. 1971), citing Bailey v. Richardson, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 248, 182 F.2d 46, 59 (1950), aff\u2019d, per cur-iam, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct. 669, 95 L. Ed. 1352 (1950).</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-11\">. Plaintiffs were non-civil service employees specifically exempt from the Illinois Personnel Code.
