The Commission ordered Otter Tail to permit the Village of Elbow Lake to interconnect its municipal power facilities with Otter Tail\u2019s transmission line for purposes of buying electrical power from Otter Tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-16\">Section 202(b) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a(b)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-17\">(b) Whenever the Commission, upon application of any State commission or of any person engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, and after notice to each State commission and public utility affected and after opportunity for hearing, finds such action necessary or appropriate in the public interest it may by order direct a public utility (if the Commission finds that no undue burden will be placed upon such public utility thereby) to establish physical connection of its transmission facilities with the facilities of one or more other persons engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy, to sell energy to or exchange energy with such persons: <em>Provided, </em>That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>Commission shall have no authority to compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes, nor to compel such public utility to sell or exchange energy when to do so would impair its ability to render adequate service to its customers. The Commission may prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement to be made between the persons affected by any such order, including the apportionment of cost between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">Otter Tail\u2019s petition objects to the \u201cterms and conditions of the arrangement\u201d with its essential contention being that the terms provided by the order do not constitute \u201ccompensation or reimbursement reasonably due\u201d Otter Tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">Otter Tail is a privately owned utility within the meaning of the Federal Power Act which serves some 460 small communities in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Elbow Lake is a village of about 1,500 persons in Minnesota who from 1913 to 1966 was one of the Otter Tail\u2019s electrical energy customers. Otter Tail\u2019s franchise with Elbow Lake expired in 1960 and was not renewed. The village attempted to purchase either Otter Tail\u2019s distribution system in Elbow Lake or electrical power at wholesale from Otter Tail, who refused. In 1962, the voters of Elbow Lake approved a bond issue to finance the construction of a municipal power system. The new system, completed and operating by 1966, consisted of two small diesel generating units (1136 KW nameplate rating each with a two-hour overload capability of 1250 KW) and a distribution system. The record is replete with evidence showing that this municipal adventure was misguided and unfortunate; that isolated diesel generating systems are inefficient and uneconomic; that in the new system\u2019s first year of operations it operated at a loss even though the same rates were charged as before; and that the system had undergone peak hour demands dangerously close to its total capability. Under the circumstances, the system would be unable to satisfy Elbow Lake\u2019s expected future needs for power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">In 1966, Elbow Lake applied to the FPC for an order requiring Otter Tail to furnish it with wholesale electric power, claiming that a shortage of energy was imminent. Following a hearing, the FPC in 1968 ordered a \u201cshort term\u201d interconnection under \u00a7 202(b) pending further study and hearings. This order required Otter Tail to furnish standby power to Elbow Lake for one year and only in the case of actual need. The order was affirmed by this Court at 429 F.2d 232 (C.A. 8 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 947, 91 S.Ct. 923, 28 L.Ed.2d 230 (1971). Elbow Lake, however, made no effort to make the interconnection with Otter Tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">The Presiding Examiner in 1971 ordered Otter Tail to sell energy at specified wholesale rates to Elbow Lake and to allow the village to establish a long-term interconnection with Otter Tail\u2019s transmission line. The Presiding Examiner and the Commission found that Otter Tail with its modern steam plants was fully capable of absorbing the village\u2019s full requirements without the necessity of enlarging its facilities, and that the long-term interconnection was necessary and appropriate in the public interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See \u00a7 202(b). Otter Tail does not appeal from this portion of the Commission\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE INTERCONNECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">The Presiding Examiner and the Commission ordered the sale of Elbow Lake\u2019s entire energy requirements on a firm basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission directed Otter Tail to permit Elbow Lake to make physical connection with Otter Tail\u2019s transmission line, with the village to install and pay for the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The rate paid to Otter Tail was to be based upon Otter Tail\u2019s fully-allocated cost of firm, wholesale service. The Commission, however, also accepted its staff\u2019s recommendation and ordered that Otter Tail must credit against Elbow Lake\u2019s monthly billing \u201cone-twelfth of the annual interest plus principal costs of Elbow Lake\u2019s generating plant, for each month in which Elbow Lake\u2019s existing two diesel generators are in operable condition.\u201d Under this part of the order, Otter Tail is, in essence, assuming Elbow Lake\u2019s bond issue obligations in full for the duration of the long-term interconnection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">Section 202(b) authorizes the Commission, pursuant to an interconnection order, to prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement, \u201cincluding the apportionment of cost between them and the <em>compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to </em>any of them [emphasis added].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Otter Tail assails this provision of the Commission\u2019s order, claiming that this \u201ccredit\u201d is not reasonably or appropriately related to <em>any </em>value of the two diesel engines as additional reserves for Otter Tail, and as a consequence denies to Otter Tail the \u201ccompensation or reimbursement reasonably due\u201d Otter Tail under \u00a7 202(b). .</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">In considering this contention we are governed by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Gainesville Utilities Department v. Florida Power Corporation, 402 U.S. 515, 91 S.Ct. 1592, 29 L. Ed.2d 74 (1971). In <em>Gainesville, </em>the Commission had ordered an interconnection on a \u201cstandby\u201d basis in order to obviate Gainesville\u2019s need to build and maintain a larger reserve generating capacity. Florida Power claimed that Gainesville should pay $150,000 annually as compensation reasonably due it for the backup service provided since the reserves made available to Florida Power from Gainesville were insignificant. The Fifth Circuit agreed with Florida Power, holding that Gainesville was receiving high benefits but no real obligations, and that Florida Power obtained obtained substantial obligations, but no real benefits. \u201cSuch imaginary equity is not reasonable compensation.\u201d Florida Power Corporation v. Federal Power Commission, 425 F.2d 1196, 1203 (C.A. 5 1970). The Supreme Court reversed, upholding the Commission, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-11\">Insofar as the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion implies that there was not substantial evidence to support a finding of <em>some </em>benefits, it is clearly wrong. And insofar as the Court's opinion implies that the responsibilities assumed by Gainesville in combination with the benefits found to accrue to Florida Power were insufficient to constitute \u201ccompensation reasonably due,\u201d the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>of Appeals overstepped the role of the judiciary. Congress ordained that that determination should be made, in the first instance, by the Commission, and on that record made in this case, the Court of Appeals erred in not deferring to the Commission\u2019s expert judgment. <em>Gainesville, supra </em>402 U.S. at 527, 91 S.Ct. at 1599.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\"> <em>Gainesville </em>makes certain our standard of review. We are to search the record to ascertain whether substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings of facts. See \u00a7 313(b). The question of whether the 'Commission\u2019s findings and resulting order constitute \u201ccompensation or reimbursement reasonably due\u201d is not for our de novo determination. In this highly technical field Congress has explicitly committed this question to the Commission, to whose expertise we must defer. <em>Gainesville, supra. </em>See Federal Power Commission v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U.S. 17, 20, 73 S.Ct. 85, 97 L.Ed. 15 (1952) and Federal Power Commission v. Pacific Power &amp; Light Co., 307 U.S. 156, 160, 59 S.Ct. 766, 83 L.Ed. 1180 (1939). <em>Cf. </em>Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 767 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">In the present case the Commission, while recognizing that Elbow Lake\u2019s small diesel units are not an economical method of producing power for a large company, held that Otter Tail would gain \u201creadily demonstrable benefits\u201d from the interconnection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">A review of the record convinces us that substantial evidence supports the finding that Otter Tail acquires some benefits from the interconnection order. The benefits are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-7\">(1) Otter Tail acquires Elbow Lake as a customer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1317-8\">(2) Elbow Lake\u2019s two 1250 KW diesel generators become a standby resource for Otter Tail\u2019s generation needs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">Since substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings that Otter Tail will benefit from the interconnection arrangement, we must initially defer to the expert judgment of the Commission on the question of whether the terms and conditions of the arrangement constitute \u201ccompensation or reimbursement reasonably due\u201d Otter Tail. Because of our disposition of this part of the Commission\u2019s order on another basis, as next set out, we do not now decide whether the compensation determined by the Commission was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-10\">Otter Tail also contends that the Commission's order, with the \u201ccredit,\u201d forces Otter Tail, in substance, to purchase the Elbow Lake generating plant in violation of \u00a7 202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">The statute limits the Commission\u2019s power in ordering interconnections. It provides \u201cThat the Commission shall have no authority to compel the enlargement of generating facilities for such purposes, . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-12\">The Commission\u2019s position is that the proscription applies only to facilities <em>owned </em>by a recipient of an interconnection order, and since Otter Tail acquires no title to the Elbow Lake plant, the credit constitutes only the \u201cterms and conditions of the arrangement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-13\">On this point the present case differs from <em>Gainesville. </em>In <em>Gainesville, </em>the recipient of the interconnection order was required to provide standby emergency service and only on an \u201cas available\u201d basis. \u201cThus the benefits that the Commission found that Florida Power will receive from the interconnection will come without any capital investment on its part.\u201d <em>Gainesville, supra, </em>402 U.S. at 528, 91 S.Ct. at 1599.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-14\">Here, Otter Tail is to provide all of Elbow Lake\u2019s energy requirements on a firm basis. Although Otter Tail will never receive any legal title to Elbow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>Lake\u2019s generation system, Otter Tail must, in effect, assume the village\u2019s obligations under the bond indenture for the duration of the interconnection. Potentially, if the interconnection order is still in effect, by 1987 Otter Tail will have paid for Elbow Lake\u2019s entire indebtedness incurred with respect to its generating facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">The Commission justifies the credit on the basis that since Elbow Lake\u2019s two diesel engines provide a \u201cclear and considerable\u201d gain in generating capacity for Otter Tail, this usefulness must be recognized in the rate Elbow Lake pays Otter Tail for power. This <em>addition </em>to Otter Tail\u2019s generation capacity plus the requirement that Otter Tail pay for such, in our opinion, clearly constitutes violation of the statutory prohibition against the forced enlargement of generating facilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">We recognize the Commission may impose \u201cterms and conditions\u201d pursuant to an interconnection order, weighing the responsibilities each party will bear and the benefits each shall receive, and then in its judgment determine what \u201ccompensation or reimbursement\u201d is \u201creasonably due\u201d both. However, when as here, Otter Tail is required to in effect purchase standby facilities the statutory proscription against compelling the enlargement of generating facilities is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">That portion of the Commission\u2019s order requiring Otter Tail to grant a credit for the costs incurred by Elbow Lake in purchasing its generating plant is set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">. Elbow Lake\u2019s preference was for an order requiring Otter Tail to \u201cwheel\u201d cheaper Bureau of Reclamation power to the village. This request was denied as being beyond the authority of the Commission. See \u00a7 201(f) and City of Paris v. Kentucky Utilities Co., 41 FPC 45 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">. Otter Tail contended before the Commission that the interconnection would amount to a suicide pact for Otter Tail. It charged that several of its municipal customers were considering the establishment of their own power systems and that if the Commission \u201cbails out\u201d Elbow Lake in this instance, many others will follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>in Elbow Lake\u2019s footsteps causing irreparable damage to Otter Tail\u2019s integrated system. We note that several of Otter Tail\u2019s customers did in fact follow Elbow Lake\u2019s example and that Otter Tail has been held in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act for its refusals to sell wholesale or wheel power to its former customers (including Elbow Lake). United States v. Otter Tail Power Company, 331 F.Supp. 54 (D. Minn.1971) prob. juris, noted, 406 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 2039, 32 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972). See 41 U.S.L.W. 3321 (December 12, 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1316-13\">. The Commission found that \u201ca long-term interconnection between Otter Tail and' Elbow Lake, with Elbow Lake taking its full requirements from Otter Tail, would result in Elbow Lake\u2019s receiving power at the lowest cost.\u201d Elbow Lake, of course, still' has the option of not exercising its rights under the interconnection order and purchasing an additional generator for its system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1317-15\">. We assume that Otter Tail will make a profit under the Commission\u2019s order. Both the Commission and Presiding Examiner selected a higher rate schedule than that proposed by the Staff, whose rates and charges would have \u201cdiminish [ed] Otter Tail\u2019s revenue to a net level1 of 47 percent below cost.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">. The Presiding Examiner held that this \u201ccredit\u201d constituted an indirect violation of \u00a7 202(b)\u2019s proscription against forcing the enlargement of generating facilities. In so holding the Presiding Examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-9\">In substance, Staff\u2019s recommended capacity credit would require Otter Tail and its customers to pay for Elbow Lake\u2019s ill-advised excursion into the power business. If the credit is applied during the entire life of the Elbow Lake bond issue, the total of the capacity credits will equal the total cost of the generating plant, including both principal and interest charges. Ironically, while paying for the plant, Otter Tail would acquire no title or interest in the property other than a right to require the operation of the equipment after 12 hours notice. [The Commission\u2019s order ultimately required \u201creasonable\u201d notice].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5L\">He also found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AczC\">[T]he credit serves as a means for enabling Elbow Lake to recoup at the expense of the Otter Tail rate payer the money committed for the purchase of the generating equipment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
