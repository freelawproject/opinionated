Zale itself is a combination operating and holding company, and as a holding company controls a network of 1056 wholly owned subsidiaries, including the subsidiary, Corrigan-Republie, Inc. The Corporate Enterprise engages in a nationwide business of selling retail jewelry and other merchandise, generating a large volume of consumer credit transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-11\">The consumer credit transactions of the Zale Corporate Enterprise were the subject of FTC\u2019s inquiry. Specifically, the Commission attacked the Enterprise\u2019s uniform retail installment contract as used in the subject period, July 1, 1969 to <em>December </em>31, 1969. Zale has conceded this form\u2019s violation of Regulation Z in thirteen particulars by failing to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-12\">1. Properly disclose the \u201cdollars finance charge per $100 of unpaid balance;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-13\">2. properly disclose the term \u201cfinance charge\u201d more conspicuously than other required terminology ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-14\">3. exclude the amount of the \u201cfinance charge\u201d in the computation of the \u201camount financed;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-15\">4. properly disclose the term \u201cfinance charge\u201d in proper meaningful sequence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-16\">5. properly include the charge for credit life insurance in the term \u201camount financed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-17\">6. disclose the amount of the \u201cdollars finance charge per year per $100 of unpaid balance\u201d with an accuracy to the nearest quarter of one percent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>7. use the term \u201ccash downpayment\u201d when the downpayment was in money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-4\">8. properly use the term \u201cunpaid balance of cash price;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-5\">9. treat an existing consumer obligation as a new transaction when the obligation was increased;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-6\">10. clearly identify the property in which a security interest was retained ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-7\">11. accurately identify the method used for computing any charge that is deducted from the amount of any rebate of unearned finance charge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-8\">12. include the proscribed notice when required disclosures are made on both sides of the document; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-9\">13. make the required disclosures on the reverse side of the contract in the necessary clear, conspicuous and meaningful sequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">Zale, however, contends that the offending form has been remedied to comply with the Regulation. The Commission disagrees, finding still other violations such as the new form\u2019s notice provision. See 12 C.F.R..226.6(a). Additionally, it should be noted that certain of the admitted violations involve incorrect amounts or rates in the actual transactions rather than in the use of terminology or disclosure sequence which is preprinted on those forms. Whether or not such practices have actually been abandoned can only be determined through subsequent enforcement procedures. Hence, while respecting the good corporate name of the Zale Enterprise, there is no valid assurance that if Zale were free of the Commission\u2019s restraint it would not continue its former course. <em>Compare </em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. FTC, 258 F. 307 (7th Cir., 1919), and Clinton Watch Co. v. FTC, 291 F.2d 838 (7th Cir., 1961). \u201cCourts properly leave to the Commission\u2019s non-abusive discretion the question whether the public interest requires the protection of an order in cases where unlawful practices have been discontinued.\u201d Cotherman v. FTC, 417 F.2d 587, 594 (5th Cir., 1969). Zale\u2019s statement that it has amended its form and no longer will violate the Act was unpersuasive before the Commission and is insufficient to convince us that the Commission abused its discretion in entering a cease and desist order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-12\">\u201cEven though Sullivan and Cother-man promised never to re-enter the lending business, the Commission .is not bound \u2018simply by the promise [s] of the petitioner [s]\u2019. C. Howard Hunt Pen Co. v. FTC, 3 Cir. 1952, 197 F.2d 273, 281; <em>see </em>Eugene Dietzgen Co. v. FTC, 7 Cir. 1944, 142 F.2d 321, 330-331; Stanley Laboratories Inc. v. FTC, 9 Cir. 1943, 138 F.2d 388, 390. A <em>promise </em>to go and sin no more is merely one of the circumstances that the Commission should consider in determining how the public interest in stopping the deceptive practices can best be accomplished. On the record as a whole we cannot say that the Commission abused its discretion in issuing the cease and desist order against Cotherman and Sullivan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-13\">Cotherman v. FTC, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-14\">Zales next questions the scope of the Commission\u2019s order and the Commission\u2019s power to look to the parent Zales for all violations occurring in the daily use of the credit forms in the Enterprise \u2014 to Zales the latter vests review in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-15\">We conclude that the FTC appropriately entered its decree against the Zale Enterprise due to the presence in the record of the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-16\">1. The source of the majority of violations is the form prepared by the parent Zale and distributed by it to its subsidiary and division stores alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-17\">2. Accountability for the use of the form lies with the parent Zale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-18\">3. The advertising done is in the Enterprise name vis-a-vis the names of specific stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-19\">4. The Enterprise organization denies recognition of the separate corporate infra structure employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>The following facts supported by this record are borrowed from the government\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-4\">The parent Zale Corporation and its subsidiaries have consistently maintained common or overlapping officers and directors. A meeting of all the directors and officers of Zale and its 1,056 subsidiaries would consist of only forty-one individuals. Of these, thirty-two are directors or officers of the Zale Corporation, and of these thirty-two individuals, thirteen are directors or officers in one or more subsidiaries. Thus, there are only nine individuals holding positions as officers or directors in the 1,056 subsidiaries who are not also officers or directors of the parent Zale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-6\">The following table shows the overlapping of directors and officers of the parent and its subsidiaries:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-7\">\n<em>Name Zale Corporation Zale\u2019s Divisions except Butler Shoe Division Zale\u2019s Butler Shoe Division</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfFq\">Ben A.

Third Ave. Ry. Co., 244 N.Y. 84, 95, 155 N.E. 58, 61 (1926):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuN_\">\u201cLiability of the parent has never been adjudged when the subsidiary has maintained so consistently and in so many ways as here the separate organization that is the mark of a separate existence, and when the implication of a contract for unity of operation would be the implication of a contract for the commission of a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-4\">\u201cThe whole problem of the relation between parent and subsidiary corporations is one that is still enveloped in the mists of metaphor. Metaphors in law are to be narrowly watched, for starting as devices to liberate thought, they end often by enslaving it. We say at times that the corporate entity will be ignored when the parent corporation operates a business through a subsidiary which is characterized as an \u2018alias\u2019 or a \u2018dummy.\u2019 All this is well enough if the picturesqueness of the epithets does not lead us to forget that the essential term to be defined is the act of operation. Dominion may be so complete, interference so obtrusive, that by the general rules of agency the parent will be a principal and the subsidiary an agent. Where control is less than this, we are remitted to the tests of honesty and justice. Bal-lantine, Parent and Subsidiary Corporations, 14 Cal.Law Review, 12, 18, 19, 20. The logical consistency of a juridical conception will indeed be sacrificed at times, when the sacrifice is essential to the end that some accepted public policy may be defended or upheld. This is so, for illustration, though agency in any proper sense is lacking, where the attempted separation between parent and subsidiary will work a fraud upon the law. . . . At such times unity is ascribed to parts which, at least for many purposes, retain an independent life, for the reason that only thus can we overcome a perversion of the privilege to do business in a corporate form. We find in the case at hand neither agency on the one hand, nor, on the other, abuse to be corrected by the implication of a merger. On the contrary, merger might beget more abuses than it stifled. Statutes carefully framed for the protection, not merely of creditors, but of all who travel upon railroads, forbid the confusion of liabilities by extending operation over one route to operation on another. In such circumstances, we thwart the public policy of the state instead of defending or upholding it, when we ignore the separation between subsidiary and parent and treat the two as one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\"><em>Compare </em>Berger v.

The examiner\u2019s order includes within its prohibitions three full sections of Regulation z. These sections embrace the practices in which respondents admittedly engaged and in which there were admitted violations. These sections also cover the types of practices in which respondents\u2019 activities are concentrated. For example, Section 226.7 governs the specific disclosure requirements for credit other than open end. The retail installment contract of the Zale Store Division owned by the Zale Corporation falls directly under this section. Section 226.8 governs the specific disclosure requirements for open end credit. The periodic statement of Corrigan-Re-public which was used throughout the Fine Jeweler\u2019s Guild Division, owned by the Zale Corporation falls under this section. Section 226.6 sets out the general disclosure requirements of type, size, and placement that ties into the other two sections.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
