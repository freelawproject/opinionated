For reasons hereinafter stated, we hold for the defendant and against the plaintiff and dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-10\">The stipulated facts may be summarized as follows. During the years in question, the taxpayer was engaged in underground construction work for utility companies in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, controlling approximately 40 percent of the market against three other competitors. The taxpayer\u2019s success, or at least the expeditious solution to a variety of excavation and construction problems, was and is dependent upon the cooperation of the utilities, their inspectors, engineers, and other supervisory personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-12\">Since 1958, the taxpayer has owned and operated a 38-foot fishing boat, the DAF. During the years in question, plaintiff employed a captain to operate the DAF. The taxpayer makes no claim, however, that the captain had any familiarity with the underground construction business or entered into any discussions with the utilities\u2019 employees regarding such business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">The overall use of the boat was limited to day-long fishing trips by the taxpayer\u2019s own employees, as well as its customers, suppliers, and other business associates. Basically, attendance on the DAF involved three different groupings of the persons noted above. First, there were occasions when the boat was used as a recreational facility exclusively by the taxpayer\u2019s own employees. Second, there were other occasions when the boat was used by the business associates of the taxpayer, accompanied by the taxpayer\u2019s own employees. As to these two situations, which comprised 26 percent of the total costs and expenses for fiscal 1966 and 10 percent of the total costs and expenses for fiscal 1967, the District Director asserted no deficiency and has, in effect, conceded that these expenses were allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">On the majority of occasions, however, a third situation existed; that is, the use of the boat was exclusively by the taxpayer\u2019s business associates and without the presence of any employee of the taxpayer, save the captain. This situation existed 74 percent of the time during fiscal 1966 and 90 percent of the time during fiscal 1967. The availability of the boat for business associates was on a first-come, first-served basis. When no employees or officers of the plaintiff were present, there were no business meetings, negotiations, discussions, or other bona fide business transactions on the DAF (or on the same day) other than the entertainment of customers, suppliers, and business associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>The District Director disallowed the pro rata portion of the expenses alloca-ble to the instances when the boat was used by the business associates of the taxpayer without the presence of any of the taxpayer\u2019s officers or employees. The resulting deficiencies and interest for this 74 percent disallowance for fiscal 1966 and 90 percent disallowance for fiscal 1967 were assessed and paid. Timely claims for refund were denied and this suit was thus commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Section 274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the relevant portions of which are reproduced below,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was added to the tax law by the Revenue Act of 1962. One of the avowed purposes of section 274 was to require certain expenditures otherwise deductible under sections 162 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 167 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to meet a more stringent standard with respect to the proximate relationship of the expense to the active conduct of the business. This is made clear in the</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-10\">House Ways and Means Committee Report, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-11\">With respect to expenses for entertainment activities, the bill provides that a deduction will be allowed only to the extent that the taxpayer establishes that the <em>expense was directly related to the active conduct of his trade or business. </em>[The same \u201cdirectly related\u201d test is used in the treatment of entertainment facilities.] <em>This means that the taxpayer must show a greater degree of proximate relation between the expenditure and his trade or business than is required under present law. </em>* * * [H.R. Rep. No. 1477, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 20 (1962-3 Cum.Bull. 405, 424.] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-13\">Due to the relatively loose business connection required under section 162, significant abuses were found present with respect to expenses for entertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>ment and facilities used in connection with such entertainment activity. In order to qualify as deductible, the expenses incurred by the DAF, a facility within the meaning of section 274(a)(1)(B), must pass two tests. The Government concedes the first of t.hese, that the facility was used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. This concession merely amounts to an admission by the Government that more than 50 percent of the total calendar days of use of the DAF were days of business use, that is, for purposes considered ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section 162 and the regulations thereunder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1461-13\">The second test and crucial issue for our resolution is whether the item was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. Clearly, the degree of proximity required to pass the test of \u201cdirectly related\u201d is more strict than the old test of \u201cordinary and necessary.\u201d The Regulations enacted pursuant to section 274 explain the new standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.274-2(c) (3) (1969) seeks to define what will, in general, satisfy the requirement of \u201cdirectly related.\u201d The taxpayer must meet all the requirements embodied in subdivisions (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (3) to pass this particular \u201cdirectly related\u201d test. The taxpayer, on the basis of the stipulation, clearly cannot satisfy the minimum prerequisite of subdivision (ii) of the regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-7\">(ii) During the entertainment period to which the expenditure related, the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting, negotiation, discussion, or other bona fide business transaction, other than entertainment, for the purpose of obtaining such income or other specific trade or business benefit * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">The taxpayer has stipulated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-13\">* * * On those occasions when no employees or officers were present, there were no business meetings, negotiations, discussions or other bona fide business transactions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>\u201cDAF\u201d (or on the same day), other than the entertainment of customers, suppliers and business associates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6Qs\">Significantly, subdivision (iii), in specifying that the principal character of the business and entertainment to which the expenditure related was the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, provides the following presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-4\">(iii) * * * The active conduct of trade or business is considered not to be the principal character or aspect of combined business and entertainment activity on hunting or fishing trips or on yachts and other pleasure boats unless the taxpayer clearly establishes to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">Unable to establish that the entertainment in issue can be considered directly related to the active conduct of its trade or business under Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.274-2(c)(3) (1969), the taxpayer concentrates its argument on Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.-274-2(c)(4) (1969). Under this sub-paragraph,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-7\">(4) * * * An expenditure for entertainment shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business if it is established that the expenditure was for entertainment occurring in a clear business setting directly in furtherance of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">The plaintiff argues that if it comes within the \u201csafe harbor\u201d of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.274-2(c) (4) (1969) by establishing that the entertainment provided by the DAF was in a \u201cclear business setting,\u201d then it has satisfied the \u201cdirectly related\u201d test. While as a general statement this is true, the plaintiff errs in focusing with almost exclusive emphasis on the following language of subparagraph (4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-11\">(4) * -* * Generally, entertainment shall not be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting unless the taxpayer clearly establishes that any recipient of the entertainment would have reasonably known that the taxpayer had no significant motive, in incurring the expenditure, other than directly furthering his trade or business. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-14\">We view this language as merely providing one element in the definition of what might constitute a \u201cclear business setting.\u201d If this were not the case, the taxpayer could succeed by a showing that the expenditures furthered simple good will, as is undoubtedly the circumstance in nearly every case of this type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-15\">We find that the specific direction in subparagraph (4) to subparagraph (7) of the same paragraph (Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.-274-2(c) (7) (ii) is far more indicative of the true meaning of the term \u201cclear business setting.\u201d Subparagraph (4) states that, ordinarily, entertainment which occurred under the circumstances described in subparagraph (7) (ii) will not be considered as occurring in a clear business setting. Those circumstances are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-16\">(ii) The distractions were substantial, such as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-17\">(a) A meeting or discussion at night clubs, theaters, and sporting events, or during essentially social gatherings such as cocktail parties, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-18\">(b) A meeting or discussion, if the taxpayer meets with a group which includes persons other than business associates, at places such as cocktail lounges, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, or at vacation resorts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-19\">If a clear business setting is not ordinarily to be established in situations in which the distractions to business discussion or activity were substantial,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this is even more clearly the case when the representatives of the taxpayer were not on the DAF during the fishing trips. Representatives of the taxpayer would at least make business discussion or activity possible. Indeed, Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.-274-2(c) (7) (1969) entitled \u201cExpendi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>tures generally considered not directly related,\u201d which we view as providing caveats in the interpretation of subpara-graphs (3) and (4), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-4\">(7) * * * Expenditures for entertainment, even if connected with the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, will generally be considered not directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, if the entertainment occurred under circumstances where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of trade or business. The following circumstances will generally be considered circumstances where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of a trade or business:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-6\">(i) The taxpayer was not present; * * -X-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">It should further be noted that the examples provided by subparagraph (4) as to what type of entertainment will be considered as occurring in a clear business setting further confirm the Government\u2019s position. After rejecting those settings where distractions were substantial, subparagraph (4) provides a favorable exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-9\">^4) * * * Expenditures made for the furtherance of a taxpayer\u2019s trade or business in providing a \u201chospitality room\u201d at a convention (described in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(b) of this section) at which goodwill is created <em>through display or discussion of the taxpayer\u2019s products, </em>will, however, be treated as directly related. * * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">The present case, however, submitted on stipulation, provides no indication that there was any such substitute for the presence of the taxpayer\u2019s representatives. While it is true that the absence of these representatives does not automatically require disallowance, it is clear that the example contemplates the situation in which the showing of the taxpayer\u2019s products in a reasonable display area may engender a business discussion or activity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-15\">Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.274-2(c)(4) (1969) provides another common example of what might satisfy the test of \u201cdirectly related\u201d under the category of \u201cclear business setting\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-17\">(4) * * * In addition, entertainment of a clear business nature .which occurred under circumstances where there was no meaningful personal or social relationship between the taxpayer and the recipients of the entertainment may be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting. For example, entertainment of business representatives and civic leaders at the opening of a new hotel or theatrical production, where the clear purpose of the taxpayer is to obtain business publicity rather than to create or maintain the goodwill of the recipients of the entertainment, would generally be considered to be in a clear business setting. * * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-18\">It is clear from the stipulation that the taxpayer in the ease before us cannot make an argument that the entertainment contains any inherent advertising advantages. In fact, the taxpayer is frank to admit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-19\">* * * A major purpose for Plaintiff\u2019s ownership and use of the \u201cDAF\u201d in the years in question was the maintenance of satisfactory business relationships with customers, suppliers, and business associates of the Plaintiff. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-21\">We find that the amounts in issue, not being directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, are precluded from deductibility by section 274 and the regulations thereunder.

A taxpayer, however, shall not be required to show that income or other business benefit actually resulted from each and every expenditure for which a deduction is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"A6vI\">(ii) During the entertainment period to which the expenditure related, the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting, negotiation, discussion, or other bona fide business transaction, other than entertainment, for the purpose of obtaining such income or other specific trade or business benefit (or, at the time the taxpayer made the expenditure or committed himself to the expenditure, it was reasonable for the taxpayer to expect that he would have done so, although such was not the case solely for reasons beyond the taxpayer\u2019s control).</p>\n<p id=\"AupB\">(iii) In light of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the principal character or aspect of the combined business and entertainment to which the expenditure related was the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business (or at the time the taxpayer made the expenditure or committed himself to the expenditure, it was reasonable for the taxpayer to expect that the active conduct of trade or business would have been the principal character or aspect of the entertainment, although such was not the case solely for reasons beyond the taxpayer\u2019s control). It is not necessary that more time be devoted to \u2022business than to entertainment to meet this requirement. The active conduct of trade or business is considered not to be the principal character or aspect of combined business and entertainment activity on hunting or fishing trips or on yachts and other pleasure boats unless the taxpayer clearly establishes to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"AXIN\">(iv) The expenditure was allocable to the taxpayer and a person or persons with whom the taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of trade or business during the entertainment or with whom the taxpayer establishes he would have engaged in such active conduct of trade or business if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>were not for circumstances beyond the taxpayer\u2019s control. For expenditures closely connected with directly related entertainment, see paragraph (d) (4) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"AmdO\">(4) <em>Expenditures in clear business setting. </em>An expenditure for entertainment shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business if it is established that the expenditure was for entertainment occurring in a clear business setting directly in furtherance of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. Generally, entertainment shall' not be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting unless the taxpayer clearly establishes that any recipient of the entertainment would have reasonably known that the taxpayer had no significant motive, in incurring the expenditure, other than directly furthering his trade or business. Objective rather than subjective standards will be determinative. Thus, entertainment which occurred under any circumstances described in subparagraph (7) (ii) of this paragraph ordinarily will not be considered as occurring in a clear business setting. Such entertainment will generally be considered to be socially rather than commercially motivated. Expenditures made for the furtherance of a taxpayer\u2019s trade or business in providing a \u201chospitality room\u201d at a convention (described in paragraph (d) (3) (i) <em>(b) </em>of this section) at which goodwill is created through display or discussion of the taxpayer\u2019s products, will, however, be treated as directly related. In addition, entertainment of a clear business nature which occurred under circumstances where there was no meaningful personal or social relationship between the taxpayer and the recipients of the entertainment may be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting. For example, entertainment of business representatives and civic leaders at the opening of a new hotel or theatrical production, where the clear purpose of the taxpayer is to obtain business publicity rather than to create or maintain the goodwill of the recipients of the entertainment, would generally be considered to be in a clear business setting. Also, entertainment which has the principal effect of a price rebate in connection with the sale of the taxpayer\u2019s products generally will be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting. Such would be the case, for example, if a taxpayer owning a hotel were to provide occasional free dinners at a hotel for a customer who patronized the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"azg-dedup-0\"><em>% </em>&gt;}s &gt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2b\">(7) <em>Expenditures generally considered not directly related. </em>Expenditures for entertainment, even if connected with the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, will generally be considered not directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, if the entertainment occurred under circumstances where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of trade or business.
