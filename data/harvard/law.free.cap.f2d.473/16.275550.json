Free and unfettered debate has been a cornerstone of our Republic for almost two hundred years. Any attempt to silence those who would speak, no matter how unpopular their opinions, no matter how controversial their views, must be met with immovable opposition by those who cherish our basic freedoms and hold them dear.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">[T]he peculiar evil of silencing the expression of opinion is that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as' the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">This is the setting in which we must consider the dispute arising from the refusal of the Federal Communications Commission (hereinafter \u201cthe Commission\u201d) to renew the broadcast license of .Brandywine-Main Line Radio, Inc. (hereinafter either \u201cBrandywine\u201d or \u201cWXUR\u201d) as licensee of radio stations WXUR and WXUR-FM, located in Media, Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet, even in light of the extremely high standard which we have set in this case, we must affirm the opinion of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">A. <em>Early Operation of WXUR </em>Brandywine was licensed to operate WXUR in 1962 by the Commission after a determination that such license would be beneficial in serving the public interest. WXUR-AM is a daytime standard broadcast station while WXUR-FM is a full-time station. The two stations are the sole stations in Media, Pennsylvania. As has been known to happen, Brandy-wine suffered financial reverses and the stockholders expressed an interest in selling the company in 1964. Contemporaneously, Station WVCH, located in Chester, Pennsylvania (a town which neighbors Media) elected to terminate broadcasting <em>20th Century Reformation Hour, </em>the program produced by Dr. Carl Mclntire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This event left Rev. Mc-lntire with no outlet for his program in the Philadelphia broadcast market. It is understandable, therefore, that when Dr. Mclntire learned that WXUR might be available, the Faith Theological Seminary<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (hereinafter \u201cthe Seminary\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>entered into an agreement to purchase Bradywine\u2019s stockholders\u2019 interests in October, 1964. The Seminary filed an application with the Commission seeking approval for the proposed purchase of Brandywine\u2019s stock and for Commission approval for the Seminary\u2019s proposed operation of WXUR.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">B. <em>The Transfer Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In its proposal to the Commission the Seminary stated that it would continue the station\u2019s general format of broadcasting entertainment, talk shows and short newscasts, and in addition, two one-hour religious programs would be broadcast each weekday;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the station would also broadcast religious programs until noon on Sunday.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The terms of the Seminary application sought Commission permission to operate \u201cfor the principal purpose of broadcasting the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, for the defense of the Gospel, and for the purposes set forth in the Charter of Incorporation.\u201d This application was not without opposition, however, as some fifteen community groups and a number of individuals and churches within the community made their opposition known to the Commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, The Commission noted that it also received communications from many individuals and churches who were proponents of the transfer. As the Commission noted \u201c[t]he complaints [opposing the transfer application] are based on the relationship to the transferee of the Reverend Carl Mclntire, President of the Board of Directors of Faith Theological Seminary, Inc.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The major concern of the opponents to the transfer was that the station would be incapable of providing for a balanced presentation of opposing views in light of Mclntire\u2019s connection with the Seminary and in view of his radio programs and publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The main thrust of the complaints concerning Rev. Mclntire, is that, in his radio programs and publications, he has made false and misleading statements and deliberate distortions of the facts relating to various public issues such as race relations, religious unity, foreign aid, etc.; that he has made \u201cintemperate\u201d attacks on other religious denominations and leaders, various organizations, governmental agencies, political figures and international organizations; and that such expressions are irresponsible and a divisive force in the community and help create a climate of fear, prejudice and distrust of democratic institutions. It is also alleged that, in light of his record of \u201cpartisan and extremist\u201d views on various public issues, he lacks the degree of social and public responsibility demanded of broadcast licensees \u2022 and that these views will carry over into the operation of the stations in view of his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>nection with the transferee. It is alleged, finally, that a serious question is thus raised, in light of his views, whether he is or will be able to bring about a balanced presentation of opposing views or whether he will place his personal views above the station\u2019s public interest obligations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">While the applications for transfer were still pending, the Commission communicated with the Seminary with regard to various aspects of the application and with particular interest as to whether station \u201cfacilities would be available to other faiths for the presentation of religious programs, and, if so, under what conditions or circumstances.\u201d The Seminary responded by filing an amendment to the original application which included an exhibit which stated the Seminary\u2019s intent to \u201cmake time available on an equal and non-discriminatory basis to all religious faiths requesting time for the presentation of religious programs.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To further insure balance in the area of religious broadcasting the Seminary\u2019s amendment provided for a half-hour program on Sunday to be known as <em>Interfaith Forum.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">C. <em>Commission Approval of Transfer</em></p>\n<p id=\"AO\">The Commission\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> granting the transfer application was forthcoming on March 19, 1965.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This opinion, known as the <em>Borst Decision, </em>summarized the nature of the complaints received<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> opposing the Seminary\u2019s application. The Commission continued by expressing that, as a matter of policy,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-15\">[t]he Commission is wisely forbidden from choosing \u201camong applicants upon the basis of their political, economic or social views . . .\u2019\u2019As Mr. Justice Douglas stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-17\">\u201cThe strength of our [broadcasting] system is in the dignity, resourcefulness and the intelligence of our people. Our confidence is in their ability to make the wisest choice. That system cannot flourish if regimentation takes hold.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqF\">The Decision noted that Dr. Mclntire represented that his relationship with WXUR would be as that of a broadcaster and that management decisions would be left to three other members of the Seminary\u2019s Board who would constitute the Board of Brandywine.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Despite all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>of this the Commission did consider the basic fear of the application\u2019s opponents that the station would be under Dr. Mc-Intire\u2019s influence and that it would not give full and fair treatment to divergent views on controversial issues as required by both standards of public interest and the Commission\u2019s fairness doctrine.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that a hearing on the transfer application was unnecessary because of the in-depth representations, contained in the application, to fully comply with the station\u2019s acknowledged obligations in the fairness arena.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The <em>Borst Decision </em>went to great lengths to reinforce and reiterate the transferee\u2019s duties and obligations under both the fairness doctrine and the personal attack corollary. The Commission took notice of Brandywine\u2019s written submission that equal opportunity would be afforded to opposing viewpoints on controversial public issues<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but nonetheless felt constrained to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-16\">[specifically direct attention to our ruling in Cullman Broadcasting Co., FCC 63-849 [requiring presentation of conflicting views at licensee expense if advocates willing to pay for broadcast time cannot be found] and to our personal attack principles (see <em>Public Notice of July 1, 1964, Applicability of the Fairness Doctrine, Part </em>E) the licensee is required to operate in accordance with these requirements, and unless immediately informed to the contrary, we take the licensee\u2019s representation to encompass these requirements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">The Commission expressed the view that Dr. Mclntire\u2019s record of offering free response time for either an opportunity to debate some issue or respond to some attack \u201c[would] not suffice to discharge the fairness responsibilities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>a licensee carrying the broadcasts in question.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Commission made every effort to assuage the fears of Brandywine\u2019s opponents that WXUR would become a medium over which Mclntire could express his personal views to the exclusion of the views of the listening public. The Commission reprinted the following detailed programming promise from the Brandywine application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">It will be the policy of the transferee to make time available on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis to all religious faiths. ... In other words, the same terms and conditions will be applicable to all faiths . as will be applicable to the religious faith . . . [of] the transferee. ... It will be the policy to make time available to religious faiths equally. However, ... a half hour will be available and utilized on Sundays for an Interfaith Forum program, in which ministers or representatives of different faiths will be invited to participate in round-table discussions of religious principles and tenets as related to current social problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">Every effort will be made to obtain varied participation from week to week to assure the greatest possible balance of views on the subjects of discussion. The transferee will invite the cooperation of recognized ministerial associations in the Greater Philadelphia area to present their recommendations as to participants and subjects of discussion on this program and in the event of failure to obtain such cooperation, the transferee will extend invitations to, and make sincere efforts to obtain participation by, individual churches and faiths in a manner which will assure, to the fullest extent possible, fair and equal representation of varying views.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">The Commission granted Brandy-wine\u2019s application for transfer with one final warning to the Seminary broadcast group.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">In reaching this determination, we have relied upon the specific representations by the transferee indicating awareness of a licensee\u2019s responsibilities. In any event, this grant is subject to the same conditions applicable to all broadcast grants . . . [including, among itemized conditions] that [Brandywine] will abide by the requirements of the fairness doctrine (see [Fairness Primer] ) .<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-18\">The new management began broadcast operations on April 29,1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-19\">D. <em>The License Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVh\">Brandywine\u2019s initial license period ran from April 29, 1965, through August 1, 1966.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is important for this court to examine WXUR\u2019s operations during this period as these operations are the actual predicate of the action before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-20\">When the new management group assumed broadcast control on April 29, 1965, they began making substantial changes in the station\u2019s program format, despite the fact that these changes were not indicated in the proposed program format as presented by the Seminary in the transfer application. In addition, one of the programs on which the Commission placed the greatest reliance in granting the application, <em>Interfaith Dialogue, </em>did not first appear on WXUR until November 28, 1965, some seven months after the Seminary assumed control of the station.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>enumerated a partial listing of programs which did appear in the early license period although not included in the Seminary\u2019s amended \u201cTypical Program Schedule.\u201d On May 3, 1965, WXUR broadcast <em>Lifeline </em>and <em>Manion Forum; Behind the Headlines </em>on May 4, 1965; <em>Howard Kershner\u2019s Commentary </em>on May 5, 1965; <em>Independent Americans </em>on May 6, 1965; <em>The Dan Smoot Report </em>on May 7, 1965; <em>Church League of America </em>on May 8, 1965; and <em>Christian Crusade </em>on June 14, 1965.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In this regard, it is interesting to note the admission by John H. Norris, the station\u2019s manager, that \u201cas soon as the F.C.C. said that [the Seminary] could take the Station over,\u201d he commenced making arrangements for broadcast of the above programs.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> All of these programs shared one common characteristic: they were devoted almost solely to coverage and discussion of viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. Personal attacks on the honesty, integrity and character of both groups and individuals were, unfortunately, not infrequent.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Seven months after the Seminary commenced operation of WXUR, the station was the subject of public condemnation by the Media Borough Council<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>and the House of Representatives of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Seminary\u2019s Broadcast Board attempted to soothe some of the ruffled nerves created by the <em>Freedom, of Speech </em>program,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and continued its attempts at rehabilitating the station\u2019s image by introducing <em>Inter-Faith Dialogue, </em>promised in the January 1965 amendment to Brandywine\u2019s transfer application, on November 28, 1965.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">WXUR was required to file its renewal application by early May, 1966. They were sent the necessary \u201crenewal packet\u201d early in 1966 by the Commission. At this time WXUR was also continuing to receive more specific communications from the Commission relating to complaints it had received from individuals, community groups and local governmental bodies. The record discloses that WXUR made attempts at this time to once again enhance its public image by attempting to produce several programs containing contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tance. Each of these programs were carefully detailed in Brandywine\u2019s renewal application filed May 3, 1966.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> That application would have, if granted, provided Brandywine a license for a three-year period from August 1, 1966, through July 31, 1969. Based on Bran-dywine\u2019s operating record from March 17, 1965, through the May 3, 1966, filing date, nineteen parties opposed the renewal application and urged the Commission to deny Brandywine\u2019s application.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This opposition was in the form of a joint pleading filed with the Commission on July 19, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">After considering the submissions of the parties the Commission found that substantial questions did exist as to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">whether the applicant has met the conditions set forth in the Commission\u2019s . . . [Transfer Order] during its license period from April 29, 1965 to August 1, 1966; . . . whether the applicant fully and candidly advised the Commission of its program plans in connection with its [transfer] application . ; the applicant\u2019s efforts to comply with the Commission\u2019s Fairness Doctrine, including the personal attack principle; and whether the applicant has used the facilities of its stations to serve the sectarian and political views of its principals and to raise funds for their support rather than to serve the community generally, and whether this was misrepresented to the Commission in its application for acquisition of control of these stations. In the latter connection, the Commission notes the charges that the applicant has operated stations WXUR and WXUR-FM, as a divisive force in the community by disparaging racial and religious groups and by castigating and vilifying persons and groups espousing views on public controversial issues different from those of the applicant.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG7\">The Commission adopted a number of issues for hearing of which four remain pertinent to these proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">\u2022 To determine whether the applicant failed to inform the Commission fully of its program plans in connection with its application for acquisition of control of Stations WXUR and WXUR-FM;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">\u2022 To determine whether the applicant has complied with the Fairness Doctrine and Section 315 of the Act by affording a reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance during its license period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">\u2022 To determine whether during its license period the applicant has complied with the personal attack principle of the Fairness Doctrine by furnishing copies of pertinent tapes, continuities or summaries to persons or groups attacked, with spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>cific offers of the stations\u2019 facilities for responses, where discussions of controversial public issues have involved personal attacks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsH_\">To determine whether the applicant in connection with its application for transfer of control of Stations WXUR and WXUR-FM misrepresented to the Commission its program plans.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The Commission designated the WXUR renewal application for hearing stating that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">unable to determine that a grant of these renewal applications would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In order to insure that a full record is made detailing all pertinent and relevant facts concerning the applicant\u2019s operations of stations WXUR and WXUR-FM and its representations concerning such application, an evidentiary hearing is required.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-23\">E. <em>The Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-24\">Hearing Examiner H. Gifford Irion called the evidentiary hearing to order on October 2, 1967, in Media, Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The hearings recessed for over three months on December 15, 1967, after the bulk of the Intervenor\u2019s and Broadcast Bureau\u2019s evidence had been submitted, to allow Brandywine to prepare its case. The Brandywine presentation began on March 20, 1968.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The record of the hearings closed on June 26, 1968, after a compilation of a nearly 8,000 page record and several hundred exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">F. <em>The Initial Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Hearing Examiner Irion released his Initial Decision on December 13, 1968. This very lengthy examination of the case <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> was most thorough with regard to findings of fact, however, the high quality of fact finding led the examiner to only irrational conclusions and findings of law. Intervenors have termed this decision \u201ca whitewash of Brandywine\u2019s performance as a licensee\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u2014 this court must concur in that assessment. Several examples will make this clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">1. <em>Presentation of Contrasting Viewpoints on Controversial Issues. </em>Hearing Examiner Irion found that WXUR should be excused from complying with the fairness doctrine because of the small staff retained by the station. Secondly, he found that programming on WXUR was balanced by the programming of other licensees in the Philadelphia market. Both of these conclusions are clearly erroneous. The fairness doctrine applies to <em>all </em>licensees, while area wide programming is not a valid consideration in determining whether a licensee has complied with the fairness requirements. <em>See </em>Green v. F. C. C.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">2. <em>Personal Attack Violations. </em>The Examiner made numerous findings against WXUR for failure to comply with the personal attack principle of the fairness doctrine. However, his conclusions fail to recommend any sanctions for these numerous violations. It is not necessary for this court to prepare a line-by-line analysis and refutation of the Examiner\u2019s decision; nor would it be prudent for us to do so as the Commission has issued its own detailed opinion reversing the Examiner. Nonetheless we are sufficiently disturbed by the Examiner\u2019s final conclusion to pause for a moment to reflect and comment. Examiner Irion concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-16\">Thus the decision must be shaped by ultimate objectives rather than by isolated instances of error. This will not be an invitation to carelessness or disregard of the ethical principles involved in the personal attack rules since punishment by forfeiture will always await the transgressor but, in the unusual circumstances of this ease, Draconian justice is inadvisable.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">It is clear to this court, as it was to the Commission, that the Examiner began his herculean opinion by determining both his conclusion and ultimate disposition of this case. Rather than suiting his conclusions to \u201clet the punishment fit the crime\u201d, he chose to adopt a benevolent stance ill-suited to the facts in this case. The <em>Initial Decision </em>allows appearance to tyrannize over truth. The facts surrounding Brandywine\u2019s operation of WXUR are neither so pliant nor sufficiently malleable to allow for the conclusions of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The opinion did contain a number of findings adverse to Brandywine; however, the licensee failed to file exceptions as to any of these matters.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Both intervenors and the Broadcast Bureau of the Commission filed extensive exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">G. <em>The Commission\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkT\">The Commission refused to adopt the Hearing Examiner\u2019s <em>Initial Opinion </em>and adopted its own opinion on July 7, 1970 in which it denied the licensee\u2019s application for renewal after an independent review of the record. In its review the Commission drew adverse conclusions with reference to Brandywine\u2019s compliance with the fairness doctrine,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> compliance with the personal attack principle <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and also with reference to the manner in which Brandywine misrepresented its program plans to the Commission.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Let us examine the Commission\u2019s reasoning in each area separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">1. <em>The Fairness Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">The fairness doctrine was, in the Commission\u2019s view, the central aspect of the litigation. The reason for this is axiomatic \u2014 prior to issuing Brandy-wine\u2019s initial license a tremendous amount of concern was expressed to the Commission by numerous parties, each fearing that WXUR would fail to comply with the doctrine. Brandywine\u2019s response to these fears was clear and apparently forthright \u2014 it had promised at the time of the transfer application to fully comply with the doctrine.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In point of fact, the decision of the Commission had \u201creiterated the necessity that a licensee serve the public interest by adherence to the Fairness Doctrine, including the personal attack principle.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArV\">The Commission proceeded to review the record, including fifteen days of monitored broadcasts,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and concluded \u201cthat Brandywine under its new ownership did not make reasonable efforts to comply with the Fairness Doctrine during the license period.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Commission discovered, as a result of studying the submissions based on the monitored periods, that WXUR had failed to comply in a number of instances in which one side of an issue was broadcast</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">during these periods without presenting any opposing viewpoints on any but one of these issues, and with an insignificant presentation on that issue, despite the fact that such controversial issue programming was a substantial part of WXUR\u2019s total programming.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">Additionally, the Commission found that WXUR had failed to affirmatively come forth with the requisite responsive evidence necessary to illustrate Brandy-wine\u2019s efforts to assure compliance with both the fairness doctrine and the personal attack principles, as promised in the initial transfer application. The Commission found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-14\">Brandywine failed to establish any regular procedure for previewing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>monitoring or reviewing its broadcasts, and thus did not regularly know what views were being presented on controversial issues of public importance. Despite the <em>prima facie </em>evidence presented by the other parties on this issue, Brandywine did not respond with any further review of its treatment of such controversial issues, either for the full license period or any smaller reasonable segment of time. Furthermore it made no showing of public announcements inviting the presentation of contrasting views at the times the issues in Appendix A (or others) were discussed, nor of any other adequate action to encourage the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on these issues.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Brandywine relies upon certain call-in and interview programs as meeting its fairness obligations. However, our review of the record shows that these programs were inadequate to this purpose because they either were not directed at obtaining opposing views on the issues (i.e., speakers were not secured or presented in connection with these issues), or were so conducted as to discourage the presentation of views not shared by their moderators.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">WXUR contended that Rev. Mclntire had undertaken substantive efforts to assure compliance with the fairness doctrine. This submission took the form of letters which evidenced unaccepted invitations to appear on the <em>20th Century Reformation Hour. </em>The Commission rejected this would-be indicia of compli-anee since \u201cthese were not invitations by the licensee and, more important, they do not constitute adequate invitations to present contrasting views on the issues set forth in Appendix A.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Similarly, the Commission rejected the suggestion that the licensee\u2019s fairness obligations could be met by the existence of a daily one-hour call-in program, entitled <em>Freedom of Speech, </em>on which a listener could comment briefly on any topic he wished.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d the Commission stated, \u201cits operation demonstrates a failure to provide a fair forum by a licensee specifically on notice of its responsibilities in the fairness area.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This was especially true since, from the inception of the program until the replacement of Thomas Livezey as moderator, after the adverse resolution of the Media Borough Council,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> the program</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWE\">was conducted so as to discourage viewpoints with which [the moderator], disagreed. From the outset he both cut off and insulted callers who did not share his views. This conduct, for which Brandywine is of course responsible, is patently inconsistent with the requirement of fairness.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Likewise, the Commission rejected two other daily programs as examples of efforts to provide the required balance. The first of these was <em>Delaware County </em>Today<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> on which the moderator dealt with those opposed to his views by \u201crough[ing them] up\u201d and by \u201cforc[ing them] to give their views in an antagonistic setting.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The second program on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>which WXUR sought to rely was <em>Radio Free </em>Philadelphia<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The commencement of this program was shortly after Brandywine filed its renewal application with the Commission and shortly prior to the filing of the petitions to deny. Therefore, the program had a very brief period of relevance to this proceeding.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The Commission indicated that a detailed discussion of these programs and issues was necessary</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aii\">both because they are critical to resolution of the fairness issue in this case and because the Examiner neither tied his view that WXUR had put on all shades of the political spectrum to the station\u2019s treatment of particular controversial issues nor made a distinction between the pre- and post-renewal date programming. <em>We are not concerned with the social, political, or religious philosophy of the licensee or any person using its facilities. </em>Our interest is in the right of the public to a reasonable opportunity to hear contrasting views on controversial issues; whether this right has been accorded by the licensee can be determined only in the context of issues, not by generalized political labels. In the face of particular attention being drawn to the necessity for fairness at the time control of the station was transferred, the record shows no reasonable attempt to meet the station\u2019s obligations in this area. See Editorializing by\u2019 Broadcast Licensees, 13 FCC 1246 (1949).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiU\">The Commission refused to give weight to the Examiner\u2019s conclusion that WXUR\u2019s small staff in some way exculpated the station for its failure to achieve balance in fairness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">The objective of the Fairness Doctrine is to protect the listeners\u2019 right of access to information about all sides of controversial issues of public importance. No showing has been made of inability to comply with fairness requirements because of financial limitations.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The Commission was also unmoved by Brandywine\u2019s \u25a0 \u201calleged delegation of Fairness Doctrine responsibilities to the sponsors or producers of the programs it broadcast. (Tr. 7874-75).\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">Fairness Doctrine responsibilities may not be delegated. Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. at 1248; see also \u201cLiving Should Be Fun,\u201d 33 F.C.C. 101, 107 (1962) [T]he ultimate responsibility for compliance with the Fairness Doctrine rests with the licensee.Norris [the General Manager] must have known this if he understood the Doctrine as thoroughly as he claimed. (See Tr. 1664-65 and 1880-82.) In any event, we have not found that any delegee adequately performed these functions.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">The Commission concluded its consideration of this topic by finding that Bran-dywine \u201cwas indifferent to its affirmative obligation \u2018to encourage and implement the broadcast of all sides of controversial public issues\u2019 (paragraph 9, Editorializing by Broadcast .Licensees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>13 F.C.C. at 1251), and indeed it was hostile to such broadcasts.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">2. <em>Personal Attack Principle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">It was clear to the Commission, as it was to Examiner Irion, that WXUR \u201crepeatedly violated the personal attack principle\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> This was in spite of specific instructions from the Commission to Brandywine at the time that the initial transfer application was approved. This court need not recount these violations seriatim as the Commission has already done so for us.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The Commission continued by noting that the Examiner had found additional attacks, as to which no exceptions were taken by Brandywine; however, the Commission found it unnecessary to \u201cadopt all of the Examiner\u2019s findings in this respect,\u201d because recitation of \u201cindisputable examples is sufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Subsequent to the attacks in issue in the case at bar the personal attack principle was codified into a formal rule.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Under the terms of the rule the Commission exempted bona-fide newscasts, bona-fide interviews, and on-the-spot coverage of bona-fide news events from the earlier reply requirements of the principle. Examination discloses that none of these exemptions prove applicable to the attacks broadcast by Brandy-wine and hence, \u201cBrandywine was obligated to comply with the personal attack principle in regard to each one of the personal attacks.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In each case the Commission found that Brandywine failed to give notice to the party attacked as required; they failed to send the required copies of transcripts, tapes or summaries; and similarly, they failed to offer an opportunity to reply to the aggrieved party as required. More dispositive, however, was the fact that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">Brandywine had not established any procedures to insure compliance. (Tr. 1662-1670.) For example, Brandy-wine did not arrange to know either before or at the time of broadcast whether a given broadcast contained any personal attacks. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Bran-dywine was therefore incapable of sending transcripts, tapes or summaries of the broadcasts to those attacked either prior to or at the time of the broadcast.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Again, the station\u2019s argument to the effect that its small staff excused it from performing in this area was unpersuasive. The Examiner was willing to excuse WXUR since those attacked often showed no concern; however, the principle was never geared at protecting persons from personal abuse, but rather \u201cto enable the listening public to hear expositions of the various positions taken by responsible individuals and groups on important disputed issues.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The Commission concluded that \u201cBrandywine simply ignored its plain duty to the public\u201d and that this conduct was \u201cparticularly reprehensible in light of the fact that the licensee had been cautioned at the outset concerning its duties in this area.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">3. <em>Representations as to Programming</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The Commission noted that an independent basis for denying the Brandy-wine renewal application was WXUR\u2019s utter failure to live up to its original representations concerning its program plans. The much-touted <em>Interfaith </em>Forum,<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> which was designed to promote open discussion concerning matters of modern-day religion, did not appear until November 28, 1965, ten days after the Media Borough Council\u2019s resolution, despite the fact that the program was promised specifically in Brandywine\u2019s January 25, 1965 transfer application amendment.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> When <em>Interfaith Forum </em>did finally make its belated debut it did not fulfill its advertised purpose to \u201c \u2018make every effort\u2019 to get a varied participation.\u201d The show never took the form of the promised round-table discussion but was an interview show on which students or faculty of the Faith Theological Seminary simply interviewed fellow seminarians. Brandywine sought to explain this away by claiming that the Greater Philadelphia Council of Churches had deliberately boycotted the program; yet, there is no support for this proposition in the record.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">Brandywine\u2019s actual programming practices were far more objectionable than the singular failure of <em>Inter faith Forum </em>to appear. From the very inception of Brandywine\u2019s control of WXUR there was a marked deviation from the original programming representations made to the Commission. Between April 29, 1965 and May 8, 1965 WXUR replaced a number of promised programs, mostly classified as \u201centertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ment,\u201d with seven new programs.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The Commission found, and logic dictates that this court agree, that the plans for each of these programs predated the actual transfer. These changes must be viewed as substantial inasmuch as they differed significantly from those programs which they were replacing and were a departure from the general format promised in the Brandywine transfer application: <em>i. e., </em>programming designed \u201cfor the purpose of broadcasting the Gospel of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for the defense of the Gospel and for the purposes set forth in the Seminary\u2019s Charter of Incorporation.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiEE\">The Commission refused to accept station manager Norris\u2019 representation that these new programs, for which sponsors allegedly purchased time from WXUR, were born of economic necessity in response to an alleged boycott on the part of commercial advertisers. Despite Brandywine\u2019s assertion that this action was in anticipation of the boycott, seven of the eight programs listed in footnote 80 were on the air between four and nine days after Brandywine\u2019s assumption of control.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Three of these programs were sponsored by an organization called the \u201cAmerican Patriotic News\u201d, which never paid any sponsorship fees to WXUR. As Norris was a trustee of the \u201cAmerican Patriotic News\u201d and station manager of WXUR, it is safe to assume that he was aware that these three programs were generating no income. The Commission concluded that the Faith Theological Seminary</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">[failed to apprise us] fully concerning program plans, and also a significant departure from an express representation concerning the fair treatment of all religious faiths [sic]. In view of the circumstances, these failures can not be laid to inadvertence. They must be considered a conscious course of conduct.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The Commission closed its 23-page opinion by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">We conclude upon an evaluation of all the relevant and material evidence contained in the hearing record, that renewals of the WXUR and WXUR-FM licenses should not be granted. The record demonstrates that Brandy-wine failed to provide reasonable opportunities for the presentation of contrasting views on controversial issues of public importance, that it ignored the personal attack principle of the Fairness Doctrine, that the applicant\u2019s representations as to the manner in which the station would be operated were not adhered to, that no adequate efforts were made to keep the station attuned to the community\u2019s or area\u2019s needs and interests, and that no showing has been made that it was in fact, so attuned. <em>Any one of these violations would alone be sufficient to require denying the renewals here, and the violations are rendered even more serious by the fact that we carefully drew the Seminary\u2019s attention to a licensee\u2019s responsibilities before we approved transfer of the stations to its ownership and </em>control.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">On August 6, 1970 Brandywine filed a motion to reconsider with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>H. <em>Commission\u2019s Opinion on Reconsideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The Commission released its memorandum Opinion and Order<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> denying Brandywine\u2019s request for reconsideration on February 11, 1971. The central theme raised by Brandywine constituted an assertion that the Commission\u2019s July Decision extended the concept of the fairness doctrine to an unconstitutional brink in that the July Decision was predicated upon \u201ca disapproval of the content of the programs on WXUR.\u201d The Commission commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">Our decision was based solely upon fairness concepts whose constitutional validity has been sustained by the Supreme Court in Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. F. C. C., 395 U.S. 367 [89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371] (1969) and in no sense upon any Commission attitude toward the content of any view expressed over Brandywine\u2019s facilities.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The Commission expressed the view that Brandywine\u2019s failure to meet the affirmative duty set forth in Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. F. C. C.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> to \u201coffer to make available a reasonable amount of broadcast time to those who have a view different from that which has already been expressed on his station\u201d,<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> was not beyond the pale of constitutional reach by the Commission, merely by demonstrating the existence of offers of time during which the proponents of contrasting views were harassed. The Commission stressed that this was a matter of presentation and not one of content.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">[W]e did not hold that there was anything wrong <em>per se' </em>in harassing conduct by a moderator, but only that Brandywine could not rely for its achievement of fairness upon a program where one side was singled out for harassment.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqP6\">The Commission proceeded to consider each of the issues which Brandywine raised and concluded by reaffirming the majority of its earlier views. Let us consider each issue separately as we did with regard to the <em>July Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">1. <em>The Fairness Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"an-dedup-0\">In its petition for reconsideration Brandywine in no way challenged the Commission\u2019s earlier finding that despite Brandywine\u2019s initial representation and despite the Commission\u2019s strong warning in the transfer decision, \u201cBran-dywine had taken no steps to encourage the presentation of contrasting views on several issues of public importance where it had presented one side on each of these issues.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Brandywine contended that it had broadcast material on certain news, interview, and call-in shows which, although never considered by the Commission, did satisfy the fairness doctrine requirements as to these issues. The Commission began by reminding the licensee that its affirmative duties in the fairness arena would not be satisfied</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-18\">by leaving the expression of contrasting views to such happenstance as the remarks of an unknown person on a call-in program, or to the possibility that a pertinent question will be asked on a general interview program unan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>nounced as dealing with any particular issue and not presenting a guest selected as a responsible spokesman of a contrasting view.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APQ\">The Commission did not stop at this juncture but rather continued on to reexamine the material cited by petitioners and determined that this material was not \u201can expression of conflicting viewpoints in a reasonable ratio which might make \u2022 a denial of renewal inappropriate.\u201d <footnotemark><em>92</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Commission commenced with an evidentiary point \u2014 -the affirmative cases presented by the inter-venors and the Broadcast Bureau, based on the two weeks of monitored programming, placed an evidentiary burden on Brandywine which could not be satisfied merely by demonstrating \u201csome instances of the expression of opposing views in other time periods without also taking account of any further expression of the original views in such other time periods.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Brandywine failed to produce any evidence concerning what was broadcast during the periods they cited to the Commission except for those specific matters on which Brandywine relied. The Commission went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">In the face of the <em>prima, facie </em>showing that its treatment of certain issues was unfair, Brandywine clearly was required to show how it encouraged the presentation of opposing views, or at least that the presentation of such views constituted a reasonable proportion to the time devoted to the issues, either throughout the license period or, at the minimum, during some other representative period of time. . Therefore, we adhere to our conclusion that Brandywine failed not only to seek some balance of opposing views but to carry opposing views in any fair ratio.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Brandywine attempted to have the Commission exclude certain broadcast statements by Dr. Mclntire since they were \u201creligious.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The decision on which this attempt was founded was without relevance. The <em>Murray Letter, </em>on which Brandywine sought to rely, only held that devotional services were not a controversial issue within the scope and meaning of the fairness doctrine; but \u201c[t]he fairness doctrine extends to all expressions of views on controversial issues of public importance, whether or not they may be deemed religious views by some persons.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> This holding, the Commission stated, \u201cis no more an abridgement of freedom of religion than of freedom of speech, an issue already decided by the Supreme Court in <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., </em>supra.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AnO\">Brandywine charged that the Commission had neglected to consider various invitations to certain spokesmen. The Commission replied by commenting that \u201cBrandywine mistakes our disagreement with its arguments for failure to consider them.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> The Commission once again detailed its reasons for finding the Brandywine invitations inadequate. It also discounted Mclntire\u2019s sundry invitations since they did not emanate from the licensee as the law requires. The Commission noted that its action was based primarily on the inadequacy of the various offers and once again spoke to Brandywine's practice of delegating its responsibilities under the fairness doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">Certainly if Dr. Mclntire had made adequate invitations corresponding to the issues and had succeeded in getting spokesmen with opposing viewpoints to speak on his program, Brandywine would have been able to rely upon this success in complying with the fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>doctrine. However, the converse does not obtain. Brandywine cannot absolve itself from failure to comply by merely pointing to Dr. Mclntire\u2019s abortive efforts. Dr. Mclntire\u2019s inadequate invitations and failure to get acceptances do not discharge Brandy-wine from its fairness duties. As we stated in the decision, \u201cthe ultimate responsibility of compliance with the fairness doctrine rests with the licensee.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">On the positive side of the scale, the Commission decided that based on materials broadcast outside of the monitored weeks that WXUR \u201cshould be given the benefit of the doubt\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> with regard to its coverage of the Vietnam War issue. However, the Commission found that with reference to issues relating to federal administration policy and activities, civil rights and liberties, United States foreign relations, the proposed New Jersey group defamation law, major news media, and loyalty of federal officials, that the citations submitted by Brandy-wine were either inadequate, inaccurate, lacking or insufficient in light of the balance of one-sided broadcast presentation.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">2. <em>Personal Attack Principle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Brandywine attempted to escape the evidentiary burden placed on it by the Commission by claiming that the standards imposed by the Commission were too vague. The Commission dealt with this allegation by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\">Brandywine contends that our judgment that it carried personal attacks without notifying the persons attacked of their right to respond is without evidentiary support and that we have no clear definition of \u201chonesty, character, integrity or like personal qualities\u201d against which to measure Bran-dywine\u2019s actions. However, the Supreme Court has sustained the rules against the charge of vagueness in <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., supra, </em>and we think that the attacks made over WXUR (see Appendix B of our decision) were such that no reasonable doubt exists as to their proper characterization. Brandywine further charges that we have not explained why the attacks were not made during exempt news broadcasts. Putting aside the fact that Brandywine does not in fact assert that the attacks were made during bona fide news programs \u2014something it should do if it believes we were in error \u2014 we think it plain that they were not. Brandywine did not introduce these programs when they were broadcast as newscasts and they consisted entirely of comments not commonly considered to be news reporting.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">In addition, the Commission rejected Brandywine\u2019s argument that an adverse finding with respect to the personal attack principle was inconsistent with other Commission rulings in this area.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The Commission also ruled that a 1969 finding by its Broadcast Bureau was not inconsistent with its ruling concerning certain remarks, not at issue in the case, broadcast by Brandywine. The Commission held the 1969 staff decision to be correct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">In any event, what is important here is not whether there may be a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the staff ruling in another situation, but rather whether there was such a doubt about the comments in this case. We do not believe that Brandywine could have had such a doubt; nevertheless, it failed to follow the requirements of the rules.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aep\">The final contention in this area, which the Commission also rejected, was that the Commission\u2019s decision constituted an unconstitutional <em>ex post facto </em>approach to the July, 1967 personal attack rules. The reason that the Commission rejected this contention was that the rules codified precepts which were already in effect and which Brandywine had specifically been made aware of by the Commission\u2019s transfer order.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">3. <em>Representations Concerning Program Plans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Once again, the Commission stressed that its concern was not with title changes being made to the program schedule but to Brandywine\u2019s \u201cwillingness to withhold [its] intentions with respect to a substantial amount of programming.\u201d<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> The action taken against Brandywine had nothing to do with program content; it was aimed against WXUR solely because of its failure to \u201ccandidly advise us and the public of its intentions.\u201d <footnotemark>107</footnotemark> The Commission determined that its concern was not based on WXUR\u2019s motive but rather its conduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">\u201cThe fact of concealment may be more significant than the facts concealed. The willingness to deceive a regulatory body may be disclosed by immaterial and useless deceptions as well as by material and persuasive ones.\u201d F. C. C. v. WOKO, Inc., 329 U.S. 223, 227, 67 S.Ct. 213, 215, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946).<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">The Commission concluded the <em>February Decision </em>by deleting its adverse findings in the <em>July Decision </em>as to the issue of ascertainment of community needs<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> and found, still again, \u201cthat Brandywine is not entitled to renewal of licenses of WXUR and WXUR-FM.\u201d <footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AId\">Brandywine has taken the instant appeal from these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">II. THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\"> The requirements of the fairness doctrine are by no means regulations of recent advent. Not only is the concept of the doctrine an established historical fact in the broadcast industry but the doctrine itself has been little changed over the years. The purpose of the doctrine is to assure that when controversial issues of public importance are aired on radio and television frequencies that fair coverage be given to both sides of issues presented. The doctrine is a \u201ccommon law development\u201d which has evolved from a long line of rulings by the Commission on a case by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>case basis. As Justice White pointed out in <em>Red Lion, </em>the doctrine \u201cis distinct from the statutory requirement of \u00a7 815 of the Communications Act<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> that equal time be allotted all qualified candidates for public office.\u201d <footnotemark>112</footnotemark> In 1967 the Commission codified two corollaries of the doctrine \u2014 the personal attack doctrine and the rules relating to political editorializing.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Red Lion </em>went to great lengths at setting out the history of the birth of the fairness doctrine and its related regulations. We shall review that material here because of its critical importance to the case at bar.-</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The government was not always engaged in the regulation of broadcast frequencies. In fact, it was only out of dire necessity and sheer confusion, accompanied by utter chaos, that the government entered into a role of broadcast regulation.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Indeed, it was not until 1927 that responsibility for the assignment and allocation of radio frequencies was assumed by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">It quickly became apparent that broadcast frequencies constituted a scarce resource whose use could be regulated and rationalized only by the Government. Without government control, the medium would be of little use because of the cacaphony of competing voices, none of which could be clearly and predictably heard.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sequently, the Federal Radio Commission was established to allocate frequencies among competing applicants in a manner responsive to the public \u201cconvenience, interest, or necessity.\u201d <footnotemark>116</footnotemark> The Court continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Very shortly thereafter the Commission expressed its view that the \u201cpublic interest requires ample play for the free and fair competition of opposing views, and the commission believes that the principle applies to all discussions of issues of importance to the public.\u201d Great Lakes Broadcasting Co., 3 F.R.C.Ann. Rep. 32, 33 (1929), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 59 App.D.C. 197, 37 F.2d 993, cert. dismissed, 281 U.S. 706, 50 S.Ct. 467, 74 L.Ed. 1129 (1930). This doctrine was applied through denial of license renewals or construction permits, both by the FRC, Trinity Methodist Church, South v. FRC, 61 App. D.C. 311, 62 F.2d 850 (1932), cert. denied, 288 U.S. 599, 53 S.Ct. 317, 77 L.

After an extended period during which the licensee was obliged not only to cover and to cover fairly the views of others, but also to refrain from expressing his own personal views, Mayflower Broadcasting Corp., 8 F.C.C. 333 (1940), the latter limitation on the licensee was abandoned and the doctrine developed into its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">There is a two fold duty laid down by the FCC\u2019s decisions and described by the 1949 Report on Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. 1246 (1949). The broadcaster must give adequate coverage to public issues, United Broadcasting Co., 10 F. C.C. 515 (1945), and coverage must be fair in that it accurately reflects the opposing views.

As much as our historical study <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>shows a need for this regulation, there has been a concomitant need for a fairness doctrine. America has turned away from its town meeting and processes of rural decision making. This is the electronic age \u2014 an age in which communications systems relay information to an eager public in fractions of milliseconds. Information has become the stock and trade of our informed public. So too has our method of getting information changed in the last half century. We are shifting our emphasis from the printed media to the electronic media. Radio and television consume massive portions of America\u2019s time. Because of this we must assume that the public be given access to varied information so that they may remain an intelligent and viable group \u2014 free to choose from the options available to them \u2014 free to make a choice. In a recent appearance before the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Nicholas Johnson, a Commissioner of the F.C.C., expressed the need of the American people for which the Commission has undertaken to provide. This parable states the problems involved so succinctly that we reprint it in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">Once upon a time there was a nation great in ideals and industrialization. It had businesses everywhere \u2014 and unsurpassed military might. Yet its greatest strength lay in its ideological foundation. This nation professed to be governed by the consent of its citizens. To ensure the successful functioning of this unique experiment in government, free education, libraries and full information were provided to all, so that this nation\u2019s two-hundred million governors, through wide-open debate, might govern themselves wisely. But as the years slipped by, the people spent more and more of their time in their air conditioned homes watching television, and less and less time listening to speakers in the public parks, attending town meetings, and reading handbills on the streets. Meanwhile, the number and importance of crucial issues were growing, and the need for well informed governors became paramount. Thus it was the great debate about the great debate began.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">Everyone had his own theory of how to reverse this trend and return the democratic dialogue to the people, who were all at home watching their television sets. Some advocated letters, petitions, press conferences and picketing, but they had little success. Attention shifted to those who advocated bombing, burning, shooting and looting, because before and after the televising of such activities it was usually possible to present a short message, however distorted, concerning the merits of the controversy that generated such outrageous conduct. Then a third group came along. It said, \u201cLet us simply go to the broadcasters peacefully, ask them for the time to present our concerns \u2014 we will even pay them.\u201d But the broadcasters politely explained that there was no time available for the discussion of public issues \u2014 such as war, life and politics \u2014 because the time all had to be used for programs and announcements necessary to the very difficult but essential task of inducing consumers to buy useless, joyless, and sometimes harmful products. Yet these patient and patriotic students, businessmen, and Senators were not deterred. They continued to preach the doctrine of \u201cworking within the system.\u201d \u201cThe Government,\u201d they said, \u201cwill treat us fairly. There is reason and justice in our land. Surely a democratic people need not be violent to be heard.\u201d And so it was that they came to the Federal Communications Commission . . . . <footnotemark>118</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In the past months this court, and several other circuit courts, have examined the fairness doctrine on several oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>casions, sometimes at great lengths.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> It is clear to this court, therefore, that what we are about to state, with reference to the law in this area, is merely repetitive of our prior efforts. Nothing which we state here is new; however, it is our hope that through our efforts we will be able to instruct appellants as to the proper standard of the law and that we will allay any lingering doubts that appellants may have as to our consideration of the pertinent authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The Commission\u2019s most recent elaboration on the fairness doctrine came following the <em>Red Lion </em>decision. In In the Matter of Obligations of Broadcast Licensees Under the Fairness Doctrine<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> the Commission posited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">The fairness doctrine was evolved as a policy under the public interest standard in a series of cases, given its definitive policy statement in the Commission\u2019s 1949 Editorializing Report (13 F.C.C. 1246), and codified into the Communications Act of 1959. See section 315(a), 47 U.S.C. 315(a); Red Lion Broadcasting Company, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, <em>supra. </em>It requires the broadcast licensee to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. The Commission early determined that if the fairness doctrine were to achieve its most salutary purpose, an affirmative obligation in this respect must be imposed upon the licensee ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\"># * * . * *\u25a0 -\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">The Commission\u2019s general approach to this facet of the fairness doctrine is set forth in a 1964 ruling, Letter to Mid-Florida Television Corporation, 40 F.C.C. 620, 621 (1964) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">The Commission does not seek to establish a rigid formula for compliance with the fairness doctrine. The mechanics of achieving fairness will necessarily vary with the circumstances, and it is within the discretion of each licensee, acting in good faith, to choose an appropriate method of implementing the policy to aid and encourage expression of contrasting viewpoints. Our experience indicates that licensees have chosen a variety of methods, and often combinations of various methods .<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">This court made it clear in Democratic National Committee v. F. C. C. that \u201c[t]he importance of the fairness doctrine is neither academic nor is it an administrative nicety. As the Commission stated: \u2018The keystone of the fairness doctrine and of the public interest is the right of the public to be informed \u2014 to have presented to it the \u201cconflicting views of issues of public importance\u201d.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>122</footnotemark> The proposition of the fairness doctrine is easy to understand, and to accept, when one considers that because of the finite number of broadcast frequencies available \u201cthey have been necessarily considered a public trust. Every licensee who is fortunate in obtain-, ing a license in mandated to operate in the public interest and has assumed the obligation of presenting important public questions fairly and without bias.\u201d <footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Because of the evident importance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>doctrine \u201cit is the manifest intention of the Commission to maintain it as a viable instrument in protecting the right of the public to be fully informed on controversial issues.\u201d <footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The fairness doctrine is not subject to a formulistic application. Meeting the obligations can only be achieved by seeking out balance in broadcast coverage. Precise mathematic equality is neither required nor desirable. The cornerstone of the doctrine is good faith and licensee discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">[T]he licensee, in applying the fair-, ness doctrine, is called upon to make reasonable judgments in good faith on the facts of each situation \u2014 as to whether a controversial issue of public importance is involved, as to what viewpoints have been or should be presented, as to the format and spokesmen to present the viewpoints, and all the other facets of such programming.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">This is an area in which the Commission has exercised a substantial degree of restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">In passing on any complaint in this area, the Commission\u2019s role is not to substitute its judgment for that of the licensee as to any of the above programming decisions, but rather to determine whether the licensee can be said to have acted reasonably and in good faith. There is thus room for considerably more discretion on the part of the licensee under the fairness doctrine than under the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">Licensees seeking to meet the requirements imposed by the doctrine must be mindful of Congressional intent. It was never intended by either Congress, or the Commission, that the doctrine work toward suppression of the discussion of controversial issues. To the contrary the intent of the drafters was to \u201c[require] the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance.\u201d <footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The Supreme Court spelled out the duties of the licensee in the clearest possible terms in <em>Red Lion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The broadcaster must give adequate coverage to public issues, and coverage must be fair in that it accurately reflects the opposing views. This must be done at the broadcaster\u2019s own expense if sponsorship is unavailable. . . . Moreover, the duty must be met by programming obtained at the licensee\u2019s own initiative if available from no other source.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Let us pause for a moment to reflect on the <em>Red Lion </em>litigation. The case arose out of an alleged breach of the personal attack doctrine. The attack came in the form of an opinionated broadcast by Rev. Billy Hargis, who also frequently broadcast on WXUR. Red Lion, which was managed by John H. Norris, the station manager of WXUR, failed to meet the requirements of the Commission which a licensee must follow in the event of a personal attack. These requirements, which are set out in <em>Times-Mirror Broadcasting </em>Co.,<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> call upon the licensee to send a tape, transcript or summary of the broadcast containing the attack to the wronged party. The licensee is required to offer the aggrieved party an opportunity to respond and must see that this opportunity be made without regard as to whether the response time will be paid for. In the opinion of this court in <em>Red </em>Lion<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> we went to great lengths to set out all of the correspondence between the Commission and Norris. Our account runs on for pages. Yet despite all of the instruction received by Norris he remained incapable of, or unwilling to, comply with the requirements in either <em>Red Lion </em>or the case currently under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The recent eases in our jurisdiction are more than adequate in setting out the current state of the law. In Green v. F. C. C.,<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> a case involving requests for time to oppose military enlistment on the air waves,</p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">Judge Wilkey wrote that the doctrine did not require identical treatment for differing viewpoints of controversial issues, \u201cas this would place an onerous and impractical burden on the licensees.\u201d Green v. F. C. C., <em>supra, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. at 358, 447 F.2d at 328. In addition we made it clear that unlike those corollaries to the doctrine that create equal-opportunities situations the doctrine itself does not create a right for any person or group to be granted time. \u201c[T]he licensees may exercise their judgment as to what material is presented and by whom .... The fairness doctrine is issue-oriented, and it would be sufficient if each licensee could show that the point of view advocated by petitioner . . . had been or was being presented on its station by others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In our opinion in Business Executives\u2019 Move for Vietnam Peace v. F. C. C., <em>supra </em>[146 U.S.App.D.C. 181, 450 F.2d 642], we held that \u201c[u]nder the permissive \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard of the fairness doctrine, acceptance of [a] particular format is by no means compulsory.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 187 of 146 U.S.App.D.C., at 648 of 450 F.2d. Thus, in opinion after opinion the Commission and the courts have stressed the wide degree of discretion available under the fairness doctrine and we have clearly stated time after time, <em>ad infinitum ad nauseam, </em>that the key to the doctrine is no mystical formula but rather the exercise of reasonable standards by the licensee. <em>See also </em>Neckritz v. F. C. C., 446 F.2d 501, 502 (9th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>132</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">We reiterate \u2014 all that is required is balance; equal opportunities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>except as specifically provided in \u00a7 315, are not required. We believe that imposing an absolute equal time standard for controversial issues would work to the detriment of the established intent of Congress and the Commission. As the Commission has previously noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa5\">We have long stressed the different manner in which the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d and fairness requirements of Section 315 operate. The former is applicable only to uses of station facilities by candidates for public office and calls for <em>equal </em>treatment \u2014 as to the amount of time to be afforded, the nature of the time slot, etc. It thus works with virtually mathematical precision.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> The Commission continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">In 1959 Congress codified the fairness doctrine, by inserting the provision in Section 315(a) that broadcast licensees \u201cmust operate in the public interest and . . . afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on controversial issues of public importance.\u201d The conference report makes clear that this was a Congressional \u201crestatement of the basic policy of the \u2018standard of fairness\u2019 which is imposed on broadcasters under the Communications Act of 1934\u201d (H.Rep.No.1069, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.,p.5 (1959)) .... And, finally, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Red Lion </em>significantly recognizes the <em>Editorializing Report </em>as the statement of the basic principles embodied in the fairness doctrine. <em>See Red Lion supra </em>[395 U.S.] at pp. 384-386 [89 S. Ct. 1794].<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">The ultimate test in this area is reasonableness. \u201cThe critical issue is whether the sum total of the licensee\u2019s efforts, taking into account his plans when the issue is a continuing one can be said to constitute a reasonable opportunity to inform the public on the contrasting viewpoint \u2014 one that is fair in the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>135</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">As the Fourth Circuit pointed out recently, the first line for deciding fairness cases is the good faith of the licensee.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> It is, therefore, here that we must begin our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">The record of BrandywineMain Line Radio is bleak in the area of good faith. At best, Brandywine\u2019s record is indicative of a lack of regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>for fairness principles; at worst, it shows an utter disdain for Commission rulings and ignores its own responsibilities as a broadcaster and its representations to the Commission. At the very outset Brandywine was informed by the Commission, in the <em>Borst Decision, </em>of the obligations of the licensee under both the fairness doctrine and the personal attack principle. This action was made necessary in the first instance because of the fear of so many in the community. It is apparent now that this fear was warranted and well founded. During the entire license period Brandy-wine willfully chose to disregard Commission mandate. With more brazen bravado than brains, Brandywine went on an independent frolic broadcasting what it chose, in any terms it chose, abusing those who dared differ with its viewpoints. This record is replete with example after example of one sided presentation on issues of controversial importance to the public. It is not necessary for this court to recount these matters again here. The Commission has amply done so and the record supports their contentions to the penultimate degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Rev. Mclntire\u2019s attitude toward the fairness doctrine and the rights of the public in general is made clear by considering the following excerpts from an exchange of correspondence between Mclntire and Albert J. Zack, Director of Public Relations for the AFL-CIO. Let us first consider this excerpt in a letter from Zack to Mclntire, sent on November 5, 1965, in response to Mclntire\u2019s invitation for Zack to appear on <em>20th Century Reformation Hour:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">Day after day, program after program, you expound a point of view which is not only contrary to mine, and that of most Americans, but which grossly offends the concepts of Christian ethics. You now propose to set everything right by asking me to come to Collingswood and speak in reply to anything you may say concerning me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">It simply will not do, Dr. Mclntire. This not only does not meet the legal definition of \u201cfairness\u201d; but it does not meet the far more significant standards set by the conscience of men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">No, I will not come to Collingswood, though it is otherwise a pleasant town. I will not give credence to your argument that one appearance by an opponent answering anything you may say is adequate to balance your incessant drumfire of disunion and hate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">If you wish, we will supply you with a tape or tapes of full program length telling the truth about the trade union movement and its policies, which you can alternate with your own daily commentaries, on your time \u2014which, let us remember, is my time, too, since [the] air belongs to us all.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Dr. Mclntire replied on November 18, 1965 in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">You have completely misrepresented and misunderstood my invitation, as I did not imply even that your appearance in response to your attack upon me would \u201cset everything right.\u201d As to the FCC\u2019s \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d and its legal definition, <em>the FCC has made it plain that this so-called fairness doctrine comes into play on a specific broadcast only when an individual\u2019s character and integrity are attacked, but a discussion of one\u2019s views and the position which he holds in our national life is a proper and legitimate subject for debate </em>under the protections of the guarantees of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion in the First Amendment. My offer to you actually went beyond any \u201clegal\u201d definition of fairness. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">. Radio stations are privately owned and it is possible in the dissemination of radio for private interests to contract for the time \u2014 which the 20th Century Reformation Hour has done. This time, for which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>pay, is ours and not yours; nor does it belong to both of use with an obligation upon me to share it equally with you. It would appear to me that you have what I would call a rather socialistic view in this regard.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\">We could give many more examples from the weighty record in this case, however, we fail to see what purpose that would serve. The exchange cited above makes it clear that Mclntire either did not understand the fairness doctrine or chose to merely ignore it by twisting the law to meet his own requirements. Mclntire attributes the requirements of the doctrine to the personal attack rules. Certainly, the doctrine is not so limited as this would imply. The doctrine requires balance when dealing with controversial issues of public importance. This is the extent of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Throughout the pendency of these proceedings appellants have attempted to obfuscate the actual issues in this case by injecting a smoke-screen issue relating to Mclntire and his <em>20th Century Reformation Hour. </em>Throughout the record we find references to stations cancelling the Mclntire program because of the requirements of the fairness doctrine and, indeed, the suggestion is infused more than once that the Commission was \u201cout to get\u201d the Reverend. Certainly, none of this is central to the case at bar and little of it is relevant. These incantations amount to childish prattle. By cloaking these charges in the clothing of the first amendment<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Mclntire attempts to conjure right which the Constitution simply does not provide. As Alexander Hamilton said in another setting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declarations and the bitterness of their invectives.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">This is what we have here. At the risk of assisting Rev. Mclntire in his bid for self-martyrdom, we note that his behavior is reminiscent of that of a not so legendary knight-errant named Quixote \u2014who engaged himself by riding against otherwise harmless wind-mills. The actions taken by the Commission with reference to both Rev. Mclntire and WXUR are more than supported by the record. Attempting to place the blame on the Commission for the shortcomings of the broadcaster and/or the licensee will not do. It would do the parties well to remember that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Left to their own wiles, Brandywine and Drl Mclntire would set the fairness doctrine to rest in a not so solemn se-pulchre without regard for the right of the community to be fully informed. This record could not support the Commission\u2019s findings in this area more strongly.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">III. PERSONAL ATTACK DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">The law in this area is well settled. Whenever there is an attack made on a person or group in the context of a controversial issue of public importance the individual attacked has a right to respond. The right is extended on the basis of two separate lines of authority\u2014 the holdings in <em>Red Lion </em>and <em>Times-Mirror Broadcasting Co., </em>and on the basis of the Commission\u2019s regulations.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALS\">These obligations differ from the general fairness requirement that issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>be presented, and presented with coverage of competing views, in that the broadcaster does not have the option of presenting the attacked party\u2019s side himself or choosing a third party to represent that side. But insofar as there is an obligation of the broadcaster to see that both sides are presented, and insofar as that is an affirmative obligation, the personal attack doctrine and regulations do not differ from the preceding fairness doctrine. The simple fact that the attacked men or unendorsed candidates may respond themselves or through agents is not a critical distinction, and indeed, it is not unreasonable for the FCC to conclude that the objective of adequate presentation of all sides may best be served by allowing those most closely affected to make the response, rather than leaving the response in the hands of the station which has attacked their candidacies, endorsed their opponents, or carried a personal attack upon them.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">The Supreme Court laid to rest any existing challenges as to the Commission\u2019s authority in enacting regulations under the personal attack doctrine in <em>Red Lion.</em><footnotemark><em>144</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Congress has given a mandate to the \u201cCommission from time to time, as public convenience, interest, or necessity requires\u201d to enact \u201csuch rules and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter . . . . \u201d <footnotemark>145</footnotemark> The demands of public interest are prime considerations for the Commission in granting licenses,<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> renewing licenses,<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> and modifying them.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> Additionally, station operation must be carried out in the public interest.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">This mandate to the FCC to assure that broadcasters operate in the public interest is a broad one, a power \u201cnot niggardly but expansive,\u201d National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 219, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943), whose validity we have long upheld. FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 138, 60 S.Ct. 437, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940); FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 90, 73 S.Ct. 998, 97 L.Ed. 1470 (1953); FRC v. Nelson Bros. Bond &amp; Mortgage Co., 289 U.S. 266, 285, 53 S.Ct. 627, 77 L.Ed. 1166 (1933). It is broad enough to encompass these regulations.<footnotemark>150</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">As the Supreme Court has held specifically that the personal attack \u201cregulations . . . are [not] beyond the scope of the congressionally conferred power to assure that stations are operated by those whose possession of a license serves \u2018the public interest,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> this leaves us only to examine the adequacy of the Commission\u2019s holding in the instant case.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">The facts in this case indicate, as the Commission found, that the licensee demonstrated complete disregard for the rules in this area. There are instances on the record where the licensee totally failed to give any notification to persons attacked,<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> in other cases there were failures to send tapes, transcripts, or summaries.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> The Commission found, adopting the Examiner\u2019s decision, that</p>\n<p id=\"b109-19\">[management did very little to comply with the mandate of the rules in supplying tapes or summaries. Usual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ly the individual was obliged to request a tape and, even then, he had difficulty.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">This is a demonstration of Brandywine\u2019s degree of compliance in regard to personal attacks. We have reviewed the alleged attacks in this case and find many instances of attacks upon honesty, character, integrity and other personal qualities of given persons or groups in the course of discussion of controversial issues of public importance. Yet we find that the licensee did not send tapes, that it did not send transcripts, that it did not send summaries. Is this the responsible behavior of an earnest licensee?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">As was the case with regard to the fairness doctrine, Brandywine was informed of its responsibilities in personal attack situations by the Commission at the time of approving the initial transfer. Brandywine represented to the Commission that they understood and would abide by the responsibilities placed on them. As the Commission stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">The unavoidable conclusion is that Brandywine simply ignored its plain duty to the public. . . .We note here again that these violations, although they would warrant the same conclusion in any event, are particularly reprehensible in light of the fact that the licensee had been cautioned at the outset concerning its duties in this area.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Brandywine has attempted to pass its obligations in this area to those who purchase time from the licensee. The law is clear in this regard. The obligation rests squarely on the shoulders of the licensee. The fact that the licensee decided to act in avoidance of this obligation by seeking to delegate a non-delegable duty is another indicia of Brandywine\u2019s failings under the law. We fully understand Brandywine\u2019s two pronged defense in this area. Firstly, Brandywine claims it is incapable of screening tapes prior to broadcast because of the small size of its staff. We note that small staffs in no way exculpate licensees from their affirmative duties. Brandywine would be incapable of operating without an engineer; similarly, a person suitable to protect the rights of the listening public is a necessity for a licensee. This is part of the expense of operating a radio station. Any economic argument to the contrary loses sight of the purposes of Commission regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Brandywine\u2019s second assertion is even less valid. John Norris testified that the station did not have anyone listen to program tapes prior to broadcast as this act would constitute censorship.<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> This argument offends the sensibilities of the court for various reasons. This is <em>pri-ma facie </em>evidence that despite the numerous and lengthy assertions of the licensee to the Commission, Brandywine never intended to comply with the personal attack rules. Any representation to the contrary on the part of the licensees can only be said to constitute a gratuitous design intended to lull the Commission into a feeling of security. Brandywine has dealt with the Commission in a setting which not only lacked good faith but was also meant to defraud the Commission with regard to the licensee\u2019s 'actual intentions in this area. Brandywine was aware of the personal attack rules, it acknowledged responsibility under them and then chose to disregard them under a guise claiming that the rules constitued licensee censorship. Such maneuvering has proven to be not so wise gamesmanship on the part of licensee. Brandywine\u2019s abuses in this area are so blatant as to be sufficient to shock the conscience of the court. The Commission had every justification for its findings in regard to the personal attack rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">IV. BRANDYWINE\u2019S PROGRAM REPRESENTATIONS .</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">This aspect of the ease, while not the most troublesome, is clearly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>most disturbing to the court. The facts in this area, as with the other areas of this case, were clearly set out by the Commission.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> Brandywine made extensive representations to the Commission about the types of programs to be broadcast, as well as providing specific, titles. Variation from the typical program schedule presented would not have been fatal if the changes had proven relatively minor or had they been implemented in good faith. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, neither was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The changes which took place on WXUR within the very first days following the transfer show a common design on the part of the licensee to engage in deceit and trickery in obtaining a broadcast license. Within nine days a totally unexpected group of seven programs, each of a nature different than those on the typical program schedule, were on the air. These programs, which Norris characterized as the \u201cHate Clubs of the Air,\u201d replaced programs which were predominantly entertainment oriented. The speed with which these changes took place can lead the court to one conclusion and one conclusion only \u25a0 \u2014 Brandywine intended to place these controversial programs on the air from the first but feared to so inform the Commission lest the transfer application be denied. This approach was foolish. As the Commission stated in the <em>Borst Decision </em>and as we stated earlier in this opinion,</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">[t]he Commission is wisely forbidden from choosing \u201camong applicants on the basis of their political, economic or social views.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The initial representation to the Commission was obviously \u201ca best foot forward\u201d effort by the licensee. The licensee feared that the truth would keep the license from being granted to it. Therefore, Brandywine sought through subterfuge to gain its license and then proceed to broadcast the type of material it believed to be most suitable \u2014 the type of material which would forward the ends of the fundamentalist movement \u2014 in utter disregard for either the public or their earlier representations to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">The second misrepresentation concerns <em>Inter faith Forum. </em>We have previously described the show at length<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> and need not reiterate here. The facts are simple \u2014when it appeared from Commission inquiry that a more balanced approach to the question of religion was necessary the principal parties at Brandywine devised this program. The record shows that only after being censured by the local government did the licensee make any effort for this program to be broadcast, and even when it finally found its way to the airwaves its content was without resemblance to those representations made to the Commission. This was never an interfaith dialogue but rather an interview program of students and faculty at the Faith Theological Seminary. We find no fault with such a program but we fail to see how it complies with Brandywine\u2019s representations for dialogue between the faiths.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">The applicable legal standard here was laid down by the Supreme Court over twenty-five years ago. In another communications case the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">The fact of concealment may be more significant than the facts concealed. The willingness to deceive a regulatory body may be disclosed by immaterial and useless deceptions as well as by material and persuasive ones.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">This is dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">This is a case in which the blind need for a radio outlet in the Philadelphia market has led men experienced in the broadcast industry to misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>sent the facts and to attempt to deceive a regulatory body all to a single end\u2014 propagation on the media of their philosophic dogma. These men may have possessed the highest aims for their cause but these aims were blind to the needs of the general public. Misrepresentations conceived to win a soap-box from which to shout one\u2019s views are the basest over-exaggeration of the liberties guaranteed in the first amendment. Since the airwaves are a scarce commodity and have been deemed a public trust it is easy for us to see that Dr. Mclntire and his followers have every right for their views to be broadcast. Their right to operate a radio station is no different than the rights of any other group in America. Their rights are neither superior nor inferior. In seeking a broadcast station they had to meet the same requirements as anyone else seeking a license. The first of these requirements is candor and honesty in representations to the Commission. Their dismal failure in this regard is evidenced by this 8,000 page record. These men, with their hearts bent toward deliberate and premeditated deception, cannot be said to have dealt fairly with the Commission or the people in the Philadelphia area. Their statements constitute a series of heinous misrepresentations which, even without the other factors in this case, would be ample justification for the Commission to refuse to renew the broadcast license.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Y. FIRST AMENDMENT CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The most serious aspect of this case relates to the basic freedoms of speech and press which are essential guarantees of the first amendment. This is the area of greatest concern to the court. Any shortcomings in this area would necessitate our reversing the decision of the Commission. Not only must the Commission take a hard look at the case in this light but so must this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">A. <em>Historical Perspective</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">1. <em>Freedoms of Speech and Free Press</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The original draft of the federal Constitution was, curiously enough, silent on the question of freedom of the press. We say \u201ccuriously\u201d because among the burning issues of the revolution and the colonial quest for freedom were the plight of Peter Zenger, who had been denied this right, and the issue of taxation of the press. So great was the concern of America that Alexander Hamilton was prompted to write the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever has been said about it in that or any other State amounts to nothing. What signifies a declaration, that \u201cthe liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved\u201d? What is the liberty of the press ?<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The response to Hamilton\u2019s complaint was not long in coming. This wrong was remedied almost immediately by the first amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">AMENDMENT 1</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">The following passage from Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries is most instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">The liberty of the press is, indeed, essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying no <em>previous </em>restraints upon publication, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. Every free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>man has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous, or illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity. To subject the press to the restrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the revolution, is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge in all controverted points in learning, religion and government. But to punish (as the law does at present) any dangerous or offensive writings, which, when published, shall on a fair and impartial trial be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundation of civil liberty. Thus the will of the individuals is still left free; the abuse only of the free will is the object of legal punishment. Neither is any restraint hereby laid upon freedom of thought or inquiry; liberty of private sentiment is still left; the disseminating, or making public, of bad sentiments, destructive to the ends of society, is the crime which society corrects.<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">This was the common law in Blackstone\u2019s time. The framers of the first amendment were devoid of any intent to change the common law in this respect. Mr. Justice Frankfurter provides an excellent lesson in his opinion in Dennis,<footnotemark>164</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The historic antecedents of the First Amendment preclude the notion that its purpose was to give unqualified immunity to every expression that touched on matters within the range of political interest. The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 guaranteed free speech; yet there are record^ of at least three convictions for political libels obtained between 1799 and 1803. The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790 and the Delaware Constitution of 1792 expressly imposed liability for abuse of the right of free speech. Madison\u2019s own State put on its books in 1792 a statute confining the abusive exercise of the right of utterance. And it deserves to be noted that in writing to John Adams\u2019s wife, Jefferson did not rest his condemnation of the Sedition Act of 1798 on his belief on un-restained utterance as ' to political matter. The First Amendment, he argued, reflected a limitation upon Federal' power, leaving the right to enforce restrictions on speech to the States. * * *<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> \u201cThe law is perfectly well settled,\u201d this Court said over fifty years ago, \u201cthat the first ten amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guarantees and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors, and which had from time immemorial, been subject to certain well-recognized exceptions, arising from the necessities of the case. In incorporating these principles into the fundamental law, there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions, which continued to be recognized as if they had been formally expressed.\u201d<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> That this represents the authentic view of the Bill of Rights and the spirit in which it must be construed has been recognized again and again in cases that have come here within the last fifty years.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>This situation was not even thought to have been altered by the fourteenth amendment until relatively recently. Speaking for the Court in 1907, Mr. Justice Holmes stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">We leave undecided the question whether there is to be found in the Fourteenth Amendment a prohibition similar to that in the 1st. But even if we were to assume that freedom of speech and freedom of the press were protected from abridgment on the part not only of the United States but also of the states, still we should be far from the conclusion that the plaintiff in error would have us reach. In the first place, the main purpose of such constitutional provisions is \u201cto prevent all such <em>previous restraints </em>upon publications as had been practiced by other governments,\u201d and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare. Commonwealth v. Blanding, 3 Pick. 304, 313, 314; Respublica v. Oswald, 1 Dali. 319, 325, 1 L.Ed. 155. The preliminary freedom extends as well to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>false as to the true; the subsequent punishment may extend as well to the true as to the false. This was the law of criminal libel apart from statute in most cases, if not in all. Commonwealth v. Blanding, <em>ubi supra; </em>4 Bl. Com. 150.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">This would appear to be an unqualified endorsement of the views espoused by Blackstone. However, Justice Holmes remarked in the same opinion, \u201cThere is no constitutional right to have all general propositions of law once adopted remain unchanged.\u201d<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> As late as 1922, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Pit-ney, stated: \u201c[N]either the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution of the United States imposes upon the States any restriction about \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 or the \u2018liberty of silence\u2019.....\u201d<footnotemark>170</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Eventually the citizens of this country were given those long sought protections for substantive personal rights. This was achieved by identifying these rights with \u201cliberty\u201d which States were without pow\u00e9r to abridge without due process of law. This disclosure was made quite casually by the Supreme Court in the landmark decision of Gitlow v. New York.<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> \u201cFor present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press \u2014 which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress \u2014 are among the fundamental principle rights and \u2018liberties\u2019 protected by the due process' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.\u201d<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> Within two years this <em>dictum </em>became accepted doctrine as to freedom of speech<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> Four years later freedom of the press was incorporated.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">2. <em>Censorship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">Let us also consider the first amendment and the concept of censorship \u2014 an implicit issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">Mr. Justice Murphy asserted in Chap-linsky v. New Hampshire:<footnotemark>175</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-18\">There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or \u201cfighting\u201d words \u2014 those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of 'ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighted by the social interest in order and morality.<footnotemark>176</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-19\">Similarly, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> Mr. Justice Jackson established it as \u201ca commonplace that censorship or suppression of expression of opinion is tolerated by our Constitution only when the expression presents a clear and present danger of action of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>kind the State is empowered to prevent and punish.\u201d<footnotemark>178</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Significantly, those cases which have sanctioned previous restraints of the utterances of specific individuals have not involved restraints by administrative action, but rather judicial restraints. It was a prime objective of those seeking to ban previous restraints to outlaw censorship which could be accomplished through licensing. It was in this setting that John Milton directed his offensive in his <em>Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing. </em>Freedom of the press was, in the beginning, a right to publish \u201c <em>\u2018without </em>a license what formerly could be published only <em>with </em>one.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>179</footnotemark> Today, as well, nothing is more likely to give rise to judicial condemnation than a licensing requirement. Only in those cases in which the licensing officer\u2019s authority is so limited as to make discrimination against utterances which he disapproves of impossible<footnotemark>180</footnotemark> will the court refrain from interfering. The Supreme Court has even gone so far as to strike down licensing ordinances with respect to forms of communication which are totally forbidden.<footnotemark>181</footnotemark> More pertinently to the case at bar, in the area of radio broadcasting, where the very physical limitations of the medium make this form of communication unavailable to all who would utilize it, the Court has sanctioned the Commission\u2019s power of selective licensing.<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> On the other hand, it had been the Court\u2019s position until recently, with regard to motion pictures, that the state\u2019s power to license, and therefore, to censor, films to be shown locally was unrestricted as \u201ca business pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit,\u201d and \u201cnot to be regarded, as part of the press of the country, or as organs of public opinion.\u201d <footnotemark>183</footnotemark> This doctrine, established in 1915, was altered by the Court in 1948. Mr. Justice Douglas stated that the Court\u2019s position had become a very different one. \u201cWe have no doubt that moving pictures, like newspapers and radio, are included in the press whose freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>184</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">It would be remiss for us to move on without noting that there are areas where the federal government has, at one time or another, placed restraints on both freedoms of speech and press. These areas include, or have included, censorship of the mails, <em>e. g., </em>fraud orders and obscenity; regulation of business and labor activities; regulation of political activities by federal employees; legislation to protect the armed forces and the war power; loyalty regulations; the Smith Act; and the registration of subversive organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">B. <em>The First Amendment and Red Lion </em>The rights of free speech and free press coupled with the fairness doctrine and the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Red Lion </em>decision, is one of the most written-about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>areas in the law today.<footnotemark>185</footnotemark> The first amendment issue was dealt with by the Supreme Court in part three of the <em>Red Lion </em>decision.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark> The Court explained the broadcaster\u2019s contentions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">Their contention is that the First Amendment protects their desire to use their allotted frequencies continuously to broadcast whatever they choose, and to exclude whomever they choose from ever using that frequency. No man may be prevented from saying or publishing what he thinks, or from refusing in his speech or other utterances to give equal weight to the views of his opponents. This right, they say, applies equally to broadcasters.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">These first amendment challenges were rejected by the Court unanimously.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> In fact, Mr. Justice White found that the Commission\u2019s application of the fairness doctrine enhances rather than abridges the freedoms of speech and press.<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> As we noted previously, one of those points emphasized by the Court was \u201cthe scarcity of broadcast frequencies, the Government\u2019s role in allocating those frequencies, and the legitimate claims of those unable without governmental assistance to gain access to those frequencies for expression of their views .\u201d<footnotemark>190</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">In direct response to the first amendment claims raised by the broadcasters the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-15\">Where there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate, it is idle to posit an unabridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish. . . . It is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market, whether it be by the Government itself or a private licensee. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-16\">It is the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences which is crucial here.<footnotemark>191</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">The Court found, and of course we agree, that it would be \u201ca serious matter\u201d if the requirements imposed by the Commission would in effect induce the licensee to censor themselves thereby making their coverage of controversial public issues \u201cineffective.\u201d However, the Court deemed this to be merely a speculative possibility. In fact the Court determined that if licensees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-18\">should suddenly prove timorous, the Commission is not powerless to insist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>that they give adequate and fair attention to public issues. It does not violate the First Amendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using scarce radio frequencies as proxies for the entire community, obligated to give suitable time and attention to matters of great public concern.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsH\">The Court was careful to point out that its rejection of the broadcaster\u2019s claim was not an absolute one. The Court found that there could be instances in which more substantial first amendment questions were raised than in <em>Red Lion. </em>For example, the Court found no evidence of Commission \u201crefusal to permit the broadcaster to carry a particular program,\u201d or \u201cof the official government view dominating public broadcast-casting.\u201d <footnotemark>193</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">C. <em>The Post Red Lion Era</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5\">In the short time that has passed since the <em>Red Lion </em>case, there has been an ever growing number of cases decided concerning the fairness doctrine, broadcasting, and the first amendment. We have already considered many of these cases during the course of our discussion of the fairness doctrine. Thus, a lengthy exposition here is unwarranted and unnecessary. For the most part these cases have relied primarily, as they must, on <em>Red Lion </em>and have added little to the shape of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">One opinion which did provide instructional enlightenment in the first amendment area is Judge Wright\u2019s scholarly opinion in Business Executives\u2019 Move for Vietnam Peace v. F. C. C.<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Wright addressed the issue of the uncertainty of the scope of the first amendment\u2019s impact on the broadcast media:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvY\">It has always been clear that the broadcast media \u2014 so vital to communication in our society \u2014 are affected by strong First Amendment interests.<footnotemark>195</footnotemark> Yet the nature of those interests has not been so clear; and evolution of constitutional principles in this area is still very much in progress. . . . <em>[Red </em>Lion] justified the Commission\u2019s interference with broadcasters\u2019 free speech by invoking specifically constitutional rights of the general public which, it said, underlie and support the fairness doctrine rules at issue. Issuing what must become a clarion call for a new public concern and activism regarding the broadcast media, the Court stated that \u201cthe people as a whole retain their . . . collective right to have the medium function consistently with the ends and purposes of the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> It went on to say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">\u201c. . . The right of free speech of a broadcaster . . . does not embrace a right to snuff out the free speech of others. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-15\">-X- * \u2022\u00bb * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-16\">. . . [A] licensee has no constitutional right ... to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-18\">* * * * -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-19\">. . . It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.\u201d <footnotemark>197</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Even in light of the later cases <em>Red Lion </em>remains the definitive opinion in the area. Therefore, we can only stress, once again, the Court's language in that case. As we said in Democratic National Committee v. F.C.C.:<footnotemark>198</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">According to the Court in <em>[Red Lion], </em>the primary concern in the broadcast industry is \u201cthe First Amendment goal of producing an informed public capable of conducting its own affairs.\u201d <footnotemark>199</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">We expressed this same view in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">In our view, the essential basis for any fairness doctrine, no matter with what specificity the standards are defined, is that <em>the American public must not be left uninformed.</em><footnotemark><em>200</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azl\">Anything else on this point would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">D. <em>The Prohibition Against Censorship</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">It was John Stuart Mill who wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afl\">[Censorship] is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it. If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of a contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.<footnotemark>201</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE-\">These views are central to the thoughts of all who hold dear our fundamental liberties. Wisely, therefore, Congress has specifically forbidden the Commission from engaging in any actions which would constitute censorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">\n<em>328. Censorship.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Akz\">Nothing in this chapter shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">It has been held that this section denied the power to censor to the states in the same terms as it denied the power to censor to the federal government;<footnotemark>203</footnotemark> and similarly that the licensee shall have the sole power in choosing programs.<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> However, this court has held that the Commission\u2019s public interest rulings, with reference to specific program content, do not invariably constitute \u201ccensorship\u201d within the confines of \u00a7 326.<footnotemark>205</footnotemark> We have also held that not every condition imposed by the Commission on a licensee constitutes interference with free speech.<footnotemark>206</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">The deep seated commitment which the courts and commission share for this concept can hardly be classified as ephemeral. The prohibition from censorship has been and will continue to be carefully guarded by those charged with the responsibility of protecting our basic freedoms. Yet, despite the guarantees there are those who fear government licensing of broadcasting and believe that it constitutes a threat to freedom of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>formation. One such person is media commentator Walter Cronkite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">That brings me to what I consider the greatest threat to freedom of information: the Government licensing of broadcasting. Broadcast news today is not free. Because it is operated by an industry that is beholden to the Government for its right to exist, its freedom has been curtailed by fiat, by assumption, and by intimidation and harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">Broadcasting\u2019s freedom has been curtailed by fiat through rulings of the Supreme Court. The Court has stated that as.long as we are licensed by the Government, we are not as free as the printed press and therefore not eligible in the same manner for the first amendment guarantees. The father of all such restrictive rulings is the decision in National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, where the Court found that freedom of utterance was abridged to anyone who wanted to use the limited facilities of radio. The Court went on to find that radio was unlike other modes of expression in that it was not available to all. It was this unique characteristic that distinguished the radio from other forms of expression and made it a subject of government regulation. More recently, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC upheld the \u201cpersonal attack rule\u201d and found that where substantially more individuals wish to broadcast than there are frequencies available to allocate, it is idle to attempt to establish an unabridgeable first amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of each individual to speak, write, or publish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Stripped of this constitutional protection, broadcast news stands naked before those in power, now or in the future, who, for whatever motive, would like to see its freedom restrained.<footnotemark>207</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">While we do not agree with Mr. Cronkite\u2019s conclusions, we do share his concern. Journalists and broadcasters have no monopoly over concern with censorship. The courts, and indeed the American public as a whole, have a tremendous stake in a free press and an informed citizenry. Yet, how can the citizenry remain informed if broadcasters are permitted to espouse their own views only without attempting to fully inform the public? This is the issue of good faith which, unfortunately, a small number of broadcasters refuse to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">E. <em>Brandywine and' the First Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Under the state of the law as it exists today, we can find no infirmity with the Commission\u2019s findings or conclusions in light of the first amendment. Commission findings in this area are in a relatively narrow sphere. The alleged violations of fairness and personal attack rules are fully documented. The abuses are flagrant. The sanctions borne of the litigation were based on continuous refusals by the licensee to meet its obligations. This is not a case in which the Commission is acting on an isolated mistake, or two, in the course of a three year license period. This is a case of deliberate and continuing disregard in a short time period spanning only several months. The Commission has made no attempt to influence WXUR\u2019s programming or censor its programming in general or specifically. Had the licensee met tlie obligations required of it we: have no reason to believe that Brandywine would have met with any difficulty. The law places requirements on licensees as fiduciaries. Failure to live up to the trust placed in the hands of the fiduciary requires that a more responsible trustee be found. This is not the public\u2019s attempt to silence the trustee \u2014 it is the trustee\u2019s attempt to silence the public. This is not the public censoring the trustee \u2014 it is the trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>censoring the public. Attempting to impose the blame on the Commission for its own shortcomings can only be likened to the spoiled child\u2019s tantrum at being refused a request by an otherwise- overly-benevolent parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As in the <em>Red Lion </em>case, we note that other questions in this area could pose more serious first amendment problems. Since such questions are not at issue here there is no need to hypothecate upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">VI. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In light of the extensive violations found by the Commission in the areas of the fairness doctrine, the personal attack rules, and misrepresentation of program plans, the Commission refused to renew Brandywine\u2019s license. The Commission, while finding that its action would have been justified when based on any of these areas, chose to base its opinion on a consideration of Brandywine\u2019s total performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> As the Commission stated in Letter to Honorable Oren Harris,<footnotemark>208</footnotemark> the question of whether the licensee is operating in the public interest, the established standard for license renewal,<footnotemark>209</footnotemark> is determined at the time of renewal. At this time the Commission must take the licensee\u2019s total performance into account, including its adherence to the fairness doctrine. Of course, the prime consideration must come back to the effectiveness of the licensee in his role as trustee for the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">As Judge Wright points out in Citizens Communications Center v. F. C. C.: <footnotemark>210</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">The policy of the Act is clear that no person is to have anything in the nature of a property right as a result of the granting of a license. Licenses are limited to a maximum of three years\u2019 duration, may be revoked, and need not be renewed. Thus the channels presently occupied remain free for a new assignment to another licensee in the interest of the listening public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">Plainly it is not the purpose of the Act to protect a licensee against competition but to protect the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-17\"><em>Cf. </em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. F. C. C.,<footnotemark>211</footnotemark> \u201c[The Federal Communications Act] does not reflect the same concern for \u2018security of certificate\u2019 that appears in other laws.\u201d<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> Both <em>Greater Boston- </em>and <em>Citizens Communications </em>make it clear that the Commission can act to provide assurances of better broadcasting by taking licenses from those who fail to provide for the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">The Commission need not be confined to the technique of exercising regulatory surveillance to assure that licensees will discharge duties imposed on them, perhaps grudgingly and perhaps to the minimum required. It may also seek in the public interest to certify as licensees those who would speak out with fresh voice, would most naturally initiate, encourage and expand diversity of approach and viewpoint.<footnotemark>213</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-19\">Judge Leventhal recently enunciated the standard for reviewing decisions of regulatory agencies in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-20\">We recognized the tension between the doctrine of judicial restraint, which requires of us considerable deference to agency decisions, and the practical necessities of judicial review, which require a minimum standard of articulation, so that we may discern the path which the Commission took on the way to its result. We acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>edged the impossibility of framing a universally applicable formula \u201cfor deciding when an agency . . . has crossed the line from the tolerably terse to the intolerably mute. . . \u201d <footnotemark>214</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Commission\u2019s opinion in this case exemplifies the type of findings which this court would like to see in all its cases. The opinion is complete, thorough, thoughtful and carefully based on the law. The sanction imposed by the Commission is fully supported by the record. We can find no justification for upsetting a sanction so well substantiated by the record and the findings of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Of course, as we have previously pointed out, these sanctions did not befall Brandywine by surprise. The <em>Borst Decision </em>contained a warning to the licensee designed to alert him to the Commission\u2019s expectations; this warning was acknowledged by the licensee. The Commission can only inform and advise as to the law; it cannot coerce a licensee to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">Finally, we come to the end of our long journey. Yet, we take a brief moment to comment on the path we have travelled. Appellants requested at oral argument that the court not rely alone on the cold submissions in the pleadings, but that we carefully review the entire record in this case. We have done so fastidiously \u2014 we have left no corner unturned; no fact has gone unconsidered. What we found teaches many lessons.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Appellants have blazed a trail marked by empty promises and valueless verbiage. They have attempted to prevail by wearing down both Commission and court. However, those charged with protecting the precious rights of the public will not, and cannot, be exhausted by a group of recalcitrants who attempt to cajole and bully. Freedom of speech is not an empty slogan or a rallying cry \u2014nor can it be snatched from the hands of the American people by an outpouring of emotional indignation. Freedom of speech is a truth that we have long held to be self-evident; we refuse to sit by idly and watch that truth snuffed out by a group of overly-zealous men whose sole interest is filling the airwaves with their own views to the exclusion of the views of all others. Dr. Mclntire and his followers have every right to air their views; but so do the balance of our two-hundred-and-ten-million people.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Brandywine was given every opportunity to succeed in the broadcast endeav- or on which it set out. The Commission fulfilled its duty in granting the initial license although it may have proven more popular and expedient to bow to the protestations of Brandywine\u2019s detractors. The Commission forewarned Brandywine about its fairness doctrine and its personal attack rules and made every effort to explain them. Despite the Commission\u2019s sanguine outlook it was soon evident that Brandywine refused to comply with those requirements, which are designed to serve the public interest and the broadcast audience. Commission good faith was interpreted as an act of weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">The first amendment was never intended to protect the few while providing them with a sacrosanct sword and shield with which they could injure the many. Censorship and press inhibition do not sit well with this court when engaged in by either the Commission or by a defiant licensee. The most serious wrong in this case was the denial of an open and free airwave to the people of Philadelphia and its environs.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Consequently, the opinion of the Federal Communications Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">.

The program, which was designed to show left, right and middle-of-the-road philosophies, lasted only a short time. The Commission did not consider the program, nor will this court, since it did not commence for more than a year after the license renewal issue arose and was thus <em>totally </em>outside the license period. <em>See </em>J.A.

We reprint the following transcript excerpt to exemplify this point. Mr. Schattenfield is examining Mr. Norris, the station manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">Q. Do you have someone listen to the tape prior to its being run?</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">A. I mentioned previously that we don't censor the broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">Q. I didn\u2019t say censor. I said listen.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">A. That would be censoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">Q. You don\u2019t listen to each tape before it is broadcast as a standard, do you?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-23\">A. No, that is impossible. I am only one individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">Q. Do you have procedures at the station so that somebody listens to the tapes?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-25\">A. On Pastor Bob and some of the local ones. I believe Pastor Bob is on only one station, WXUR. There are other broadcasters that are on just this station.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-26\">Q. But he doesn\u2019t have a tape?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-27\">A. He doesn\u2019t have a tape. It is done live.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-28\">Q. On those programs you receive on tape, is it a standard operating procedure for you or someone under your direction to listen to them?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-29\">A. Not standard, we take it like we would on a network.</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Q. Is it standard procedure for you to have someone monitor it while they are on the air?</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">MR. COTTONE: That question has been asked and answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">PRESIDING EXAMINER: I don\u2019t believe that precise question was asked. If it was I don\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">THE WITNESS: While it is on the air we didn\u2019t say to the announcers or the person on the air, \u201cYou must listen to that.\u201d I believe most of our help do listen to the programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">Q. Is it standard operating procedure for the station to assign someone to listen to each program as it is broadcast, each taped program as it is broadcast over WXUR, to determine whether positions are taken with respect to controversial issues and/or whether statements have been made which may be construed as attacks on individuals or groups?</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">A. Not in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"ATe\">Tr. 1699-1701.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-20\">Thus the record is clear. Norris openly admitted that he either was physically incapable of personally dealing with personal attack problems or that the station was incapable of dealing with them. In addition, and of greater moment to this proceeding, was Norris\u2019 attitude that attempts at compliance would be tantamount to censorship. This obstinate and obdurate approach is indicative of a schematic design to frustrate compliance in this critical area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b93-22\">.

Because of this chaos, a series of National Radio Conferences was held between 1922 and 1925, at which it was resolved that .regulation of the radio spectrum by the Federal Government was essential and that regulatory power should be utilized to ensure that allocation of this limited resource would be made only to those who would serve the public interest. The 1923 Conference expressed the opinion that the Radio Communications Act of 1912, 37 Stat. 302, conferred upon the Secretary of Commerce the power to regulate frequencies and hours of operation, but when Secretary Hoover sought to implement this claimed power by penalizing the Zenith Radio Corporation for operating on an unauthorized frequency, the 1912 Act was held not to permit enforcement.

In our judgment, based on decades of experience in this field, this is the only sound way to proceed as a general policy. A contrary approach of equal opportunities, applying to controversial issues generally the specific equal opportunities requirements for political candidates would in practice not be workable. It would inhibit, rather than promote, the discussion and presentation of controversial issues in the various broadcast program formats (e. g., newscasts; interviews, documentaries). For it is just not practicable to require equality with respect to the large number of issues dealt with in a great variety of programs on a daily and continuing basis. Further, it would involve this Commission much too deeply in broadcast journalism ; we would indeed become virtually a part of the broadcasting \u201cfourth estate,\u201d overseeing thousands of complaints that some issue had not been given \u201cequal treatment.\u201d We do not believe that the profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public, issues should be \u201cuninhibited, robust, wide-open\u201d (New York Times Co. v.

The great initial problem in this realm of constitutional liberty was to get rid of the common law of \u201cseditious libel\u201d which operated to put persons in authority beyond the reach of public criticism. The first step in this direction was taken in the famous, or infamous, Sedition Act of 1798, which admitted the defense of truth in prosecution brought under it, and submitted the general issue of defendant\u2019s guilt to the jury. But the substantive doctrine of \u201cseditious libel\u201d the Act of 1798 still retained, a circumstance which put several critics of President Adams in jail and thereby considerably aided Jefferson\u2019s election as President in 1800. Once in office, nevertheless, Jefferson himself appealed to the discredited principle against partisan critics. Writing his friend Governor Mc-Kean of Pennsylvania in 1803 [about] such critics, Jefferson said: \u201cThe federalists having failed in destroying freedom of the press by their gag-law, seem to have attacked it in an opposite direction ; that is by pushing its licentiousness and its lying to such a degree of prostitution as to deprive it of all credit. * * * This is a dangerous state of things, and the press ought to be restored to its credibility if possible. The restraints provided by the laws of the States are sufficient for this, if applied. And I have, therefore, long thought that a few prosecutions of the most prominent offenders would have a wholesome effect in restoring the integrity of the presses. Not a general prosecution, for that would look like persecution; but a selected one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvF\">Works (Ford ed., 1905), IX 451-52.</p>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">In the <em>Memorial Edition, </em>of Jefferson\u2019s works this letter is not included ; nor apparently was it known to the Honorable Josephus Daniels, whose enthusiastic introduction to one of these volumes makes Jefferson out to have been the father of freedom of speech and press in this country, if not throughout the world. The sober truth is that it was that arch enemy of Jefferson and of democracy, Alexander Hamilton, who made the greatest single contribution toward rescuing this particular freedom as a political weapon from the coils and toils of the common law. and that in connection with one of Jefferson\u2019s \u201cselected prosecutions.\u201d I refer to Hamilton\u2019s manytimes quoted formula in the Oroswell case in 1804: \u201cThe liberty of the press is the right to publish with impunity, truth, with good motives, for justifiable, ends though reflecting on government, magistracy, or individuals.\u201d People v. Crosswell [Croswell], 3 Johns. [Cas.] (N.Y.) 337. Equipped with this brocard our State courts working in co-operation with juries, whose attitude usually reflected the robustiousness of American political discussion before the Civil War, gradually wrote into the common law of the States the principles of \u201cqualified privilege,\u201d which is a notification to plaintiffs in libel suits that if they are unlucky enough to be officeholders or office seekers, they must be prepared to shoulder the almost impossible burden of showing defendant\u2019s \u201cspecial malice.\u201d Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, Chap.

SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AuN\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Judge Tamm\u2019s opinion contains a careful articulation of the facts of this case and an excellent exposition of the applicable law. While I am not necessarily in agreement with all his apprais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>als of the actions of the people concerned with this litigation, including counsel and the hearing examiner, I concur in his decision affirming the Commission on the ground that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s finding that appellant misrepresented its program plans and thus consciously deceived the Commission. This finding was a separate ground for denial of renewal by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">If this case did not involve an unpopular fundamentalist preacher, for me it would be an easy one indeed. The application to transfer the WXUR license was granted on specific representations of appellant as to programming and with a special warning that appellant must comply with its responsibilities under the law as a public licensee. The Commission felt that a special warning was required because opponents of the transfer, representing a substantial segment of the public served by the license, strongly argued that appellant, if granted the license, would not comply with the law. In spite of the warning and the circumstances surrounding the transfer generally, appellant proceeded to treat its public license as though it were its private property unencumbered by public obligations. It not only deceived the Commission as to its programming, but it ignored the Commission\u2019s warning with respect to fairness in the operation of the station. In effect it simply defied the Commission. Under the circumstances the Commission\u2019s action unquestionably has substantial support in the record. Universal Camera Corp v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">But because the Commission\u2019s ruling has the possible effect of suppressing the ventilation of views with which there might be substantial disagreement, its action in denying renewal of the license requires particularly careful scrutiny. As Judge Tamm\u2019s opinion makes clear, in such a case it is not enough simply to find that substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole supports the Commission and there was no abuse of discretion. In these circumstances the court itself should make its own evaluation of the evidence to insure that First Amendment freedoms of the licensee and the public are fully and fairly taken into account in the decision making process. <em>See </em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 187-190, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L. Ed.2d 793 (1964); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 271, 71 S.Ct. 325, 328, 95 L.Ed. 267, 280 (1951); Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252, 271, 62 S.Ct. 190, 86 L.Ed. 192 (1941). So doing, I cannot say that the Commission erred in denying the renewal application in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Chief Judge BAZELON concurs in affirming the decision of the FCC solely on the ground that the licensee deliberately withheld information about its programming plans. A full statement of his views will issue at a later date.</p>\n<author id=\"b123-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">On September 25, 1972, the judgment of this court was filed affirming the action of the Commission in this case on the ground of deception in the acquisition of a broadcasting license. Chief Judge Bazelon also concurred \u201cin affirming the decision of the FCC solely on the ground that the licensee deliberately withheld information about its programming plans.\u201d He stated further that \u201c[a] full statement of his views will issue at a later date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Chief Judge Bazelon now files a dissenting opinion. That opinion follows immediately on p. 63. Circuit Judge J. SKELLY WRIGHT files a response, with the concurrence of Circuit Judge TAMM, which follows on p. 80.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b123-12\">BAZELON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AW5\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">In this case I am faced with a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the First Amendment. The Federal Communications Commission has subjected Brandywine to the supreme penalty: it may no longer operate as a radio broadcast station. In si<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>lencing WXUR, the Commission has dealt a death blow to the licensee\u2019s freedoms of speech and press. Furthermore, it has denied the listening public access to the expression of many controversial \u2019 views. Yet, the Commission would have us approve this action in the name of the fairness doctrine, the constitutional validity of which is premised on the argument that its enforcement will <em>enhance </em>public access to a marketplace of ideas without serious infringement of the First Amendment rights of individual broadcasters.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">This paradoxical result is sustained only by a faith in the argument that, despite some short-term casualties along the way, long-term enforcement of the fairness doctrine\u2019s obligations is the only means to achieve the marketplace ideal. But if we are to go after gnats with a sledgehammer like the fairness doctrine, we ought at least to look at what else is smashed beneath our blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Our perception of the need for broadcasting regulation has not, in Judge Tamm\u2019s words, \u201cseriously been questioned in over fifty years.\u201d A re-examination of the value, purposes and effects of the fairness doctrine raises for me such serious doubts about the constitutionality of its application here that I am compelled to withhold my affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Instead, I would remand to the FCC for a searching inquiry into the factual issues and alternative policies<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raised within the constitutional framework outlined below, before we can even begin to answer the question: does silencing WXUR in the name of the fairness doctrine violate the First Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The entire field of governmental regulation of broadcast communication is so fraught with competing interests and uncertain results, and the shifting balance of First Amendment freedoms offers so few definite guidelines in this area, that there is no easy answer to this question. My Brother Tamm has written a lengthy, detailed opinion which carefully applies Commission regulations to the facts of this case; there was perhaps a time when I could concur fully with his conclusions. But I fear that ancient assumptions and crystallized rules have blinded all of us to the depth of the First Amendment issues involved here. In affirming the Commission, Judge Tamm relied on its application of the fairness doctrine and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>WOKO. </em>Judge Wright, on the other hand, relied only on <em>WOKO. </em>But I must dissent on both counts. My purpose in writing a separate opinion is to try to come to grips with the conceptual underpinnings which have led the Commission to such ironic consequences in the case before me.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">I begin with a discussion of the standards according to which regulation of broadcasting by the federal government must be judged. And I say \u201cjudged\u201d, because it is the particular duty and function of this court to test all federal regulation of speech and press against the mandates of our Constitution. The \u201cpublic interest\u201d, the standard under which the FCC operates, cannot be divorced from our contemporary understanding and interpretation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">The purpose of the First Amendment is to preserve an \u201cuninhibited marketplace of ideas.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Its language presupposes the general concept that the marketplace is best preserved by protecting the right of each <em>individual </em>to speak freely; that \u201cthe fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>coerced silence, or governmentally directed discussion. Thus, \u201cthe First Amendment does not speak equivocally. It prohibits any law \u2018abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Such has always been the logic behind our strict protection of the freedom of the press to disseminate news and views on public issues from the imposition of governmental burdens or regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The First Amendment's mandate that freedom for the individual is the only means to achieve the marketplace ideal of an informed American public \u201c[t]o many ... is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-19\">Of course, there have been exceptions to this general proposition. There is a need to accommodate other societal interests: as Mr. Justice Holmes said in Schenck v. United States, \u201c[t]he most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government may also act affirmatively to regulate behavior which directly threatens the free speech of others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> New types of regulation which promote effective communication may be required: \u201cthe various forms of modern so-called \u2018mass communications\u2019 raise issues that were not implied in the meaning of communication known to Franklin and Jefferson and Madison.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Regulations which are designed to make the system function effectively may have an adverse impact on a particular individual\u2019s rights. But abridgement of individual rights may be tolerated only when in the long run it enhances the right of the public to receive access to the marketplace of diverse views. Obviously this requires a delicate balancing: any harm to private rights must be outweighed by benefit to the public.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">This balancing process has been applied to regulation of the broadcast industry,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> although in its infancy radio enjoyed the same freedom as the printed press: that is, \u201canyone who will may transmit.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The 1912 Radio Act gave no discretion to the Secretary of Commerce in the granting of broadcast licenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But by the 1920s the number of broadcasters had increased so dramatically that every \u201cchannel\u201d was occupied by at least one station, some by several. The resulting chaos \u201cshook the broadcasting world and left an indelible impression of the dangers of non-regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-17\">By 1927 it had become clear that private over-use of the airwaves threatened the public\u2019s right to listen to what was being said. \u201cWith everybody on the air, nobody could be heard.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Some conditions had to be set by Congress to restrict use of the broadcast medium\u2014 conditions which <em>created </em>the scarcity of the resource which has come to be the outstanding characteristic of the industry.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Unlike other modes of expression, radio inherently is not available to all. That is its unique characteristic, and that is why, unlike other modes of expression, it is subject to governmental regulation. Because it cannot be used by all, some who wish to use it must be denied.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Only because <em>private </em>rights of access to the air had to be limited, was it feared that the <em>public\u2019s </em>right of access to a robust marketplace of ideas would be endangered.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Congress authorized the newly-created Commission to insure that broadcasters operate \u201cin the public interest\u201d \u2014 a duty which had never been imposed on the printed media. But Congress did \u201cnot license the Commission to scan the airwaves for offensive material with no more discriminating a lens than the 'public interest\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Each new form of regulation which departed from the strict \u201chands-off\u201d policy ordered by the First Amendment required a careful balancing of private vs. public rights in light of the paramount goal of a marketplace of ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">Many reasons have been given for the regulation of broadcasting.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But behind all formulations lies the simple fact that a broadcast license is a scarce resource. Regulation by government cannot, under the First Amendment, be divorced from the threat to the marketplace posed by the <em>unique </em>characteristic of scarcity. The temptation is, however, to rely on familiar formulas to justify' new regulations, even where they may not be justified by the First Amendment test.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">For instance, it is often stated as a foregone conclusion that a \u201cbroadcast license is a public trust subject to termination for breach of duty\u201d, <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that the public may attach whatever conditions it believes necessary to protect its interest. Certainly government might claim ownership of the airwaves, just as it has claimed ownership of parks and streets and postal facilities, for the public good. But it cannot, unlike a private owner, place restraints upon the First Amendment rights of those who use this property simply by declaring \u201cI own it.\u201d The very fact of public ownership or control brings into play the First Amendment, which requires that governmental authority may not be used in and of itself to justify deprivation of freedoms of speech and press.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Were it otherwise, these constitutional protections would fall to the caprice of governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">There is some usefulness in the \u201cpublic trust\u201d terminology only if it is understood to be derived from technical scarcity in the broadcast industry. To the extent that government can and must impose restrictions upon licensees in order to deal with the problems posed by scarcity, a broadcast licensee is a trustee. But the scope of the trust duties cannot be extended beyond what is required to preserve the marketplace of ideas from the dangers which scarcity may threaten. Thus the term \u201cpublic trust\u201d expresses the result of a complicated process of constitutional reasoning by a deceptively simple formula. It is a conclusory label dangerously applied without reference to its history or derivation, and has no constitutional weight of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">As we have stated before:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">First Amendment complaints against FCC regulation of content are not adequately answered by mere recitation of the technically imposed necessity for <em>some </em>regulation of broadcasting and the conclusory propositions that \u201cthe public owns the airwaves\u201d and the broadcast license is a \u201crevocable privilege\u201d. It may well be that some venerable FCC policies cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny in the light of contemporary understanding of the First Amendment and the modern proliferation of broadcasting outlets.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Brandywine\u2019s First Amendment complaints require that the fairness doctrine be subjected to constitutional scrutiny far more searching than either the Commission or my Brother Tamm provides. The FCC, fresh from its vindication in <em>Red Lion, </em>focused only on whether WXUR had in fact violated certain fairness obligations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Judge Tamm also relied on <em>Red Lion </em>to set the constitutional balance in favor of a fairness doctrine: if fairness obligations <em>could </em>constitutionally be imposed, the imposition <em>must </em>be constitutional in this case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">But the facts cry out otherwise. WXUR was no doubt devoted to a particular religious and political philosophy; but it was also a radio station devoted to speaking out and stirring debate on controversial issues.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The station was purchased by Faith Theological Seminary to propagate a viewpoint which was not being heard in the greater Philadelphia area. The record is clear that through its interview and call-in shows it <em>did </em>offer a variety of opinions on a broad range of public issues; and that it never refused to lend its broadcast facilities to spokesmen of conflicting viewpoints.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-21\">The Commission\u2019s strict rendering of fairness requirements, as developed in its decision,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> has removed WXUR from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the air. This has deprived the listening public not only of a viewpoint but also of robust debate on innumerable controversial issues. It is beyond dispute that the public has <em>lost </em>access to information and ideas. This is not a loss to be taken lightly, however unpopular or disruptive we might judge these ideas to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Furthermore, even if WXUR had not been removed from the air but simply ordered to comply with the FCC\u2019s ruling, the effect would have been strangulation. There was testimony that the monitoring procedures which the FCC required for identification of controversial issues are beyond the capacity of a small staff, or a shoestring operation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The ratio of \u201creply time\u201d required for every issue discussed would have forced WXUR to censor its views \u2014 to decrease the number of issues it discussed, or to decrease the intensity of its presentation. The ramifications of this chilling effect will be felt by every broadcaster who simply has a lot to say.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus the result in this case, and the rules it establishes, seem to move us a step backwards, away from the First Amendment\u2019s marketplace ideal, in the name of the fairness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">When we see what is being lost as the result of a single blow of this doctrinal sledgehammer, I can only assume that the FCC must be relying on the assumption that the public interest will be served in the <em>long run </em>through strict enforcement of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">What troubles me most is that the FCC and Judge Tamm apparently see no need to question this underlying assumption. The FCC is perhaps too busy applying and enforcing what it sees to be the necessities of the fairness doctrine theory. But I think the time is overripe to take our blinders off and look further toward First Amendment goals than the next regulatory step which the FCC urges us to take in the name of fairness. Ease of administration is of no weight in this field where precious constitutional freedoms hang in the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">Nor can we simply hang our hats on <em>Red Lion </em>and relax. The Supreme Court deliberately withheld its approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of all other aspects of the fairness doctrine, and even of further applications of the very rules it was in general approving.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The constitutional validity of each and every application of the doctrine must be tested on its own, on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We must not be guilty of pouring concrete around foundation of a doctrine which enhances the public\u2019s right of access in some circumstances but abridges that right in others.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The theory of the fairness doctrine\u2014 that the paramount right of the public under the First Amendment can only be achieved by limiting the rights of individuals so that everybody talks about everything from every point of view \u2014 has rested for so long on so many assumptions that any alternative is now hard to imagine.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But the logic which alone can justify silencing WXUR requires that this theory be re-examined in light of the narrow constitutional test outlined in Part I above.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">The fairness doctrine is a venerable FCC policy which originated in an era when our fears about the effects of scarcity on the public\u2019s right of access far outweighed what we understood would be the doctrine\u2019s <em>minimal </em>encroachment on private First Amendment freedoms. In fact, our belief that government could beneficently regulate a communications medium within the confines of the First Amendment can only be understood in its historical context.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">At the turn of the century, there were doubts about whether the First Amendment even applied to radio. After all, radio came into the world as a magic box analogized to the telegraph.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>1912, broadcasting was an \u201cundisclosed art.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> By 1927 the magic box was a household word, but it still held no legitimacy as press. Rather, radio was entertainment, and it was then perhaps justifiable to ask what entertainment had to do with the First Amendment. In 1928 the Radio Commission had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">. The Commission is unable to see that the guaranty of freedom of speech has anything to do with entertainment programs as such. Since there are only a limited number of channels and since an excessive number of stations desire to broadcast over these channels, the commission believes it is entitled to consider the program service of the various applicants, to compare them and to favor those which render the best service. Second Annual Report of F.R.C. 160 (1928).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The Commission\u2019s notion that entertainment was divorced from the First Amendment was not inaccurate in 1928. The Supreme Court had in 1915 upheld a state statute establishing censorship of motion picture films.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Not until 1952 did the Court establish that movies were within the protection of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Early court decisions affirming the power of the Commission to regulate on the basis of programming were grounded on the established power of Congress to regulate commerce and gave short shrift to the First Amendment by today\u2019s standards.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Broadcasters themselves were viewed as entertainers rather than responsible journalists; certainly they were not \u201cnewsmen\u201d. The Commission felt justified in imposing upon these neophytes a series of obligations to insure that they would act \u201cresponsibly\u201d in the public interest. In 1941 the Federal Communications Commission determined that broadcasters could not editorialize.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In 1949 the Commission reversed itself and required that broadcasters <em>must </em>edi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>torialize.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In each case, of course, the the Commission was motivated by a peculiar distrust of broadcast journalists as opposed to those who reported in print. \u201cNews\u201d was still the business of newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Today we have arrived at different constitutional definitions as to what is protected speech.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Certainly, broadcasting is included.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> But perhaps more significant is the fact that most Americans now consider television and radio to be their most important news source.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Broadcast journalists have grown up. They see it as in their interest to be guided by the same professional standards of \u201cfairness\u201d as the printed press.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> There is no factual basis for continuing to distinguish the printed from the electronic press as the true news media.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">Our fears of an unregulated broadcast industry in 1927 did focus on the scarcity of the resource. It was argued that the limited facilities would make it a natural monopoly, in distinct contrast with the flourishing competition among printed media.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> It was feared that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>effects of this monopoly would be to silence a diversity of opinion, so the Commission determined that diversity would be enforced by governmental regulations. Some of these took the form of ownership and network restrictions, but these efforts remained largely incomplete.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> So the fairness doctrine focused on the responsibility of each \u201cmonopolist\u201d to present views in contrast with his own so that the public would not be misled.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Today, our fears of a broadcasting monopoly seem dated. The number of commercial broadcasting stations on the air as of September, 1972, was 7,458. As of January 1, 1971, daily newspapers totaled only 1,749.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Nearly every American city receives a number of different television and radio signals. Radio licensees represent diverse ownership; UHF, local and public broadcasting offer contrast to the three competing networks; neither broadcasting spectrum is completely filled. But out of 1,400 newspaper cities, there are only fifteen left with face-to-face competition.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">This is not to say that scarcity is only a problem of the past. In <em>Red Lion, </em>the Supreme Court premised its analysis on the reality of the existing limitations of the resource.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> There are also a variety of new arguments being raised about the lack of access for minority groups which have not yet been dealt with by the Court.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> But <em>Red Lion </em>cannot be read as the final word on scarcity: the cable technology of the future was not even mentioned in the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>It is a fact that with <em>existing equipment and technology </em>\u201ca single coaxial [tv] cable can carry between 28 and 36 channels of television, plus the entire AM and FM radio bands and a quantity of other non-visual electronic signals.\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark> It is predicted that in perhaps 10 years it will be possible to provide to the television viewer 400 channels;<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> that by 1980 half the nation will be on cable television; and that a host of educational and public services will accompany the cable revolution which are simply mind-boggling.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">Thus, even now we possess the know-how to do away with technical scarcity through CATV.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The costs of laying cable may at <em>some point </em>be prohibitive, but this is to say no more than that there may be severe economic limitations to obtaining a cable station \u2014 economic limitations which affect the printed media equally severely.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Is it not a little ironic that we still adhere to our fears of monopoly and limited access? Ought we not instead focus our attention on how we can make the cable medium economically accessible to those who assert a right to use it ? <footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Scarcity raised still another fear in the early days of broadcasting \u2014 that of broadcasters, licensed by a Commission of political appointees, who would propagandize political viewpoints and privately censor all opposition.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The spur of the fairness doctrine was thus justified as encouraging \u201cfair\u201d discussion of pub-lice issues, and the Commission was seen as the even-handed arbiter of \u201cfairness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">Yet we are told today, by highly respected members of the newspaper and broadcasting corps, that governmental regulation of broadcasting has been more pernicious than any group of private censors.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Some of the \u201cchilling\u201d effects of the threat of FCC intervention, which the broadcasters say have operated to suppress discussion of controversial views and ambitious journalism, remain hidden from the public eye.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Red Lion </em>dismissed this issue as speculative,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> but this cannot be the final word. Facts can change, and so can our perception of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Some chilling effects have become quite obvious. In the past years, networks have come under repeated attacks from government spokesmen who did not like the way television reported a variety of hot public issues.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> These attacks did not focus on inaccuracies, but on the \u201cbias\u201d or lack of \u201cfairness\u201d in the presentation. The history of the FCC is itself replete with examples, including Brandywine itself, of the controversial viewpoint being screened out in favor of the dreary blandness of a more acceptable opinion.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In the context of broadcasting today, our democratic reliance on a truly informed American public is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>threatened if the overall effect of the fairness doctrine is the very censorship of controversy which it was promulgated to overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">A final word on the crucial impact of the broadcasting media. Early in the history of regulation the fear was expressed that broadcasting might be dangerous because of its unique potential for influence and control.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> And Judge Tamm seems to warn that because we are \u201cshifting our emphasis from the printed media to the electronic media\u201d the need for governmental regulation has grown greater. Often it is difficult to unravel this argument from fear of monopoly control. But we must be careful to meet it head on, for rightly or wrongly it has become an unexamined prescription for all sorts of government regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">There is no doubt about the unique impact of radio and television.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> But this fact alone does not justify governmental regulation. In fact, quite the contrary. We should recall that the printed press was the <em>only </em>medium of mass communication in the early days of the Republic \u2014 and yet this did not deter our predecessors from passing the First Amendment to prohibit abridgment of its freedoms. If, as has been suggested, we are to focus on the newly acquired role of broadcasting as the 20th century version of the 18th century town meeting or political pamphlet, we must be all the more careful to preserve a \u201cfree press\u201d in the broadcast media. To argue that a more effective press requires a more regulated press flies in the face of what history has taught us about the values and purposes of protecting the individual\u2019s freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">We once stated that \u201c[i]f the fairness doctrine cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny, the reason is that to insure a <em>balanced </em>presentation of controversial issues may be to insure no presentation, or no vigorous presentation, at all.\u201d <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> An examination of the facts of this ease and the history of regulation which has brought us here raise for me serious doubts about the correctness of continuing to rely primarily on the fairn\u00e9ss doctrine as the proper means of insuring First Amendment goals. The plain truth is that to uphold the Commission\u2019s fairness ruling, not only must we bless again the road we have trav-elled in the past, we must go farther; for this will be the first time that the FCC has denied a license renewal because of fairness doctrine obligations.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">Whether in this case the Commission has simply taken the doctrine too far or applied it 'too rigidly, or whether the trouble lies deeper, cannot be determined without a remand. Even now the FCC has begun a long inquiry into a question we face here: Do fairness policies truly promote a marketplace of uninhibited, wide and robust debate ? <footnotemark>68</footnotemark> It is proper that this court urge the Commission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>reconsider this ease in light of its fairness hearings; that we encourage the Commission to draw back and consider whether time and technology have so eroded the necessity for governmental imposition of fairness obligations that the doctrine has come to defeat its purposes in a variety of circumstances; that we ask whether an alternative does not suggest itself \u2014 whether, as with printed press, more freedom for the individual broadcaster would enhance, rather than retard, the public\u2019s right to a marketplace of ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">I originally authorized issuance of the opinions of the court with my concurrence resting on the narrow ledge of Brandywine\u2019s misrepresentations under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in F.C.C. v. WOKO, Inc.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> But it is abundantly clear that the fairness doctrine is the \u201ccentral aspect\u201d of this case which even touches the core of the applicability of <em>WOKO. </em>I have therefore concluded that the great weight of First Amendment considerations cannot rest on so narrow a ledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The point to be made is simply that I had originally thought that the alleged misrepresentation could be considered separately from the other issues in the case. But upon closer consideration, it became clear to me that the subject matter of the so-called \u201cdeception\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> is inextricably bound up in the considerations underlying the fairness doctrine. The Commission found one misrepresentation explicitly concerned Brandywine\u2019s efforts to comply with the fairness doctrine. The Commission also found that Brandywine \u201cfailed to adhere to its program proposals in other respects which are relevant to the fairness questions in this case.\u201d 24 F.C.C.2d at 30. Furthermore, in light of my discussion of the changing relationship between the First Amendment and broadcasting, there is some question as to what the FCC may constitutionally ask of applicants with respect to programming plans and adherence to fairness obligations. Thus the application of <em>WOKO </em>raises constitutional questions which cannot be neatly separated, as I had originally thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Fortunately, Justice Jackson provided some precedent for a change of mind when he quoted Baron Bramwell as saying, \u201c \u2018The matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then.\u2019 \u201d McGrath v.

The variety of aspects of American life which are touched by the First Amendment, and the constitutional tests whicli have evolved, are discussed at length in Emerson. <em>See also </em>Hudon, Freedom of Speech and Press in America (1963). There is disagreement over whether a balancing test should apply at all where First Amendment rights are involved. The late Justice Black described this test as having a \u201cfreedom-destroying nature,\u201d Scales v. United States, 367 U.S. 203, 261, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1961). \u201cSince that \u2018test\u2019 denies that any speech, publication or petition has an \u2018absolute\u2019 right to protection under the First Amendment, strict adherence to it would . . . mean that there would be only a conditional right, not a complete right, for any American to express his views to his neighbors \u2014 or for his neighbors to hear those views.\u201d Konigsberg v.

Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 69 S.Ct. 684, 93 L.Ed. 834 (1949), which may, in itself, suggest that some balancoing is required. <em>See </em>Nutting, Is the First Amendment Obsolete?, 30 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 167, 171 (1961). The primary danger of broadly asserting the need to balance interests is that there is a great temptation to reduce a constitutional right to the same weight as every other interest; \u201cmoreover, it has a tendency to tip the scales against the individual,\u201d particularly where the balance sets the individual against the needs of the nation.

Surely no one seriously supposes that the airways are a thing of nature which can be possessed, occupied, or used in any normal sense of the word.

The \u201cspectrum\u201d is a purely artificial, construct of the Commission itself.

Moreover, the problem is not solved simply by bringing into the picture the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions \u2014 that if the government extends the privilege of using the airways to private individuals or groups it cannot attach conditions that violate the First Amendment. Surely the affirmative power of the First Amendment demands that the government make available for general use, as a constitutional right, the most significant medium in our whole system of freedom of expression. The government cannot maintain a monopoly of the airways any more than it can maintain a monopoly of the streets, or of printing presses.

The FCC re-examined tapes of two weeks of Brandywine\u2019s programming and found that these established a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the fairness doctrine, since while Brandywine presented one side of numerous issues, it presented opposing views on only one issue. To override this <em>prima fade </em>showing, Brandywine was required to prove that it had established an acceptable procedure for complying with the doctrine. <em>See </em>Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. F.C.C., 138 U.S.App.D.C. 112, 425 F.2d 543 (1969). The Commission narrowly defined what would be acceptable \u2014 a regular procedure for previewing, monitoring or reviewing its broadcasts; a showing of public announcements inviting the presentation of contrasting views; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>other adequate action to encourage response to specific broadcasts.</p>\n<p id=\"AUp\">Brandywine\u2019s methods of compliance\u2014 call-in and interview shows \u2014 were unacceptable to the Commission by their very nature, since callers or speakers were not pre-selected or required to speak on specific and isolated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">Brandywine did show in its petition for rehearing that conflicting and contrasting views had been aired, albeit fortuitously, on its programs outside of the two-week taped period. But the FCC countered this showing with the argument that since the Commissioners had no way of knowing how <em>often </em>Brandywine\u2019s own views were expressed outside the two-week period, they could not determine whether a \u201creasonable ratio\u201d of Brandywine\u2019s time had been devoted to opposing views. The Commission concluded that the station must have failed to \u201ccarry opposing views in any fair ratio\u201d on the basis of the two weeks of tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">It may well be that Brandywine did not meet the stringent standards set by the Commission for this case. But whether these standards find any support in judicial discussion of justifications for the fairness doctrine is entirely another matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b130-13\">.

Basically, it is in recognition of the great contribution which radio can make in the advancement of this purpose that portions of the radio spectrum are allocated to that form of radio communications known as radiobroad-casting. Unquestionably, then, the standard of public interest, convenience and necessity as applied to radio-broadcasting must be interpreted in the light of this basic purpose. The Commission has consequently recognized the necessity for licensees to devote a reasonable percentage of their broadcast time to the presentation of news and programs devoted to the consideration and discussion of public issues of interest in the community served by the particular station. And we have recognized, with respect to such programs, the paramount right of the public in a free society to be informed and to have presented to it for acceptance or rejection the different attitudes and viewpoints concerning these vital and often controversial issues which are held by the various groups which make up the community. It is this right of the public to be informed, rather than any right on the part of the Government, any broadcast licensee or any individual member of the public to broadcast his own particular views on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>any matter, which is the foundation stone of the American system of broadcasting.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b135-5\">.

Access of minority groups to the microphone of mass communication is indeed a serious problem; it is one which exists with respect to newspapers as well as the broadcast media. But the right to hear a countering view does not solve the problem of control of stations or newspapers. In upholding the promulgation of fairness rules in <em>Red Lien, </em>\u201cJustice White found the force of the First Amendment to lie in the right of the public to hear, and he ignored the right of the ordinary citizen to use broadcasting facilities to speak.\u201d Emerson at 664. The fairness doctrine does not <em>necessarily </em>speak to minority rights of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Recently, this court determined that broadcast licensees may not, as a general policy, refuse to sell any of its advertising time to groups or individuals wishing to speak out on controversial public issues. Business Executives\u2019 Move For Vietnam Peace v. F.C.O., 146 U.S.App. D.C. 181, 450 F.2d 642 (1971), cert. granted Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic Nat. Committee, 405 U.S. 953, 92 S.Ct. 1174, 31 L.Ed.2d 230 (1972). This case is now before the Supreme Court. While my opinion today might raise some First Amendment questions with respect to <em>Business Execu-Uves\u2019 Move For Vietnam, Peace, </em>it may be well to note Judge Wright\u2019s statement for this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">It is particularly important that these cases deal only with the public\u2019s First Amendment interests in broadcasters\u2019 allocation of advertising time. They deal only with time relinquished by broadcasters to others; petitioners argue only that, in relinquishing that time, broadcasters must not discriminate against protected expression. In normal programming time, closely controlled and edited by broadcasters, the constellation of constitutional interests would be substantially different. In news and documentary presentations, for example, the broadcasters\u2019 own interests in free speech are very, very strong. . . . The Commission\u2019s fairness doctrine properly leaves licensees broad leeway for professional judgment in that area. But in the allocation of advertising time, the broadcasters have no such strong First Amendment interests. <em>Their </em>speech is not at issue; rather, all that is at issue is their decision as to which other parties will be given an opportunity to speak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-19\"><em>Supra, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. at 198, 450 F. 2d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-21\">It also might well be argued that the economic status of the owners of broadcast stations, or the influence of advertisers, make it unlikely that certain opinions will ever be aired. The fairness doctrine approaches this problem from the perspective of regulating how and what the licensee broadcasts. An alternative approach would be the allocation of access time. <em>See </em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 395 U.S. at 390-391, 89 S.Ct. 1794; Emerson at 663.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b136-4\">.

Are we to consent to the building up of a great publicity vehicle and allow it to be controlled by a few men, and empower those few men to determine what the public shall hear? Facts were brought out before the committee to show that already plans were on foot to buy up and monopolize stations in various areas of the country, and that as high as $100,000 had been paid for the transfer of a broadcasting license; in fact, if I remember correctly, it was intimated that $250,000 was paid in one case.

The problem was noted 15 years ago by Mr. Richard Sal-ant in a speech before the National Association of Broadcasters. Salant explained that following CBS\u2019s interview in 1957 with Premier Khrusehev, the station was deluged with government criticisms and inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">This puts us on the spot before we even get started. No matter what the laws may say about immunity from censorship and about our entitlement to the guarantees of the First Amendment there is always the brooding omnipresence that a broadcaster is a licensee and if he is not a licensee, he cannot be a broadcaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">We are reminded of this basic dilemma with rather frightening regularity. Time and time again we are called to account by those who have, directly or indirectly, power of life and death over us. Every time we deal in our news or public affairs broadcasts with a public controversy concerning which there are strongly contending views, we can at least expect letters from legislators, public officials and private citizens representing important organizations who accuse us of partiality and call on us for an accounting \u2014 line by line and second by second.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">Speech by Richard Salant, Broadcast Licensees and the Freedom of the Press, before National Association of Broadcasters, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-20\">Professor Harry Kalven, after studying CBS\u2019s complete file of FGC complaints covering the period from 1960 to 1964, has said about \u201cregulation by dossier\u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-21\">Think of the outcry if some great daily newspaper were requested by government, and so peremptorily requested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to furnish a justification for printing the views of Walter Ldppmann! To answer a letter is, to be sure, no great burden. But freedom has in no small part depended on awareness of the difference between doing something as a matter of grace and doing it as a matter of obligation. In the end there are two important aspects of the FCC dossier technique. First, it serves to extend the appearance of control far beyond what rulemaking or formal decisions would suggest, and it does so by a process which is really not public and which is awkward to challenge. Second, as Mr. Salant has pointed up, it serves' to create psychologically an atmosphere of surveillance which is destructive of the morale of a free press.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Comments Goodman,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">A timid broadcaster who has gone through one or two of these experiences may think twice before he tackles a subject of strong controversy \u2014 the kind that the public needs most to know about. It is not that he wants to avoid the obligation to be fair. But he knows that where there is controversy, there are advocates who will turn to the FCC, under the umbrella of the Fairness Doctrine, to obtain a broadcasting voice that may bear no relationship to the interest or newsworthiness of their cause. And once they invoke the government process, the broadcaster knows that he must defend himself from second-guessing that will come not from a specialist in journalism, but by a generalist in the government bureaucracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Goodman,- <em>supra, </em>note 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">.

Now he would dissent from that judgment, apparently because he questions the Commission\u2019s reliance on the fairness doctrine in reaching its decision. But the Commission\u2019s decision was based on \u00abtwo grounds: (1) alleged violations of the fairness doctrine by the licensee, and (2) deception and misrepresentations made to the Commission by the licensee in obtaining the license. Judge Bazelon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>states in his dissent that he originally concurred in affirming the Commission because of appellant\u2019s deception and misrepresentations in obtaining the license in the first place. Now he dismisses that ground as too \u201cnarrow a ledge\u201d to rest affirmance of the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">As shown in my separate opinion, I rested my concurrence in the court\u2019s judgment <em>solely </em>on the deception ground. Since Judge Tamm would affirm the Commission on that ground also, that ground, and that ground alone, forms the basis of our judgment. I do not agree that it is too \u201cnarrow a ledge.\u201d Elementary contract principles teach that when a licensee obtains his license by fraud and deception, that license may be voided by the grantor like any other contract may be set at naught for the same reason. I do not believe that a contract is less voidable for deception in its inception simply because the Government is the party deceived. Indeed, since the public is the loser when the Government is deceived, courts should be more, not less, alert in enforcing primary contracting concepts, particularly those based on simple honesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">By resting the court\u2019s judgment in this case on the narrow contract ground, we avoid plunging into the constitutional \u201cthicket\u201d that - is the fairness doctrine. The fairness doctrine is a tortured constitutional area of the law that, as Judge Bazelon recognizes, is under comprehensive study in rule-making proceedings now being conducted by the Commission. Because of the pendency of this study and because courts should not reach out to decide difficult constitutional issues when a narrow nonconsti-tutional ground is available for decision, I voted to affirm the Commission\u2019s action in this case without reaching the constitutional issues involved in an application of the fairness doctrine. I do not think that deception in obtaining a Government license is too narrow a ledge for voiding that license. The Supreme Court flatly so held in F. C. C. v. WOKO, Inc., 329 U.S. 223, 67 S.Ct. 213, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946), and there are no cases holding otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
