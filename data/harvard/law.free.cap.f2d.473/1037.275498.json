I believe that the Tax Court misapplied the law regarding the \u201cimprovements to the leasehold\u201d issue. I understand that the Tax Court, upon finding that the lessee made capital improvements to the leasehold, charged taxpayers with constructive receipt of income dnd based the computation of the amount of that income on the amortized cost of erecting the improvements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>30 CCH Tax Ct.Mem. 467, 476. Section 109 of the Code clearly prevents the Commissioner from charging a lessor- \u2014 \u2022 at the time improvements are made or at the time the lease terminates \u2014 with the constructive receipt of taxable income merely because the lessee has made improvements on the leasehold.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>M. E. Blatt Co. v. United States, 1938, 305 U.S. 267, 59 S.Ct. 186, 83 L.Ed. 167; Commissioner v. Cunningham, 9 Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 231. But section 109 does not prevent taxing the lessor for the value he receives when the lessee allows him to <em>use </em>the leasehold for personal purposes during the life of the lease. The taxpayer-lessor constructively receives income when he is given the use of the property, but the value of that use is not necessarily related in any way to the cost of erecting the improvements. M. E. Blatt Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>305 U.S. at 277-279, 59 S.Ct. 186, 83 L.Ed. at 170-172. Rather, the value received by the taxpayer-lessor should be computed on the basis of the fair market value of <em>using </em>the property <em>as </em>improved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would remand for a factual finding of that value.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">. Based upon its finding that taxpayers used the leased premises for personal, as opposed to business, purposes in a ratio of 40 percent to 60 percent, the Tax Court assigned to taxpayers as taxable income 40 percent of the value found; i. e., the amortized cost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">. Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 109 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-15\">\u201cGross income does not include income (other than rent) derived by a lessor of real property on the termination of a lease, representing the value of such property attributable to buildings ereet-ed or other improvements made by the lessee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1098-18\">. The lessor\u2019s income derived from <em>ownership </em>of the improvements is exempted from taxation until he sells the property by \u00a7 109. The lessor\u2019s income derived from <em>use </em>of the improvements during the life of the lease is taxable as constructively received income. The <em>Oohan </em>reasoning applied by the Tax Court is, of course, still applicable. Thus, taxpayers here have constructively received 40 percent of the value of using the property as improved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
