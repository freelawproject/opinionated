Hines, who was convicted of attempted burglary in 1969 and who is currently serving a life sentence imposed pursuant to the Texas habitual offender statute, Vernon\u2019s Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 63. Appellant\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, Hines v. State of Texas, Tex.Cr. App.1970, 458 S.W.2d 666, and after exhausting his state remedies, appellant brought the instant habeas action alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had been \u201csubjected to an unconstitutional identification process.\u201d The United States. District Court studied the record and denied relief without having conducted an evidentiary hearing, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">Appellant\u2019s primary contention is that the complaining witness had been taken by the police to appellant\u2019s place of employment, where the witness identified appellant as the would-be burglar, and that as a result of this allegedly illegal out-of-court identification, the witness\u2019 subsequent in-court identification of appellant was so tainted as to render its use impermissible. The State of Texas insists that regardless of whether the earlier identification process was constitutionally infirm, appellant is not entitled to relief if the in-court identification was independent of and not influenced or tainted by the improper \u201clineup.\u201d We agree, and we thus need not decide whether the first identification procedure can pass constitutional muster. We have only recently had this precise point before us in Robinson v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir. 1972, 469 F.2d 690, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-17\">\u201cUnited States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, [87 S.Ct. 1926], 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, [87 S.Ct. 1951],. 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), do not apply, since the lineup was held prior to institution of the judicial criminal proceedings against him. Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, [92 S.Ct. 1877], 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972). However, he is entitled to relief if the identification procedures were \u2018so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u2019 as to be a denial of due process. Stoval v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, [87 S.Ct. 1967], 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967) .... [Assuming that the line-up was not fairly conducted, a] determination is then required as to whether the in-court identification was influenced by the suggestive line-up. Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, [89 S.Ct. 1127], 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>The court below studied both the record and what was said by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and concluded that \u201cthe record permits an informed judgment that the in-court identification was of independent and untainted origin.\u201d That finding is not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d <em>e. g., </em>Carroll v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 61, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 854, 90 S.Ct. 115, 24 L.Ed.2d 103; accordingly, the case must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
