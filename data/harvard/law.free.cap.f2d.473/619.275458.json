After finding Summerfield, the uninsured motorist, guilty of five counts of negligence, the district court entered a judgment for $56,830, exclusive of costs, penalty interest, and regular interest from the date of judment. Twin City appealed from the findings of negligence and from various portions of the award of damages. TransAmerica Insurance Company, the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier for Mr. Bogart's employer, who intervened in the court below, appealed from the district court\u2019s refusal to allow it subrogation rights so that it could recover the $16,150.13 in benefits it had previously paid the Bo-garts. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">On January 16, 1970, Mr. and Mrs. Bogart and their children left their home in Tyler, Texas, and drove west on Interstate Highway 20 toward Dallas, where Mr. Bogart was to attend a United Press meeting on behalf of his employer. As they neared Dallas, an intoxicated driver entered the eastbound lanes by means of an exit ramp and proceeded to drive westbound into the face of oncoming traffic. Several automobiles avoided this errant vehicle and managed to pull over to the side of the highway. The Summerfield automobile, traveling eastbound, also was able to miss this vehicle, but in the process swerved to the right and then careened back to the left, crossed the median strip and crashed into the Bogarts\u2019 1970 Plymouth. Mr. Bogart and Summerfield were killed in the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">At the time of the accident the Bogarts owned two automobiles, a 1970 Plymouth and a 1966 Ford Mustang, and insured them both under a single policy issued by Twin City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This policy included protection against uninsured motorists as required under Texas law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although questioned in the court below, it is now accepted that Summerfield was an uninsured motorist operating an uninsured automobile, as those terms are defined in the Twin City policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">II. <em>Findings of Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-20\">The district court, after a non-jury trial devoted largely to reeonstruct-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ing the actions of the various vehicles prior to the Bogart-Summerfield collision, found that Summerfield was guilty of five counts of negligence: (1) failing to maintain a proper lookout; (2) failing to make a reasonable application of the brakes on her automobile; (3) causing or permitting her automobile to proceed to its left; (4) failing to keep and maintain her automobile under reasonable control; and (5) causing her automobile to cross over the dividing section of 1-20 in violation of section 62, article 6701d, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Tex.Civ.St.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a careful review of the record we find ourselves with no \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d Chaney v. City of Galveston, 5 Cir.1966, 368 F.2d 774, 776. Instead, there is ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Summer-field acted negligently and proximately caused the accident and the findings of fact upon which this conclusion was rendered are not clearly erroneous. Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">III. <em>Stacking of Policy Limits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Having affirmed the district court\u2019s findings of negligence, the most important question that relates to the extent of Twin City\u2019s liability is whether the Bogarts should be allowed to \u201cstack\u201d or \u201cpyramid\u201d the policy\u2019s limitation of liability by virtue of the fact that the family had paid premiums for uninsured motorists coverage on two separate automobiles under the same policy. The policy in effect at the time of the accident limited Twin City\u2019s liability for bodily injuries to $10,000 for each person, not to exceed $20,000 for each occurrence. To obtain this coverage on the 1970 Plymouth, which was automobile #1 under the policy, the Bo-garts paid a $4.00 premium. Up to the stated limits, this $4.00 provided coverage for the named insured and any relative, and for any other person while occupying an insured automobile; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> these people were protected against bodily injuries, including death, \u201ccaused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of [an] uninsured automobile.\u201d From the policy it is clear that a nonrelative must be injured in \u201can insured automobile\u201d in order to recover, but, in the absence of a similar limitation applicable to the named insured or a relative, Twin City covers them regardless of where injured by an uninsured motorist.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This could conceivably occur while on foot, while riding in a non-owned automobile, or, as in this case, while riding in an owned, insured automobile. Given the breadth of this coverage, there is no dispute about the Bogarts recovering under the insurance purchased with respect to automobile #1.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">The difficult question is whether the $3.00 premium paid by the Bogarts to include their 1966 Mustang \u2014 which was automobile #2 \u2014 within the uninsured motorists coverage, also protected them while they were riding in automobile #1. There is no separate section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the policy which details the coverage afforded a second car. Thus, if the problem is analyzed only by looking at the insurance policy itself, we would conclude that the \u00ab$3.00 premium purchased the same insurance for automobile #2 as the $4.00 premium purchased for automobile #1; this would include protection for the named insured and any relative wherever injured by an uninsured motorist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This interpretation, if followed, would require stacking the coverage of the two automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Because this is a diversity action, however, we are not at liberty to decide the case on the basis of our interpretation of the policy; instead we are bound to apply the Texas law and to make an \u201c.Ewe-educated guess\u201d as to what the outcome of this case would have been had it been brought in a Texas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">One of the earliest Texas stacking cases was Southwestern Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Atkins, Tex.Civ.App.1961, 346 S. W.2d 892, in which the plaintiff sought to double the maximum recovery under his medical payments insurance because he had two cars insured under the same policy. He had paid a premium of $8.00 for medical coverage on the first automobile and $7.00 for the coverage on the second. The court allowed stacking because of a \u201ctwo or more automobiles\u201d clause (described in footnote 6) and because separate premiums had been paid for insurance against an event that was not necessarily tied to an accident in either of the automobiles. <em>See also </em>Harlow v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance Co., Tex.Civ.App.1969, 439 S. W.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The Texas Supreme Court in Allstate Insurance Co. v. Zellars, Tex.1970, 462 S.W.2d 550, took the next significant step and denied stacking the limits of liability under non-owned vehicle insurance when the plaintiff was injured in an automobile other than his own. The court seized on the separate premium feature of <em>Atkins </em>and stated: \u201cIf Zel-lars had in fact paid an additional premium for non-owned automobile coverage when he added the second car to his policy, the medical payments cases would lend stronger support to his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556. The <em>Zellars </em>court based the distinction it drew between medical coverage and non-owned vehicle coverage on the decision of this court in Allstate Insurance Co. v. Mole, 5 Cir. 1969, 414 F. 2d 204 (applying Florida law). In <em>Mole </em>it was specifically noted that unlike non-owned vehicle coverage, both medical <em>and uninsured motorists </em>coverage were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">derived from a specifically insured vehicle and a separate premium was paid for each type of insurance on each vehicle .... Moreover both the medical and uninsured motorist protection, though purchased with insurance on a particular vehicle, was [sic] payable whether the insured was injured in that vehicle or some other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Id. at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">The next major development in the stacking of limitations of liability under Texas law was Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. Gatlin, Tex.Civ.App.1971, 470 S.W.2d 924, in which it was held that, despite the existence of an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> an insured could stack the limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of his own uninsured motorists coverage on top of similar coverage in another policy which was applicable to the same accident. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">[W]e hold (1) that our uninsured motorist statute sets a minimum amount of coverage but does not place a limit upon the total amount of recovery so long as that amount does not exceed the amount of actual loss; (2) that where the loss exceeds the limits of one policy, the insured may proceed under the other available policies; (3) and that where uninsured motorist coverage has been provided, we cannot permit an insurer to avoid its statutorily imposed liability by its insertion into the policy of a liability limiting clause which restricts the insured from receiving the benefits of that coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Id. at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Considering the posture of the Texas law on stacking insurance coverage it is hardly surprising that the district court allowed stacking: (1) The Bogarts had clearly paid two premiums for the kind of coverage under which they claimed, which was not the case in <em>Zellars; </em>(2) under the policy, recovery was not tied to injuries sustained while in either automobile, which was the distinguishing factor in <em>Mole; </em>(3) a difference in premiums between automobile #1 and automobile #2, while arguably suggesting reduced coverage for the second automobile, had not bothered the <em>Atkins </em>court at all; and (4) the damages suffered by the Bogarts were sufficient to preclude the double recovery cautioned against in <em>Gatlin. </em>The one potential weakness in the Bogarts\u2019 case seemed to be that the \u201ctwo or more automobiles\u201d clause did not apply to the uninsured motorists section. Although Texas courts have used the applicability of such a clause to bolster the argument for stacking, they have never tackled the problem when such a clause was specifically stated to be inapplicable to the kind of insurance at issue. (See footnote 6). The only impact that this fact could have, however, is that it might create an ambiguity over the otherwise strong case for allowing stacking. Under Texas law this would not require the drawing of a mandatory negative inference, but would trigger the general rule that an uncertainty in the fact or extent of coverage will be strictly construed against the insurance company. <em>See, e. g., </em>Kelley v. American Insurance Co., Tex.Civ.App.1958, 316 S.W.2d 452, 455, aff\u2019d, 1959, 160 Tex. 71, 325 S.W.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Despite the seeming reasonableness of the decision below to allow stacking, we must reverse and hold that, under the facts of this case, stacking would not be allowed in Texas. Six months after the district court\u2019s judgment, the Texas Supreme Court decided a case that presented a fact situation similar to the Bo-garts. American Liberty Insurance Co. v. Ranzau, Tex.1972, 481 S.W.2d 793, aff\u2019g Tex.Civ.App.1971, 473 S.W.2d 249. In <em>Ranzau </em>the plaintiff had been injured when the non-owned vehicle in which she was riding was struck by an uninsured motorist. Because the plaintiff\u2019s father owned, and insured under the same policy, two cars, for which he had paid $4.-00 and $3.00 respectively in order to ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tain uninsured motorists coverage, the plaintiff sought to double the stated limit of coverage. The supreme court, analogizing recovery sought under uninsured motorists coverage for injuries suffered in a non-owned automobile with recovery sought under non-owned vehicle coverage for injuries suffered in such an automobile, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">We agree with the court of civil appeals that Ranzau did not pay an additional premium for or acquire added non-owned automobile protection from an uninsured motorist when he paid the premium of $3.00 for uninsured motorist coverage on the second owned automobile and hence this payment cannot serve as a basis for holding that he has double coverage and can recover two policy limits of $10,000 for injury to one person. Ranzau received such coverage under the basic policy and the premium charged there-' for, whether or not the policy covered one or many owned automobiles, and without the payment of an additional premium upon the addition of owned automobiles. . . . Moreover, there was consideration for the extra premium of $3.00 upon the addition of the second owned automobile in the protection afforded Ranzau if an insured, while using the second owned automobile, suffered damages at the hands of an uninsured motorist . [The allowance of stacking] could only follow from proof that a premium was charged and paid for this additional risk exposure and protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Id. at 797-798 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">Thus, the burden of proof is on the <em>insured </em>to show exactly what coverage he has purchased when he pays a premium for a second automobile under the uninsured motorists section of his policy. The fact that his policy gives no clear warning to a layman of any different coverage on the second automobile apparently is not sufficient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold that the Bogarts have not demonstrated that they paid two premiums for insurance which would cover them if injured in automobile # 1 as the result of an accident caused by an uninsured motorist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>IV. <em>Medical Payments Offset</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">With the Bogarts\u2019 <em>maximum </em>recovery under their uninsured motorists insurance limited to $10,000 per person, not to exceed $20,000 per occurrence, we now turn to a consideration of whether the $10,000/$20,000 figures are also <em>m\u00ednimums.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Under the \u201cExpenses for Medical Services\u201d section of the policy, Twin City becomes liable when, among other things, the named insured or any relative suffers bodily injury as a result of an accident occurring while he or she is occupying an owned automobile. The limit of liability is $500 per person and Twin City admitted liability to Mrs. Bogart and her two children of $1,500. Because of the Texas cases allowing the stacking of medical payments limitations <em>(Atkins </em>and <em>Harlow, supra), </em>the district court doubled the amount recoverable to $3,000 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and this portion of the judgment is not attacked. Twin City argues, however, that any sums paid to the Bogarts under the medical expenses section of the policy must be offset against its total liability under the uninsured motorists section. It bases this argument on a clause in the uninsured motorists section of its policy which states :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">The Company shall not be obligated to pay under this Coverage that part of the damages which the insured may be entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile which represents expenses for medical services paid or payable under Section II [the medical payments section] .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">This question is one upon which no Texas appellate court has yet ruled. Nevertheless, there have been several significant decisions which point the way and which require us to hold that the above quoted clause is void as being contrary to the policy underlying article 5.06 \u2014 1, V.A.T.S., <em>supra </em>footnote 2. The principal Texas case is Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. Gatlin, Tex.Civ.App.1971, 470 S.W.2d 924, which considered the effect that an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause would have on uninsured motorists coverage. That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">Our [uninsured motorists insurance] law was obviously enacted by our Legislature for the benefit of the innocent victim of a financially irresponsible motorist. It should be liberally construed to fully accomplish that purpose. By enacting the law the Legislature did not attempt to fix any maximum limit of recovery but merely established a minimum requirement. The statute is plain in its direction that each policy of insurance issued must contain uninsured motorist protection in minimum amounts, without qualification, and it necessarily follows that any attempt on the part of an insurer to limit the effect of such provision must be held to be in derogation of the statute itself. It would be unconscionable to permit insurers to collect a premium for a coverage which they are required by statute to provide, and then to avoid payment of a loss because of language of limitation devised by themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">470 S.W.2d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">This practice of voiding such limiting clauses in uninsured motorists insurance policies has been followed by other Texas courts of civil appeals (American Liberty Insurance Co. v. Ranzau, Tex. Civ.App.1971, 473 S.W.2d 249, and Northwestern Mutual Insurance Co. v. Lawson, Tex.Civ.App.1972, 476 S.W.2d 931), and has recently been adopted by the Texas Supreme Court in American Liberty Insurance Co. v. Ranzau, Tex. 1972, 481 S.W.2d 793. The <em>Gatlin-Ran-zau </em>rationale also has been used to invalidate a clause which would reduce the recovery under uninsured motorists insurance by the amount of any workmen\u2019s compensation benefits received. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. McMahon, Tex.Civ.App., 1972, 487 S.W.2d 371.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Despite the fact that, unlike <em>Gatlin, </em>the insurance sought to be offset in this case is found in the same policy the reasoning in both cases is identical. The Bogarts have suffered far more in damages than they will now receive in this judgment and this removes any fear of double recovery. Relying on <em>Gatlin, Ranzau, </em>and <em>McMahon, </em>we find that the medical payments offset clause is void as contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Y. <em>Applicability of Statutory Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In addition to seeking recovery under the Twin City policy, the Bogarts asked the district court for, and were awarded, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, 12% of the judgment as a penalty, and penalty interest from the date Twin City should have paid the loss. These sums were added to the judgment under the provisions of articles 3.62 and 3.62 \u2014 1, V.A.T.S., which require them to be paid to an insured whenever insurance companies delay in paying certain kinds of claims against them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Twin City contends that the assessment against it of that portion of these penalties which is attributable to the uninsured motorists recovery was error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Because of the penal nature of both of these statutes, they must be strictly construed and a person \u201cclaiming under [one of them] must bring himself strictly within its provisions.\u201d First Texas Prudential Insurance Co. v. Long, Tex. Com.App.1932, 46 S.W.2d 297, 298. <em>See also </em>McFarland v. Franklin Life Insurance Co., Tex.1967, 416 S.W.2d 378; Key Life Insurance Co. v. Taylor, Tex. Civ.App.1970, 456 S.W.2d 707; Pan American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Tram-mell, Tex.Civ.App.1959, 322 S.W.2d 13. Of the types of insurance companies and policies included within these statutes, only \u201caccident insurance\u201d could be broad enough to cover uninsured motorists protection. A company selling this insurance is defined as one \u201cdoing business under any charter involving the payment of money or other thing of value, conditioned upon the injury, disablement or death of persons resulting from traveling or general accidents by land or water.\u201d Article 3.01, \u00a7 2, V.A.T.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">An examination of the statutory scheme for insurance in the state of Texas and an analysis of the purpose behind articles 3.62 and 3.62 \u2014 1 convince us that no penalty should be attached to the recovery in the uninsured motorists insurance portion of this judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The Texas Insurance Code regulates uninsured motorists insurance under a totally different chapter than it does accident insurance; furthermore motor vehicle insurance, in which class uninsured motorists insurance is found, is generally listed separately from those types of insurance to which the penalty provisions apply. <em>See, e.g., </em>Article 5.13, V. A.T.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Of greater significance, however, is the language in the two articles that makes each applicable to an insurance company which is liable for a <em>loss </em>from an accident but fails to pay it promptly. Although uninsured motorists insurance is first party insurance and may ultimately pay the insured for damages suffered in an accident, the insurer\u2019s liability does not arise solely from the occurrence of \u201cinjury, disablement or death\u201d as it does in a true accident insurance policy. <em>See </em>Dorsey v. Fidelity Union Casualty Co., Tex.Civ.App.1932, 52 S.W. 2d 775. Instead, under uninsured motorists coverage a company agrees to pay a loss <em>if it is caused by an uninsured motorist from whom the insured is legally entitled to recover. </em>Consequently, Twin City did not insure against an accident, but against an accident <em>negligently </em>caused by an uninsured person. The inadvisability of penalizing such an insurer is fully realized by recognizing that \u201c[t]he manifest purpose of the statute is to effect a speedy collection of just claims without diminution.\u201d Boomer v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co., Tex.Civ.App. 1941, 148 S.W.2d 945. Such speed is a laudatory requirement when liability is triggered by the mere happening of a loss, but becomes distinctly inappropriate when a determination of a third person\u2019s negligence and uninsured status must precede the existence of liability. <em>Cf. </em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Hopper, Tex. Civ.App.1950, 237 S.W.2d 411. That portion of the judgment below which awarded statutory penalties on the uninsured motorists insurance recovery is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">VI. <em>Subrogation of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">The final question presented on this appeal is raised by the intervenor, TransAmerica Insurance Company, and concerns whether a workmen\u2019s compensation insurer, who has paid benefits to an employee for injuries suffered in an automobile accident, has a right, in an action by that employee against his uninsured motorist insurance carrier, to subrogate itself to the judgment or a part of it. Because Mr. Bogart was going to Dallas to attend a meeting for his employer, his death en route was in the course and scope of his employment, and TransAmerica paid the Bogarts a total of $16,150.13 in full satisfaction of its liability under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Texas. It then sought to intervene in the present action, was denied any recovery, and brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">TransAmerica bases its argument on article 8307, section 6a, V.A.T.S., which in essence provides that a workmen\u2019s compensation carrier has a right of sub-rogation in any recovery the employee may obtain against the third person who, because of the circumstances under which the accident occurred, has a legal liability to pay damages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>court, however, relied on a clause in the uninsured motorists section of the Twin City policy which stated that nothing should inure to the benefit of any workmen\u2019s compensation carrier,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and found the clause valid because the right of subrogation was said to exist only against a third party who was the tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">TransAmerica\u2019s argument hinges on two word choices in the statute. It argues that the reference to a person with a \u201clegal liability\u201d implies a class larger than the tort-feasors themselves and includes uninsured motorists insurance carriers. This position is bolstered, it contends, by the use of the word \u201cdamages\u201d which is asserted to be that which is paid by a carrier like Twin City when an insured makes a claim after an accident caused by a negligent uninsured motorist. Despite the superficial support for TransAmerica found in parts of section 6a of article 8307, a reading of the statute as a whole and the applicable Texas law convinces us that the argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">A workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier\u2019s right of subrogation, if any, is derived solely from'section 6a of article 8307. Fort Worth Lloyds v. Haygood, Tex.1952, 246 S.W.2d 865; Fidelity Union Casualty Co. v. Texas Power &amp; Light Co., Tex.Civ.App.1931, 35 S.W.2d 782. Under this section the right has been recognized only in actions involving a tort-feasor. In upholding the constitutionality of this section, the Texas Commission of Appeals, in Consolidated Underwriters v. Kirby Lumber Co., Tex. Com.App.1924, 267 S.W. 703, 706, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">The original law could have been considered defective, among other respects, in that there was nothing in it to prevent an employ\u00e9, in ease he were injured <em>by a \u201cthird person,\u201d </em>from receiving both compensation from the insurer and, in addition, full damages for the same injuries from the third person; whereas the insurer in such a case, although having become bound and finally paying the \u201ccompensation,\u201d was not subrogated in respect to the employ\u00e9\u2019s rights <em>against the actual tortfeasor. </em>This situation was, in reason, imperfect; ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acg-dedup-0\">It was doubtless to remedy these defects and supply this juster and more politic substitute that the particular section of the amendment that is now under investigation was passed. It was not to create a liability against the actual tort-feasor; for that already existed. It was doubtless merely to apply that responsibility in such a way as to make the law regulating \u201cemployer\u2019s liability\u201d a better and completer law, by not overcompensating the \u201cemploy\u00e9,\u201d and by reducing the burden of the \u201cinsurance\u201d as to the insurer and its cost as to the \u201cem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ployer,\u201d and ultimately the public. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">This limitation of the section to actions against the actual tort-feasor has been followed by other Texas courts. Fort Worth Lloyds v. Haygood, <em>supra; </em>Evans v. Venglar, Tex.Civ.App.1968, 429 S.W.2d 673; Yeary v. Hinojosa, Tex. Civ.App.1957, 307 S.W.2d 325; Traders &amp; General Insurance Co. v. West Texas Utilities Co., 1942, 140 Tex. 57, 165 S. W.2d 713. The language in these cases makes the basis for such a limitation clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">This statute does not provide for separate causes of action against the third party tort-feasor, one cause in the employee and another in the insurance company. There is but one cause of action against the third party tort-feasor, which belongs to the injured employee, who owns it burdened by the right of the insurance carrier to recoup itself for compensation paid The statute subrogates the carrier to the employee\u2019s rights against the tort-feasor to the extent of the compensation payments, and authorizes it to enforce, in the employee\u2019s name or in its own, the <em>liability </em>of said other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Evans v. Venglar, <em>supra, </em>429 S.W.2d at 675 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The Bogarts\u2019 recovery in the court below was not against the third party tort-feasor and the singular cause of action against that person has been in no way affected so as to prejudice Trans-America\u2019s subrogation right in that action if and when it is brought. Trans-America\u2019s fear of double recovery is similarly baseless: (1) because the double recovery against which section 6a of article 8307 was aimed was recovery first from the carrier and then from the tort-feasor, Consolidated Underwriters v. Kirby Lumber Co., <em>supra; </em>and (2) because the Bogarts have in fact suffered damages far in excess of the sum of the compensation benefits, the medical payments, the penalties appropriate thereto, and the uninsured motorists insurance that they have received or will receive as a result of this judgment. Finally, TransAmerica argues that sub-rogation in this case would reduce the burden of the insurance to the employer and to the public, which was the reason for enacting section 6a of article 8307. <em>See </em>Capitol Aggregates, Inc. v. Great American Insurance Co., Tex.1966, 408 S.W.2d 922. We recognize this as the theory behind the subrogation statute, but that theory cannot be used to create a right of subrogation in a case when under the statute itself there is none available. Because we hold that there is no right of subrogation in this case and because the clause which excludes workmen\u2019s compensation carriers from benefitting under the uninsured motorists section of the Twin City policy is clear and unambiguous, we affirm that portion of the judgment below which states that TransAmerica shall take, have, and recover nothing. '</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">We, therefore, affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the ease to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\">.

Article 5.06 \u2014 1, Insurance Code, V.A.

The policy does contain one stated exception to this broad protection for the insured. It excludes \u201cbodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile <em>(other than an insured automobile) </em>owned by the insured.\u201d (emphasis added). This exclusion does not come into play in this case, however, because both automobiles owned by the Bogarts were insured by the same Twin City policy. <em>But see </em>footnote 9 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">. The policy has a clause which states that \u201c[wjhen two or more automobiles are insured hereunder, the terms of this policy shall apply separately to each.\u201d It is specifically made inapplicable to the uninsured motorists coverage, however. This would leave only the plain language of the Protection Against Uninsured Motorists section to define the coverage purchased by the $3.00 premium, if it could still be said to apply. For a case which specifically considered this question and decided that, on similar facts, the second premium purchased the same coverage see Lips-combe v. Security Ins. Co., 1972, 213 Va. 81, 189 S.E.2d 320. The possible implications under Texas law of not including uninsured motorists protection within this clause are discussed in the text <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b682-14\">. The clause in the <em>Gatlin </em>policy read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aji\">\u201cWith respect to bodily injury to an insured while occupying an insured automobile not owned by the named insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ed, the insurance under Part IV shall apply only as excels insurance available to such automobile as primary insurance, and this insurance shall then apply only in the amount by which the limit of liability for this coverage exceeds the applicable limit of liability of such other insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">Except as provided in the foregoing paragraph, if the insured has other similar insurance available to him and applicable to the accident, the damages shall be deemed not to exceed the higher of the applicable limits of liability of this insurance and such other insurance, and the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss to which this Coverage applies than the limit of liability hereunder bears to the sum of the applicable limits of liability of this insurance and such other insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcG\">470 S.W.2d at 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">This clause is virtually identical to the one in the Twin City policy, but it was not relied on herein in an attempt to limit recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. It is interesting to. note that at the trial in <em>Ranzau </em>the <em>defendant insurance company </em>tried to introduce evidence to explain the $1.00 differential in premium between automobile #1 and automobile #2, but the trial court excluded the evidence after the plaintiff objected to it as irrelevant and as tending to vary the policy by parol. It is still more interesting to note from the bill of exceptions in <em>Ranzau </em>that the defendant\u2019s expert witness on this point explained the $1.00 difference to be attributable to <em>non-owned automobile </em>coverage. 473 S.W.2d at 250-251. There is, however, no similar offer of proof in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Texas court of civil appeals that decided <em>Ranzau </em>has faced the question of stacking policy limits once since that decision. In United Services Automobile Association v. Bratton, Texas Civ.App., No. 15028, Dec. 15, 1971, (unpublished), the court allowed stacking when the insured had purchased two separate policies from the same insurance company for his two automobiles and had paid a $4.00 premium for uninsured motorists coverage on each. Adhering to its decision in <em>Ranzau </em>and untroubled by the fact that the only \u201cother insurance\u201d in this case was issued by the same carrier, the court held that <em>Gatlin </em>precluded the insurer from relying on an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the policies to limit recovery. <em>See </em>footnote 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\">. The incongruity of the Texas decisions is demonstrated by the following hypothetical example: Assume that the Bo-garts had left automobile #1 at home and had driven to Dallas in automobile #2 instead. Assuming the same accident occurred, the Bogarts would have submitted their claim and requested double the $10,000/$20,000 limit. In our opinion the Bogarts would prevail, even under <em>Ranzau. </em>The insurance purchased for automobile #2 with the $3.00 premium would certainly apply to give them one $10,000/$20,000 limit. <em>See </em>481 S.W.2d at 798. Additionally, the $4.00 premium for automobile #1 purchased insurance which protects the family in every case except that described in footnote -5 <em>supra. </em>In fact, that exception (for injuries occurring in an owned but not an insured automobile) supports double recovery in the hypothetical example. It is evident that, but for an unfortunate choice of automobiles, the Bogarts would have been able to stack the limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b685-14\">. Bogart paid $9.00 for medical coverage under automobile #1 and $8.00 for medical coverage under automobile #2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\">. The clause at issue in <em>McMahon </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">(b) Any amount payable under the terms of this endorsement because of bodily injury sustained in an accident by a person who is insured under this coverage shall be reduced by</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">&gt;}c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">(2) the amount paid and the present value of all amounts payable on account of such bodily injury under any workmen\u2019s compensation law, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">The Bogarts\u2019 policy contains an almost identical offset clause, but Twin City has not objected to its not being given effect in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\">. Article 3.62 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-13\">In all cases where a loss occurs and the life insurance company, or accident insurance company, or life and accident, health and accident, or life, health and accident insurance company liable therefor shall fail to pay same within thirty days after demand therefor, such company shall be liable to pay the holder of such policy, in addition to the amount of the loss, twelve (12%) per cent damages on the amount of such loss together with reasonable attorney fees for the prosecution and collection of such loss. Such attorney fee shall be taxed as a part of the costs in the case. The Court in fixing such fees shall take into consideration all benefits to the insured incident to the prosecution of the suit, accrued and to accrue on account of such policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">Article 3.62 \u2014 1, V.A.T.S., essentially makes article 3.62 applicable to other kinds of insurance companies who issue a life, health, or accident policy and it requires payment by these companies within sixty days after the filing of a written proof of loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b686-19\">.
