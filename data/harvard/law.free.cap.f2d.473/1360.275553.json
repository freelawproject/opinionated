The cases involve the same parties with the exception that the surety was sued in the Minnesota case. The Minnesota case subsequently was transferred to North Dakota and the eases although not consolidated were discussed together at a pretrial hearing and disposed of separately in a single unpublished memorandum by the late Judge George S. Register. They involve common questions of law and fact and will be considered to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>gether in this opinion. The cases concern an alleged breach of contract for late delivery of materials by a seller and the refusal of the buyer to pay for the unpaid balance due on the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">In May 1968, Dale Luick, doing business as Luick Construction Company, contracted with Graybar Electric Company to purchase underground cable for $142,514 to be shipped the second week of July 1968 to Badger, Minnesota, for a job with Wickstrom Telephone Company. Graybar, unable to get delivery from its suppliers, did not deliver the cable to Luick in substantial amounts until November 1968. Luick, who was supposed to complete the Wickstrom installation by the end of 1968, did not complete the work until spring 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">In June 1969, Luick and Graybar again contracted for Graybar to sell $214,000 of cable to be delivered on or before August 1, 1969, to Underwood, Minnesota, for a job with Park Region Telephone Company, which was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1969. Graybar could not deliver the cable in substantial amounts until late October 1969. Luick completed the Park Region installation in spring 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">In October 1970, Luick filed suit in the North Dakota state court against Graybar for lost profits, the rental value of his idle equipment, and added construction costs for the Wickstrom and Park Region installations in the approximate amount of $230,000. On Graybar\u2019s motion, the case was removed to the Federal District Court of North Dakota.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Graybar answered denying that it was liable for late delivery damages due to exculpatory clauses allegedly contained in contracts for both installations and counterclaimed for the value of the unpaid materials, $85,864.49. While Luick\u2019s suit was pending, Graybar filed suit against National Surety Corporation, Luick\u2019s bonding company, in Minnesota Federal District Court in December 1970 for the value of the unpaid materials and interest. National Surety answered alleging Luick\u2019s same claim for late delivery damages. This case was transferred to North Dakota on April 1, 1971.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-13\">On July 23, 1971, Graybar, as plaintiff, moved for a summary judgment against National Surety in case No. 72-1217. On March 2, 1972, the District Court, in its unpublished memorandum and order, granted Graybar\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed National Surety\u2019s counterclaim. On the same day and in the same order, the District Court, on its own motion, dismissed Luick\u2019s complaint (No. 72-1216) for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">Since National Surety did not respond to Graybar\u2019s requests for admissions, the validity of Graybar\u2019s claim for materials furnished stands admitted. No real issue has been raised on the delivery or value of the materials furnished. Applying the summary judgment provision of Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., the District Court found that there was \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d In making this conclusion, the District Court found that National Surety did not respond to Graybar\u2019s requests for admissions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a) and therefore admitted all matters contained in the requests. Graybar had requested that National Surety admit that the materials had been delivered for the Park Region job and that Luick owed $85,864.49, as a fair value for the delivered and unpaid materials. These requests were the basis of the Graybar complaint and its counterclaim in Luick\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>Unanswered requests for admissions render the matter requested conclusively established for the purpose of that suit. Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a) and (b). See Moore\u2019s Fed.Prac. \u00a7 36.01(7). Also a summary judgment may be based on admitted matter. Moosman v. Joseph P. Blitz, Inc., 358 F.2d 686, 688 (2d Cir. 1966). We agree with the District Court\u2019s determination on the contract amount owed by Luick to Graybar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">This leaves for consideration the question of whether the late delivery of the materials gave rise to an actionable claim for damages by Luick. We think Luick\u2019s suit for damages raises substantial factual issues that are not properly susceptible of determination in a summary judgment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">Graybar contends that an exculpatory clause <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the alleged contracts exonerated Graybar from any liability for damages due to late delivery, and further that this exelusion-of-remedies clause is valid and enforceable under Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-719 (1965) (a provision of the Uniform Commercial Code in Minnesota).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court held that the exculpatory clauses in the alleged contracts were enforceable, that the late delivery damages were special or consequential under Minnesota law, and, therefore, that Graybar was not liable for the damages attributable to late delivery. This well may be but we don\u2019t think that conclusion can be reached in a summary judgment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-14\">The question of whether these exculpatory clauses are enforceable raises genuine factual issues, since Luick argues that there is a dispute whether these exculpatory clauses were included within the terms and conditions of the purchase contracts. The District Court assumed they were, and, again well they might be, as the exculpatory clauses are in each contract as No. 6 of the printed form on Terms and Conditions of Sale. However, Luick contends otherwise, and from the available record it is unclear exactly what written documents constituted the parties\u2019 contracts. In addition, Luick raises the issue of \u201cuncon-seionability\u201d of the exculpatory clauses. Since Luick has not admitted through any failure to answer a request for admissions that these exculpatory clauses were included in the, contracts, he should be allowed to introduce evidence concerning the formation of the two contracts and the issue of unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-15\">We, therefore, think Luick\u2019s complaint raises factual issues which preclude the issuance of a summary judgment. Parmelee v. Chicago Eye Shield Co., 157 F. 2d 582, 586-587 (8th Cir. 1946). Because of the drastic nature of the summary judgment entry, the right to that judgment must be shown \u201cwith such clarity as to leave no room for controversy . . . [and the other party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>must] not be entitled to recover under any discernible circumstances.\u201d Traylor v. Black, Sivalls &amp; Bryson, Inc., 189 F.2d 213, 216 (8th Cir. 1951); <em>accord, </em>Cervantes v. Times, Inc., 464 F.2d 986, 993 (8th Cir. 1972). In order for us to hold that the summary judgment procedure disposing of Luick\u2019s claim was proper, we would have to rule on the basis of the pleadings and the very limited documents submitted with the motion for summary judgment that Luick\u2019s claim was either a sham, frivolous or unmeritorious. See Annot., 8 A.L.R.3d 1361 (1966). This we cannot do on the present sketchy record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">Although parties to \u00e1 contract may modify, limit, or exclude remedies, they cannot do so unconscionably. Minn. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-719(3) (1965). Luick argues that Graybar knew or should have known that the purchase of the cable would have been impossible from other sources and that exclusion of any damages for late delivery under these circumstances was unconscionable. Although we offer no view on whether Luiek\u2019s claim of unconscionability is valid, he should be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on this issue. Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-302(2) (1965). It is then within the province of the trial court to determine the issue of unconscionability. Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-302 (1965), Official UCC Comment 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">The discussion of one further matter of law is advisable. The District Court held that the late delivery damages claimed by Luick were special or consequential damages under Minnesota law and excluded by the exculpatory clauses. We agree, provided the exculpatory clauses are part of the purchase contracts and are not unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-16\">The District Court properly held that the law of Minnesota applied in determining whether the claimed damages for lost profits, lost rental value for idle equipment, and added costs due to construction during the wet springs were direct or special damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Court held that Minnesota follows the established rule of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Ex. 341, 156 Eng.Rep. 145 (1854), which held that direct damages were those that \u201cmay reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties.\u201d In applying the rule of Hadley v. Baxendale, Minnesota courts have held that loss of rents <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and loss of profits from sales<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are special and not direct damages. According to the rationale of these cases the claimed damages due to late delivery would also be special damages under Minnesota law. Since the damages are special or consequential, the exculpatory clauses, if part of the contracts and not unconscionable, would preclude the defendant from any recovery. Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-719 (3) (1965); Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-715 (1965), Official UCC Comment 3; Minn.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 336.2-719 (1965), Official UCC Comment 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">Our discussion of Luick\u2019s claim is not to.be interpreted as expressing any opinion on the merits of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-18\">The summary judgments entered are reversed and both cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">.

The same counsel represented Luick and National Surety and filed a motion to con-sol\u00eddate these two cases on July 13, 1971.
