Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Am2\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A2Z5\">Boshell brought an action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that he was discharged from his position as an aid at the Bryce Hospital, an institution operated by the Alabama Mental Health Board, for constitutionally impermissible reasons. He asserted that his discharge arose from the exercise of his First Amendment rights in actively seeking passage of certain legislation which was opposed by the hospital administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>The trial court determined that the action was barred by the one year statute of limitations, Ala.Code, Title 7, \u00a7 26 (1958), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-4\">\u201cThe following must be commenced within one year: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-5\">\u201cActions for any injury to the person or rights of another, not arising from contract, and not herein specifically enumerated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">Appellant argues that his claim should be governed by Alabama\u2019s six year limitations statute applicable to contractual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">Since \u00a7 1983 does not contain a statute of limitations, reference must be made to the limitation periods prescribed by the state in which the litigation arose. Sewell v. Grand Lodge of Int. Ass\u2019n. of Mach. &amp; Aero Wkrs., 445 F.2d 545 (5th Cir., 1971), cert. denied 404 U.S. 1024, 92 S.Ct. 674, 30 L.Ed.2d 674 (1972); O\u2019Sullivan v. Felix, 233 U. S. 318, 34 S.Ct. 596, 58 L.Ed. 980 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">The essential nature of the allegations contained in the complaint determine which state limitation period will govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">The gravamen of Boshell\u2019s complaint, both as originally filed and subsequently amended, was the interference under color of state law with a constitutionally protected right, not the breach of a contractual obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">Under the circumstances of this case the lower court correctly applied Alabama\u2019s one year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">Appellant urges that seeking administrative review of his discharge tolled the running of the limitation period. We need only note that appellant failed to exercise due diligence in pursuit of his administrative remedies before filing the present action. A lackadaisical attempt to vindicate one\u2019s personal rights will not serve to toll the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
