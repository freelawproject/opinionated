Cardillo appeals from his conviction for bail jumping in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3150 (1969). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">On May 28, 1970, Cardillo pleaded not guilty to a charge of interstate transportation of stolen securities. He was released on $15,000 bond. Following the court\u2019s regular procedure, the courtroom clerk, in the presence of the judge, reviewed the bail conditions with Car-dillo. The clerk warned him that if he violated any condition of his release or failed to appear when ordered by the court, he could be prosecuted on separate bail-jumping charges carrying a maximum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. Cardillo signed a document acknowledging these conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">On January 7, 1971, before the trial in the stolen securities case began, the government filed a motion to modify the conditions of Cardillo\u2019s bond. On the same day, the clerk\u2019s office sent Cardillo a notice informing him that a hearing on this motion had been scheduled for January 13, 1971. The United States Attorney\u2019s office also sent copies of this notice to Cardillo and his counsel. Cardil-lo admits to both receipt of the notice and knowledge that he was expected to appear in court on January 13. Nevertheless, Cardillo chose not to appear, apparently because he feared that his bail would be revoked due to his bondsman\u2019s unwillingness to accept any modification of the bond. Cardillo \u201cskipped\u201d town, traveling to Boston and later New York, where he surrendered to the FBI on March 24. At trial, Cardillo explained that he \u201cskipped\u201d town in order to punish the bonding company for its refusal to agree to any modification of the bond, never aware that his failure to appear could result in criminal sanctions in addition to forfeiture of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">Cardillo submits that since the courtroom clerk rather than the judge advised him of the penalties for failing to appear, he cannot be prosecuted for violating the bail-jumping statute, \u00a7 3150. Cardillo relies on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146(c) (1969), which requires that \u201c[a] judicial officer authorizing the release of a person under this section * * * shall inform such person of the penalties applicable to violation of the conditions of his release * * Cardillo contends that his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal should have been granted because the courtroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>clerk is not a \u201cjudicial officer.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 3146(c) demonstrates that the required warning by a \u201cjudicial officer\u201d is not a condition precedent to prosecution under \u00a7 3150. The requirement of \u00a7 3146(c) that a judicial officer inform the defendant of applicable penalties was \u201cdesigned not as a prerequisite to subsequent prosecution, but in order to enhance its deterrent value of increased emphasis on criminal penalties * * *\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>United States v. DePugh, 434 F.2d 548, 552-553 (8 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 978, 91 S. Ct. 1208, 28 L.Ed.2d 328 (1971). The clerk delivered the \u00a7 3146(c) warning to Cardillo in the presence of the judge. Cardillo signed a document acknowledging it. In these circumstances, the clerk acted under the guidance of and as the agent for the presiding judge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no doubt that the procedure used in the District Court was sufficient to put Cardillo on notice of the penalties that might be imposed if he failed to appear in court as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Section 3150 makes it a crime for a defendant who has been released pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C.A. ch. 207, willfully to fail to appear before any court as required. Cardillo\u2019s bond order did not recite the authority under which he was released, and the government did not prove at trial that he was released pursuant to the Bail Reform Act rather than Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Cardillo claims that since \u00a7 3150 applies only to persons released pursuant to the Bail Reform Act, the government\u2019s failure to establish that he was released under this Act mandates reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">The Fifth Circuit rejected an identical claim in United States v. Luis, 418 F.2d 439 (1969). Rule 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that an error or omission in the citation of a statute in an indictment is not grounds for reversal \u201cif the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\u201d Cardillo was well aware that he was on trial for willful failure to appear at the bail modification hearing. Additionally, as the Fifth Circuit correctly observed, since Rule 46 is substantially a restatement of the Bail Reform Act, the government need not establish the provision under which a defendant was released. <em>Luis, supra </em>at 438-439. <em>See </em>Notes of Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, comment on Rule 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Cardillo\u2019s bond recited as one of its conditions that he must appear before the court and at such other places and times as the court or the United States Commissioner might order. The notice Cardillo received did not explicitly order his presence at the bond modification hearing, although it did advise him of the hearing. Cardillo argues that since he received no explicit order to appear, it is of no consequence that he believed he was obliged to appear and willfully absented himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">In the circumstances of this ease, we cannot accept this contention. The United States' Attorney arranged the hearing date with Cardillo\u2019s counsel. It was understood that Cardillo was ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>pected to attend. Cardillo was advised that his presence was expected and he believed it to be required. A notice of the hearing bearing the court\u2019s name and signed by the clerk of court was sent to Cardillo. This notice may be understood as a court direction to appear, and Cardillo admittedly drew this meaning from it. Under these circumstances, although the notice did not explicitly order Cardillo to appear or notify him that his presence was required, it is patent that Cardillo willfully failed to make a court appearance, thereby transgressing the essence of \u00a7 3150. It would, however, be better practice in the future for the notice to include an unequivocal statement that the defendant\u2019s presence at a particular hearing is required. This would obviate the possibility that under different circumstances a defendant might truly be unaware that his attendance at a hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We see no merit in Cardillo\u2019s other contentions and conclude that they do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-12\">. \u201c * * * I also understand that if I fail to appear before this Court as required, an additional criminal case may be instituted against me by the United States Attorney, and that I may receive a fine of not more than $5,000.00 and/or be imprisoned for not more than five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">.
