Appellant\u2019s trial date, March of 1972, was after the ratification of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which lowered the voting age to eighteen but before The effective date of Pub.Law 92-269, \u00a7 1; 86 Stat. 117, which, <em>inter alia, </em>amends 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865(b)(1) by lowering the age for service on federal juries to eighteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, appellant\u2019s jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>convened under the prior provisions of \u00a7 1865(b)(1), which set the minimum age of twenty-one. It is this circumstance which gives rise to appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">By a pre-trial motion appellant sought to cure what he saw as a nonrepresenta-tive master jury list resulting from the statutory exclusion of persons aged eighteen to twenty. Appellant\u2019s motion did not seek the customary relief of quashing the indictment or setting aside the jury list. Instead, he proposed supplementing the master jury list in any one of the four divisions of the District of Minnesota by adding an algebraically determined number of voters of all ages who had registered to vote after the ratification of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment. Appellant said this number (n) should bear the same ratio to the number of persons already on the list (p) as the number of persons registered after ratification of the Amendment (N) bears to the number registered at the time the master list was compiled (P). Stated algebraically, n/p = N/P. Thus, to determine the number to be added (n), the formula would be n=pN/P. The denial of this motion is the sole assignment of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Appellant\u2019s entire contention is that the ratification of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment <em>ipso facto </em>rendered unconstitutional the requirement of \u00a7 1865 (b)(1) that jurors be twenty-one years of age. He asserts that, by virtue of the equal protection of the laws command of Amendments Five and Fourteen, \u201c[i]f a man cannot be denied the greater right to vote, then he cannot be denied the lesser right to be a juror,\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 7; and claims it was this quoted principle which conferred the right of jury service upon Negroes and women via the extension of suffrage to them by the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments respectively. For this proposition he cites several cases prohibiting intentional and systematic racial classifications in jury selection<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 67 S.Ct. 261, 91 L.Ed. 181 (1946), which prohibited the systematic exclusion of women from federal juries. We think appellant misreads these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\"><em>Ballard </em>did not hold that the extension of the franchise to women precluded barring them from juries. Rather, the court held that women are an identifiable community group the exclusion of which violates the <em>statutory </em>command that federal juries be a cross-section of the community, and therefore exercised its supervisory powers over federal courts to terminate their exclusion. <em>See </em>329 U.S. at 193, 67 S.Ct. 261. No constitutional issue was reached. Indeed, the question whether the exclusion of women from juries is prohibited by the Constitution has yet to be squarely decided by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 634, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (1972) (Douglas concurring); Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">Similarly, the four cases which appellant cites do not hold that the act of enfranchising Negroes is the source of the prohibition of excluding them from juries. All four cited cases<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> involve challenges to state rather than federal juries and, like Strauder v. West Va., 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1879), turn squarely upon the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s prohibition, via the Equal Protection Clause, of racial classifications. <em>See especially </em>100 U.S. at 307-309. No mention is made at all in any of the four cases of the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">In sum, there is no support in law or logic for the proposition that the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>of jury service is a concomitant subsidiary of the franchise. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the Twenty-Sixth Amendment <em>ipso facto </em>rendered unconstitutional the tv/enty-one year minimum of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1865(b) (1). <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Duncan, 456 F.2d 1401, 1404-1405 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. Waddy, 340 F. Supp. 509 (S.D.N.Y.1971); United States v. Guzman, 337 F.Supp. 140, 144-145 (S.D.N.Y.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The true basis of a challenge to the master list in this case must rest on the allegation that the compilation of the list excluded an identifiable community group, to wit: persons aged eighteen to twenty. Of course, \u201c[n] either the jury roll nor the venire need be a perfect mirror of the community or accurately reflect the proportionate strength of every identifiable group.\u201d Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 208, 85 S.Ct. 824, 829, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965). However, since a jury is designed to \u201cexpress the conscience of the community,\u201d Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 519, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), \u201c[t]he American tradition of trial by jury . . necessarily contemplates an impartial jury drawn from a cross-section of the community.\u201d Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 220, 66 S.Ct. 984, 985, 90 L.Ed. 1181 (1946). Thus, juries must be indiscriminately selected \u201cwithout systematic and intentional exclusion of any . . . substantial portion of the community that cannot be excluded in whole or in part without doing violence to the democratic nature of the jury system.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 220, 223, 66 S.Ct., at 985. This command flows from the requisites of both Due Process, Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972) (plurality opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall), and the Sixth Amendment, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Accordingly, the dispositive question is whether persons aged eighteen to twenty compose an \u201cidentifiable group\u201d which cannot be systematically excluded from jury service without rendering juries nonrepresentative of community attitudes. But appellant has \u201cfailed to show that the attitudes of this group [18-20] are inadequately represented by those several years older than they, that is, that eighteen to twenty-one year olds are a distinct, cognizable group.\u201d United States v. Deardorff, 343 F.Supp. 1033, 1043 (S.D.N.Y.1971). \u201cThe difference in viewpoint between ages [eighteen to twenty and twenty-one to twenty-five, for example,] would not seem to us of any great significance. . . .We regard it as highly speculative whether the decisional outlook of such excluded persons would be different than that of persons a mere few years older. . . . \u201d King v. United States, 346 F.2d 123, 124 (1st Cir. 1965). Accordingly, we hold that persons aged eighteen to twenty are not an identifiable group the exclusion of which renders a jury list nonrepresentative of the community and violative of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Ross, 468 F.2d 1213 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. Deardorff, <em>supra, </em>343 F.Supp. at 1039-1044; United States v. Waddy, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Guzman, <em>supra. Cf. </em>Chase v. United States, 468 F.2d 141, 144 (7th Cir. 1972) (21-24); United States v. Gast, 457 F.2d 141, 142 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 969, 92 S.Ct. 2426, 32 L.Ed.2d 688 (1972) (21-26); United States v. Kuhn, 441 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir. 1971) (21-23); United States v. DiTommaso, 405 F.2d 385, 387-392 (4th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 934, 89 S.Ct. 1209, 22 L.Ed.2d 465 (1969) (21-29); King v. United States, <em>supra. </em>For additional cases agreeing with the result that exclusion from federal juries of persons aged eighteen to twenty does not violate the Constitution, <em>see </em>United States v. Gast, <em>supra, </em>457 F.2d at 142-143; United States v. Duncan, <em>supra; </em>United States v. McVean, 436 F.2d 1120, 1122 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 822, 92 S.Ct. 45, 30 L.Ed.2d 50 (1971); United States v. Tantash, 409 F.2d 227 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 968, 89 S.Ct. 211, 23 L.Ed.2d 754 (1969); George v. United States, 196 F.2d 445, 452-455 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 843 73 S.Ct. 58, 97 L.Ed. 656 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In closing, we emphasize that we deal here only with two questions: (1)'the effect of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment <em>per se </em>on statutes erecting the minimum age for jurors; and (2) the constitutionality under the Sixth Amendment, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, of excluding from federal juries persons aged eighteen to twenty.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Finding no merit in appellant\u2019s claim of error we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-18\">.
