Bloch on the ground of incompatibility of temperament.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">A second question presented is whether the District Court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in its fact-finding that the Blochs had entered into a common law marriage during a visit they had made to Florida in October 1965.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It may be noted, parenthetically, that the appellant does not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination as to incompatibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">Thes\u00e9 background facts are undisputed :</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">The Blochs* are residents and domi-ciliaries of Christiansted, St. Croix, Virgin Islands. In 1962 they commenced living together under one roof, sharing bed and board. A son was born to them in February 1963. From the beginning of their 1962 relationship until the institution of the divorce proceedings in 1971, they held themselves out in the community as husband and wife. In October 1965 they paid a visit to Mrs. Bloch\u2019s father in Miami Beach, Florida. They spent the first night of that visit in her father\u2019s home, and the next two or three days in a Miami Beach hotel where they registered as husband and wife. Prior to the Florida visit, the appellant purchased and gave the appellee a wedding ring which she thereafter wore on the appropriate finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-14\">The divorce proceedings developed only one critical fact issue, viz., whether the Blochs, during their Florida visit, had entered into a common law marriage, in consonance with then prevailing Florida law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by the exchange of vows. The appellee testified they had exchanged vows and the appellant denied it. The Dis-. trict Court resolved the conflict in the testimony in favor of the appellee. In doing so it stated that it found the appellee\u2019s \u201cdemeanor as a witness was the more forthright by far,\u201d and that \u201cshe impressed on the witness stand as being earnest and truthful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-15\">Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P., commands that where a trial is had to the court its \u201c[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-16\">It is settled that Rule 52(a) governs appellate review of a fact-finding of a trial court, and that under it, such a finding, when supported by evidence, can be found to be \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d <em>only </em>when the appellate court, upon review of all the evidence, \u201c \u2018is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6, 8, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954), quoting from United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-17\">Speaking for this Court, Judge Aldi-sert recently spelled out the sweep of appellate review of fact-findings made by a trial court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-18\">\u201cIt is the responsibility of an appellate court to accept the ultimate factual determination of the fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>finder unless that determination either (1) is completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility, or (2) bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data. Unless the reviewing court establishes the existence of either of these factors, it may not alter the facts found by the trial court. To hold otherwise would be to permit a substitution by the reviewing court of its finding for that of the trial court, and there is no existing authority for this in the federal judicial system, either by American common law tradition or by rule and statute.\u201d Krasnov v. Dinan, 465 F.2d 1298, 1302-1303 (1972) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Applying the principles stated, we are of the opinion, upon review of all the evidence, that the District Court\u2019s fact-finding that the appellant and appellee entered into a common law marriage in Florida in 1965 was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">It may be noted parenthetically that the District Court found that \u201capart from the express finding that the parties vowed and consented to be husband and wife in Florida, their cohabitation and holding out as husband and wife in that State would be sufficient to supply the condition of mutual consent\u201d under Florida law,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> irrespective of the brief span of the Florida visit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ase-dedup-2\">We come now to the primary question, of first impression, whether the public policy of the Virgin Islands precludes recognition of a common law marriage entered into by Virgin Islands domicili-aries in a state where such a marriage is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-19\">As earlier stated, the District Court answered the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-20\">In doing so, it held that while common law marriages may not be validly entered into in the Virgin Islands under Title 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 32, effective September 1, 1957,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they are not included in the category of \u201cVoid marriages,\u201d Title 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 l, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or \u201cVoidable marriages,\u201d Title 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and accordingly they are cognizable under Title 1 V.I.C. \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>effective in the Virgin Islands the Restatement, Conflicts of Laws \u00a7 123 provision that a common law marriage \u201cis valid everywhere\u201d if entered into \u201cin a state in which such a marriage is valid.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">In so holding, the District Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-5\">\u201cI find nothing in the statutory or decisional law in the Virgin Islands to indicate that a common law marriage, even if prohibited, is against the public policy of this forum. Certainly, common law marriages are not numbered among those declared to be void (see 16 VIC section 1) or even voidable (see 16 VIC section 2). Accordingly, section 123 of the restatement is to be given effect. , . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">We are in accord with the District Court\u2019s holding that the public policy of the Virgin Islands does not preclude recognition of a common law marriage entered into by its domiciliaries in a state where such a marriage is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The sum of the appellant\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s holding is that the Virgin Islands statutory requirement that marriages shall be solemnized \u201cclearly shows a strong public policy\u201d with respect to common law marriages entered into in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">The stated contention disregards the fact that Title 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which concerns marriages entered into by Virgin Islands domiciliarles \u201cin another jurisdiction\u201d declares such marriages \u201cillegal\u201d <em>only </em>if they are \u201cdeclared illegal by sections 1 and 2 of this title.\u201d Sections 1 and 2, respectively, define categories of \u201cVoid\u201d and \u201cVoidable\u201d marriages. They do not, as earlier noted, include common law marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-14\">Failure of \u00a7 4 of Title 16 to include common law marriages between Virgin Islands domiciliaries, \u201cin another jurisdiction,\u201d in the category of \u201cillegal\u201d marriages, is of significant dimension in ascertaining the Islands\u2019 public policy with respect to such marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">The general rule is that in the absence of an express provision to the contrary, a common law marriage, valid in the state in which it is entered into, will be held valid by the courts of the domicile even though such a marriage could not be entered into in the domicile by force of its statutory law. <em>Cf. </em>Loughran v. Loughran, 292 U.S. 216, 223 n. 3, 54 S.Ct. 684, 78 L.Ed. 1219 (1934); <em>see </em>Albina Engine and Machine Works v. O\u2019Leary, 328 F.2d 877 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 817, 85 S.Ct. 35, 13 L. Ed.2d 29 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">The circumstance that under Title 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 32 a common law marriage cannot be entered into in the Virgin Islands \u201cdoes not make it so offensive to local policy\u201d so as to preclude recognition of a common law marriage entered into in a state where such a marriage is valid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number><em>See </em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws \u00a7 134, comment (b) (1934).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Al_O\">For the reasons stated the Decree of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">. Common law marriages were valid in Florida at <em>the </em>time.
