Costantino, <em>District Judge, </em>finding appellant guilty on one count of importing 7.1 kilograms of hashish into the United States on November 21, 1971, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) (1970); on a second count of possessing and bringing the same hashish on the same date into the United States on board an aircraft, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 955 (1970); and on a third count of possessing the same hashish on the same date with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1970). On August 15, 1972, appellant was sentenced by Judge Costantino on each count to a consecutive term of four years imprisonment. He was also sentenced to a special parole term of two years and was fined $2500.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">On appeal Valot claims (1) that the district court erred in imposing consecutive sentences upon the multiple counts under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970; and (2) that the district court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the indictment on the ground that the government was not ready for trial within the time prescribed by the Second Circuit Rules Regarding Prompt Disposition of Criminal Cases. 28 U.S. C.A. (Supp.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">As in United States v. Scafo, 470 F.2d 748 (2 Cir.1972) (a decision rendered on the date the instant case was argued), we find the record in the instant case inadequate for us to review the propriety of Judge Rosling\u2019s denial on June 16, 1972 of appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment pursuant to Rule 4 of the Second Circuit Rules, <em>supra. </em>The skeleton sequence of events was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">November 21, 1971 \u2014 Arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVj\">November 22, 1971 \u2014 Arraigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anvx\">May 9, 1972 -Indicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab2\">May 11, 1972 \u2014Government mailed <em>notice </em>advising Valot to appear before Judge Rosling for plea on May 26, 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a1i-dedup-0\">May 15, 1972 \u2014Government mailed notice of readiness for trial to Valot and Judge Rosling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1NB\">May 26, 1972 \u25a0 \u2014 Valot pleaded not guilty before Judge Rosling and moved to dismiss indictment pursuant to Rule 4 of <em>Second </em>Circuit Rules, supra, on the ground the six month period had expired on May 21, 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akp-dedup-0\">June 16, 1972 \u2014Judge Rosling heard argument on the motion to dismiss and denied it in an endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">Here, as in <em>Scafo, </em>no findings of fact were made as to what actually occurred, including the reasons for the delay or delays and whether they were \u201coccasioned by exceptional circumstances\u201d. Rule 5(h) of the Second Circuit Rules, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">Upon the authority of <em>Scafo, </em>we therefore remand this case to the district court for a further hearing on the motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to comply with the Second Circuit Rules, <em>supra, </em>and we direct the district court, as we did in <em>Scafo, </em>470 F.2d at 751, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-17\">\u201cThe district court should make findings of fact on the issues. If the district court finds, after taking such additional evidence as may be relevant, that the motion should be denied, it shall enter new final judgment based upon the record as supplemented by further testimony and findings, thereby preserving to the appellant his right to further appellate review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-19\">On the other hand, if the motion is granted, the indictment should be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">In view of our remand on the issue of the motion to dismiss, of course we do not at this time reach the issue of the propriety of the consecutive sentences and we imply no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-21\">This panel retains jurisdiction over this case. Depending upon the outcome of the hearing on the issue for which the ease is remanded, any further or supplemental appeal will be referred to this panel which will then determine all issues, including that involving the propriety of the consecutive sentences. On that issue, if it becomes ripe for us to rule upon it, no further briefs need be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
