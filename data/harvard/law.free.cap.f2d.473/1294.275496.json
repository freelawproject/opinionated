In view of the conflicting evidence and the Government\u2019s assertion, supported by affidavits, that it did not represent to plaintiff that it would refrain from attempt to collect taxes from her for the years 1959, 1960, and 1961, it is not clear that the Government is estopped from presently proceeding against the plaintiff. Consequently, this Court has no jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s request for an injunction on the non-statutory grounds of waiver or estop-pel. To the extent that plaintiff\u2019s suit is based on these grounds, it must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-8\">\u201cIn conclusion, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to plaintiff\u2019s claim that the IRS violated statutory requirements in the notices of deficiency sent to her for the taxable years 1960 and 1961. With respect to the claim that the notice of deficiency for 1959 violated' statutory requirements, defendant\u2019s motion is denied. To the extent that plaintiff\u2019s request for an injunction is grounded on theories of waiver or estoppel, it is dismissed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">The appellant contends that the District Court erred in its partial dismissal of her action for lack of jurisdiction, and to the contrary asserts that the Court had jurisdiction and that since the record relating to estoppel discloses material \u00edSt sues of fact, the Court was precluded from ordering the partial dismissal without holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">We agree with the statement of the District Court that the record presents \u201cmaterial issues of fact disputed\u201d in respect to estoppel, and that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) prevents suits \u201c . . . for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax . . . \u201d In Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 284 U.S. .498, 52 S.Ct. 260, 76 L.Ed. 422 (1932), the Supreme Court enunciated a judicial exception to the statutory proscription. It held that if the Government could not prevail, and the taxpayer otherwise satisfied the requirements for equity jurisdiction, a United States district court could entertain a suit for injunctive relief against the collection of taxes. That rule was clarified and affirmed in Enochs v. Williams Packing Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962). Under this rule, the narrow question becomes what the Government must allege to avoid the <em>Nut Margarine </em>exception. This Court addressed this issue in Thrower v. Miller, 440 F.2d 1186 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-15\">\u201cIn order to determine whether the government has a chance of ultimately prevailing, the court must look to the evidence presented at the time of the suit. Only if it is then manifest, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, that the government cannot prove its claim, may the suit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>an injunction be maintained.\u201d Id. at 1187.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\"> The district court found \u201cmaterial issues of fact disputed\u201d and concluded that it was possible for the Government to prevail. Based on this determination, and the rule in <em>Thrower, </em>the district court was correct in holding it was without jurisdiction to hear the estoppel claim, <em>Nut Margarine </em>notwithstanding. Appellant\u2019s proper remedy is either through the Tax Court, or to pay the tax, and sue for a refund in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1355-16\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-22\">. Since the district court denied appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the year 1959, this appeal is not concerned with the invalidity of the 1959 notice of deficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
