BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A_gJ\">Trying hard to get under the dry comfortable umbrella which we often raise to protect disputatious matters from the quick disposition by summary judgment, F.R.Civ.P. 56, see Smith v. St. Paul Fire <em>&amp; </em>Mar. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1972, 471 F.2d 840, Marsden v. Patane, 5 Cir., 1967, 380 F.2d 489, 491; Gauck v. Meleski, 5 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 433; Braniff v. Jackson Ave.-Gretna Ferry, Inc., 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 523; Robbins v. Milner Enterprises, Inc., 5 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 492; Murphy v. Light, 5 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 323, the daughter as claimant to proceeds of life insurance policies contends that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment for the second wife. But the case turns out to be something quite different. Indeed, everything seems to be an afterthought completely unsupported by the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-28\">Indeed, it is difficult to figure out just what is complained of save the result. The case started out on the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>question of whether the property settlement provision of the divorce decree <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the terms of the father\u2019s subsequent formal change of beneficiary<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> controlled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>The trial <em>court </em>agreed with the daughter and granted her all of two policies, so obviously she cannot complain about the court\u2019s legal choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">The real question became just <em>what </em>policies<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were covered by the divorce decree (note 2, <em>supra). </em>The daughter by new counsel tries to persuade us that this was a question that surprisingly came up almost at the last minute, so much so that the Judge, in his characteristically informal handling of a non-jury trial, decided the- question before anyone (or at least the daughter\u2019s then counsel) knew what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">The record, scarce in spots as it might be, simply does not bear this out. In the first place, the daughter\u2019s complaint against Aetna not only alleged speeifi-cally the two numbered policies, but expressly charged that the husband had fraudulently attempted to change the beneficiaries of both, in breach of the divorce decree. Next, the second wife in her complaint against Aetna likewise alleged both policies, the change of beneficiary and sought one half of both. And finally, in Aetna\u2019s 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1335 in-terpleader action citing both daughter and second wife as competing claimants, there were specific allegations as to the issuance of both policies, the change of beneficiary (exemplified as an annexed exhibit), and the rival claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-19\">Only one thing affords any basis for the contention of late discovery. That was the trial court\u2019s memorandum order of February 22, 1972<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which advised counsel that in the Judge\u2019s pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>study of the case he found there was this <em>factual </em>question of <em>what </em>policies were encompassed within the divorce decree which was in addition to the question previously stipulated <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to be decided by the court without a jury. It was, however, clear that he contemplated that all issues concerning the rival claims were for Judge, not jury, determination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Indeed, the parties and certainly the daugher, fully understood that the Judge was to determine the rival claims both as literally described in the stipulation (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>and as perhaps broadened by the Judge\u2019s memorandum order of February 22, 1972 (see note 8, <em>supra). </em>For in response to it counsel for the daughter submitted affidavits of the first wife (mother) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and her counsel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-14\">The court properly did not undertake to resolve this on summary judgment. It obviously was for court determination on both fact and law and clear notice was given to counsel of the court\u2019s proposed handling.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-15\">By a notice so plain that all who ran could read, the court proceeded to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>all the remaining issues impliedly, if not expressly reserved for Judge decision. The record which the daughter specified as adequate for this appeal, FRAP 10(b), is a big round 2;ero either as to the hearing, who was present, what was said and what, if any objections or contentions were made. Nor was this record\u2019s silence ameliorated in any way by post-hearing motions or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">For all we know, counsel for both daughter and second wife agreed to this procedure, and did not object to the use of the materials the Judge had already discussed (e.g., the change of beneficiary, note 3, <em>supra) </em>or to the use of the affidavits (notes 9 and 10, supra) the daughter had supplied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">With this silence we cannot in the name of some high sounding equity fault the Judge for not having demanded a more advocative exercise. Nor, operating from the cold void of nothingness can we believe that this patient Judge really did, could or would overbear the sort of lawyers who comprise his bar \u2014 and certainly not to the point of thinking that they were then and thereby overborne \u2014 and all they could bring themselves to do was to file an un-revealing notice of appeal without a single cheep of a request for action or non-action or objection to the Judge\u2019s failure to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">Only a tag end remains. Once the Judge was permitted to evaluate affidavits he could read the two (notes 9 and 10, <em>supra) </em>in several ways. One was that the only policy in contemplation of husband and wife as they approached life\u2019s parting of the ways was, as the affidavits specified, GL 63693. And that is what the Judge held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">There it ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1281-20\">. So confusing is the theory of the daughter in the light of the printed appendix, we obtained the whole of the original record as specified by the appellant, FRAP 10(b). Not a stitch of evidence or colloquy between court and counsel, the slightest record of any objection to what the Judge did or said, or request that the Judge do otherwise appears anywhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">. \u201c(d) That Husband will maintain in full force and effect during his lifetime the two insurance policies presently in force on his life with face values of FIVE THOUSAND ($5,000.00) DOLLARS and TWENTY THOUSAND ($20,000.00) DOLLARS, respectively, and agrees that the minor child, ALLISON DUFFIELD, shall be the irrevocable beneficiary on said policies of life insurance. * * *\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AA9u\">.

Specifically it was whether the two policies mentioned (one of which was a Metropolitan policy over which there is no controversy) were confined to the Aetna Group Life policy GL 63693, as to which the daughter got 100%, or encompassed as well the Aetna accident and accidental death policy G\u00a9 63693, as to which the court granted one half each to daughter and second wife pursuant to the post-divorce change of beneficiary, see note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1283-21\">.

It would appear that there is therefore an issue in this case which has not previously been considered by counsel as to whether the divorce settlement agreement applied to both the Group Life Insurance Policy and the Group Accidental Death and Dismemberment Policy; if it applied only to the Life Policy, then, of course, the Change of Beneficiary form might be effective as to the Accidental Death Policy even though not effective as to the Life Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-23\">In order that counsel may be heard on this important remaining issue this case is set for hearing thereon at 11:00 o\u2019clock A.M., Thursday, March 2, 1972.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">. \u201cH) The following issues of law remain to be determined by the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-6\">(1) Whether the proceeds of the life insurance policy are to be distributed in accordance with the final judgement of divorce or in accordance with the contract of insurance, it being agreed between counsel for the respective claimants that there are <em>no factual issues </em>for jury <em>determination </em>and that the Court be requested to make a determination of this issue based upon the <em>foots </em>as <em>stipulated </em>to by the respective claimants and the applicable law. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">. The Judge, with imaginative resourcefulness, had a bifurcated trial. The first part was to a jury on the hotly contested issue of whether under policy GC 63693 death was accidental. The remaining issue of the contest between daughter and second wife was to be determined by the court. To the extent that the factual question of <em>what </em>policies were encompassed in the divorce decree was not specifically within the stipulation, note 7, <em>supra, </em>the Judge\u2019s order of July 30, 1971 postponing the entry of final judgment on the jury verdict expressly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-9\">\u201cBecause there is still a dispute between Allison J.

Affiant states that on said date said policies were the only policies in existence on the life of Lloyd M. Duf-field, and that neither he nor Affiant owned any other policies of insurance on Lloyd M.

Duffield was an employee of Radiation, Inc., and that as an incident of his employment, the said Lloyd M. Duffield was covered by a group life insurance policy having a face value of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) at the time. Affiant states that the insurance policy having a face value of $20,000.00 referred to in the aforesaid Paragraph 7, was in fact the same as the group life insurance policy with Radiation, Inc., herein referred to; and that the insurance policy having a Five Thousand-Dollar ($5,000.00) face value was a policy issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, covering the life of Lloyd M.
