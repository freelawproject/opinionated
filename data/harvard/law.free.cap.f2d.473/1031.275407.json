Security was Frey\u2019s liability insurance carrier and had refused to afford coverage with respect to a negligence action brought against Frey. After settling the claim against him, Frey instituted the present proceeding to recover the amount of the settlement. Security\u2019s motions for judgment N.O.V. and for a new trial were denied by the district court, and this appeal followed. Jurisdiction is founded upon diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">Security had disclaimed liability in the tort suit brought against Frey for the reason that Frey failed to report the underlying accident as soon as practicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this appeal, Security contends that the notice given by Frey was not timely as a matter of law. Error is also asserted in the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury and in the admission of evidence that other parties had delayed in reporting the accident, but their insurer had nonetheless provided coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-16\">We need not recite the facts involved here, for the opinion of Chief Judge Marsh accompanying his order denying Security\u2019s post-trial motions, reported at 331 F.Supp. 140 (W.D.Pa.1971), most ably sets them out. On review of the record and consideration of the relevant law, we find Security\u2019s contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-17\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed for the reasons so well stated by Chief Judge Marsh in his opinion, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">.
