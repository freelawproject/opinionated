Weinstein, /., dismissing his claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against defendants Raymond Fleming and Willis A. Weaver. Defendants were Correction Officers in the Queens House of Detention on October 24, 1970, when, according to plaintiff, they brutally assaulted him. At the trial before Judge Weinstein, at which 11 witnesses testified, two completely different versions of the facts emerged. While the judge deservedly complimented plaintiff\u2019s court-appointed counsel for their \u201cmagnificent\u201d efforts, he found himself \u201cin a state of equipoise on the matter of probabilities. They are evenly balanced here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-17\">Since plaintiff had not met his burden of persuading the trier of fact by a preponderance of evidence, the judge dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-18\"> On appeal, plaintiff challenges certain critical factual inferences drawn by the judge, which, he argues, were altogether unwarranted by the evidence. Where factual findings are challenged, however, we may not set them aside \u201cunless clearly erroneous.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Although counsel have continued in this court their zealous and highly competent efforts on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, we do not see how we can, on this record, do anything but affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-19\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
