Located therein for the use and enjoyment of patrons are a juke box, shuffle board and pool table, all manufactured outside the State of Florida. The devices are coin operated or activated, the revenue from them constituting 3% of appellee\u2019s business, dollar-wise.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-25\">On April 29, 1971, the United States filed suit in the lower court against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>defendants-appellees, seeking to enjoin alleged racial discrimination in the operation of The Northwood Bar. The complaint alleged that The Northwood Bar was a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d within the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, supra, in that it provided entertainment which moved in interstate commerce and that defendants-appellees operated the bar in a fashion which discriminated against Negroes by refusing them service on the same basis as the service provided white members of the general public. The complaint prayed for appropriate injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">After receiving a pre-trial stipulation of facts and conducting a pre-trial conference, the district judge, 332 F.Supp. 316, found there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and concluded that the mere presence of three coin-operated machines manufactured outside the state was not sufficient to regard the bar as a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d covered by the Act. Accordingly, he granted defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P. The United States entered a timely appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a sweeping prohibition of discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin at places of public accommodation whose operations affect commerce. Sections 2000a(a) and (b)(3) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201c(a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodations, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">(b&gt; Each of the following establishments which serves the public is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of this subchapter if its operations affect commerce. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">(3) any motion picture house, theater, concert hall, sports arena, stadium or other place of exhibition or entertainment . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Section 2000a(c)(3) defines the term \u201caffect commerce\u201d as meaning that the operations of a Section 2000a(b) (3) establishment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-12\">\u201c. . . customarily presents films, performances, athletic teams, exhibitions, or other sources of entertainment which move in commerce <em>tf</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">\u201cCommerce\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-16\">\u201c. . . . travel, trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">Although recognizing that the Act was not designed to cover all establishments, this Court <em>en banc </em>concluded that Sections 2000a(b)(3) and (c)(3) must be read \u201cwith open minds attuned to the clear and strong purpose of the Act, namely, to secure for all citizens the full enjoyment of facilities described in the Act which are open to the general public. That Title II of the Civil Rights Act is to be liberally construed and broadly read we find to be well established.\u201d Miller v. Amusement Enterprises, Inc., 5 Cir. 1968, 394 F.2d 342, 349. Thus we read the statute, particularly the term \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d, as did the Supreme Court in Daniel v. Paul, 1969, 395 U.S. 298, 307-308, 89 S. Ct. 1697, 1702, 23 L.Ed.2d 318, 326, according to its generally accepted meaning so as to give full effect to Congress\u2019 overriding purpose of eliminating the affront and humiliation involved in discriminatory denials of access to facilities ostensibly open to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">With this purpose as our lodestar, we compare the facts of the instant case with the \u201cgenerally accepted meaning\u201d of the Act and find that, at least facially, the presence of the out-of-state manufactured juke box, shuffle board and pool table for the use and enjoyment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>of the bar\u2019s patrons would quite comfortably comport with a literal, but liberal, interpretation of the Act's language. Certainly an establishment which provides mechanical devices for the use and enjoyment of its patrons or customers is a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d. Just as logically, these devices are, by use if not by definition, \u201csources of entertainment\u201d which here were not only \u201ccustomarily\u201d presented, but permanently provided for the entertainment of the establishment\u2019s customers. Lastly, these devices have moved in \u201ccommerce\u201d when they were manufactured in one state and used for their intended purpose in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">As opposed to this literal reading of the statute, defendants-appellees suggest that the phrase \u201cother place of exhibition or entertainment\u201d in Section 2000a(b)(3) refers to facilities similar in kind to those enumerated in the statute: \u201ctheater, concert hall, stadium\u201d, etc., which are devoted to exhibitions of skill or which are devoted entirely or substantially to the entertainment of the public. We cannot, however, read those limitations into the statute because the words of the statute do not require that we do so and the expressed intent of the statute prohibits us from doing so. The statute does not require that the entertainment be of a certain variety or that a certain quantum of the establishment's business be derived from the entertainment of its customers. On the contrary, the statute clearly specifies that \u201c. . . <em>any </em>place of entertainment\u201d is a place of public accommodations within its meaning if that establishment\u2019s operations affect commerce. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Additionally, as the Supreme Court held in Daniel v. Paul, supra, at 308, 89 S.Ct. at 1702, 23 L.Ed.2d at 327, the legislative history of Section 2000a (c)(3) indicates that Congress specifically considered such mechanical and stationary machines such as a juke box, shuffle board and pool table, to be \u201csources of entertainment\u201d within the meaning of Section 2000a(c)(3). Indeed, \u201cThe Senate rejected an amendment which would have ruled out most mechanical sources by requiring that the source of entertainment be one which has \u2018not come to rest within a State.\u2019 110 Cong. Rec. 13915-13921 (1964).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Contrary to defendants-appellees intimation, the United States need not show that any person, because of race, color, religion, or national origin, had been deprived of any right to use those devices which caused the establishment to be characterized a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d. Once it was shown, as here, that the establishment is a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d, and thus a place of public accommodation, the Act proscribes any and all efforts to deny one \u201cthe full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodation\u201d of that place because of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin. The statute is not limited to proscribing discrimination only as to the enjoyment of those devices which make the establishment a place of public accommodation. Thus, as a matter of law, defendants-appellees Northwood Bar is a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d within the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because of its being a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">In their answer to the complaint, defendants-appellees denied having discriminated against any person or persons because of race, color or creed. Since it is incumbent upon the United States to prove the contrary, the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to afford the United States an opportunity to prove its allegations that defendants-appellees have violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by discriminating against Negroes by refusing them service on the same basis as service is provided to members of the white race. If so, the United States is entitled to the injunctive relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ARx\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"A2vP\">I concur fully in the result and the excellent opinion of Judge Simpson for the Court. I add again, only by way of emphasis, how sterile is the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim based upon the pleadings. Now this case has to go back for an ascertainment of facts which are probably uncontra-dicted on the practices of this particular neighborhood bar. Having asserted with such vigor \u2014 and with all propriety under the law \u2014 that it was not covered since it did not have to afford its entertainment to persons without regard to race, it is highly unlikely that the establishment will now come in and attempt to prove that after .all they had never violated the law at all even as we have held.</p>\n<p id=\"A4Z\">The facts could readily have been reduced to an uneontradicted form \u2014 in all likelihood \u2014 by affidavits and counter-affidavits, stipulations and the like for summary judgment. Then we could have decided the case once and for all on what the facts really are, not what the lawyers say they are.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">The shortest way through is often the longest way around. This is another case to add to the growing list of this misspent judicial energy. See, Cook &amp; Nichol, Inc. v. Plimsoll Club, 5 Cir., 1971, 451 F.2d 505, 506; Haines v.

Amusement Enterprises, Inc., 394 F.2d 342 (5th Cir. 1968) (en banc), from which these principles were drawn. But neither high motives nor open minds authorize us to construe away the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"AWgl\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"AGGG\">The opinion of my brothers does not address itself to the core of the problem before us. Their analysis is in the form of considering whether an establishment treated by them as otherwise neutral insofar as coverage of the Act is concerned, is to lose its neutral status. That is not this case. This court is committed to the position that the coverage of the public accommodations section of the Act does not extend to bars per se. Fazzio Real Estate Co. v. Adams, 396 F.2d 146, 150 (5th Cir. 1968); Selden v. Topaz 1-2-3 Lounge, Inc., 447 F.2d 165 (5th Cir. 1971);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> accord, Cuevas v.

Cazes, 363 F.2d 742 (5th Cir. 1966), one of the grounds on which the District Court had dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint was that a bar was not a covered establishment, and on appeal we accepted without comment plaintiff\u2019s concession to the same effect.<footnotemark>1A</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Other courts have readily agreed that bars per se are not covered establishments. In Seidenberg v. McSorleys\u2019 Old Ale House, Inc., 308 F.Supp. 1253 (S.D.. N.Y.1969), the court first held that the public accommodations section of the Act did not extend to sex discrimination, and then stated in dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">[R]ecent decisions have found Section 201 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 inapplicable to bars and taverns whose principal business is the sale of alcoholic beverages. [Citing <em>Tyson </em>and Cuevas.] However, a business which describes itself as a bar would nevertheless be covered by the Act if it is principally engaged in selling food for consumption on the premises. [Citing <em>Cuevas </em>and <em>Fazzio.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1256. In United States v. Fraley, 282 F.Supp. 948 (M.D.N.C.1968), the court began with the hypothesis that a tavern with dance floor and live band that played twice weekly was not by itself a covered establishment, but nevertheless found that a covered lunch counter in the tavern conferred derivative coverage on the premises under \u00a7 2000a(b) (4). The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8f-dedup-0\">[S]ince it is not disputed that the defendant\u2019s non-covered bar is physically located within the same premises as his restaurant, and that the bar holds itself out as serving patrons of the restaurant, the entire establishment is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a(b)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">282 F.Supp. at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">In the instant case the District Judge quoted and applied our statement in <em>Fazzio </em>that \u201c[i]t appears settled that bars, <em>per se, </em>are not covered by the Act.\u201d The government urges us, as it unsuccessfully urged the District Court, to abandon that position. My brothers have not abandoned it, and indeed they could not without a decision of the court <em>en banc. </em>Rather they have ignored its existence, not so much as tipping their hats in its direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">It seems to me rational to conclude that the Congressional view of a bar\u2014 which is not to be covered by the Act\u2014 is a bar having the usual appurtenances, equipment and trappings of an establishment of that kind. That is, the Congressional concept of a bar is the every<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>day, man on the street concept. The District Judge took that approach, and, recognizing the noncoverage of bars, dismissed the case, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">Only by ignoring the plain working [sic] of the Act and Congressional intent could this Court include a neighborhood bar, intended to be excluded, as a \u201cplace of exhibition or entertainment\u201d because that bar maintains three coin-operated machines manufactured outside the state. To hold otherwise would, without a doubt, bring every bar within the Act and fly in the face of the plain wording, meaning, and intent of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">At the pleading stage of this lawsuit, without evidence of what normally constitutes a bar, without an evidentiary hearing, without even the statistics which we delight in saying tell us so much, my colleagues conclude as a matter of law that the bar which Congress intended not to be covered is a bar only so long as it is sans \u201cmechanical devices for the use and entertainment of [its] patrons and customers.\u201d As my colleagues would have it, as a matter of law, a bar in which one may engage in such pleasant diversions as drinking beer or wine, bantering lightly or commiserating lachrymosely with friends and bartender, and even lifting voice in song, is only a bar. But put a nickel in the nickelodeon or the pin ball machine, and the bar becomes something else.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I agree with District Judge Fulton\u2019s approach that small coin-operated devices such as those here involved are concomitant parts of a bar. My two colleagues appear to feel otherwise. The fact that two judges, on the basis of their own knowledge and experience, take judicial notice leading them to one conclusion, while two others, on the same basis, reach the opposite conclusion, seems to me to command as a minimum the taking of evidence on the point. I claim no more expertise about bars than my colleagues, but I do not admit any less. It seems to me simply inappropriate to hold as a matter of law, at the appellate level, that coin-operated devices which are located in a bar and at least arguably are usual equipment or appurtenances of a bar, are not that at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The heart of the majority opinion is a two-part analysis which appears to run this way \u2014 the devices here involved are \u201csources of entertainment\u201d as that term is employed in \u00a7 2000a(c)(3) and in common parlance (\u201cgenerally accepted meaning\u201d) as well; according the statute \u201cgenerally accepted meaning,\u201d as referred to by the Supreme Court in Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298, 307-308, 89 S. Ct. 1697, 23 L.Ed.2d 318, 326 (1969), the term \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d includes a bar equipped with \u201csources of entertainment.\u201d I am unsure whether the majority consider the presence of any \u00a7 2000a(c)(3) device to be conclusively determinative of \u00a7 2000a(b)(3) character or merely circumstantial evidence. But regardless of which is meant, the opinion\u2019s interplay of the two concepts \u2014 \u201cgenerally accepted meaning\u201d and the statutory language of \u00a7 2000a(b)(3) and \u00a7 2000a(c)(3) \u2014 is not valid. Neither prong of the concept is properly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">I agree with the majority that under generally accepted meaning, a bar <em>is </em>a \u201cplace of entertainment.\u201d Were there no legislative history and no body of case law to the contrary, I would so conclude. But the now-established meaning, for purposes of this case, is a Congres-sionally-limited term, \u201cany place of entertainment except a bar.\u201d In Daniel v. Paul the argument was made that a recreational area, which under generally accepted meaning was a \u201cplace of entertainment,\u201d was not a \u00a7 2000a(b) (3) \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d because those entertained were participants in sports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>and activities rather than spectators, and the focus of Congressional discussion on Title II of the Act had been on spectator entertainment. Rather than give effect to the primary object of Congress\u2019 concern, the Supreme Court relied on the broader coverage required by the natural language of the Act and the overriding purpose of Title II and gave to \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d its generally accepted meaning which, the Court found, included recreational areas where entertainment was participatory. 395 U.S. at 305-308, 89 S.Ct. 1697, 23 L.Ed. 2d at 325-327. In the instant case it already has been judicially established in this circuit and elsewhere that the relevant Congressional intention is narrower than the common parlance. See part 1, <em>supra. </em>Generally accepted meaning is not available as a tool to broaden the scope of a term which Congress advisedly limited to a narrower range. No discussion of Miller v. Amusement Enterprises, Inc., <em>supra, </em>is necessary other than to point out that it is a case precisely like Daniel v. Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Turning to the relationship of \u00a7 2000a(b)(3) and \u00a7 2000a(c)(3), in Daniel v. Paul the Supreme Court indicated that mechanical devices, such as juke boxes, are \u201csources of entertainment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2000a(c)(3). The temptation is great to assume that (c)(3) gives content to (b)(3), since-they are in the same statute and contain the common word \u201centertainment.\u201d But, as already pointed out, (b) (3) is a phrase of limited meaning, and the broader (e)(3) usage cannot expand (b) (3) beyond Congressionally-imposed limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">There are other reasons as well why \u00a7 2000a(c)(3) should not be equated either conclusively or circumstantially with the term \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d in \u00a7 2000a(b)(3). First, the statute requires a court to determine initially whether the subject premises are a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d under \u00a7 2000a(b)(3). After making that determination, \u2022 a court should then consider whether the premises meet the commerce connection requirements of \u00a7 2000a(c)(3). The presence of a \u00a7 2000a(c) (3) \u201csource of entertainment\u201d is important in establishing commerce connection. This two-step statutory structure requires a court to consider \u00a7 2000a(b)(3) requirements separately from \u00a7 2000a(c) (3) requirements. As the Supreme Court stated in Daniel v. Paul, the issues are whether the subject establishment is \u201c \u2018place of public accommodation\u2019 as defined by \u00a7 2000a(b) of the 1964 Act, <em>and, if so, </em>whether its operations \u2018affect commerce\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 2000a(c) of that Act.\u201d 395 U.S. at 302, 89 S.Ct. at 1699, 23 L. Ed.2d at 323 (emphasis added). Using the \u00a7 2000a(c) (3) term \u201csource of entertainment\u201d to give meaning to \u00a7 2000a(b)(3) short circuits the analytical methodology compelled by the statute. Secondly, in enacting the public accommodations section of the 1964 Act Congress did not intend to regulate all establishments that it had power to regulate. Broad coverage of retail establishments was originally contemplated, H.R. 7152, but that coverage was deleted when the House Judiciary Committee reported the bill. H.R. No. 914 on H.R. 7152, 88th Congress, 1st Sess., Part I. at 2-3. Congress intended to limit coverage to \u201cthose business establishments which on the basis of current experience have proved to be the most important sources of discrimination and, therefore, the focal point of most discriminations.\u201d House Judiciary Comm. Hearings on H. R. 7152, Part IV, a 2655-56 (statement of Attorney General Kennedy). Obviously, then, an establishment which may meet the commerce connection requirement of \u00a7 2000a(c) (3) might nevertheless fail to qualify as a \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d under \u00a7 2000a(b)(3). The two-step analysis compelled by the statute was not happen-stance. To equate the criteria separately specified in \u00a7\u00a7 2000a(e)(3) and 2000a(b)(3) operates to extend coverage in plain con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>travention of the statute\u2019s intended scope.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Section 2000a(b)(4) sets out the common method for extending coverage to otherwise noncovered establishments. This section provides that a public accommodation is \u201cany establishment . within the premises of which is physically located any such covered establishment, and . . . which holds itself out as serving patrons of such establishment.\u201d Thus, a noncovered bar would become covered under this section if the coin machines separately constituted a \u201cplace of entertainment.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority do not suggest, however, that the instant devices, separately or collectively, comprise a \u201cplace of entertainment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">Even if, in determining whether an establishment is covered or noncovered, one can appropriately employ a test consisting of the presence of mechanical amusement devices (see part 2, <em>supra,), </em>such a test has no application unless and until it has been determined that the devices are <em>not </em>part of the normal trappings of a noncovered establishment. But, assuming that such a test is to be used, and that the particular devices are found to be not part of the normal equipment of a bar, the mechanistic application of a \u201cpresence of a device\u201d rule is unrealistic. In the light of the Congressional history, some kind of <em>de min-imis </em>principle must be applied. Or, to put it another way, it is not rational to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>conclude that Congress intended that every departure, however nominal, from the usual mode of operation of an otherwise noncovered establishment will cause it to become covered notwithstanding that its essential character has not altered. I need no evidentiary hearing to know that a goodly percentage of the bars in America are equipped with television set or radio, or both. Both are \u201cmechanical devices for the use and enjoyment of [its] patrons and customers.\u201d I await the judicial declaration that when Congress set out a scope of coverage which did not include bars it intended noncovered status for only those radio-less, TV-less, and jukebox-less emporiums where glum and disconsolate, the drinkers of the evening may listen to no Nashville Sound records, follow neither Archie Bunker nor Joe Namath and the Jets, nor even listen to the weather report. And, presumably, lest the bar become a place of entertainment, those drinkers addicted to nicotine must purchase their cigarettes over the counter and not from a vending machine mechanically purveying this particular form of \u201cuse and enjoyment for patrons and customers.\u201d Or, perhaps, if that day of decision comes this court, or some other, will decide that there is a legally cognizable difference between a bar with a television set and a bar with a juke box. It seems to me better to recognize that a bar is a bar so long as it has the things that generally go with a bar, and if judges cannot agree on what those things are, then to' determine that issue in the usual judicial manner. If, however, the courts are to conclude that the presence of coin devices can cause a bar to lose is noncovered status, the departure in this instance is too insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">To summarize my views:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">(a) It is essential to recognize that we are not determining the status of an otherwise neutral establishment but of an otherwise noncovered establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">(b) I agree with District Judge Fulton that small coin-operated amusement devices are concomitant appurtenances of bars, and that to hold otherwise is to ignore the intent of Congress that bars not be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">(c) If there is disagreement among judges as to whether coin-operated devices are concomitant appurtenances of bars, evidence should be taken on the point. Conflicting judicial notice is neither appropriate nor seemly.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">\u2022 (d) The employment of the \u00a7 2000a(c)(3) phrase \u201csource of entertainment\u201d to determine whether an otherwise noncovered establishment is to become a covered \u201cplace of entertainment\u201d under \u00a7 2000a(b)(3) is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">(e) The concept of generally accepted meaning may not be employed to override what has been judicially established as the intent of Congress, by expanding the scope of a Congressionally-limited meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">(f) If the particular devices are not part of the normal appurtenances of a bar, and if we are to measure departure from the norm by the presence of mechanical amusement devices, the departure in this instance is too nominal to impose coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Immediately following the language in <em>Miller </em>upon which my brothers rely the following appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-14\">Though we give to the Act a liberal interpretation, we are aware that the Act was not designed to cover all establishments. \u201cCongress * * * exclude[d] some establishments from the Act either for reasons of policy or because it believed its powers to regulate and protect interstate commerce did not extend so far.\u201d Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 273, 85 S.Ct. 348, 366, 13 L. Ed.2d 258, 277 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">394 F.2d at 349-350. I am in accord with the District Judge in the present case, who in his dismissal order said, \u201c [r] egardless of what this Court may think of the wisdom of exemptions [exclusions] to the Act, it cannot substitute its judgment for that of Congress.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AHV_\">. If there was any doubt of the position of this circuit after <em>Fazzio, </em>it was dispelled by <em>Selden. </em>Examination of the briefs in <em>Selden </em>discloses that one of appellants\u2019 two points on appeal was whether a bar or tavern <em>vel non, </em>serving only alcoholic beverages and no food, and offering no entertainment, was nevertheless a covered establishment. This court summarily rejected the argument, citing <em>Fazzio. </em>447 F.2d at 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1A\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">. Legislative history fully supports this circuit\u2019s position that bars per se are not covered establishments. See generally Cuevas v. Sdrales, 344 F.2d 1019 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1014, 86 S.Ct. 625, 15 L.Ed.2d 528 (1966) ; Miller v. Amusement Enterprises, Inc., 391 F.2d 86, 89-96 (5th Cir. 1967), rev\u2019d en banc, 394 F.2d 342 (1968). Senator Magnuson, floor manager of Title II in the Senate, directly addressed the status of bars under Title II. He prefaced his remarks with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">\u201cMr. President ... in order that the <em>Record </em>may be clear and the intent of Congress better ascertained by the courts in the future, I should briefly describe each section of Title II. Following that, I should like to dwell on the interpretation of those sections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">110 Cong.Rec. 7404. The Senator then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-15\">\u201cA few weeks ago the Senator from Louisiana . . . stated that he was not clear as to when bars or nightclubs would be subject to the provisions of Title II. As a general rule, establishments of this kind will not come within the scope of the title. But a bar or nightclub physically located in a covered hotel will be covered, if it is open to patrons of the hotel. A nightclub might also be covered under section 201(b) (3) if it customarily offers entertainment which moves in interstate commerce. A business which describes itself as a bar or nightclub would also be covered if it is \u2018principally engaged in selling food for consumption on the premises.\u2019 And, of course, a bar or nightclub would be covered under section 202 in the rare case in which State law required it to segregate or discriminate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 7407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. And, as we point out below, under the majority approach watching the football game on television, catching the baseball scores on the radio, or buying a pack of smokes out of a vending machine may be enough to effect the same transformation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">. Remarks made during floor debates over Title II underline its intended coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJjY\">\u201cThe business enterprises covered by section 201 include hotels and motels\u2014 other than small, owner-occupied establishments \u2014 restaurants and lunch counters, including those on the premises of retail establishments, gasoline stations, and motion-picture houses, theaters, sports arenas, and other public places of exhibition or amusement. These are the establishments covered by title II. The reach of that title is much narrower than when the bill was first introduced. It is also narrower than S. 1732, the bill reported by the Senate Commerce Committee, which covers the general run of retail establishments, membership in labor unions, and so forth. . . . The deletion of the coverage of retail establishments generally is illustrative of the moderate nature of this bill and of its intent to deal only with the problems which urgently require solution. Discrimination in retail establishments generally is not as troublesome a problem as is discrimination in the places of public accommodation enumerated in the bill. And it seems likely that if discrimination is terminated in restaurants and hotels, it will soon be terminated voluntarily in those few retail stores where it still exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">110 Cong.Ree. 6533 (remarks of Senator Humphrey).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">\u201cTitle n of H.R. 7152 would establish the right of all persons, without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin, to the full and equal enjoyment of the services and facilities of a variety of places of business serving the general public. The list of businesses expressly covered by the title consists of places of public accommodation in which racial discrimination is particularly humiliating and causes the greatest inconvenience. Moreover, the list focuses on situations in which congressional action can clearly produce prompt and significant relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">110 Cong.Ree. 7383 (remarks of Senator Young).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-16\">.
