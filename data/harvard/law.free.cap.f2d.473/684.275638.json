He seeks to vacate, set aside, and expunge from the records his 1949 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>viction in the Middle District of Georgia, entered on a guilty plea, for a violation of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The petitioner\u2019s basic contention is that in 1971 the District Court for the Southern District of California, in sentencing him to the maximum statutory penalty of 15 years on three counts of violating 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1324, which he is now serving, was influenced by the allegedly invalid conviction now under attack. Although Correa-Negron did not take an appeal from his 23 year old conviction and has offered no explanation for his long delay in seeking relief, he alleges as grounds for his petition that he was not apprised of his constitutional rights, including the right to a court-appointed attorney, that he was not advised of the consequences of his guilty plea, that his plea was entered without the assistance of counsel, and that the court failed to make a Rule 11 inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Moreover, for the first time on appeal, Correa-Negron now attempts to attack the sufficiency of his indictment. We will not entertain his contentions regarding this issue. This Court has emphasized on numerous occasions that \u201c[w]e will not notice matters which were not presented to the district court except to prevent a miscarriage of justice. Petitioner cannot try one case below and another on appeal.\u201d Conklin v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 516, 517-518; <em>see, e. g., </em>United States v. Hall, 5 Cir. 1971, 440 F.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> Despite the express abolition of coram nobis relief in federal civil actions, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), it is still available, with respect to criminal convictions under the All Writs Statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651(a). <em>See </em>United States v. Morgan, 1954, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L. Ed. 248. Nevertheless, the writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary writ and the jurisdiction of the court to grant such relief is of limited scope. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Norman, 6 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 212, cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1014, 88 S.Ct. 1265, 20 L.Ed.2d 163. Coram nobis is only available to correct errors of the most fundamental character where the circumstances are compelling to achieve justice. United States v. Morgan, su<em>pra; </em>Cline v. United States, 5 Cir. 1972, 453 F.2d 873. Furthermore, coram nobis normally lies only when the petitioner is no longer in federal custody. <em>See </em>United States v. Brown, 9 Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 878; United States v. Sullivan, D.Haw.1968, 278 F.Supp. 626. Where a petitioner is still in federal custody, relief from a prior invalid conviction must be sought by means of \u00a7 2255; for coram nobis survives only to the extent that it has not been replaced by statute and, therefore, is open to a prisoner only when his statutory remedies are unavailable or inadequate. <em>See </em>United States v. Morgan, <em>supra; </em>Mathis v. United States, E.D.N.C.1965, 246 F. Supp. 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Indeed, the Supreme Court in United States v. Tucker, 1972, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 made clear that the <em>sentence </em>which a prisoner is presently serving may be challenged via a \u00a7 2255 petition on the grounds that a prior invalid conviction was used for enhancement purposes. <em>See </em>Franchi v. United States, 5 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 1035. Although <em>Tucker </em>is factually different from the case <em>sub gudice </em>in that in <em>Tucker </em>the unconstitutionality of the prior convictions had been previously adjudicated where as here there is only Correa-Negron\u2019s allegations of the invalidity of his 1949 conviction, we do \u201cnot find this distinction sufficient to place this case outside the scope of <em>Tucker.\u201d </em>Lipscomb v. Clark, 5 Cir. 1972, 468 F.2d 1321 at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
