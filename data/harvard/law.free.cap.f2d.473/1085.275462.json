The appellant Tinney and five co-defendants were indicted for conspiracy and bank robbery pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (b), and (d). Tinney and three co-defendants were tried together. At the close of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, motions for judgment of acquittal were granted as to two of the co-defendants, leaving the prosecutions against Tinney and co-defendant Sellers for submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-19\">On the last day of this trial when all evidence had been presented, and prior to the closing arguments to the jury, it was brought to the court\u2019s attention that Tinney was not present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tinney\u2019s counsel, after having been granted permission to call Tinney\u2019s home to see if \u201cthere is anything amiss,\u201d reported, \u201cHis grandmother was out in the corridor there and she said he left at twenty minutes of 9 this morning, and she can\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>understand it. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then stated that if Tinney was not pres- \u2022 ent in \u201cten minutes, I am going to have the marshals pick him up. I am going to revoke his bail and commit him.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After 10 minutes had elapsed, the trial judge, Judge Wood, declared that \u201cwe will proceed with the case of Mr. Sellers.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The following colloquy then took place;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-6\">ME. LEIDNER [counsel for Tin-ney] : Do I understand you are declaring a mistrial in Tinney\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-8\">THE COURT: Oh, no, no. I am just simply stating what I said. Whatever bail he is on is forfeited, a bench warrant will issue, and he will be brought into court whenever the marshals pick him up. We will proceed from there. I am not going to declare a mistrial. If there is a mistrial, he has caused it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-11\">And I will fix bail then, perhaps, and he will sit in jail until I am ready to hear it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-12\">MR. GOGGIN [counsel for Sellers]: Is Your Honor going to permit Mr. Leidner to finish his case as if the defendant were here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-13\">THE COURT: Oh, no, not in the absence of the defendant. I can\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-15\">Now it is down to you and Mr. Wright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-16\">MR. GOGGIN: If Your Honor please, I believe the fact that Mr. Tin-ney hasn\u2019t shown up, while it is, of course, no fault of mine or my client, certainly reflects unduly upon our case, and I think it is somewhat prejudicial to my client at this juncture, in view of the circumstances, which, of course, is no fault of the court, the government, or anyone else, but I certainly think it casts a very unfavorable light on my position at this juncture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-22\">THE COURT: What do you want?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-23\">MR. GOGGIN: Well, I would ask that we at least have a continuance for a brief period of time to see if this man is going to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-24\">THE COURT: The motion is denied .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-26\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-27\">MR. WRIGHT [counsel for the government] : May I inquire, sir, when we would proceed against Tinney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-28\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know until we apprehend him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-29\">MR. WRIGHT: Well, surely Your Honor wouldn\u2019t retain this jury indefinitely ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-30\">THE COURT: Oh, no. This jury will determine Mr. Sellers\u2019 case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-31\">The jury entered the courtroom at 10:28 A.M. The prosecutor began his closing address and stated that the only defendant remaining for the jury\u2019s consideration was Sellers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After seven minutes, at 10:35 A.M., Tinney entered the courtroom, and the following occurred : <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-32\">THE COURT: Excuse me, Mr. Wright. Is that Tinney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-34\">MR. LEIDNER: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-35\">THE COURT: Take him into custody, Mr. Marshal. Lock him up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-36\">DEFENDANT TINNEY: Your Honor, sir, my car broke down on the Expressway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-38\">THE COURT: Never mind. I am sorry Mr. Wright. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-39\">The case was thereafter submitted to the jury only as to Sellers. The jury was unable to reach a verdict and was thus discharged. Upon inquiry by the prosecutor as to whether a mistrial was declared with respect to Tinney, the court stated, \u201cWell, if it is necessary to have it on the record, there is a mistrial insofar as Tinney is concerned.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Tinney\u2019s present contention that the mistrial was erroneously declared was raised by way of a motion for judgment of acquittal and was denied by the court below. A motion for dismissal on the ground of double jeopardy was also denied at the start of Tinney\u2019s second trial on the same charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The re-trial resulted in Tinney\u2019s being found \u201cguilty\u201d by a jury on Count I (conspiracy) of the indictment and \u201cnot guilty\u201d on the remaining substantive counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-3\">Tinney contends that the double jeopardy clause barred his further prosecution after the trial judge, <em>sua sponte </em>and without his consent, withdrew his ease from the jury and declared a mistrial at his first trial. The purpose of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy is to prevent the government from making repeated attempts to convict an individual of an alleged offense, \u201cthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). Thus a defendant has a \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949). It is undeniable that Tinney was placed in jeopardy once he was put to trial before the jury in the first proceeding. In recognition of the fact that a criminal trial is \u201ca complicated affair to manage,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> however, \u201ca defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\u201d Wade v. Hunter, <em>supra, </em>at 689, 69 S.Ct. at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">Over 145 years ago, the Supreme Court in United States v. Perez, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824), opinion by Mr. Justice Story, formulated the standard which has continued to be applied in cases such as this one where a mistrial has been declared without the defendant\u2019s consent: <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-12\">We think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes. 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) at 580, 6 L.Ed. 165.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">The standard of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d first adopted in <em>Perez </em>was recently reiterated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) as follows: \u201cIn the absence of such a motion [by the defendant for a mistrial], the <em>Perez </em>doctrine of manifest necessity stands as a command to trial judges not to foreclose the defendant\u2019s option until a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion leads to the conclusion that the ends of public justice would not be served by a continuation of the proceedings.\u201d This court emphasized in United States v. Brahm, 459 F.2d 546, 550-551 (3 Cir. 1972), that the trial judge must take \u201c \u2018care to assure himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>that the situation warrant [ed] action on his part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially favorable judgment\u2019 <em>(Jorn, </em>at 486 of 400 U.S., at 557 of 91 S.Ct.).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">Mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that any doubt should be resolved in favor of the liberty of the individual in order to prevent the exercise of \u201can unlimited, uncertain, and arbitrary judicial discretion,\u201d Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 738, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 1035, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1963), <em>quoting </em>United States v. Watson, 28 Fed.Cas. pp. 499, 501, No. 16,651 (D.C.N.Y.1868), we conclude that the trial court failed to adequately protect Tinney\u2019s right to have his case decided by a particular tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Although a mistrial was not formally declared in Tinney\u2019s first trial until after the jury had failed to reach a verdict as to the co-defendant Sellers, we think that the decision to withdraw the jury as to Tinney and to proceed with the case against Sellers marked the point at which the mistrial was effectively declared.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This occurred after the trial judge had waited but ten minutes for Tinney to appear. Moreover, the decision was made without regard to other reasonable possibilities and without taking all the circumstances into considera-tion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">United States v. Jorn, <em>supra,, </em>teaches that, absent a motion for a mistrial by the defendant, the trial judge should not foreclose a defendant\u2019s option to proceed to the jury without a \u201cscrupulous exercise of discretion\u201d in determining whether a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d warrants the declaration of a mistrial. United States ex rel. Peetros v. Rundle, 342 F.Supp. 55, 60 (E.D.Pa.1972). <em>Jorn </em>places on the trial judge \u201ca duty to exhaust all other reasonable possibilities before deciding to foreclose [a] defendant[\u2019s] option to proceed. . . . The scrupulous exercise of that discretion means that he must seek out and consider all avenues of cure to avoid trial abortion.\u201d United States v. Walden, 448 F.2d 925. 929 (4 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">We find no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d here. The most obvious alternative, a continuance for a reasonable length of time to see if Tinney would appear or to investigate the cause for his absence, was refused.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The failure to utilize this reasonable alternative before aborting the trial constituted an abuse of discretion. This is not to say that the absence of the defendant may never justify discontinuance of a trial. Each case must turn on its facts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor do we think that there is a minimum period of time which a court must wait before declaring a mistrial. But under the circumstances at bar, when only closing arguments to the jury were scheduled, no witnesses who might be unavailable or seriously inconvenienced thereafter were involved, the circumstances surrounding Tinney\u2019s absence were neither known nor sought after,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and there was no reason to believe that Tinney had fled, the court\u2019s failure to wait longer than ten minutes before declaring a mistrial was unjustified. \u201c[T]he power [to abort] ought to be used with greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u201d United States v. Perez, <em>supra, 22 </em>U.S. (9 Wheat.) at 580, 6 L.Ed. 165. It certainly can not be said that \u201cthe trial judge took \u2018care to assure himself that the situation warrant [ed] action on his part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially favorable judgment.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Brahm, <em>supra, </em>at 550-551, <em>quoting Jorn, supra, </em>at 486, 91 S.Ct. 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>The government\u2019s argument that retrial was permissible because the declaration of a mistrial was precipitated by Tinney\u2019s misconduct is without merit. The record shows only that Tinney was delayed by no fault of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-3\">We need not reach Tinney\u2019s other contention involving alleged error in his second trial, for our holding that his re-prosecution violated the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment requires that the subsequent judgment of conviction be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1146-11\">.
