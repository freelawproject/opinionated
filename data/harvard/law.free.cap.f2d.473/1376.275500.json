On September 30, 1970, the district court reversed the Secretary\u2019s determination and remanded the case to the Secretary for a new hearing. Following a second hearing, the Secretary determined that Gold had become disabled on April 1, 1970, and awarded disability benefits commencing on that date. Gold petitioned for further review in the district court seeking to reverse the Secretary\u2019s determination insofar as it held that Gold had not been disabled between April 1967 and April 1970. Subsequently, the district court again reversed the Secretary\u2019s determination with respect to the 1967-1970 period and remanded the case to the Secretary for another hearing. From that order the Secretary appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-25\">It is undisputed that, since April 18, 1967, Gold has suffered from a medically determinable myocardial infarction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>and arteriosclerotic heart disease which prevented him from returning to his former work as an airline pilot. Further, the parties agree that Gold\u2019s symptomatology significantly changed by April 1970 with the onset of angina pectoris, and that since that date he has been unable to engage in any type of substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">There was a conflict of medical evidence with respect to Gold\u2019s \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d within the terms of the amended definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in the Social Security Act, \u00a7\u00a7 216(i) and 223(d), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) and 423(d), during the 1967-1970 period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">In the opinion of vocational experts, during this period Gold had the ability to engage in light and sedentary work\u2014 such as manager of an office building, insurance claims examiner or adjuster, salesman of aircraft and aircraft parts, travel agent, manager of a general store, and organ or piano salesman \u2014 and that these jobs existed in significant numbers in both the region where Gold lives and other regions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">On appeal Gold contends that the district court\u2019s order of remand is not final and therefore is not appealable. We disagree. The district court not only denied the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary-judgment and reversed the decision of the Secretary, but also determined that on remand the Secretary had the burden of proving that reasonable job opportunities were available to Gold for the period April 1967 through April 1970. It further held that the Secretary\u2019s burden could not be met by a vocational expert testifying concerning job opportunities from an occupational manual and without the benefit of a personal interview with Gold. Unless the Secretary is allowed to appeal from this order he will never be able to reach the questions involved. Cohen v. Perales, 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 44, rev\u2019d on other grounds, Richardson v. Perales, 1971, 402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">Gold next complains that since no appeal was taken from the first remand order, and since the second remand order was identical to the first order, the time for an appeal has somehow run. The record refutes this argument. The only similarity between the first and second remand orders is the holding that reliance upon a catalog of job opportunities without independent determination that a reasonable opportunity existed for obtaining such work and without benefit of a personal interview was insufficient to meet the Secretary\u2019s burden. This erroneous legal standard was incorporated in the first remand order and the error was compounded in the second remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">Gold argues that a vocational expert must make an independent determination that Gold had an opportunity to obtain work. He contends that in light of the failure to personally interview him, the use of a dictionary of job titles is not evidence that the jobs enumerated by the expert are reasonably available to Gold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">The short answer is that Congress amended the law by the addition to the Act in 1968 of section 223(d)(2)(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-10\">(A) an individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">\u201cThe newly amended law makes it absolutely clear that the consideration whether an applicant would be hired is irrelevant.\u201d King v. Finch, 5 Cir. 1970, 428 F.2d 709. <em>See also </em>Meneses v. Secretary of Health, Education and Wei-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>fare, 1971, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 442 F. 2d 803; Brown v. Finch, 5 Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 80. The testimony of the vocational expert is substantial evidence that Gold was, from April 1967 to April 1970, capable of engaging in substantial gainful activity which existed in the national economy. <em>See </em>Chavies v. Finch, 9 Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 356; Gentile v. Finch, 3 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 244; Wright v. Gardner, 7 Cir. 1968, 403 F. 2d 646; Mullins v. Gardner, 6 Cir. 1968, 396 F.2d 139. Furthermore, the vocational expert\u2019s testimony need not be discounted because he had not interviewed Gold. Kyle v. Cohen, 4 Cir. 1971, 449 F.2d 489. <em>Cf. </em>Peoples v. Richardson, 5 Cir. 1972, 468 F.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">Finally, we are convinced that the Secretary\u2019s determination that Gold was not disabled for the period in question is supported by substantial evidence. Gold worked as an insurance salesman between November 1967 and November 1968, making $8,249.25 in gross commissions in 1968. Three doctors opined that Gold\u2019s heart condition indicated a \u201cslight limitation of physical activity,\u201d while one doctor felt that modest exertion would cause angina or fatigue. The first hearing examiner rejected the latter opinion as being inconsistent with the advice given by the doctor to Gold that he should walk half a mile a day or play golf. The five testifying doctors also held different opinions concerning Gold\u2019s vocational ability: two believed that Gold could do light or sedentry work; one thought that Gold could do part time work at home; and two felt that he could not return to significant gainful employment. The Secretary relied upon the opinions of the two vocational experts and two doctors, all of whom agreed that Gold could do light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">When we view the expert testimony in the light most favorable to Gold we find substantial evidence that Gold was not disabled from April 1967 to April 1970 within the meaning of the Act. In so concluding we do not disregard the contrary medical evidence. These opinions, however, present merely a conflict in the evidence which the Secretary was called upon to resolve. Martin v. Finch, 5 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
