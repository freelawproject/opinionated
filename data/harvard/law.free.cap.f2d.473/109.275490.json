Appellants, law students enrolled in a clinical legal education seminar, seek disclosure by the Renegotiation Board (the Board) of three categories of documents regarding eight named corporations that have entered into national defense contracts with certain Departments or agencies of the United States government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the Board level, as will be explained, appellants\u2019 request was substantially denied. In the District Court appellants sought to compel disclosure. The court granted the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, giving no reasons. The appeal challenges the action of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">Congress charged the Renegotiation Board with the responsibility of eliminating excessive profits earned on contracts between national defense contractors and the United States. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1217 (1970). Those holding contracts subject to the Renegotiation Act are required to submit to the .Board various forms detailing receipts, accruals, cost and profits relating to the performance of such contracts. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1215(e)(1) (1970). If it appears on the basis of these reports that excessive profits may have been earned, the Board is authorized to enter into renegotiation proceedings to \u201cendeavor to make an agreement with the contractor or subcontractor with respect to the elimination of excessive profits. . . . \u201d 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1215(a) (1970), as amended (Supp. I, 1971). If no agreement is reached during these informal negotiations, the Board shall enter an order determining the amount of excessive profits. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1215(a) (1970), as amended (Supp. I, 1971). Upon entry of such an order, a contractor may file a petition with the Court of Claims for a <em>de novo </em>proceeding to redetermine the amount of excessive profits. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1218 (1970), as amended (Supp. 1, 1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Under section 552(a)(2) of the Freedom of Information Act each agency must make available for public inspection and copying in accordance with published rules <em>inter alia </em>\u201cfinal opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases. . . . \u201d Pursuant to this section, appellants seek disclosure of certain Unilateral Orders, Statements of Determination and the Agreements to Eliminate Excess Profits. That these documents come within the category of \u201cfinal opinions\u201d is not questioned. Appellants seek a second and a third category of documents pursuant to section 552(a)(3) of the Act, which requires disclosure of \u201cidentifiable records.\u201d The second category comprises the following information forms submitted to the Board from the eight named contractors from JulyT, 1964, to June 30, 1969: the Standard Form of Contractors Report for. Renegotiation, Statements of Nonapplicability of the Renegotiation Act, and Reports of Self-Exemption. In the third category are transcripts or minutes of meetings held in connection with the agreements to eliminate excessive profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\"> Our decisions interpreting the Act require the courts to be hospitable to disclosure, Bristol-Myers v. FTC, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 424 F.2d 935 (1970); Soucie v. David, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 448 F.2d 1067 (1971), especially where no problem of identification of information requested is involved. See Irons v. Schulyer, 151 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 465 F. 2d 608 (1972). The exceptions to disclosure are to be narrowly construed. Soucie v. David, <em>supra. </em>It follows that if the trial court decides the agency is not required to respond to a request for information under the Act the court must identify the exemption which supports non-disclosure. Bristol-Myers v. FTC, <em>supra; </em>Soucie v. David, <em>supra; </em>Ackerley v. Ley, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 420 F. 2d 1336 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\"> We consider now the request for disclosure of the final orders and opinions, the first category. In granting the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, though no reasons were stated, the District Court apparently relied upon Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. v. Renegotiation Board, 138 U.S. App.D.C. 147, 425 F.2d 578 (1970), as authorizing disclosure of the contents of the documents with deletion by the Board of details identifying the contractors. Such deletions, it appears, were made on the assumption either that <em>Grumman </em>afforded protection to anonymity <em>per se, </em>or that the opinions and orders contained information of a confidential character within Exemption 4<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that such confidentiality could be protected by such deletions. The Board had contended in <em>Grumman </em>that the opinions and orders involving the fourteen contracts were exempt from disclosure \u201cbecause they include data submitted \u2018in confidence\u2019 to the Board by defense contractors,\u201d <em>Grumman, supra, </em>138 U.S.App.D.C. at 149, 425 F.2d at 580. The <em>Grumman </em>court, however, held that Congress did not intend to exempt an entire document merely because it contained some confidential information, the primary purpose of the Act being served by maximum disclosure consistent with the statutory exemptions. This purpose was deemed fulfilled as the case was there presented by deleting the identifying details, with disclosure of the balance of the information in the opinions and orders. The court stated: \u201cshould data which falls within Exemption (4) appear in any Board opinion or order . . . the interests of confidentiality [of Exemption 4] can be pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tected by striking identifying details prior to releasing the document,\u201d (footnotes omitted), <em>Grumman, supra, </em>138 U. S.App.D.C. at 149-150, 425 F.2d at 580-581. Appellants contend that <em>Grumman </em>authorizes such deletions, however, only if the other contents of the document are in fact independently confidential<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> within the meaning of Exemption 4, which they dispute is the case. Hence we are now faced with a direct challenge both to the confidentiality of the identification of the contractors <em>per se </em>and to the confidentiality of the commercial and financial information in the requested documents. While we cannot fault the Board or the District Court in the present case in adopting an understandable construction of <em>Grumman </em>which would permit the deletion of identifying details, we do not give <em>Grumman </em>an interpretation which preserves the anonymity <em>per se </em>of the contractors with the government. The question is one of confidentiality under Exemption 4. Identifying details of these contractors do not so qualify in and of themselves. As stated in footnote 10 of the <em>Grumman </em>opinion, 138 U.S.App.D.C. at 150, 425 F.2d at 581, it is required that \u201cjustification for the deletion be fully explained in writing.\u201d Only if the information in an opinion or order is independently confidential within the meaning of Exemption 4 or, in the rare case where the name or other identifying details may be used to reconstruct confidential information in conjunction with information to be disclosed by the Board, should identifying details be deleted. This court said in <em>Bristol-Myers, supra, </em>138 U.S.App.D.C. at 25-26, 424 F.2d at 938-939:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">the statutory scheme does not permit a bare claim of confidentiality to immunize agency files from scrutiny. The District Court in the first instance has the responsibility of determining the validity and extent of the claim, and insuring that the exemption . is strictly construed in light of the legislative intent. The court may well conclude that portions of the requested material are protected, and it may be that identifying details or secret matters can be deleted from a document to render it subject to disclosure. These judgments are possible only after careful consideration of the particular documents in question . (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">On the remand of this case, therefore, the District Court should first determine in an <em>in camera </em>proceeding whether the commercial and financial data contained in the requested opinions and orders, with details identifying the contractors not deleted, were independently confidential within the meaning of Exemption 4. If the court finds that any of such information is exempt from disclosure, then the deletion of the identifying details which have been made by the Board shall not be disturbed, since such information has already been disclosed in this case. If, on the other hand, the court finds that none of the information is independently exempt from disclosure, then the court shall order disclosure of the identifying details previously deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">We now consider the request for disclosure of the information forms, namely, the Standard Form of Contractor\u2019s Report for Renegotiation, Statement of Non-Applicability, and the data required to be set forth in the Contractor\u2019s Report of Self-Exemption. These documents, comprising the second category, are submitted by the contractors and do not, like Board orders and opinions, represent governmental action. The Board contends that these documents are protected from disclosure by reason of Exemption 4 as confidential commercial and financial information received from persons outside the Government. We apply to these documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the ruling this court made in <em>Grumman </em>with respect to a similar contention of the Board involving certain documents other than Board opinions and orders as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">After examination of those documents, the District Court must decide whether they contain commercial or financial information which the contractor would not reveal to the public and therefore are exempt from disclosure or are subject to release only after appropriate deletions have been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADau\">138 U.S.App.D.C. at 151, 425 F.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">There remains the request for the minutes of the meetings held in connection with the agreements of the companies to eliminate excessive profits. The record before us does not explain the nature of the records made of such meetings in a manner to enable us to pass upon the disclosure obligation of the Board. The brief of the Board describes these \u201cminutes\u201d as merely memo-randa summarizing the results of the meetings with the contractors. The Board defends non-disclosure of these memoranda under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) (1970), which exempts from disclosure,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">As we have pointed out, in refusing to require disclosure the trial court gave no reason. We do not know whether the court considered Exemption 5 now relied upon by the Board to apply. Assuming, however, that the court did act upon the basis of Exemption 5, further exploration and explanation by the District Court are required. One of the principles to guide the court is whether the memoranda</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">contain intra- and inter-agency advisory opinions and recommendations submitted for consideration in the performance of decision- and policy-making functions. This claim, if appropriately advanced and supported, would preclude disclosure of these documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">Freeman v. Seligson, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 69, 405 F.2d 1326, 1339 (1968), citing Boeing Airplane Co. v. Coggeshall, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 106, 112, 280 F.2d 654, 660 (1960), Machin v. Zuckert, 114 U.S. App.D.C. 335, 338, 316 F.2d 336, 339, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 896, 84 S.Ct. 172, 11 L.Ed.2d 124 (1963), V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, Jena v. Clark, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 10, 384 F.2d 979, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 952, 88 S.Ct. 334, 19 L.Ed.2d 361 (1967). <em>Freeman </em>and the cases above referred to were not decided under the Freedom of Information Act, but under discovery principles otherwise applicable to civil litigation. Nevertheless, in support of its statement that the claim, if supported, would preclude disclosure of the documents, the court in a lengthy footnote following the text above quoted pointed out that Exemption 5 of the Act covered \u201c[i]nter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the agency.\u201d The Court in <em>Freeman </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> quoted at length from the House Report on the Act, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">. . . a Government agency cannot always operate effectively if it is required to disclose documents or information which it has received or generated before it completes the process of awarding a contract or issuing an order, decision or regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGa\">H.R.Rep.No.1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1966), U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin. News, 1966, p. 2427. See also S.Rep. No.813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The District Court should examine <em>in camera </em>the memoranda to determine whether they contain recommendations or deliberations in the course of decision making \u2014 or exchange of views in that process within the agency\u2014 which would bring them within Exemption 5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If so, with the qualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>now to be stated, they fall within the exemption. The qualification is that if these portions of the memoranda contain factual data which can be disentwined from the decision-making process, and the factual data is not within some other exemption, so much of the memoranda as is of a factual character should be disclosed. Thus, in Bristol-Myers Company v. FTC, <em>supra,, </em>138 U.S.App.D.C. at 26, 424 F.2d at 939, it is held with respect to Exemption 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">This provision encourages the free exchange of ideas among government policy makers, but it does not authorize an agency to throw a protective blanket over all information by casting it in the form of an internal memorandum. Purely factual reports and scientific studies cannot be cloaked in secrecy by an exemption designed to protect only \u201cthose internal working papers in which opinions are expressed and policies formulated and recommended.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1D\">Appellants contend that even such \u201cpolicy-making\u201d documents lose whatever intra-agency, non-disclosure, status they may have had, once the agency\u2019s action has been publicly announced, citing American Mail Line, Ltd. v. Gulick, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 382, 411 F.2d 696 (1969). We think <em>Gulick </em>is not so to be construed. In the special circumstances there before the court, the intra-agency document sought to be disclosed was explicitly relied upon and referred to in the published opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">If the Maritime Subsidy Board did not want to expose its staff\u2019s memorandum to public scrutiny it should not have stated publicly in its ruling that its action was based upon that memorandum, giving no other reasons or basis for its action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">133 U.S.App.D.C. at 389, 411 F.2d at 703. Accordingly the memorandum had lost its intra-agency character. It is not lost, however, merely by the circumstance that the process of decision has been completed. Exemption 5 applies according to the character of the memo-randa, and not according to their chronological position in the decision-making process of which they might have been a part. There might be exceptions due to the passage of time, or to some special over-riding circumstance, but we need not speculate about such exceptions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Grant of the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-12\">.
