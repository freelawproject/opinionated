The critical factual determinations upon which the Board based its decision are clearly supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">We reject the respondent\u2019s contention that the aggrieved employee failed to exhaust administrative remedies which the respondent urges were available under a collective bargaining agreement, consummated after the unfair labor practice had occurred. \u201c[W]here the facts create both an arbitrable dispute and a possible unfair labor practice, the Board has discretion to issue a complaint or to defer action until an arbitration has been completed.\u201d NLRB v. Thor Power Tool Co., 351 F.2d 584, 587 (7th Cir. 1965). <em>See also </em>NLRB v. Strong, 393 U.S. 357, 360-362, 89 S.Ct. 541, 21 L.Ed. 2d 546 (1969). Moreover, the respondent, in its exceptions to the Examiner\u2019s findings and recommendations, did not, with adequate specificity, object to any failure on the Examiner\u2019s part to find that the grievance procedure was applicable to the controversy. Nor in its exceptions did the respondent make any other reference to its present contention in this respect. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46 (b) (1969). <em>See also </em>NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 350, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953); NLRB v. Giustina Bros. Lumber Co., 253 F.2d 371, 374 (9th Cir. 1958).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
