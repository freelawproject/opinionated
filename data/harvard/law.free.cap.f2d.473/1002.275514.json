We affirm the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">The standard emerged from a rule-making commenced June 10, 1970, when the Secretary published notice that flammability standards for mattresses might be needed, and invited comments. 35 Fed.Reg. 8944. A proposed standard was issued September 9, 1971 (36 Fed. Reg. 18095), comments being again invited. Comments from approximately 75 groups, many of them connected with industry, were received in response to the original notice and the later proposed standards; they were analyzed in written reports. Statistical data were gathered on bed fires across the nation; a consultant\u2019s study of such fires was obtained; and recommendations were received from members of the National Advisory Committee for the Flammable Fabrics Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">In response to the proposed standard of September 9, 1971, the Secretary received a letter (the only comment relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>ing to crib mattresses) from counsel for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers\u2019 Association, Inc. (one of petitioner\u2019s present counsel). Counsel requested exclusion of crib-size mattresses as \u201cinfants and young children obviously do not smoke.\u201d This letter along with requests from others for the exclusion of many other types of bedding (such as water beds and sleeping bags) was considered; the Department staff, in its comments, recommended exclusion of the latter (because of non-flammability) but against exclusion of crib mattresses, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-5\">\u201cExemption of youth and crib mattresses is not recommended. While members of these age groups do not smoke, their parents frequently do, and the accidental dropping of a lighted cigarette on these mattresses while attending to a child is a distinct possibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Thereafter, the present standard was promulgated to include \u201ccrib mattresses including portable crib mattresses\u201d but excluding, among others, \u201cjuvenile products pads such as ear bed pads, carriage pads, basket pads, infant carrier and lounge pads\u201d and the like.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The wording of the Act invites confusion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> over whether we must be satisfied that the Secretary\u2019s standard is \u201csupported by substantial evidence\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E)), or whether our review is measured under other clauses appearing in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), including especially the \u201carbitrary capricious, . not in accordance with law\u201d language of \u00a7 706(2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-15\">The provisions of the Act most in point are \u00a7 1193(d), making \u00a7\u00a7 551 through 559 of the APA (encompassing and defining both rule-making and formal adjudication) applicable to the issuance of all standards or regulations or amendments; and \u00a7 1193(e)(3), authorizing judicial review by courts of appeals in accordance with Chapter 7 of Title 5 (the judicial review sections of the APA). Absent a statutory directive for a hearing, we think the Secretary correctly interpreted the Act and the relevant APA provisions as contemplating rule-making under \u00a7\u00a7 551 and 553 rather than under \u00a7\u00a7 556 and 557. For the same reason, we find the substantial evidence test<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to be inapplicable. Automobile Parts &amp; Accessories v. Boyd, <em>supra, </em>at 337-338.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Congress did not specifically provide for \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review (as in the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>considered in Law Motor Freight, Inc. v. C. A. B., 364 F.2d 139 (1st Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 905, 87 S.Ct. 1683, 18 L.Ed.2d 622 (1967)), and the Secretary has not conducted a hearing, we do not feel at liberty to extend the language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (E). .</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Nonetheless, under the applicable other clauses of \u00a7 706(2), we must examine the standard in light of the criteria established in the Act. <em>See supra </em>note 1. The Secretary\u2019s obligation to make findings, based on investigation and research, that satisfy those criteria leads us to a standard of review that may differ little, if at all, from the standard normally used in substantial evidence review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our focus will be on the reasonableness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence before the Secretary, including the adequacy of the Secretary\u2019s responses to objections raised by participants in the rulemaking process. See Automobile Parts &amp; Accessories v. Boyd, <em>supra, </em>407 F.2d at 338, 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Of petitioner\u2019s three contentions, we find troublesome only the second \u2014 that the record does not support inclusion of crib mattresses within the standard adopted as generally applicable to all mattresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">On the first point, the record adequately demonstrates the need to protect the public against unreasonable risk of fire hazard from mattresses including crib mattresses. Twenty-three case studies show that fires may originate in, or spread to, crib or undersized mattresses, just as they do in adult mattresses. The Secretary could infer, from cases in the record and as a matter of common knowledge, that infants are particularly helpless to escape from fires in the mattresses where they lie.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">We find equally unpersuasive petitioner\u2019s third argument that the Secretary\u2019s finding of technological practicability was unsupported. The Secretary\u2019s finding was based on a consultant\u2019s study, presumably limited to adult mattresses, that the modifications needed for compliance with the standard would increase the retail price of a mattress from $39.95 to $49.95. We think the Secretary could infer that modification of crib mattresses would cause cost increases of no greater scale. At least he could do so in the absence of contrary evidence from the crib mattress manufacturers. Petitioner and those similarly situated had the facts in their possession to contest the finding of technological feasibility when first proposed. They did not do so. Indeed, they did not raise the point at all in their one communication to the Secretary during the rule making. See Unemployment Commission v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143, 155, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946). They had the burden of going forward with evidence uniquely in their knowledge. N.L.R.B. v. Mastro Plastics Corp., 354 F.2d 170, 176 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 972, 86 S.Ct. 1862, 16 L.Ed.2d 682 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining point is that the standard was not shown to be applicable to crib mattresses \u2014 the nature of the test and the Secretary\u2019s statement of intent<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> both focusing on the cigarette-fire hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>However, while the reason for a cigarette flammability test was data that cigarettes were the principal ignition source, we think the record provides a reasonable basis for including crib mattresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">First, the Secretary could infer, as he expressly did, that parents frequently smoke and \u201cthe accidental dropping of a lighted cigarette on these mattresses while attending to a child is a distinct possibility.\u201d Whether the test is \u201carbitrary, capricious\u201d or \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d, agencies are not precluded from drawing reasonable inferences from facts commonly known.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Second, both from test results mentioned in the record <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and common sense it could be inferred that the cigarette test would serve appreciably as a test of general flammability, affording protection against many mattress fires whatever their source. We are not required to overlook this rather obvious inference in determining the reasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s findings, since while his \u201cIntent of Standard\u201d refers to the cigarette hazard, his findings define the hazard more generally as the \u201cunreasonable risk of fire arising from such hazards as slow burning or smoldering. . . . Cf. Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962); That cigarettes were the principal source of risk does not demonstrate that the Secretary was not properly concerned about other dangerous sources, such as electrical cords, h'ot light bulbs, etc., and could not conclude that mattresses passing the cigarette test would be generally less vulnerable to ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Third, in declining to exclude crib mattresses, the Secretary could consider \u2014at least in the absence of any information from the industry showing that the cigarette test was peculiarly inappropriate \u2014 the desirability of adopting a single, uniform standard applying to mattresses generally. Not only might it seem patently objectionable to deny to helpless infants the same standard of safety afforded to adults within the same household, there also could be reasons of economy and administrative convenience for applying a single test to a generic product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Finally, the Secretary could take account of the crib manufacturers\u2019 failure to present any evidence warranting exclusion. The burden to justify inclusion of a product within a general safety standard is initially upon the Secretary. But at some point \u2014 reached, we think, here \u2014 the burden shifts to those seeking exclusion to come forward with their own evidence. If they do so, the Secretary may then have to develop further evidence in response \u2014 or otherwise risk our determination that inclusion is unsupported. The Secretary\u2019s initial burden, however, is not limitless \u2014 especially when dealing with inclusion of a product falling within a common product-line, as to the latter of which there is extensive evidence supporting application of the standard. If from what is before him, he plausibly opts for inclusion of a particular product, it is not unreasonable to require affected manufacturers to point out with particularity those features which make special treatment necessary. Here nothing was presented, beyond the cryptic assertion that infants do not smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">Petition to set aside flammability standard is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">. Under the Act, interior furnishings, among other products, not conforming to flammability standards established by the Secretary are prohibited in interstate commerce. The Secretary is to investigate deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from the accidental burning of such products; may conduct research into their flammability, and develop test methods; and \u201cshall institute proceedings for the determination of an appropriate flammability standard (including conditions and manner of testing) or other regulation\u201d whenever he finds, on the basis of such research, that a new flammability standard or other regulation \u201cmay be needed to protect the public against unreasonable risk of the occurrence of fire leading to death or personal injury, or significant property damage.\u201d \u00a7 1193.
