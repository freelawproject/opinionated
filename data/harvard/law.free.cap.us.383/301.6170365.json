Chief Justice Waeren</author>\n<p id=\"Aqo5\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">By leave of the Court, 382 U. S. 898, South Carolina has filed a bill of complaint, seeking a declaration that selected provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violate the Federal Constitution, and asking for an injunction against enforcement of these provisions by the Attorney General. Original jurisdiction is founded on the presence of a controversy between a State and a citizen of another State under Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution. See <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>324 U. S. 439. Because no issues of fact were raised in the complaint, and because of South Carolina\u2019s desire to obtain a ruling prior to its primary elections in June 1966, we dispensed with appointment of a special master and expedited our hearing of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Recognizing that the questions presented were of urgent concern to the entire country, we invited all of the States to participate in this proceeding as friends of the Court. A majority responded by submitting or joining in briefs on the merits, some supporting South Carolina and others the Attorney General.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Seven of these States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>also requested and received permission to argue the case orally at our hearing. Without exception, despite the emotional overtones of the proceeding, the briefs and oral arguments were temperate, lawyerlike and constructive. All viewpoints on the issues have been fully developed, and this additional assistance has been most helpful to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Voting Rights Act was designed by Congress to banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century. The Act creates stringent new remedies for voting discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale, and in addition the statute strengthens existing remedies for pockets of voting discrimination elsewhere in the country. Congress assumed the power to prescribe these remedies from \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which authorizes the National Legislature to effectuate by \u201cappropriate\u201d measures the constitutional prohibition against racial discrimination in voting. We hold that the sections of the Act which are properly before us are an appropriate means for carrying out Congress\u2019 constitutional responsibilities and are consonant with all other provisions of the Constitution. We therefore deny South Carolina\u2019s request that enforcement of these sections of the Act_be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The constitutional propriety of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects. Before enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial discrimination in voting. The House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary each held hearings for nine days and received testimony from a total of 67 wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>nesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More than three full days were consumed discussing the bill on the floor of the House, while the debate in the Senate covered 26 days in all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the close of these deliberations, the verdict of both chambers was overwhelming. The House approved the bill by a vote of 328-74, and the measure passed the Senate by a margin of 79-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Two points emerge vividly from the voluminous legislative history of the Act contained in the committee hearings and floor debates. First: Congress felt itself confronted by an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution. Second: Congress concluded that the unsuccessful rem-edi\u00e9s which it had prescribed in the past would have to be replaced by sterner and more elaborate measures in order to satisfy the clear commands of the Fifteenth Amendment. We pause here to summarize the majority reports of the House and Senate Committees, which document in considerable detail the factual basis for these reactions by Congress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See H. R. Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-16 (hereinafter cited as House Report); S. Rep. No. 162, pt. 3, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 3-16 (hereinafter cited as Senate Report).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1870. Promptly thereafter Congress passed the Enforcement Act of 1870,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which made it a crime for public officers and private persons to obstruct exercise of the right to vote. The statute was amended in the following year<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to provide for detailed federal supervision of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. As the years passed and fervor for racial equality waned, enforcement of the laws became spotty and ineffective, and most of their provisions were repealed in 1894.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The remnants have had little significance in the recently renewed battle against voting discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Meanwhile, beginning in 1890, the States of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia enacted tests still in use which were specifically designed to prevent Negroes from voting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Typically, they made the ability to read and write <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>a registration qualification and also required completion of a registration form. These laws were based on the fact that as of 1890 in each of the named States, more than two-thirds of the adult Negroes were illiterate while less than one-quarter of the adult whites were unable to read or write.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the same time, alternate tests were prescribed in all of the named States to assure that white illiterates would not be deprived of the franchise. These included grandfather clauses, property qualifications, \u201cgood character\u201d tests, and the requirement that registrants \u201cunderstand\u201d or \u201cinterpret\u201d certain matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The course of subsequent Fifteenth Amendment litigation in this Court demonstrates the variety and persistence of these and similar institutions designed to deprive Negroes of the right to vote. Grandfather clauses were invalidated in <em>Guinn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>238 U. S. 347, and <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>238 U. S. 368. Procedural hurdles were struck down in <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>307 U. S. 268. The white primary was outlawed in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allwright, </em>321 U. S. 649, and <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>345 U. S. 461. Improper challenges were nullified in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>362 U. S. 58. Racial gerrymandering was forbidden by <em>Gomillion </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>364 U. S. 339. Finally, discriminatory application of voting tests was condemned in <em>Schnell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>336 U. S. 933; <em>Alabama </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 37; and <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U. S. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">According to the evidence in recent Justice Department voting suits, the latter stratagem is now the principal method used to bar Negroes from the polls. Discriminatory administration of voting qualifications has been found in all eight Alabama cases, in all nine Louisiana cases, and in all nine Mississippi cases which have gone to final judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, in almost all of these cases, the courts have held that the discrimination was pursuant to a widespread \u201cpattern or practice.\u201d White applicants for registration have often been excused altogether from the literacy and understanding tests or have been given easy versions, have received extensive help from voting officials, and have been registered despite serious errors in their answers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Negroes, on the other hand, have typically been required to pass difficult versions of all the tests, without any outside assistance and without the slightest error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The good-morals require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ment is so vague and subjective that it has constituted an open invitation to abuse at the hands of voting officials.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Negroes obliged to obtain vouchers from registered voters have found it virtually impossible to comply in areas where almost no Negroes are on the rolls.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In recent years, Congress has repeatedly tried to cope with the problem by facilitating case-by-case litigation against voting discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1957<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> authorized the Attorney General to seek injunctions against public and private interference with the right to vote on racial grounds. Perfecting amendments in the Civil Rights Act of 1960 <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> permitted the joinder of States as parties defendant, gave the Attorney General access to local voting records, and authorized courts to register voters in areas of systematic discrimination.Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> expedited the hearing of voting cases before three-judge courts and outlawed some of the tactics used to disqualify Negroes from voting in federal elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Despite the earnest efforts of the Justice Department and of many federal judges, these new laws have done little to cure the problem of voting discrimination. According to estimates by the Attorney General during hearings on the Act, registration of voting-age Negroes in Alabama rose only from 14.2% to 19.4% between 1958 and 1964; in Louisiana it barely inched ahead from 31.7% to 31.8% between 1956 and 1965; and in Mississippi it increased only from 4.4% to 6.4% between 1954 and 1964. In each instance, registration of voting-age whites ran roughly 50 percentage points or more ahead of Negro registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The previous legislation has proved ineffective for a number of reasons. Voting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, sometimes requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent combing through registration records in preparation for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded voting officials and others involved in the proceedings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been obtained, some of the States affected have merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests designed to prolong the existing disparity between white and Negro registration.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Alternatively, certain local officials have defied and evaded court orders or have simply closed their registration offices to freeze the voting rolls.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The provision of the 1960 law authorizing registration by federal officers has had little impact on local maladministration because of its procedural complexities.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">During the hearings and debates on the Act, Selma, Alabama, was repeatedly referred to as the pre-eminent example of the ineffectiveness of existing legislation. In Dallas County, of which Selma is the seat, there were four years of litigation by the Justice Department and two findings by the federal courts of widespread voting discrimination. Yet in those four years, Negro registra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>tion rose only from 156 to 383, although there are approximately 15,000 Negroes of voting age in the county. Any possibility that these figures were attributable to political apathy was dispelled by the protest demonstrations in Selma in the early months of 1965. The House Committee on the Judiciary summed up the reaction of Congress to these developments in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">\u201cThe litigation in Dallas County took more than 4 years to open the door to the exercise of constitutional rights conferred almost a century ago. The problem on a national scale is that the difficulties experienced in suits in Dallas County have been encountered over and over again under existing voting laws. Four years is too long. The burden is too heavy \u2014 the wrong to our citizens is too serious \u2014 the damage to our national conscience is too great not to adopt more effective measures than exist today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cSuch is the essential justification for the pending bill.\u201d House Report 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The Voting Rights Act of 1965 reflects Congress\u2019 firm intention to rid the country of racial discrimination in voting.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The heart of the Act is a complex scheme of stringent remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant. Section 4 (a)-(d) lays down a formula defining the States and political subdivisions to which these new remedies apply. The first of the remedies, contained in \u00a7 4 (a), is the suspension of literacy tests and similar voting qualifications for a period of five years from the last occurrence of substantial voting discrimination. Section 5 prescribes a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>remedy, the suspension of all new voting regulations pending review by federal authorities to determine whether their use would perpetuate voting discrimination. The third remedy, covered in \u00a7\u00a7 6 (b), 7, 9, and 13 (a), is the assignment of federal examiners on certification by the Attorney General to list qualified applicants who are thereafter entitled to vote in all elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Other provisions of the Act prescribe subsidiary cures for persistent voting discrimination. Section 8 authorizes the appointment of federal poll-watchers in places to which federal examiners have already been assigned. Section 10 (d) excuses those made eligible to vote in sections of the country covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act from paying accumulated past poll taxes for state and local elections. Section 12 (e) provides for balloting by persons denied access to the polls in areas where federal examiners have been appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The remaining remedial portions of the Act are aimed at voting discrimination in any area of the country where it may occur. Section 2 broadly prohibits the use of voting rules to abridge exercise of the franchise on racial grounds. Sections 3, 6 (a), and 13 (b) strengthen existing procedures for attacking voting discrimination by means of litigation. Section 4 (e) excuses citizens educated in American schools conducted in a foreign language from passing English-language literacy tests. Section 10 (a)-(c) facilitates constitutional litigation challenging the imposition of all poll taxes for state and local elections. Sections 11 and 12 (a)-(d) authorize civil and criminal sanctions against interference with the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">At the outset, we emphasize that only some of the many portions of the Act are properly before us. South Carolina has not challenged \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4 (e), 6 (a), 8, 10, 12 (d) and (e), 13 (b), and other miscellaneous provisions having nothing to do with this lawsuit. Judicial review of these sections must await subsequent litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In addition, we find that South Carolina\u2019s attack on \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12 (a)-(c) is premature. No person has yet been subjected to, or even threatened with, the criminal sanctions which these sections of the Act authorize. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baines, </em>362 U. S. 17, 20-24. Consequently, the only sections of the Act to be reviewed at this time are \u00a7\u00a7 4 (a)-(d), 5, 6 (b), 7, 9, 13 (a), and certain procedural portions of \u00a7 14, all of which are presently in actual operation in South Carolina. We turn now to a detailed description of these provisions and their present status.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\n<em>Coverage formula.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The remedial sections of the Act assailed by South Carolina automatically apply to any State; or to any separate political subdivision such as a county or parish, for which two findings have been made: (1) the Attorney General has determined that on November 1, 1964, it maintained a \u201ctest or device,\u201d and (2) the Director of the Census has determined that less than 50% of its voting-age residents were registered on November 1,1964, or voted in the presidential election of November 1964. These findings are not reviewable in any court and are final upon publication in the Federal Register. \u00a7 4 (b). As used throughout the Act, the phrase \u201ctest or device\u201d means any requirement that a registrant or voter must \u201c(1) demonstrate the ability to read, write, understand, or interpret any matter, (2) demonstrate any educational achievement or his knowledge of any particular subject, (3) possess good moral character, or (4) prove his quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>fications by the voucher of registered voters or members of any other class.\u201d \u00a7 4 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Statutory coverage of a State or political subdivision under \u00a7 4 (b) is terminated if the area obtains a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia, determining that tests and devices have not been used during the preceding five years to abridge the franchise on racial grounds. The Attorney General shall consent to entry of the judgment if he has no reason to believe that the facts are otherwise. \u00a74 (a). For the purposes of this section, tests and devices are not deemed to have been used in a forbidden manner if the incidents of discrimination are few in number and have been promptly corrected, if their continuing effects have been abated, and if they are unlikely to recur in the future. \u00a7 4 (d). On the other hand, no area may obtain a declaratory judgment for five years after the final decision of a federal court (other than the denial of a judgment under this section of the Act), determining that discrimination through the use of tests or devices has occurred anywhere in the State or political subdivision. These declaratory judgment actions are to be heard by a three-judge panel, with direct appeal to this Court. \u00a74 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">South Carolina was brought within the coverage formula of the Act on August 7, 1965, pursuant to appropriate administrative determinations which have not been challenged in this proceeding.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On the same day, coverage was also extended to Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, 26 counties in North Carolina, and one county in Arizona.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Two more counties in Arizona, one county in Hawaii, and one county in Idaho were added to the list on November 19, 1965.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Thus far Alaska, the three Arizona counties, and the single county in Idaho have asked the District Court for the District of Columbia to grant a declaratory judgment terminating statutory coverage.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\n<em>Suspension of tests.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In a State or political subdivision covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act, no person may be denied the right to vote in any election because of his failure to comply with a \u201ctest or device.\u201d \u00a74 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On account of this provision, South Carolina is temporarily barred from enforcing the portion of its voting laws which requires every applicant for registration to show that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201cCan both read and write any section of [the State] Constitution submitted to [him] by the registration officer or can show that he owns, and has paid all taxes collectible during the previous year on, property in this State assessed at three hundred dollars or more.\u201d S. C. Code Ann. \u00a723-62 (4) (1965 Supp.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIcx\">The Attorney General has determined that the property qualification is inseparable from the literacy test,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and South Carolina makes no objection to this finding. Similar tests and devices have been temporarily suspended in the other sections of the country listed above.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>Review of new rules.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">In a State or political subdivision covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act, no person may be denied the right to vote in any election because of his failure to comply with a voting qualification or procedure different from those in force on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>November 1, 1964. This suspension of new rules is terminated, however, under either of the following circumstances: (1) if the area has submitted the rules to the Attorney General, and he has not interposed an objection within 60 days, or (2) if the area has obtained a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia, determining that the rules will not abridge the franchise on racial grounds. These declaratory judgment actions are to be heard by a three-judge panel, with direct appeal to this Court. \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">South Carolina altered its voting laws in 1965 to extend the closing hour at polling places from 6 p. m. to 7 p. m.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The State has not sought judicial review of this change in the District Court for the District of Columbia, nor has it submitted the new rule to the Attorney General for his scrutiny, although at our hearing the Attorney General announced that he does not challenge the amendment. There are indications in the record that other sections of the country listed above have also altered their voting laws since November 1, 1964.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Federal examiners.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In any political subdivision covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act, the Civil Service Commission shall appoint voting examiners whenever the Attorney General certifies either of the following facts: (1) that he has received meritorious written complaints from at least 20 residents alleging that they have been disenfranchised under color of law because of their race, or (2) that the appointment of examiners is otherwise necessary to effectuate the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment. In making the latter determination, the Attorney General must consider, among other factors, whether the registration ratio of non-whites to whites seems reasonably attributable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>racial discrimination, or whether there is substantial evidence of good-faith efforts to comply with the Fifteenth Amendment. \u00a76 (b). These certifications are not reviewable in any court and are effective upon publication in the Federal Register. \u00a7 4 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The examiners who have been appointed are to test the voting qualifications of applicants according to regulations of the Civil Service Commission prescribing times, places, procedures, and forms. \u00a7\u00a7 7 (a) and 9 (b). Any person who meets the voting requirements of state law, insofar as these have not been suspended by the Act, must promptly be placed on a list of eligible voters. Examiners are to transmit their lists at least once a month to the appropriate state or local officials, who in turn are required to place the listed names on the official voting rolls. Any person listed by an examiner is entitled to vote in all elections held more than 45 days after his name has been transmitted. \u00a7 7 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A person shall be removed from the voting list by an examiner if he has lost his eligibility under valid state law, or if he has been successfully challenged through the procedure prescribed in \u00a7 9 (a) of the Act. \u00a7 7 (d). The challenge must be filed at the office within the State designated by the Civil Service Commission; must be submitted within 10 days after the listing is made available for public inspection; must be supported by the affidavits of at least two people having personal knowledge of the relevant facts; and must be served on the person challenged by mail or at his residence. A hearing officer appointed by the Civil Service Commission shall hear the challenge and render a decision within 15 days after the challenge is filed. A petition for review of the hearing officer's decision must be submitted within an additional 15 days after service of the decision on the person seeking review. The court of appeals for the circuit in which the person challenged resides is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>hear the petition and affirm the hearing officer\u2019s decision unless it is clearly erroneous. Any person listed by an examiner is entitled to vote pending a final decision of the hearing officer or the court. \u00a7 9 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The listing procedures in a political subdivision. are terminated under either of the following circumstances: (1) if the Attorney General informs the Civil Service Commission that all persons listed by examiners have been placed on the official voting rolls, and that there is no longer reasonable cause to fear abridgment of the franchise on racial grounds, or (2) if the political subdivision has obtained a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia, ascertaining the same facts which govern termination by the Attorney General, and the Director of the Census has determined that more than 50% of the non-white residents of voting-age are registered to vote. A political subdivision may petition the Attorney General to terminate listing procedures or to authorize the necessary census, and the District Court itself shall request the census if the Attorney General\u2019s refusal to do so is arbitrary or unreasonable. \u00a7 13 (a). The determinations by the Director of the Census are not reviewable in any court and are final upon publication in the Federal Register. \u00a7 4 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">On October 30, 1965, the Attorney General certified the need for federal examiners in two South Carolina counties,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and examiners appointed by the Civil Service Commission have been serving there since November 8, 1965. Examiners have also been assigned to 11 counties in Alabama, five parishes in Louisiana, and 19 counties in Mississippi.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The examiners are listing people found eligible to vote, and the challenge procedure has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>employed extensively.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> No political subdivision has yet sought to have federal examiners withdrawn through the Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">These provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are challenged on the fundamental ground that they exceed the powers of Congress and encroach on an area reserved to the States by the Constitution. South Carolina and certain of the <em>amici curiae </em>also attack specific sections of the Act for more particular reasons. They argue that the coverage formula prescribed in \u00a7 4 (a)-(d) violates the principle of the equality of States, denies due process by employing an invalid presumption and by barring judicial review of administrative findings, constitutes a forbidden bill of attainder, and impairs the separation of powers by adjudicating guilt through legislation. They claim that the review of new voting rules required in \u00a7 5 infringes Article III by directing the District Court to issue advisory opinions. They contend that the assignment of federal examiners authorized in \u00a7 6 (b) abridges due process by precluding judicial review of administrative findings and impairs the separation of powers by giving the Attorney General judicial functions; also that the challenge procedure prescribed in \u00a7 9 denies due process on account of its speed. Finally, South Carolina and certain of the <em>amici curiae </em>maintain that \u00a7\u00a7 4 (a) and 5, buttressed by \u00a7 14 (b) of the Act, abridge due process by limiting litigation to a distant forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Some of these contentions may be dismissed at the outset. The word \u201cperson\u201d in the context of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any reasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to encompass the States of the Union, and to our knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>this has never been done by any court. See <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Cocreham, </em>246 La. 244, 266, 164 So. 2d 314, 322, n. 5; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>318 F. 2d 1, 8 (C. A. 5th Cir.). Likewise, courts have consistently regarded the Bill of Attainder Clause of Article I and the principle of the separation of powers only as protections for individual persons and private groups, those who are peculiarly vulnerable to nonjudicial determinations of guilt. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>381 U. S. 437; <em>Ex parte Garland, </em>4 Wall. 333. Nor does a State have standing as the parent of its citizens to invoke these constitutional provisions against the Federal Government, the ultimate <em>parens patriae </em>of every American citizen. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>262 U. S. 447, 485-486; <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>273 U. S. 12, 18. The objections to the Act which are raised under these provisions may therefore be considered only as additional aspects of the basic question presented by the case: Has Congress exercised its powers under the Fifteenth Amendment in an appropriate manner with relation to the States?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The ground rules for resolving this question are clear. The language and purpose of the Fifteenth Amendment, the prior decisions construing its several provisions, and the general doctrines of constitutional interpretation, all point to one fundamental principle. As against the reserved powers of the States, Congress may use any rational means to effectuate the constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting. Cf. our rulings last Term, sustaining Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in <em>Heart of Atlanta Motel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>379 U. S. 241, 258-259, 261-262; and <em>Katzenbach </em>v. <em>McClung, </em>379 U. S. 294, 303-304. We turn now to a more detailed description of the standards which govern our review of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment declares that \u201c[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d This declaration has always been treated as self-executing and has repeatedly been construed, without further legislative specification, to invalidate state voting qualifications or procedures which are discriminatory on their face or in practice. See <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>103 U. S. 370; <em>Guinn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>238 U. S. 347; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>238 U. S. 368; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>307 U. S. 268; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allwright, </em>321 U. S. 649; <em>Schnell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>336 U. S. 933; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>345 U. S. 461; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>362 U. S. 58; <em>Gomillion </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>364 U. S. 339; <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 37; <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U. S. 145. These decisions have been rendered with full respect for the general rule, reiterated last Term in <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Rash, </em>380 U. S. 89, 91, that States \u201chave broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised.\u201d The gist of the matter is that the Fifteenth Amendment supersedes contrary exertions of state power. \u201cWhen a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right.\u201d <em>Gomillion </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>364 U. S., at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">South Carolina contends that the cases cited above are precedents only for the authority of the judiciary to strike down state statutes and procedures \u2014 that to allow an exercise of this authority by Congress would be to rob the courts of their rightful constitutional role. On the contrary, \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment expressly declares that \u201cCongress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\u201d By adding this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>authorization, the Framers indicated that Congress was to be chiefly responsible for implementing the rights created in \u00a7 1. \u201cIt is the power of Congress which has been enlarged. Congress is authorized to <em>enforce </em>the prohibitions by appropriate legislation. Some legislation is contemplated to make the [Civil War] amendments fully effective.\u201d <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>100 U. S. 339, 345. Accordingly, in addition to the courts, Congress has full remedial powers to effectuate the constitutional prohibition against racial discrimination in voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Congress has repeatedly exercised these powers in the past, and its enactments have repeatedly been upheld. For recent examples, see the Civil Rights Act of 1957, which was sustained in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>362 U. S. 17; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra; </em>and <em>Hannah </em>v. <em>Larche, </em>363 U. S. 420; and the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which was upheld in <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Louisiana </em>v. <em>United States, supra; </em>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>380 U. S. 128. On the rare occasions when the Court has found an unconstitutional exercise of these powers, in its opinion Congress had attacked evils not comprehended by the Fifteenth Amendment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>92 U. S. 214; <em>James </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>190 U. S. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The basic test to be applied in a case involving \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is the same as in all cases concerning the express powers of Congress with relation to the reserved powers of the States. Chief Justice Marshall laid down the classic formulation, 50 years before the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\u201d <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 421.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The Court has subsequently echoed his language in describing each of the Civil War Amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201cWhatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion, if not prohibited, is brought within the domain of congressional power.\u201d <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>100 U. S., at 345-346.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">This language was again employed, nearly 50 years later, with reference to Congress\u2019 related authority under \u00a7 2 of the Eighteenth Amendment. <em>James Everard\u2019s Breweries </em>v. <em>Day, </em>265 U. S. 545, 558-559.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We therefore reject South Carolina\u2019s argument that Congress may appropriately do no more than to forbid violations of the Fifteenth Amendment in general terms\u2014 that the task of fashioning specific remedies or of applying them to particular localities must necessarily be left entirely to the courts. Congress is not circumscribed by any such artificial rules under \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the oft-repeated words of Chief Justice Marshall, referring to another specific legislative authorization in the Constitution, \u201cThis power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.\u201d <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>9 Wheat. 1, 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Congress exercised its authority under the Fifteenth Amendment in an inventive manner when it enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. First: The measure prescribes remedies for voting discrimination which go into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>effect without any need for prior adjudication. This was clearly a legitimate response to the problem, for which there is ample precedent under other constitutional provisions. See <em>Katzenbach </em>v. <em>McClung, </em>379 U. S. 294, 302-304; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>312 U. S. 100, 120-121. Congress had found that case-by-case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting, because of the inordinate amount of time and energy required to overcome the obstructionist tactics invariably encountered in these lawsuits.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> After enduring nearly a century of systematic resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress might well decide to shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims. The question remains, of course, whether the specific remedies prescribed in the Act were an appropriate means of combatting the evil, and to this question we shall presently address ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Second: The Act intentionally confines these remedies to a small number of States and political subdivisions which in most instances were familiar to Congress by name.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This, too, was a permissible method of dealing with the problem. Congress had learned that substantial voting discrimination presently occurs in certain sections of the country, and it knew no way of accurately forecasting whether the evil might spread elsewhere in the future.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In acceptable legislative fashion, Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic areas where immediate action seemed necessary. See <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U. S. 420, 427; <em>Salsburg </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>346 U. S. 545, 550-554. The doctrine of the equality of States, invoked by South Carolina, does not bar this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>upon which States are admitted to the Union, and not to the remedies for local evils which have subsequently appeared. See <em>Coyle </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>221 U. S. 559, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\n<em>Coverage formula.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We now consider the related question of whether the specific States and political subdivisions within \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act were an appropriate target for the new remedies. South Carolina contends that the coverage formula is aw7kwardly designed in a number of respects and that it disregards various local conditions which have nothing to do with racial discrimination. These arguments, however, are largely beside the point.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Congress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting discrimination in a great majority of the States and political subdivisions affected by the new remedies of the Act. The formula eventually evolved to describe these areas was relevant to the problem of voting discrimination, and Congress was therefore entitled to infer a significant danger of the evil in the few remaining States and political subdivisions covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act. No more was required to justify the application to these areas of Congress\u2019 express powers under the Fifteenth Amendment. Cf. <em>North American Co. </em>v. <em>S. E. C., </em>327 U. S. 686, 710-711; <em>Assigned Car Cases, </em>274 U. S. 564, 582-583.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">To be specific, the new remedies of the Act are imposed on three States \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi\u2014 in which federal courts have repeatedly found substantial voting discrimination.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Section 4 (b) of the Act also embraces two other States \u2014 Georgia and South Carolina \u2014 plus large portions of a third State \u2014 North Carolina \u2014 for which there was more fragmentary evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>recent voting discrimination mainly adduced by the Justice Department and the Civil Rights Commission.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> All of these areas were appropriately subjected to the new remedies. In identifying past evils, Congress obviously may avail itself of information from any probative source. See <em>Heart of Atlanta Motel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>379 U. S. 241, 252-253; <em>Katzenbach </em>v. <em>McClung, </em>379 U. S., at 299-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The areas listed above, for which there was evidence of actual voting discrimination, share two characteristics incorporated by Congress into the coverage formula: the use of tests and devices for voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential election at least 12 points below the national average. Tests and devices are relevant to voting discrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual voters. Accordingly, the coverage formula is rational in both practice and theory. It was therefore permissible to impose the new remedies on the few remaining States and political subdivisions covered by the formula, at least in the absence of proof that they have been free of substantial voting discrimination in recent years. Congress is clearly not bound by the rules relating to statutory presumptions in criminal cases when it prescribes civil remedies against other organs of government under \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>382 U. S. 136; <em>Tot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U. S. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It is irrelevant that the coverage formula excludes certain localities which do not employ voting tests and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>devices but for which there is evidence of voting discrimination by other means. Congress had learned that widespread and persistent discrimination in voting during recent years has typically entailed the misuse of tests and devices, and this was the evil for which the new remedies were specifically designed.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> At the same time, through \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6 (a), and 13 (b) of the Act, Congress strengthened existing remedies for voting discrimination in other areas of the country. Legislation need not deal with all phases of a problem in the same way, so long as the distinctions drawn have some basis in practical experience. See <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U. S. 483, 488-489; <em>Railway Express Agency </em>v. <em>New York, </em>336 U. S. 106. There are no States or political subdivisions exempted from coverage under \u00a7 4 (b) in which the record reveals recent racial discrimination involving tests and devices. This fact confirms the rationality of the formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Acknowledging the possibility of overbreadth, the Act provides for termination of special statutory coverage at the behest of States and political subdivisions in which the danger of substantial voting discrimination has not materialized during the preceding five years. Despite South Carolina\u2019s argument to the contrary, Congress might appropriately limit litigation under this provision to a single court in the District of Columbia, pursuant to its constitutional power under Art. Ill, \u00a7 1, to \u201cordain and establish\u201d inferior federal tribunals. See <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Willingham, </em>321 U. S. 503, 510-512; <em>Yakus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>321 U. S. 414, 427-431; <em>Lockerty </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>319 U. S. 182. At the present time, contractual claims against the United States for more than $10,000 must be brought in the Court of Claims, and, until 1962, the District of Columbia was the sole venue of suits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>federal officers officially residing in the Nation\u2019s Capital.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We have discovered no suggestion that Congress exceeded constitutional bounds in imposing these limitations on litigation against the Federal Government, and the Act is no less reasonable in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">South Carolina contends that these termination procedures are a nullity because they impose an impossible burden of proof upon States and political subdivisions entitled to relief. As the Attorney General pointed out during hearings on the Act, however, an area need do no more than submit affidavits from voting officials, asserting that they have not been guilty of racial discrimination through the use of tests and devices during the past five years, and then refute whatever evidence to the contrary may be adduced by the Federal Government.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Section 4 (d) further assures that an area need not disprove each isolated instance of voting discrimination in order to obtain relief in the termination proceedings. The burden of proof is therefore quite bearable, particularly since the relevant facts relating to the conduct of voting officials are peculiarly within the knowledge of the States and political subdivisions themselves. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>355 U. S. 253, 256, n. 5; cf. <em>S. E. C. </em>v. <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>346 U. S. 119, 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Act bars direct judicial review of the findings by the Attorney General and the Director of the Census which trigger application of the coverage formula. We reject the claim by Alabama as <em>amicus curiae </em>that this provision is invalid because it allows the new remedies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the Act to be imposed in an arbitrary way. The Court has already permitted Congress to withdraw judicial review of administrative determinations in numerous cases involving the statutory rights of private parties. For example, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>California Eastern Line, </em>348 U. S. 351; <em>Switchmen\u2019s Union </em>v. <em>National Mediation Bd., </em>320 U. S. 297. In this instance, the findings not subject to review consist of objective statistical determinations by the Census Bureau and a routine analysis of state statutes by the Justice Department. These functions are unlikely to arouse any plausible dispute, as South Carolina apparently concedes. In the event that the formula is improperly applied, the area affected can always go into court and obtain termination of coverage under \u00a7 4 (b), provided of course that it has not been guilty of voting discrimination in recent years. This procedure serves as a partial substitute for direct judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\n<em>Suspension of tests.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We now arrive at consideration of the specific remedies prescribed by the Act for areas included within the coverage formula. South Carolina assails the temporary suspension of existing voting qualifications, reciting the rule laid down by <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Northampton County Bd. of Elections, </em>360 U. S. 45, that literacy tests and related devices are not in themselves contrary to the Fifteenth Amendment. In that very case, however, the Court went on to say, \"Of course a literacy test, fair on its face, may be employed to perpetuate that discrimination which the Fifteenth Amendment was designed to uproot.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 53. The record shows that in most of the States covered by the Act, including South Carolina, various tests and devices have been instituted with the purpose of disenfranchising Negroes, have been framed in such a way as to facilitate this aim, and have been ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ministered in a discriminatory fashion for many years.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the Fifteenth Amendment has clearly been violated. See <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 U. S. 145; <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 37; <em>Schnell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>336 U. S. 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Act suspends literacy tests and similar devices for a period of five years from the last occurrence of substantial voting discrimination. This was a legitimate response to the problem, for which there is ample precedent in Fifteenth Amendment cases. <em>Ibid. </em>Underlying the response was the feeling that States and political subdivisions which had been allowing white illiterates to vote for years could not sincerely complain about \u201cdilution\u201d of their electorates through the registration of Negro illiterates.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Congress knew that continuance of the tests and devices in use at the present time, no matter how fairly administered in the future, would freeze the effect of past discrimination in favor of unqualified white registrants.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Congress permissibly rejected the alternative of requiring a complete re-registration of all voters, believing that this would be too harsh on many whites who had enjoyed the franchise for their entire adult lives.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\n<em>Review of new rules.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The Act suspends new voting regulations pending scrutiny by federal authorities to determine whether their use would violate the Fifteenth Amendment. This may have been an uncommon exercise of congressional power, as South Carolina contends, but the Court has recognized that exceptional conditions can justify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate. See <em>Home </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Bldg. </em>&amp; <em>Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>290 U. S. 398; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>New, </em>243 U. S. 332. Congress knew that some of the States covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act had resorted to the extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse federal court decrees.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Congress had reason to suppose that these States might try similar maneuvers in the future in order to evade the remedies for voting discrimination contained in the Act itself. Under the compulsion of these unique circumstances, Congress responded in a permissibly decisive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">For reasons already stated, there wras nothing inappropriate about limiting litigation under this provision to the District Court for the District of Columbia, and in putting the burden of proof on the areas seeking relief. Nor has Congress authorized the District Court to issue advisory opinions, in violation of the principles of Article .III invoked by Georgia as <em>amicus curiae. </em>The Act automatically suspends the operation of voting regulations enacted after November 1, 1964, and furnishes mechanisms for enforcing the suspension. A State or political subdivision wishing to make use of a recent amendment to its voting laws therefore has a concrete and immediate \u201ccontroversy\u201d with the Federal Government. Cf. <em>Public Utilities Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 534, 536-539; <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 19, 24-25. An appropriate remedy is a judicial determination that continued suspension of the new rule is unnecessary to vindicate rights guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\n<em>Federal examiners.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The Act authorizes the appointment of federal examiners to list qualified applicants who are thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>entitled to vote, subject to an expeditious challenge procedure. This was clearly an appropriate response to the problem, closely related to remedies authorized in prior cases. See <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>United States, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>362 U. S. 58. In many of the political subdivisions covered by \u00a7 4 (b) of the Act, voting officials have persistently employed a variety of procedural tactics to deny Negroes the franchise, often in direct defiance or evasion of federal court decrees.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Congress realized that merely to suspend voting rules which have been misused or are subject to misuse might leave this localized evil undisturbed. As for the briskness of the challenge procedure, Congress knew that in some of the areas affected, challenges had been persistently employed to harass registered Negroes. It chose to forestall this abuse, at the same time providing alternative ways for removing persons listed through error or fraud.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In addition to the judicial challenge procedure, \u00a7 7 (d) allows for the removal of names by the examiner himself, and \u00a7 11 (c) makes it a crime to obtain a listing through fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In recognition of the fact that there were political subdivisions covered by \u00a7 4.(b) of the Act in which the appointment of federal examiners might be unnecessary, Congress assigned the Attorney General the task of determining the localities to- which examiners should be sent.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> There is no warrant for the claim, asserted by Georgia as <em>amicus curiae, </em>that the Attorney General is free to use this power in an arbitrary fashion, without regard to the purposes of the Act.

Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment provides, that \u201cThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d In addition to this unequivocal command to the States and the Federal Government that no citizen shall have his right to vote denied or abridged because of race or color, \u00a7 2 of the Amendment unmistakably gives Congress specific power to go further and pass appropriate legislation to protect this right to vote against any method of abridgment no matter how subtle. Compare my dissenting opinion in <em>Bell </em>v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 226, 318. I have no doubt whatever as to the power of Congress under \u00a7 2 to enact the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 dealing with the suspension of state voting tests that have been used as notorious means to deny and abridge voting rights on racial grounds. This same congressional power necessarily exists to authorize appointment of federal examiners. I also agree with the judgment of the Court upholding \u00a7 4 (b) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the Act which sets out a formula for determining when and where the major remedial sections of the Act take effect. I reach this conclusion, however, for a somewhat different reason than that stated by the Court, which is that \u201cthe coverage formula is rational in both practice and theory.\u201d I do not base my conclusion on the fact that the formula is rational, for it is enough for me that Congress by creating this formula has merely exercised its hitherto unquestioned and undisputed power to decide when, where, and upon what conditions its laws shall go into effect. By stating in specific detail that the major remedial sections of the Act are to be applied in areas where certain conditions exist, and by granting the Attorney General and the Director of the Census unre-viewable power to make the mechanical determination of which areas come within the formula of \u00a7 4 (b), I believe that Congress has acted within its established power to set out preconditions upon which the Act is to go into effect. See, <em>e. g., Martin </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>12 Wheat. 19; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bush &amp; Co., </em>310 U. S. 371; <em>Hirabayashi </em>v. <em>United States, </em>320 U. S. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Though, as I have said, I agree with most of the Court\u2019s conclusions, I dissent from its holding that every part of \u00a7 5 of the Act is constitutional. Section 4 (a), to which \u00a7 5 is linked, suspends for five years all literacy tests and similar devices in those States coming within the formula of \u00a74(b). Section 5 goes on to provide that a State covered by \u00a7 4 (b) can in no way amend its constitution or laws relating to voting without first trying to persuade the Attorney General of the United States or the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia that the new proposed laws do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying the right to vote to citizens on account of their race or color. I think this section is unconstitutional on at least two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>(a) The Constitution gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases and controversies only. If it can be said that any case or controversy arises under this section which gives the District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction to approve or reject state laws or constitutional amendments, then the case or controversy must be between a State and the United States Government. But it is hard for me to believe that a justiciable controversy can arise in the constitutional sense from a desire by the United States Government or some of its officials to determine in advance what legislative provisions a State may enact or what constitutional amendments it may adopt. If this dispute between the Federal Government and the States amounts to a case or controversy it is a far cry from the traditional constitutional notion of a case or controversy as a dispute over the meaning of enforceable laws or the manner in which they are applied. And if by this section Congress has created a case or controversy, and I do not believe it has, then it seems to me that the most appropriate judicial forum for settling these important questions is this Court acting under its original Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, jurisdiction to try cases in which a State is a party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At least a trial in this Court would treat the States with the dignity to which they should be entitled as constituent members of our Federal Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">The form of words and the manipulation of presumptions used in \u00a7 5 to create the illusion of a case or controversy should not be allowed to cloud the effect of that section. By requiring a State to ask a federal court to approve the validity of a proposed law which has in no way become operative, Congress has asked the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>secure precisely the type of advisory opinion our Constitution forbids. As I have pointed out elsewhere, see my dissenting opinion in <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U. S. 479, 507, n. 6, pp. 513-515, some of those drafting our Constitution wanted to give the federal courts the power to issue advisory opinions and propose new laws to the legislative body. These suggestions were rejected. We should likewise reject any attempt by Congress to flout constitutional limitations by authorizing federal courts to render advisory opinions when there is no case or controversy before them. Congress has ample power to protect the rights of citizens to vote without resorting to the unnecessarily circuitous, indirect and unconstitutional route it has adopted in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">(b) My second and more basic objection to \u00a7 5 is that Congress has here exercised its power under \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment through the adoption of means that conflict with the most basic principles of the Constitution. As the Court says the limitations of the power granted under \u00a7 2 are the same as the limitations imposed on the exercise of any of the powers expressly granted Congress by the Constitution. The classic formulation of these constitutional limitations was stated by Chief Justice Marshall when he said in <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 421, \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, <em>which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, </em>are constitutional.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 5, by providing that some of the States cannot pass state laws or adopt state constitutional amendments without first being compelled to beg federal authorities to approve their policies, so distorts our constitutional structure of government as to render any distinction drawn in the Constitution between state and federal power almost meaningless. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of the most basic premises upon which our structure of government was founded was that the Federal Government was to have certain specific and limited powers and no others, and all other power was to be reserved either \u201cto the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d Certainly if all the provisions of our Constitution which limit the power of the Federal Government and reserve other power to the States are to mean anything, they mean at least that the States have power to pass laws and amend their constitutions without first sending their officials hundreds of miles away to beg federal authorities to approve them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, it seems to me that \u00a7 5 which gives federal officials power to veto state laws they do not like is in direct conflict with the clear command of our Constitution that \u201cThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\u201d I cannot help but believe that the inevitable effect of any such law which forces any one of the States to entreat federal authorities in far-away places for approval of local laws before they can become effective is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>create the impression that the State or States treated in this way are little more than conquered provinces. And if one law concerning voting can make the States plead for this approval by a distant federal court or the United States Attorney General, other laws on different subjects can force the States to seek the advance approval not only of the Attorney General but of the President himself or any other chosen members of his staff. It is inconceivable to me that such a radical degradation of state power was intended in any of the provisions of our Constitution or its Amendments. Of course I do not mean to cast any doubt whatever upon the indisputable power of the Federal Government to invalidate a state law once enacted and operative on the ground that it intrudes into the area of supreme federal power. But the Federal Government has heretofore always been content to exercise this power to protect federal supremacy by authorizing its agents to bring lawsuits against state officials once an operative state law has created an actual case and controversy. A federal law which assumes the power to compel the States to submit in advance any proposed legislation they have for approval by federal agents approaches dangerously near to wiping the States out as useful and effective units in the government of our country. I cannot agree to any constitutional interpretation that leads inevitably to such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">I see no reason to read into the Constitution meanings it did not have when it was adopted and which have not been put into it since. The proceedings of the original Constitutional Convention show beyond all doubt that the power to veto or negative state laws was denied Congress. On several occasions proposals were submitted to the convention to grant this power to Congress. These proposals were debated extensively and on every occasion when submitted for vote they were overwhelmingly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>jected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The refusal to give Congress this extraordinary power to veto state laws was based on the belief that if such power resided in Congress the States would be helpless to function as effective governments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since that time neither the Fifteenth Amendment nor any other Amendment to the Constitution has given the slightest indication of a purpose to grant Congress the power to veto state laws either by itself or its agents. Nor does any provision in the Constitution endow the federal courts with power to participate with state legislative bodies in determining what state policies shall be enacted into law. The judicial power to invalidate a law in a case or controversy after the law has become effective is a long way from the power to prevent a State from passing a law. I cannot agree with the Court that Congress \u2014 denied a power in itself to veto a state law \u2014 can delegate this same power to the Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia. For the effect on the States is the same in both cases \u2014 they cannot pass their laws without sending their agents to the City of Washington to plead to federal officials for their advance approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In this and other prior Acts Congress has quite properly vested the Attorney General with extremely broad power to protect voting rights of citizens against discrimination on account of race or color. Section 5 viewed in this context is of very minor importance and in my judgment is likely to serve more as an irritant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the States than as an aid to the enforcement of the Act. I would hold \u00a7 5 invalid for the reasons stated above with full confidence that the Attorney General has ample power to give vigorous, expeditious and effective protection to the voting rights of all citizens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-4\"> If \u00a7 14 (b) of the Act by stating that no court other than the District Court for the District of Columbia shall issue a judgment under \u00a7 5 is an attempt to limit the constitutionally created original jurisdiction of this Court, then I think that section is also unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-4\"> The requirement that States come to Washington to have their laws judged is reminiscent of the deeply resented practices used by the English crown in dealing with the American colonies. One of the abuses complained of most bitterly was the King\u2019s practice of holding legislative and judicial proceedings in inconvenient and distant places. The signers of the Declaration of Independence protested that the King \u201chas called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures,\u201d and they objected to the King\u2019s \u201ctransporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences.\u201d These abuses were fresh in the minds of the Framers of our Constitution and in part caused them to include in Art. 3, \u00a7 2, the provision that criminal trials \u201cshall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.\u201d Also included in the Sixth Amendment was the requirement that a defendant in a criminal prosecution be tried by a \u201cjury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b425-5\"> See Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 as reported by James Madison in Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union of the American States (1927), pp. 605, 789, 856.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> One speaker expressing what seemed to be the prevailing opinion of the delegates said of the proposal, \u201cWill any State ever agree to be bound hand &amp; foot in this manner.
