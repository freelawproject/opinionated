Green, Incorporated, against the appellants, Rils P. Severin and Alfred R. Severin, copartners, trading as R. P. Severin Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">The declaration alleged that the plaintiff, \u201cbetween the dates of January J, 1930, and August 4th, 1930, proposed to furnish the defendants thirty-seven thousand (3T,000) barrels of Whitehall Portland cement, U. S. Bin Tested, in cloth bags, F. O. B. cars, Baltimore, Maryland, during the construction of the United States Post Office Building at Baltimore, for the sum of Two Dollars and fifty-one cents ($2.51) per barrel; terms of payment: ten cents (10^;) per barrel discount allowed for payment within fifteen days, net, 30 days; in the event that the general market, price declined below the price, namely, $2.51 per barrel, then the plaintiff agreed to meet the new price upon the same terms; which proposal the defendants accepted, and sixteen thousand four hundred and ninety-four barrels of said cement were delivered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the plaintiff and accepted and paid for by the defendants at the prices called for in said contract. That thereafter the plaintiff was notified by the defendants that they would not accept any further deliveries of said cement at any time. That the defendants thereafter neglected and refused and have ever since neglected and refused to order or receive the balance of said cement, although the Post Office Building is long since completed and although during the time of its construction the plaintiff was ready, able, and willing to deliver the remaining barrels of said cement as required by the terms of the contract.\u201d To the declaration, the defendants pleaded they \u201cdid not promise as alleged,\u201d and \u201cwere never indebted as alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The fundamental question lying at the root of the whole controversy seems to be, Was there a contract between the parties ?</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">It is contended by the plaintiff that there was a contract, evidenced partly by writings and partly by parol. If so, then it was for the jury to determine whether there was a contract, and, if they found a contract, what that contract actually was. If, on the other hand, writings alone evidenced the contract, as contended by the appellants, it was for the court to construe the writings, and determine whether there was a contract, and, if so, what that contract was. <em>Roberts v. Bonaparte, </em>73 Md. 191, 20 A. 918; <em>Joseph Bros. Co. v. Schonthal Co., </em>99 Md. 382, 58 A. 205; <em>Eureka Fertilizer Co. v. Balt. Copper Co., </em>78 Md. 188, 27 A. 1035; <em>Buffalo Steel Co. v. Kirwan, </em>138 Md. 65, 113 A. 628. Inasmuch as the appellants\u2019 theory was founded on the assumption that the writings alone evidenced the contract, it will be necessary to set out these writings, consisting only of the correspondence between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">It is shown by this correspondence that the appellee, Robert S. Green, Incorporated, was requested by the appellants to give quotations on certain materials, including \u201cGray Portland Cement,\u201d which were to be used by the appellants. This request was answered by appellee\u2019s letter of May 1st, 1930. In appellants\u2019 reply to appellee\u2019s letter, they asked that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>should be inserted in the proposed agreement the following provision, which is called by the parties the \u201cdecline clause\u201d: \u201cIn the event that during the life of this agreement, prices of materials embraced herein decrease, it is understood that the prices mentioned in this agreement shall be decreased accordingly.\u201d In answer thereto, the appellee wrote, saying: \u201cRegarding the paragraph in your letter in which you mention that a possible decline in the price might occur, we wish to advise that we understand this as follows: If the general market price of cement declines below the price of the contract, namely, $2.51 per barrel, then we will agree to meet the new price, same terms,\u201d etc. In reply to' the appellee\u2019s letter, the appellants wrote on June 27th, saying: \u201cThe clause mentioned in our contract governing decline in price, shall affect the contract price by whatever the decline may be. In other words, if the standard price of cement in the territory of Baltimore drops 10^, your price would decline accordingly from $2.51 to $2.41. Your interpretation of the decline, that it would only affect your contract if the price dropped to a point below $2.51, is incorrect.\u201d Replying to this letter, the appellee wrote on July 2nd: \u201cWe cannot allow you anything unless the market goes below the price which we have sold you.\u201d On July 10th appellants wrote appellee, saying: \u201cConsidering that the decline clause in the contract is very explicit, and under the conditions explained to you above, we cannot agree to any change,\u201d and suggested that, because of the urgency of the matter, it should be \u201csettled one way or the other without delay,\u201d and asked that the letter be answered by wire immediately, saying whether or not the appellee would accept the contract as it then read. This letter was answered by the appellee on July 22d, stating that their Mr. Green, who handled this phase of their business, was out of town, and would communicate with the appellants upon his return home. On July 25th appellee wrote acknowledging order for 150 barrels of cement, and said: \u201cThis to be in accordance with the terms of your letters of June 19 th, and July 2nd.\u201d The appellants, by their letter of August 1st, again took issue with the appellee as to its interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the \u201cdecline clause,\u201d and concluded their letter by saying: \u201cIt must be settled one way or the other immediately, and we therefore suggest that you respond to this letter by return mail.\u201d On August 4th appellee wrote appellants, saying: \u201cYou gave us the order for the cement for the above job on our quotations of May 1st. Yothing was said about the reduction in price in the event the market declined and we can. do nothing' regarding this matter only as outlined in our letters of June 19th and July 2nd.\u201d This is not a correct statement by the appellee, as the appellants\u2019 reply of June 16th to. appellee\u2019s letter of May 1st specifically inserted the condition known as the \u201cdecline clause,\u201d heretofore stated in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">It is conceded by the appellee that \u201cup and until the plaintiff\u2019s letter of August 4th, and the beginning of the deliveries of cement, on that day (which, as a matter of fact, was not the beginning of the deliveries) there was a disagreement as to the \u2018decline clause,\u2019 and there was no&gt; meeting of the minds.\u201d Therefore, if there was a meeting of the mi nils, it must be shown from that letter and what followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On December 30th the appellants wrote appellee. This was the first letter passing between the parties, after the reduction in the market price of cement. In this letter they again quote the \u201cdecline clause\u201d as it appeared in their letter of June 16th, and informed the appellee that they were debiting its account in the amount of $105, in accordance with contract agreement. The appellee, on January 5th, 1931, returned the debit memorandum, stating that they shipped the cement subject to their letters of June 19th and July 2nd, and again stated their position as to the \u201cdecline clause,\u201d and on January 10th appellants, wrote appellee that, as price reduction had gone into effect, they were canceling their invoice dated December 30th. On the same day the appellee wrote the appellants, again stating its interpretation of the \u201cdecline clause.\u201d On January 14th appellants wrote appellee: \u201cIf you will refer to correspondence, you will find that it was your desire and wish that it be handled that way, but. it was never agreed to by us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The correspondence closed with a letter from appellee to the appellants written on January 19th, 1931, acknowledging receipt of appellants\u2019 letter of the 14th, in which it is said: \u201cYou haye indicated that you are arranging to purchase the balance of the cement needed on the Baltimore Post Office elsewhere. In the event this is done, we wish to advise you that we will take the necessary steps to protect our interests in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On and after August 4th, 1930, the time at which it is conceded no contract existed, there was certainly nothing said in the correspondence showing the existence of a contract. On the contrary, the disagreement of the parties upon the \u201cdecline clause\u201d lasted throughout the entire correspondence, and it was because of such disagreement that the appellants ceased to purchase any more cement from the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The inability of the parties -to agree upon the \u201cdecline clause\u201d became an important factor in their dealings at that time, inasmuch as the market price of cement had largely decreased.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In several of their letters, the appellants used the expressions \u201cthe contract\u201d and \u201cour contract.\u201d These expressions, as used, cannot properly be construed as admissions of the existence of the contract set up by the plaintiff, or, in fact, of any binding contract. They were, at times, used in immediate connection with a denial of the correctness of the appellee\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cdecline clause\u201d of the proposed contract. In these cases the appellants, were referring to the \u201cdecline clause\u201d inserted in appellants\u2019 letter of June 16th, 1930, or their interpretation of that clause, and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In <em>Hand v. Evans Marble Co., </em>88 Md. 226, 40 A. 899, this court said, quoting for convenience from the headnotes: \u201cWhen negotiations between parties looking to the formation of a contract take place by correspondence\u2019, many letters being exchanged, and at a certain point an agreement seems to have been reached, still such agreement will not be held to constitute a final contract when the succeeding letters be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>tween them show that they did not intend to. abide by such terms as a complete expression of their intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The fact, as disclosed by the record, that- a number of barrels of cement were delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants and accepted and paid for by them, during the period of negotiations, is the parol evidence to which the appellee refers in its contention that the contract set np by it was evidenced partly by writings and partly by parol. The deliveries and acceptances made during the period of negotiations, at a time when it is definitely shown that the minds of the parties had not met upon the provisions of the proposed contract, cannot be given the significance ordinarily given to such facts, occurring under different circumstances, in determining the existence of a contract. These facts in no way reflected upon the question on which they were unable, to agree, and upon which the completion and consummation of the contract depended. It was upon the \u201cdecline clause\u201d that they could not agree, and upon this clause they never agreed, though it was continuously before them in their correspondence, and during the period in which the cement was delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants. We are unable to see how, or in what manner, the contract was evidenced by such parol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The alleged contract, in our opinion, was. evidenced only hv the written correspondence between the parties. This being so, the question whether a contract existed between them was to he determined, not by the jnry, hut by the court, upon a proper construction of the writings, consisting of the correspondence between the appellants and the appellee. In our opinion, the writings in this, case, consisting only of the correspondence betwen the parties, do not constitute a contract, and the trial court, by whom the question was to be decided, should have so held, and the case taken from the jnry, as was prayed by the defendants in their first prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed without a new trial; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
