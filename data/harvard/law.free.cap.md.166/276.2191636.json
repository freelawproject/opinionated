It now appears, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the plaintiff (appellee) desires to controvert, in point of fact, the allegations of the plea; and this, of course, she is entitled to do, the demurrer to* the plea only admitting the truth of the allegations in the plea for the purposes of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The order of this court reversing the judgment without a new trial is erroneous, and should he modified. The motion for reargument will he overruled, hut a modification of the judgment of this court, as requested in the motion for reargument, is allowed, so that the judgment will permit a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The previous judgment or order of this court is: \u201cJudgment reversed, without a new trial, with costs to the appellant.\u201d This is hereby modified so as to read: \u201cJudgment reversed, and a new trial awarded, with costs <em>to </em>the appellant.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
