See <em>In re Isserman, </em>345 U. S. 286. The order of disbarment is now before us on a petition for rehearing. Rule 8 of our present Rules provides that \u201cno order of disbarment will be entered except with the concurrence of a majority of the justices participating.\u201d The petition for rehearing is granted. A majority of the Justices participating do not find ground for disbarment of Isserman. Accordingly, the former order of disbarment is set aside and the rule against Isserman to show cause is discharged.</p>\n<judges id=\"b89-13\">Mr. Justice Burton, with whom Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Minton join, dissents for the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>stated in the opinion announced by Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, April 6, 1953, in <em>In re Isserman, </em>345 U.
