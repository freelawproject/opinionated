These bonds were revenue producing bonds as authorized by Chapter 58 of-Kentucky Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-31\">Chapter 58, Kentucky Revised Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b955-32\">Exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-33\">V.

City of Barbourville, Ky., 246 S.W.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-21\">II.

The privilege to vote on state or local issues is within the jurisdiction of the state, to be exercised as the state may direct and upon such terms as it may deem proper, provided that the laws -relating thereto are not unreasonable or arbitrary and there is no discrimination between individuals, and provided the privilege is not refused on account of race, color or previous conditions of servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-26\">Pope v.

Rates fixed by the municipality for services rendered by a municipally owned utility does not deprive the user of property of his rights under the law, nor is it a taking without due process of law, but is a matter of public policy for the legislature since the property owner receives a special benefit from the construction of the sewer, water lines and plants in the privilege of making use of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-29\">Carson v. Sewer Commission of Brocton, 182 U.S. 398, 21 S.Ct. 860, 45 L.Ed. 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-30\">V.

The issuance and sale of the revenue bonds by the City of Bowling Green for the construction of sewer system and water system expansions, the construction of sewer treatment plant and pumping stations without a vote of the people is valid, reasonable and non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>discriminatory, and a proper exercise of the police power of the city within the provisions of the constitution of the United States and the State of Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Citations Supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">JUDGMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">It is ordered and adjudged that defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss be sustained and plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is hereby dismissed at plaintiffs\u2019 cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
