From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496\">Plaintiff, a common carrier, brought suit alleging that defendant delivered to it a parcel for shipment and wrongfully stated its value to be not exceeding $50; that it was consigned to Henry Plaff, of El Paso, Texas; that while in transit it was destroyed, through no fault of plaintiff; that Plaff brought suit against the plaintiff Express Company for the value of the contents of the parcel and had judgment for $538, which on appeal was affirmed, and subsequently the Express Company paid said judgment with interest and costs. It was further alleged that plaintiff, a common carrier, was obligated for a less degree of care during transit for goods valued at $50 or less than for goods of greater value, and because of the value wrongfully placed on said parcel by defendant, plaintiff gave the less degree of care to the parcel, hence its destruction ; that this was fraud and deceit on the part of defendant which caused plaintiff to sustain damages.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-9\" pgmap=\"496\">The evidence showed that the shipping clerk for defendant delivered the parcel to plaintiff for shipment and took from plaintiff a receipt; that plaintiff did not ask for any valuation of the goods and no value was given.

Carriers, \u00a7 182<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence of knowledge of existence of provision in receipt limiting liability to certain sum admissible in action against shipper for fraud. In an action by a carrier, based on fraud and deceit of a shipper in delivering to it for shipment goods of a value greater than $50 without stating the value thereof, to recover damages sustained by the recovery of a judgment against it by the consignee for loss of the shipment, evidence of knowledge by the shipper\u2019s shipping clerk that the receipt for the shipment contained a provision limiting the carrier\u2019s liability to $50, unless the true value exceeding that amount be stated, is admissible.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b497-11\" pgmap=\"497\">2.

Carriers, \u00a7 168*\u2014what does not constitute actionable fraud or deceit by consignor. Delivery of shipment to carrier by consignor, without stating the value thereof, though he knows there is a clause in the receipt limiting carrier\u2019s liability to $50 in case a higher value is not given, does not amount to fraud and deceit entitling the carrier to recover damages sustained by recovery of a judgment against it by the consignee for loss of shipment.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b498-4\" pgmap=\"498\">5. Judgment, \u00a7 502*\u2014when judgment by consignee against carrier for negligence conclusive in action by carrier against consignor. Where a consignee has recovered judgment against a carrier for loss of shipment caused by the latter\u2019s negligence, such carrier cannot recover damages sustained thereby of the consignor based on his fraud and deceit in not stating the true value of the shipment under contract limiting carrier\u2019s liability to a certain amount unless such shipment is valued in excess thereof.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
