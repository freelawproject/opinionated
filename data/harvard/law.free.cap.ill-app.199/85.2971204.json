Brown, plaintiff, against J. E. Moudy, Walter Satera, A. G-. Rinehart and Charles Gualdoni, defendants, for damages for injury to plaintiff\u2019s means of support as the result of the sale of intoxicating liquor to plaintiff\u2019s husband. From a verdiet for plaintiff against defendants Satera, Binehart and Gfualdoni, such defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\" pgmap=\"108\">Plaintiff\u2019s husband with his family moved to the Town of Sesser, in Franklin county, about the month of September, 1908, and at that time he was about fifty years of age. Prior to moving.thereto he was a school teacher and farmer, but had never accumulated any property to speak of. He had had a good deal of sickness in his family, which involved a considerable expense for a man of his .means. Prior to his moving to Sesser he was a man of good habits, steady, industrious, and had furnished his family a comfortable support. About the month of March, 1909, after moving to Sesser, plaintiff\u2019s husband with his son, Baymond Brown, engaged in the butcher business until February 20, 1911. Their bank account introduced in evidence showed that their business was reasonably prosperous, and that during the period of two years it amounted to more than $25,000. On February 20, 1911, plaintiff\u2019s husband bought out his son\u2019s interest in the business and ran the business alone until about October 1, 1911, when the son bought out the father.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">It further appeared that some time after engaging in the butcher business plaintiff\u2019s husband began the use of intoxicating liquors; that he purchased said liquors of defendants and that the habit of drinking grew on him until it affected him to the extent that he neglected his business, and was frequently intoxicated to such an extent that he had to be assisted home. It also appeared that the trips to the saloon of defendants were of frequent daily occurrences and that at times it would be necessary for those in charge of the shop to go to the saloon for the purpose of bringing plaintiff\u2019s husband back to the shop to look after his business; that the butcher business conducted by plaintiff\u2019s husband ran down, and that finally he closed the same out and soon disposed of the funds derived therefrom, amounting to something like $1,200.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Am6\" pgmap=\"109\">It further appeared that in a fit of intoxication plaintiff\u2019s husband shot and killed a man and was incarcerated in the county jail for several months awaiting his trial.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">The court gave the following instructions for plaintiff :</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHU\" pgmap=\"109\">1 \u2018 The jury are instructed as a matter of law that the fact, if it is a fact, that the plaintiff did, during the time it is charged in her declaration that the defendants sold and gave intoxicating liquors to her husband, which caused his habitual intoxication, engage in keeping boarders or carried on the business of conducting a millinery store, will constitute no defense whatever for the sale or gifts of intoxicating liquors to her husband, causing his habitual intoxication, provided you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants did make such sales which resulted in such intoxication.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\" pgmap=\"109\">\u201cYou are instructed that every dramshop keeper is expressly prohibited by the statute of the State from selling or giving intoxicating liquor to a person who is at the time of such sale or gift in an intoxicated condition; and if you believe from a preponderance of all the evidence in this case that the defendants did repeatedly sell or give intoxicating liquors to plaintiff\u2019s husband when he was in an intoxicated condition, and if you further believe from the evidence that such sale or gifts of intoxicating liquors resulted in injury to plaintiff\u2019s means of support, then such sale or gifts of intoxicating liquors may be regarded by you as wilfully and wantonly made.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\" pgmap=\"109(68) 110(38)\">\u201cYou are instructed that it is expressly contrary to the statute of Illinois for any person to sell or give intoxicating liquors to a person known to be an habitual drunkard; and if you find from the evidence in this case that the defendants, well knowing that plaintiff\u2019s husband was an habitual drunkard, and that after having sucb knowledge did continue to sell or give him intoxicating liquors, which caused him to remain and be intoxicated* then such sales would be regarded by the law as having been wilfully and wantonly made, and will lay a proper foundation for the awarding of exemplary damages.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b110-7\" pgmap=\"110\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b110-8\" pgmap=\"110\">1.
