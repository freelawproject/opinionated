Devine, administrator of the estate of Nathan Collins, deceased, plaintiff, against the Chicago &amp; Erie Railroad Company and Chicago &amp; Western Indiana Railroad Company, defendants, to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate. From a judgment for $2,000 recovered by plaintiff, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\" pgmap=\"395(193) 396(68)\">It appeared that deceased was a switchman in the employ of the Belt Railway Company of Chicago and at the time he met his death was a member of a train crew engaged in the operation of a train of two cars and an engine on the tracks of the Chicago &amp; Western Indiana Railroad Company. There were on the right of way six tracks numbered from the east 1 to 6, and west of track 6 two switch or lead tracks. Collins\u2019 train was to be shoved north towards 37th street on track 6. A Chicago &amp; Erie train came north on track 3, passed over a diagonal track between 38th and 39th streets to track 4, and there stopped until it got a signal to go to track 5. It passed over track 5 to the crossing from 5 to 6 near 38th street, the engine in front. The deceased got off from his train on the east side thereof about fifty feet north of 38th street, probably to step across track 6 and throw a switch. Kibling, his conductor, got off the train on the west side and threw the switch. Collins when last seen by Kibling was standing on the east side of his train, which, as has been said, was on track 6. The Chicago &amp; Erie train, which had stopped at the crossing of the diagonal switch track and track 4, came north on track 5 and struck and killed Collins at a point about fifty feet north of 38th street.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-9\" pgmap=\"396\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-10\" pgmap=\"396\">1.
