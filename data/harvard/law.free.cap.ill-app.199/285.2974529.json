Merigold, plaintiff, against Sol H. Goldberg and the Twentieth Century Theater &amp; Amusement Company, a corporation, defendants, to recover commissions alleged to be due him as a real estate broker for the sale of premises. Plaintiff claimed the sum of $2,125, being two and one-half per cent, of $85,000, the sale price of the premises. The defendants entered a joint appearance, and, by an agent, filed an affidavit of merits in which it was stated, in substance, that neither of them employed plaintiff to sell the premises or agreed to pay him any sum for making such sale; that they were not jointly liable to plaintiff; that plaintiff was not the procuring cause of the sale, in that the premises were sold for the defendant company by a broker named Kipper, to whom it paid an agreed commission for said sale. The cause was tried before the court without a jury. After plaintiff\u2019s evidence in chief had been heard, the cause was dismissed as to the defendant Sol II. Goldberg, but the motion of the defendant company for a finding in its favor was denied. At the conclusion of all the evidence the court found the issues ag\u2019ainst the defendant company and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $2,125, upon which finding judgment for $2,125 against the defendant company was entered. From this judgment defendant company appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-7\" pgmap=\"308\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b308-8\" pgmap=\"308\">1.
