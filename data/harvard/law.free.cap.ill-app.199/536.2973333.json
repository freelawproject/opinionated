To reverse a judgment for plaintiff, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-9\" pgmap=\"558(193) 559(73)\">Defendant was engaged in making, selling and laying roofing. Under a contract made with its manager, plaintiff solicited orders directly from consumers. His contract required him to make an estimate or measurement of the number of \u201csquares\u201d of material (each containing one hundred square feet) each job would require. He was directed how to make the measurements and was allowed an extra square on each job for any discrepancy. His compensation was to be fifteen or twenty per cent, of the selling price, according to the quality of material ordered. After estimating the cost of the job according to the amount and quality of material.it would take, and securing the order at a gross price, he would send in the order and from the price therein named defendant determined the amount of material to supply. Owing to inaccurate measurements on which the gross price of the job was based, it was often found necessary to supply more than an additional square to complete the job, thus necessitating loss on' the contract. These shortages in measurements were discussed when ascertained, and deductions therefor were made from plaintiff\u2019s commissions, and shown on the monthly statement of accounts submitted to plaintiff according to which he was paid. While he objected thereto, \u201che took the money and went right on working,\u201d as testified to by defendant\u2019s manager. Plaintiff himself testified that he was told he would have to stand the \u201ccut\u201d and that the matter was final. After he left defendant\u2019s employ he brought this suit for practically the amount of such deductions.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-7\" pgmap=\"559\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-8\" pgmap=\"559\">Accord and satisfaction, \u00a7 4<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when acceptance of commissions during employment constitutes.
