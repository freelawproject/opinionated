It was not denied that a cement block had been missing but it was claimed that such block had been replaced before the accident and that the sidewalk thereafter, up to and including the time of the accident, continued to be in good condition. Defendant introduced the testimony of five witnesses which tended to show that about four months prior to the accident, the cement panel that had been removed was replaced.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-6\" pgmap=\"439\">Richard S.
