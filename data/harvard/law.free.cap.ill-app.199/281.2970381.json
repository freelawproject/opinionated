Dodge v. Thomas, 266 Ill. 76. \"When the cause was reinstated in the Circuit Court the chancellor was of the opinion that inasmuch as the Supreme Court had made no mention of the order dismissing the cross-bill, that all that he had authority to do was to dismiss the original bill as to the property known as the hotel property, and that he had no authority to proceed with said cause under the cross-bill.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-10\" pgmap=\"303\">Kagy &amp; Vandervort, for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-11\" pgmap=\"303\">Charles H.
