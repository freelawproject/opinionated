Graczykowski, trading as Division Street Iron Works, plaintiff, against Wanda Wysocki, defendant, for labor and material furnished. To reverse a judgment against her, the defendant sued out a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\" pgmap=\"464\">The plaintiff testified that the work and labor were furnished under a contract with the defendant, by which she agreed to pay him eighty-five dollars for the work and materials. He was corroborated by a witness who testified that he was present when the agreement was made. This testimony was directly contradicted by the defendant. Defendant claimed that plaintiff did not establish his case by a preponderance of the evidence, and that defendant\u2019s testimony was supported by the fact that she had made a general contract including the iron work in question prior to the alleged agreement upon which the suit was brought. Plaintiff\u2019s case did not rest upon his statement alone, but was corroborated. Defendant offered evidence to show that the work and labor were worth much less than the alleged contract price.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-10\" pgmap=\"464\">Caswell &amp; Healy, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-11\" pgmap=\"464\">Wiley &amp; Mack, for defendant in error.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b465-4\" pgmap=\"465\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">1.
