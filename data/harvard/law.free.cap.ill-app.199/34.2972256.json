Landlord and tenant, \u00a7 325<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show superseding of contract by new one not entitling landlord to rent. In an action to recover for breach of a lease of land demised for the production of oil and gas, where it appeared that the lease contained a covenant to pay plaintiffs an agreed rental and to supply them with gas for domestic use without cost, \u201cwhile the product of each well in which gas only is found shall be marketed from said premises;\u201d that the lease was assigned and the assignee drilled a well which produced gas only, which was marketed for general consumption; that the lease was afterwards assigned to defendant; that the flow of gas becoming insufficient to supply plaintiffs if allowed to go into defendant\u2019s commercial line, plaintiffs shut it off from the line, and for some time used the gas without cost; that later an arrangement was made whereby the owner of land on which there were strong gas wells which were owned by defendant secured the right to use gas from plaintiffs\u2019 well without cost for domestic purposes so as to increase the pressure in defendant\u2019s commercial line from the wells on such other person\u2019s land, defendant agreeing not to take up the pipe from the well as intended, which would have prevented plaintiffs from using the gas, but to allow it to remain with the well shut off from defendant\u2019s commercial line; and plaintiffs claimed that the gas used by such other person was \u201cmarketed\u201d within the meaning of the lease, entitling them to rental, held that under the evidence the lease was superseded by the new arrangement, and that plaintiffs could not recover for rental.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\" pgmap=\"56\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Crawford county; the Hon.
