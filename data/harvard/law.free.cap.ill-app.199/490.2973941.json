From a judgment for $9,000 for plaintiff, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-9\" pgmap=\"512(201) 513(135)\">The defendant Railways Company operated a street railway in Madison street. A westbound street car on the north track of the railway stopped to discharge and receive passengers, with the front end of the car at or near the east line of Halsted street. Plaintiff started to cross Madison street from the southeast comer of Halsted and Madison streets, and when she reached the center of the eastbound track saw a westbound car of defendant coming to a stop. After the car had stopped she walked in front of the car and then east alongside of it to about the center of the car; she then saw a team coming towards her, which was then twenty-five or thirty feet east of the rear end of the car. The entrance to the car was at the rear end, and she walked to the rear vestibule and started to get on. She testified that she placed her right foot on the step, took hold of the iron stanchion at the outer end of the rail which divided the rear platform, stepped on the platform with her left foot, when the car started with a jerk and she was thrown backward into the street. Two teams of defendant Hinehliife were going west north of the north rail of the track on which the car ran. The front team was driven by Sibley, who was not called as a witness, and the rear one was driven by Forrest Hinehliife, a brother of defendant Hinehliife. Fie testified that plaintiff was twenty or twenty-five feet in front of the hind wheels of Sibley\u2019s wagon when she fell, and that the wagon could not have run over her leg. Opposed to this testimony is the testimony of Silver and Taylor that they saw the hind wheel of the wagon run over plaintiff\u2019s leg, and the testimony of the surgeon that both bones of the right leg were broken and the left leg injured. One count of the declaration is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\" pgmap=\"513\">\u201cPlaintiff further avers that while standing at said intersection as aforesaid, one of the defendant\u2019s Chicago Railways Company\u2019s cars stopped at said intersection, for the purpose of receiving and discharging passengers, and while so doing, the defendant Chicago Railways Company negligently and carelessly started said car, and the defendant Herbert T. Hinehliife by his servants, then and there in charge of said horses and wagon, negligently and carelessly drove, operated and managed said horses and wagon, so as to cause same to collide with plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\" pgmap=\"513\">\u201cPlaintiff further avers that she was then and thereby severely, dangerously and permanently injured,\u201d etc.1</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\" pgmap=\"513\">As amended the last paragraph commences as fiollows:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-9\" pgmap=\"513\">\u201cPlaintiff further avers that she was then and thereby as a result of the negligence of said defendants and each of them as above alleged, severely, dangerously and permanently injured both internally and exterr nally.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-11\" pgmap=\"513\">Joseph D.
