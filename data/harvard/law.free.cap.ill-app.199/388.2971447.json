Judgment\u2014when evidence sufficient to support verdict on foreign judgment. In an action on a foreign judgment, evidence examined and held to show that the foreign court had jurisdiction of defendant and of the subject-matter of the suit, and that defendant was represented at the trial by counsel having authority from him to appear.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-9\" pgmap=\"411\">2. Judgment, \u00a7 580<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when foreign judgments binding on parties. In an action on a foreign judgment where the evidence shows that the foreign court had jurisdiction of defendant and of the subject-matter of the suit and that defendant was represented by counsel having authority from him to appear, the judgment of the foreign court binds all the parties to it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-10\" pgmap=\"411\">3. Judgment, \u00a7 670*\u2014when jurisdiction of foreign court presumed. In an action on a foreign judgment, the recital in the record of the appearance of defendant by attorney is presumptive evidence that the court had jurisdiction of defendant\u2019s person, the authority of the attorney being presumed.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-4\" pgmap=\"411\">Thornton &amp; Chancellor, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-5\" pgmap=\"411\">M.

Judgment\u2014when evidence sufficient to show jurisdiction of foreign court. In an action on a foreign judgment where the record recites the appearance of defendant by .attorney and there is evidence of one of the attorneys that his firm was employed and that the suit was defended by it, and that the services rendered in such defense were paid for by defendant, all the elements necessary to render the judgment effective are present in the record.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b412-5\" pgmap=\"412\">5.

In an action on a foreign judgment, even though it is error to receive evidence of attorneys for the defendant in the action in the foreign court that they were employed by defendant, that the suit was defended by them and that services rendered were paid for by defendant, such error is harmless where the recital of appearance appears in the record.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b412-6\" pgmap=\"412\">6.
