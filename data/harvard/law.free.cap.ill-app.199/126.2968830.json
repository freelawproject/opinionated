Bourland, plaintiff, against the Louisville &amp; Nashville Bailroad Company, defendant, to recover for damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of slipping on a banana peeling on the third step of one of defendant\u2019s cars as she was attempting to board the train. From a judgment for plaintiff for $1,000, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-9\" pgmap=\"148\">The declaration, which consisted of two counts, alleged that defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to keep its platform and the steps of its coaches clean, and permitted banana peelings, garbage and refuse to accumulate upon its platform and the steps of one of its coaches, and that plaintiff, while attempting to board the train, was thereby caused to slip and fall, sustaining a severe nervous shock, laceration and strain of the muscles and ligaments, and that she was permanently injured.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\" pgmap=\"148(97) 149(16)\">The train which plaintiff attempted to board was an accommodation train consisting of a baggage car, smoker and ladies\u2019 car, starting from St. Louis and reaching Ashley about eight o\u2019clock at night. When plaintiff reached the second or third step of the car she slipped and fell in a heap to the right and somewhat backward, but not off of the steps of the car. The station at Ashley was on the north side of defendant\u2019s railroad track, and the next five stations west of Ashley were on the south side of defendant\u2019s track, and the last station on the north side of defendant\u2019s track before arriving at Ashley was Mascontah.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\" pgmap=\"149\">The evidence tended to show that plaintiff was more or less of a nervous temperament, and that up to some two years prior to this accident she had been in ill health, but that for two years preceding the accident her health had been good and that she had done the housework without assistance for a family of four; that subsequent to the accident she had been unable for six weeks to leave her bed and that she had not been able, up to the time of the trial, some four or six months after the accident, to walk without assistance.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\" pgmap=\"149\">The only evidence to dispute plaintiff in this regard were two witnesses, neighbors of plaintiff, who testified that they had observed her doing her house work, and one of them testified that they saw her get into a buggy unassisted and had seen her sweep the walks in front of her house. Two physicians examined plaintiff at the time of the injury, one called at the instance of plaintiff and the other being the physician of defendant\u2019s railroad, both of whom found an injury on plaintiff\u2019s hip, and it was thought by them when the injury first occurred that one of the lower limbs of plaintiff was some two inches shorter than the other, but the railroad physician afterwards became of the opinion on measurement that this was not true. Plaintiff\u2019s physician who had charge of her after the first examination testified that following the injury at Ashley, plaintiff suffered disorders of the pelvic organs and the womb, that one of the fingers of plaintiff was injured at the time of the accident, that it festered and a part of the bone thereafter became detached' and sloughed off.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-7\" pgmap=\"149\">James M.
