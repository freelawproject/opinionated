Tbial, \u00a7 199<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when verdict improperly directed. In an action to recover for personal injuries, where the evidence is conflicting and where plaintiff\u2019s evidence, if true, is sufficient to sustain a verdict, it is the province of the jury, under proper instructions, to determine whether such evidence is disproved by defendant\u2019s evidence, and it is error to direct a verdict in such case.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\" pgmap=\"24\">The evidence for plaintiff showed that on March 28, 1915, plaintiff and four acquaintances boarded a car of defendant about twenty minutes before midnight at Allens Park, near East St. Louis, on the way to St. Louis, Missouri. The car was crowded and plaintiff stood in the aisle near the back end. As the car reached the corner of Thirteenth street and Nectar avenue, which appeared to have been somewhere near Thirteenth street and St. Clair avenue, it was running so fast that when it struck the curve the trolley was thrown off, the windows broken, several persons thrown from their seats, plaintiff thrown on the floor towards or upon the platform, and others thrown against or upon her. Plaintiff testified that by reason of her injuries she had lost her health and become permanently injured. In regard to her injuries and their seriousness, she was corroborated by her physician in St. Louis.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\" pgmap=\"24\">At the close of all the evidence the court, on motion of defendant, directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.

Constitutional law, \u00a7 176<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when direction of verdict deprived of right to trial by jury. To direct a verdict, where the evidence is conflicting and where plaintiff\u2019s evidence, if true, is sufficient to sustain a verdict, involves a determination by the court of the question of the preponderance of the evidence, and is a violation of plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right of trial hy jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b25-6\" pgmap=\"25\">3. Carriers, \u00a7 456*\u2014when variance between declaration and proof immaterial. A variance between a declaration in an action by a passenger against a street railroad for damages for personal injuries alleging that an accident occurred at a named street and avenue and proof that it occurred \u201csomewhere around\u201d such street and avenue is merely technical and is not of such importance as to defeat a recovery.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b25-7\" pgmap=\"25\">4.

The question of variance cannot be raised for the first time in the Appellate Court.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b25-8\" pgmap=\"25\">5. Carriers, \u00a7 456*\u2014when averment of injury divisible. In an action to recover for personal injuries to a passenger, where plaintiff alleged that by reason of the excessive speed of a car while rounding a curve she was thrown against the side of the car and trampled on, it is not necessary, to entitle plaintiff to recover, that she prove that she was trampled on, the injury alleged being divisible.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b25-9\" pgmap=\"25\">6. Torts, \u00a7 29*\u2014when plaintiff need only prove part of charge.
