Stein, administrator of the estate of Elizabeth Stein, deceased, plaintiff, against the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad Company and William J. Jackson and Edwin W. Winter, receivers, defendants, in the Circuit Court of Franklin county, to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate as a result of the alleged negligence of defendants \u2019 servants in operating one of its passenger trains in Benton, Illinois. From a judgment for plaintiff for $2,500, defendant railroad company appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\" pgmap=\"70(50) 71(123)\">The action was brought by plaintiff under the statute to recover damages to the next of kin on account of the death of Elizabeth Stein. It appeared from the evidence that on Decoration Day, May 30, 1914, at a little after eight o\u2019clock in the morning, when the air was quiet and there were no noises, plaintiff with his wife, Elizabeth Stein, were going south on South Main street and had reached the north side of the railroad crossing. She was a woman sixty-seven years of age, weighing 190 to 195 pounds, with no unusual infirmities. She was walking four or five feet in the lead of her husband, carrying a basket of flowers while he followed with a bucket of water. She started to cross the track and while about to step from the south side was struck by an engine attached to one of defendant\u2019s passenger trains going southwest. She was thrown from 75 to 100 feet by the impact and received injuries which caused her immediate death.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\" pgmap=\"71\">Emory Lig\u00f3n testified: \u201cI think that at the crossing you could see a train approaching as the cut is not very deep. * * * I know there is a cut there because you have to go down a slant to cross the railroad. From that point south to the east on the railroad crossing I do not think there is anything to hinder a person from seeing an approaching train if he looks.\u201d Philip Schrade testified: \u201cA person walking along South Main street just north of the C. &amp; E. I. crossing could see an approaching train; at times you could see it 200 or 300 yards.\u201d These witnesses were-all called on behalf of- plaintiff, who himself testified: \u201cWhen we first observed the train, Mrs. Stein was just a few feet from the right-hand rail of the C. &amp; E. I. Bail-road, three or four or five feet, something like that. When I first saw the train I hollered to her not to try to cross. * * * I saw the train coming. I suppose at that time she could have seen the train if she had looked, but guess she thought she could get across.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\" pgmap=\"71\">On the part of defendant two witnesses, Jacob and Anna Horine, who were up the street behind Mrs. Stein and' are in no ways interested in the event of the suit, swore she stopped and looked at the train and then started to run across the track and beat the train.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-8\" pgmap=\"71\">Holmes &amp; Dillon, for appellants.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b72-5\" pgmap=\"72\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Asc\" pgmap=\"72\">1. Negligence, \u00a7 157<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what plaintiff must prove in action for negligent death of intestate. In an action to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate as the result of the alleged negligence of defendant, it is necessary, in order to warrant a verdict of guilty that plaintiff prove not only that defendant was negligent, but also that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was in the exercise of due care.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-8\" pgmap=\"72\">2.

One who approaches a railroad crossing without seeing an approaching train when the surroundings are such that she would have seen it had she looked, or who seeing the train attempts to cross in front of it, in either event fails to exercise reasonable care in approaching and going on the crossing.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-3\" pgmap=\"72\">W.
