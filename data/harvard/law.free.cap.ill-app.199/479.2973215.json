There it was received by the Ann Arbor railroad, which issued its through bill of lading to destination. The Ann Arbor railroad hauled it to Imlay City7, Michigan, there connecting with defendant\u2019s road, which hauled it to Black Rock, New York, and there turned it over to the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railway', which transported it to destination, New York City. Plaintiff says that defendant, through its agent at Imlay City, orally agreed to haul the car from that point on a certain train, No. 90, leaving early in the morning, but it failed to do so and hauled it on a later train, thus causing it to arrive at destination too late for a market, with ensuing loss.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b502-10\" pgmap=\"502\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b502-11\" pgmap=\"502\">1.
