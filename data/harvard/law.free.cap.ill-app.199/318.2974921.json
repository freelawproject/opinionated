Frank, defendant, on two written instruments signed by him, one an application to plaintiff to become surety on a stay bond for a corporation, of which defendant\u2019s brother was secretary, containing an agreement of indemnity to the company, and the other a general bond of indemnity to plaintiff against the same contingencies. At the close of the evidence the court directed a verdict for plaintiff for $2,561.81.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-10\" pgmap=\"340(55) 341(27)\">The defenses pleaded and attempted to be made were that the instruments were signed by defendant in blank and delivered so signed upon conditions not complied with of which plaintiff had notice before delivery. The conditions claimed were that defendant was not to be liable in excess of $40 (the amount of the premium to be paid by the principal to the stay bond for the surety-ship of plaintiff), and that said principal should deposit certain cash to indemnify plaintiff.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b341-8\" pgmap=\"341\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b341-9\" pgmap=\"341\">1.
