Trial, \u00a7 153<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when weight of evidence for jury. It is the province of the jury, who see the witnesses and hear them testify, to weigh the evidence of the respective parties when the evidence is conflicting.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-9\" pgmap=\"58\">2. Sales, \u00a7 329*\u2014when evidence sufficient to sustain finding that contract was substantially complied with. In an action to recover the contract price of ironing boards manufactured by plaintiff at defendant\u2019s request, where the defense was that the contract was not substantially complied with, and where the evidence was conflicting, evidence examined and held to warrant the jury in finding a verdict for plaintiff.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-10\" pgmap=\"58\">3. Sales, \u00a7 330*\u2014when instruction as to presumption of acceptance of goods correct. In an action to recover the contract price of ironing boards manufactured by plaintiff at defendant\u2019s request, an instruction that if after the completion of the work defendant called and inspected it and accepted part of the goods and agreed to pay for all of it, he is presumed to have accepted all of the work, held correct.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-11\" pgmap=\"58\">4. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1523*\u2014when error in one of series of instructions harmless. The fact that in one of a series of instructions there exists a slight ambiguity is not ground of reversal where appellant\u2019s rights were so fully covered by other instructions that the jury could not have been misled.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b58-12\" pgmap=\"58(55) 59(17)\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1474*\u2014when stating of conclusion by witness harmless error. It is not reversible, error to permit a plaintiff to state his conclusion as to whether defendant had made an objection as to the character of goods deliver\u00e9d in performance of the contract sued on where such witness also testifies to all the conversation which took place at the time when the objection was alleged to have been made.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-4\" pgmap=\"58\">Charles H.
