The defendant and his wife both testified in his behalf, and during their examination the court refused to allow them to testify as to what was said and done by them directly with the purchaser of the property. The objection was that as the conversations took place out of the presence of the plaintiffs, they were not admissible. The plaintiffs sought to prove that they had procured the purchaser for the property, while the defendant sought to prove that he had obtained the purchaser himself.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-10\" pgmap=\"484\">Harry G.
