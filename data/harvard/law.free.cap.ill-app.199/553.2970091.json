Grimm, executor of the estate of Henry E. Grimm, deceased, plaintiff, against the Clark Delivery Car Company, defendant, to recover damages for the death of his testator. To reverse a judgment for .plaintiff, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-12\" pgmap=\"575\">Henry E. Grimm while crossing Clark street at its intersection with Adams street in Chicago was struck by an automobile truck and received injuries resulting in his death. His executor brought suit against the defendant Clark Delivery Car Company, which owned the truck. Deceased was thirty-five years of age, physically active, with good eyesight and hearing.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH2-\" pgmap=\"576\">Of the five eyewitnesses testifying, four testified substantially that the accident happened in this way: Under the downtown traffic regulations in Chicago the police officer directing the movement of traffic at street intersections blows one whistle as a signal' for the traffic to move from north to south and vice versa. At this time the east and west traffic stands until the officer gives two whistles, when it moves, while the north and south traffic in turn stands still. Clark street runs north and south, Adams east and west. Deceased was at the southwest corner of the two streets, starting to go east across Clark on a line about four feet north of the south crosswalk across Clark. As deceased started easterly to cross Clark, the traffic, pursuant to the officer\u2019s single whistle, was going north and south, that is, deceased was going against the course of the traffic. The last vehicle'in the procession going- south, running about equidistant between the westerly street car track on Clark and the west curb, was the auto truck of the defendant. It was going about three to five miles an hour, no faster than vehicles ahead of it. There was some little space between it and the traffic ahead. As one of the witnesses testified, deceased seemed to walk right into the truck He was struck by its righthand front corner and knocked down, falling under the wheels. This version of the accident was supported not only by the occurrence witness produced by the defendant, but also by three of the four occurrence witnesses testifying on behalf of the plaintiff. According to the single witness who was in disagreement with the others, when deceased started to cross the street the two whistle signal for the east and west traffic to move had been given; but in this he is contradicted by the police officer, the driver of the truck, and the pedestrians who saw the accident while they were waiting at the street corner for the two whistle signal which would clear th,e way for them to cross Clark street.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-7\" pgmap=\"577\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-8\" pgmap=\"577\">1.
