The parties agreed that a check for this amount should be placed in the hands of one John H. Kingsbury until December 21, 1911, by which time if it was ascertained that plaintiff had paid over all moneys collected by him from January 1, 1910, to October 21, 1911, then the amount of this check should be paid to him. The jury found that plaintiff had turned over to defendant all his collections except $39. Defendant wrote a letter to plaintiff under date of December 8, 1911, in which he requested that plaintiff permit defendant to retain the money represented by the check held by Mr. Kingsbury for the reason \u201cthat we are very short of money at the present time, but would be able to give it to you at the time specified. Hoping you will not be inconvenienced by not having the money, we beg to remain,\u201d etc.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b598-7\" pgmap=\"598\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b598-8\" pgmap=\"598\">Master and servant, \u00a7 84<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show that salesman had accounted for part of collections.
