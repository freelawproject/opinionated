He was asked as to other alleg\u2019ed acts of intercourse with said witness, to which questions objections were made by plaintiff and were sustained by the court. The record shows that the objection to these questions was sustained for the reason that the questions did not limit the time to the period of gestation. Later in the trial the court permitted a full examination of this witness as to other acts of intercourse with plaintiff had at any time during the months of May and June. The child was born on the 29th day of January, 1915. The 29th of June, 1914, would be just seven months preceding the birth of the child.
