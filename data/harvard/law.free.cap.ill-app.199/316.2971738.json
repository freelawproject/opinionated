An eastbound car was also approaching said avenue at the same time at which he appeared to be looking. The westbound car slackened its speed at the crossing and sounded its gong. As it slowed down the assured either hesitated or stopped for a moment and immediately afterward resumed his way across the tracks still watching the eastbound car. As soon as the motorman of the westbound car observed his hesitation or stop, he released the brakes, turned on the power and went ahead to an almost instantaneous collision.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-6\" pgmap=\"339\">L.
