Michael Tauber and Michael Levy, trading as Michael Tauber &amp; Company, conducted said auction sale, were summoned as garnishees and filed their answer to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories, admitting an existing indebtedness to defendant in excess of $1,218.84 at the time of service of said writ. Defendant filed an affidavit of merits denying that plaintiff at any time sold and delivered to defendant the merchandise set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim and traversed plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of atttachment, which affidavit alleged that defendant, within two years last past, fraudulently (a) conveyed or assigned its effect; (b) concealed or disposed of its property; (c) that it was about to fraudulently conceal or dispose of its property, so as to hinder and delay its creditors.
