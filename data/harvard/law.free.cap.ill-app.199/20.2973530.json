Lindsey, defendants, and the second by Ruth Mclntire et al., plaintiffs, against the same defendants, in the Circuit Court of Franklin county, to recover for injury to their means of support as the result of the death of J. E. Mclntire, the husband of the first plaintiff and the father of the others, who were minors, such death being alleged to be the result of decedent becoming intoxicated by drinking liquor sold to him by defendants. From a judgment for the first plaintiff for. $1,000 and from a similar judgment for the other plaintiffs, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-11\" pgmap=\"42(113) 43(393) 44(167)\">The evidence in the case was not contradictory in character, and showed the following to have been the facts: J. E. Mclntire, the deceased, had been married eleven years and his family consisted of his wife, Bertha Mclntire and two small children, Ruth and Dean Mclntire. He was a miner, owned a home worth $1,000 subject to a $300 mortgage, and was making $4 a day when he worked. He and his family were dependent on his wages for support. About three weeks before his death he was hurt in the mine and was laid\" off from work. He was a candidate for check-weigh-man and was electioneering for the position. About a week after he was injured he began to drink very heavily and slept and ate but little. He took large quantities of liquor home with him which he consumed during the night. He took his gun to bed with him and threatened to shoot his wife or to shoot through the floor at her feet, and acted in an irrational and dangerous manner. During this time he bought and drank liquor in the different saloons in Buckner, among others those of defendants. On Saturday previous to his death, which occurred the following Monday, he was arrested for disorderly conduct and locked up by the city marshal, Collins. Later in the day his wife came for him and took him home, his trial being set for Monday. He did not drink on Sunday, and on that day called on a neighbor, taking his gun with him and leaving it in the hall. He stated he was going to Benton to consult some attorney and see if he could not get satisfaction for his arrest and, if not, that he was going to shoot the \u201cson of a gun\u201d; that he had had trouble with Collins and made him \u201cback down.\u201d On the following Monday morning at about eight o\u2019clock he went to the saloon of defendant Morris, where he bought two drinks of whisky, and also a half pint bottle of liquor which he put in his pocket. At about 8:30 a. m. he went to the saloon of defendant Lindsey, and drank three or four drinks of whisky and some beer. A little later he returned and got another drink of whisky and then started to take a train to Benton. Before leaving Buckner he called a man by the name of Bowman out of another saloon and asked him to go to his, Mclntire\u2019s, house and get his revolver, and said he would get Collins or Collins would get him. He then went to Benton on the train that left at, 11:30 a. m. and returned on the 3:30 p. m. train. It was shown by the proofs that he was drinking in Benton and also on his return. About five o\u2019clock he went to the city hall where his trial was to have been had, and after waiting twenty to twenty-five minutes, left there. A little later Ms wife found Mm in defendant Morris\u2019 saloon. He had a glass of whisky in his hand, and his revolver was lying on the counter. He had taken about half of the whisky and after her arrival he drank the balance of the glass. Before leaving the saloon he drank still another glass and then he and his wife started down the street towards the city hall, where a horse and buggy was standing. His wife got into the buggy and while she was telling Mclntire to get in, Collins opened a door near by. Mclntire, who had been carrying his revolver in his hand, saw Collins and commenced shooting. He fired six shots, none of which took effect, but Collins fired at him in return and killed him. After Mclntire\u2019s death a bottle was found in his pocket which appeared to contain whisky. No provocation was shown whatever for the attack and the coroner\u2019s jury found that the marshal killed Mclntire in self-defense.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-7\" pgmap=\"44\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-8\" pgmap=\"44\">1.
