Skahen, trading as Thomas E. Skahen &amp; Company, plaintiff, against Jacob Strauss and Bertha Strauss, defendants, to recover a commission of two and one-half per cent, on $13,000, for obtaining a purchaser for the premises owned by the defendants. By this writ of error it is sought to reverse a judgment for $325 in favor of plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425\">Plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim charged that both defendants had requested plaintiff to secure a purchaser for the property in question; and testimony in support of that allegation was introduced. Defendants, in their affidavits of merits, denied that they had either jointly or severally requested plaintiff to secure a purchaser for the premises, and endeavored to introduce testimony to substantiate this contention.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\" pgmap=\"425(93) 426(83)\">On behalf of the plaintiff, two witnesses\u2014the plaintiff himself, and one George Lynn\u2014testified that Mr. Strauss, as well as Mrs. Strauss, had requested plaintiff to secure a purchaser. On behalf of the defendants, Jacob Strauss denied that he had ever had any conversation with plaintiff or any one from his office with reference to the sale of the property involved in this controversy, and that he had ever requested plaintiff to secure a purchaser for the property. There was also offered the testimony of Mrs. Strauss for the purpose of denying alleged conversations with Lynn and with the plaintiff, wherein she requested plaintiff to secure a purchaser. Objection was made to her testimony for the reason that she was the wife of Jacob Strauss, hence not a competent witness. The objection thereto, which was based upon section 5 of the Evidence Act, ch. 51, Rev. St. (J. &amp; A. jf 5522), was sustained, and the exclusion of this offered testimony is urged by defendants as cause for reversal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b426-7\" pgmap=\"426\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b426-8\" pgmap=\"426\">1.
