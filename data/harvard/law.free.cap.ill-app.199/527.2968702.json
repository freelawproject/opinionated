From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-13\" pgmap=\"549\">In this case judgment was entered by default for plaintiff after the court had stricken defendant\u2019s affidavit of merits from the files and he had failed to file another within the time allowed.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\" pgmap=\"550\">The only question argued and presented was whether such affidavit showed a legal defense.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\" pgmap=\"550\">Plaintiff\u2019s original statement of claim rested on a promissory note dated August 28, 1913, and an account. Defendant\u2019s original affidavit of merits set up a defense to part of the account, and admitted execution and delivery of the note, but claimed it was given pursuant to the terms of certain agreements entered into between the parties hereto in 1909 and 1911 respectively, which provided that the title to certain personal property should remain in defendant. It further alleged that plaintiff had failed to deliver said property to defendant, and that therefore the consideration for the notes had partly failed, and would fail entirely unless plaintiff delivered such property to defendant.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\" pgmap=\"550\">Thereupon plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim which in effect stated a cause of action on the note alone. But it unnecessarily set forth the consideration of the note. To that end it alleged that the parties had entered into two settlement\" agreements whereby they had adjusted disputes that had arisen between theih over the agreements of 1909 and 1911, alluded to in defendant\u2019s affidavit of merits, and that said note was one of several executed and delivered pursuant to the settlement agreements.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\" pgmap=\"550(110) 551(36)\">To the amended claim defendant filed another affidavit of merits, setting up, in substance, the same defense as in the original affidavit of merits, and stating that said settlement agreements adjusted only such matters as were then in dispute and that no dispute had then arisen as to the title to said personal property, and that \u201cit.was understood\u201d that defendant\u2019s said property would be returned to him, and that defendant did not discover that such property had not been returned to him until after the execution of the \u2022 settlement agreements, believing however that it had been. The affidavit then set up grounds by way of excuse for his failure to make such discovery, and claimed a total failure of consideration for the notes, but offered to pay the balance due on said note upon the return of said property to him.</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b551-8\" pgmap=\"551\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b551-9\" pgmap=\"551\">1.
