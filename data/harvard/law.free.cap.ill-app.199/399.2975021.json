Appeal and error, \u00a7 1512*\u2014when remarks of court not ground for reversal. In an action against a carrier for injuries to a passenger, remarks of court held not so prejudicial to defendant as to afford grounds for reversal, where the amount of the verdict is not such as to justify any inference of prejudice or passion on the part of the jury.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b422-7\" pgmap=\"422\">3. Carriers, \u00a7 482*\u2014when instructions sufficient in action for injury to passenger.
