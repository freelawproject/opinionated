Cermak, bailiff of the Municipal Court of Chicago for use of City Hall Square Company, plaintiff, against Boyal Furniture Company, a corporation, and Chicago Bonding &amp; Surety Company, a corporation, defendants, wherein plaintiff recovered a; judgment for $881.40 and costs against defendants on a replevin bond. To reverse this judgment defendants prosecute this writ of error. The proceeding grew out of a replevin suit brought in the Municipal Court of Chicago -by the Boyal Furniture Company against the City Hall Square Company, for the possession of certain furniture, to which the Boyal Furniture Company claimed title by virtue of two chattel mortgages executed on July 10th and August 10,1913, respectively, by I. C. Newman &amp; Company, a corporation, in favor of the said Boyal Furniture Company. The chattel mortgages under which the Boyal Furniture Company claimed title were executed by the said I. C. Newman &amp; Company, acting through its treasurer, and were acknowledged on the aforesaid dates by one Carl W. Nelson as attorney in fact, who derived his authority under a power of attorney attached to each of these documents. The validity of these two chattel mortgages as against third persons was, under a stipulation between the parties, the sole question to be determined.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b436-8\" pgmap=\"436\">Chattel mobtgages, \u00a7 55<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when acknowledgment l&gt;y attorney in fact insufficient.
