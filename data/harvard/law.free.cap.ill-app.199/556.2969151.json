By its terms it was provided that an abstract or a guaranty policy should be furnished to the defendant \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d also that a loan of $1,000 drawing interest at six per cent, should be furnished to defendant within sixty days from date of the contract, and if the loan was not furnished the contract was to be null and void and the earnest money returned to defendant. The evidence showed that although defendant made repeated efforts to obtain an abstract or guaranty policy, and was given many promises that it would be delivered to him, none was furnished; that when sixty days after the date of the contract had expired,' and several days thereafter,' and neither an abstract, guaranty policy nor the loan contemplated by the contract had been furnished, defendant served notice upon Catherine Joyce and the plaintiff of his election to terminate the contract. The evidence also shows that no guaranty policy was ordered until about ninety days after the signing of the contract.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-7\" pgmap=\"579\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-8\" pgmap=\"579\">Vendor and purchaser, \u00a7 327<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when purchaser entitled to return of earnest money upon failure of vendor to fulfil condition.
