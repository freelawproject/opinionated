Earthen, defendant, to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract for the purchase of goods. From a judgment for plaintiff for $483, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-9\" pgmap=\"617\">A contract was entered into between the parties on January 6, 1910, whereby the defendant agreed to purchase dress patterns, fashion books and fashion guides from plaintiff for a period of three years from date of first shipment to defendant. At the time this contract was entered into, plaintiff delivered to defendant $255 worth of goods. A credit of $55, which had been previously agreed upon between the parties, was allowed on this $255, leaving a balance of $200 which, under the contract, was to be considered as a \u201cstanding debit, \u2019 \u2019 and was to draw interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum throughout the term of the contract, after the expiration of which, all conditions having been fulfilled, defendant could, under section 8 of the agreement, return all \u201clive patterns in good sale-able condition,\u201d at the original purchase price, in payment of the foregoing standing debit.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-10\" pgmap=\"617(34) 618(49)\">On June 18, 1910 (about four and one-half months after entering into the aforesaid contract), defendant notified plaintiff of his intention to discontinue handling its line of patterns, and returned his entire stock to the plaintiff (including the four-section pattern case furnished by the plaintiff to him), in payment of the standing debit of $200. The property was received by plaintiff and credit given defendant for $208.80 on \u201cdiscard account,\u201d as indicated by a statement of September 1, 1910, rendered defendant.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\" pgmap=\"618\">Plaintiff\u2019s action was for the standing debit of $200, with interest thereon at four per cent, per annum, and for minimum damages sustained by reason of plaintiff\u2019s alleged breach of the contract.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\" pgmap=\"618\">It was urged that plaintiff\u2019s claim of minimum damages, which was allowed by the jury and upheld by the court, was based upon a palpable misconstruction of section 2 of the contract, wherein plaintiff was authorized to ship defendant1 \u2018 an assortment of new Peerless Patterns as issued at 5 cents each, not to exceed an average of $10.00 a month, one each size of every neiv pattern issued except 32 bust.\u201d (The portion in italics was written in pen and ink, and the remainder was printed.) Plaintiff contended that, under the section just quoted, defendant was bound to purchase at least $10 worth of patterns each month in any event.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\" pgmap=\"618(143) 619(41)\">Defendant further contended that the court in its instructions to the jury erroneously permitted a recovery for the $200 representing the standing debit provided for in the contract. Under the provisions of the contract, defendant was to have on hand at all times a full assortment of patterns, and at the conclusion of the contract, the terms having been complied with, defendant had the right to return all live patterns and receive full allowance therefor. This provision was not peculiar to the defendant but was general and applied to all with whom the plaintiff dealt. Within four and one-half months defendant returned all patterns and also the cases in which they were contained, and wrote a letter indicating that the defendant did not intend to continue with the contract, and that it would be useless for plaintiff to send the patterns back or endeavor to send any new patterns. Plaintiff, on September 1st, and again during October, sent a statement to the defendant wherein defendant was given credit for $208.80, representing the amount of the patterns returned, on the discard account.</p><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-10\" pgmap=\"619\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b619-11\" pgmap=\"619\">I.

In an action for alleged breach of a contract to purchase patterns and fashion guides for a definite period, under which goods of a certain value were to be considered as a standing debit and to draw interest throughout the term of the contract, after the expiration of which, all conditions having been fulfilled, the defendant could return all \u201clive patterns in good sale-able condition\u201d at the original purchase price, in payment of the standing debit, where defendant rescinded the contract and returned the patterns on hand shortly after the beginning of the term of the contract with the intention that credit be given him on the standing debit, held that plaintiff was entitled to recover the interest on the standing debit only during the period that the goods were retained and also, as minimum damages, its loss of profits sustained as a result of the failure of the defendant to purchase new patterns and as a result of the failure to order fashion guides in such numbers as were provided for in the contract.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
