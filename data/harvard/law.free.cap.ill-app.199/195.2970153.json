P. Crossley, plaintiff, against St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railway Company, defendant, for damages for negligence in shipping and handling of stock, including delay in shipment to destination. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-12\" pgmap=\"217(25) 218(377) 219(154)\">Plaintiff, being desirous of shipping some cattle, forty-one head, from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to East St. Louis, Illinois, made application to the agent of defendant at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, for a car, and was advised that the cattle would be shipped at about noon of September 11th. The cattle were loaded but not shipped out until 6:20 in the evening, at which time they were shipped to Little Bock, Arkansas, and there the car was transferred and put on the rear of another train of about eighty cars and arrived at Hoxie at 3:40 of the next morning of the 12th, where the cattle were unloaded for rest. Plaintiff was advised by the yardmaster that his cattle would be taken out of there about eight o\u2019clock in the morning. Instead of unloading them immediately they were placed upon a side track and allowed to remain in the car until about eight or nine o\u2019clock, when they were then unloaded into the stock pens. The stock pens were muddy and in bad condition and the cattle were kept there for twenty-nine hours. During that day several trains, as claimed by plaintiff, passed going to St. Louis, but plaintiff claimed that he was not able to get his cattle attached to any one of those trains because of the fact that the yardmaster who they claimed had to arrange to conduct them with other trains was out of town, but later on they were shipped out from Hoxie to East St. Louis and arrived at the stock yards about nine o\u2019clock on the morning of the 14th of September, and it was claimed they were on the road for about sixty-six hours. There was evidence tending to show that during a portion of this time the cattle were roughly handled; that in shipping, the car was placed in a position at the rear of the train so that in starting and stopping the cattle were thrown from their feet and many of them bruised and injured, and that they were not well cared for while in the stock yards at Hoxie, and on arriving at East St. Louis were in very gaunt condition and badly bruised, and that the shrinkage was far in excess of that usually sustained by stock, in the making of that shipment. Some of the witnesses placed the shrinkage at one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five pounds, while they should not have shrunk more than from twenty-five to fifty pounds, if properly cared for in the making of the shipment. It appeared from the evidence that the usual time for the making of a shipment from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to East St. Louis, Illinois, allowing rest at Hoxie, as provided by statute, would be about thirty-six to thirty-eight hours. The evidence of defendant tended to show that the trains that the plaintiff claims passed through Hoxie going to St. Louis were not St. Louis trains and that the car of cattle was taken up by the first train that passed going to St. Louis. The evidence of plaintiff also tended to show that the delay at Pine Bluff caused them to miss connection with the train that should have taken the cattle out from Hoxie on the morning of the 12th, and that such delay was unexplained.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\" pgmap=\"219\">The defendant complained of the following instructions for plaintiff:\u2014\u2018 \u2018 The court instructs the jury that when a railroad company receives live stock for shipment it is the duty of such company to use reasonable diligence to carry and deliver said stock to said destination within a reasonable time. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Azt\" pgmap=\"219\">\u201cThe court further instructs the jury that if you find from the evidence that the defendant company sent the cattle in question forward from Hoxie, Arkansas, on the first stock train leaving there after the expiration of the time required by the Federal law for feed and rest, then the defendant would not be liable for any damage to said cattle if not caused by such delay at Hoxie, Arkansas.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-7\" pgmap=\"219\">L.
