Conviction of offense of being a vagabond, sustained though information in charging that defendant was known to be a thief, burglar or pickpocket, did not state whether such knowledge came \u201cby his own confession or otherwise,-\u201d according to the wording of the statute, as the means by which the fact is known is a mere matter of evidence and not a substantial part of the crime.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b468-10\" pgmap=\"468\">\u20222.

Vagrancy\u2014when information not vague or defective. A charge in an information, charging the defendant with being a vagabond, that he was known to be a \u201cthief, burglar or pickpocket,\u201d is not vague or uncertain, as the word \u201cthief\u201d includes burglars, pickpockets, or any one guilty of the crime of stealing, nor does the use of the redundant expression of the statute render the charge defective.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\" pgmap=\"468\">Eebstein &amp; Macaulay, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468\">Maclay Hoyne, for defendant in error; Edward E.

Vagrancy\u2014when information contains all essential elements of offense. An information charging the defendant with the offense of being a vagabond and that he was \u201chabitually found prowling around steamboat landings, railroad depots, banking institutions, places of amusement,\u201d etc., is not defective in substance as every element necessary to constitute the offense is charged.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b469-6\" pgmap=\"469\">6. Criminal law, \u00a7 502<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when sufficiency of information presumed because of failure to call for bill of particulars. Where one charged in an information with the offense of being a vagabond, and with being found habitually prowling around places designated in the statute, considers that the language used does not sufficiently apprise him of the places in which he was found prowling around, he has a right to ask for a bill of particulars, and on his failure to do so, the information must be presumed on error to have been sufficiently definite to enable him to present his defense.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b469-7\" pgmap=\"469\">7. Indictment and information\u2014when defects in information waived. Failure of an information, charging the defendant with the offense of being a vagabond, to definitely charge the particular places he was charged with having been habitually found prowling around does not go to the merits of the case on the question of guilt or innocence and is waived by failure to move to quash the information.</headnotes> <footnote label=\"*\" orphan=\"true\"> <p id=\"b468-14\" pgmap=\"468\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
