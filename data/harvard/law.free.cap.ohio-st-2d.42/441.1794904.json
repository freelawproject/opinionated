C. 11.911<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a means of appealing the adoption of regulations by the Ohio Liquor Control Commission to the Court of Common Pleas; that is, the right to judicial review by that court of quasi-legislative proceedings. In finding that no such right existed under the above statute, this court relied upon the language in Section 4(B) of Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u201cThe Courts of Common Pleas and divisions thereof shall have * * # such powers of review of proceedings of administrative officers and agencies as may be provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In a prior case involving an appeal to the Supreme Court, in which practically identical constitutional language was concerned, the word \u201cproceedings\u201d was interpreted to contemplate only quasi-judicial proceedings <em>(Zangerle </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>[1942], 139 Ohio St. 563, 41 N. E. 2d 369). In light of that conclusion, the employment of the term \u201cproceedings\u201d in a subsequent constitutional amendment prescribing the jurisdiction of Courts of Common Pleas convinced this court that the framers of the amendment intended to maintain and extend the impact of the <em>Zangerle </em>decision. Hence, in <em>Fortner, </em>it was concluded that R. C. 119.11 could not provide appeals to the Court of Common Pleas from quasi-legislative proceedings of administrative officers and agencies. See, also, <em>M. J. Kelley Co. </em>v. <em>Cleve</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>land </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 150, 290 N. E. 2d 562; <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Board of Edn. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 62, 303 N. E. 2d 890; <em>Rankin-Thoman </em>v. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>fn. 1. Cf. <em>Burger Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 93, 296 N. E. 2d 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In the case at bar, appellant seeks an appeal from a decision of the Environmental Board of Review to the Court of Appeals pursuant to R. C. 3745.06.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 3(B)(2) of Article TV of the Constitution of Ohio states:</p>\n<p id=\"Aap\">\u201cCourts of Appeals shall have * * * such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse final orders and actions of administrative officers or agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Up\u00a9n comparison of the above section with Section 4(B) of Article IV, construed in Fortner, and Section 2 of Article IV, interpreted in Zangerle, it is evident that the language in Section 3(B) (2) of Article IV reads far differently in relation to judicial review of administrative matters. Thus, the first paragraphs of the syllabi in <em>Fortner </em>and <em>Zangerle </em>have no application to the instant case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the third paragraph of the <em>Fortner </em>syllabus<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has been rendered academic by <em>Rankin-Thoman (supra, </em>fn. 1). Therefore, only the second paragraph of the syllabus in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Fortner </em>could logically be considered as a basis for the jurisdictional conclusion reached by the court below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The second paragraph of the <em>Fortner </em>syllabus sets forth a general statement of familiar judicial doctrine. It should not be taken as a sweeping eradication of the protection against significant bureaucratic abuse which is derived from judicial scrutiny of the activities of regulatory agencies. For example, see the syllabus in <em>Burger Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Comm., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In the instant case, pregnant statutory language found in E. C. Chapter 3745 remains to be interpreted (at a time when it is properly before us), and the effect of Section 3(B) (2) of Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio upon the new statutes must be determined (which was not done below by virtue of the dismissal). We cannot properly settle these issues upon the record herein, except to announce our conclusion, necessary to a resolution of this appeal, that nothing in the decisions thus far announced by this court mandates the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Appellant contends that it had a right to a <em>ele novo </em>hearing before the Environmental Board of Eeview pursuant to E. C. 3745.05. That section, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u201cTn hearing the appeal, if an adjudication hearing was conducted by the Director of Environmental Protection in accordance with Sections 119.09 and 119.10 of the Eevised Code, the board is confined to the record as certified to it by the director. * * * If no adjudication hearing was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ducted in accordance with Sections 119.09 and 119.10 of the Revised Code, the board shall conduct a hearing <em>de novo </em>on the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On its face, R. C. 3745.05 requires the Environmental Board of Revew to conduct a hearing <em>de novo </em>in an appeal from an order of the Director of Environmental Protection, except where such order results from an adjudication hearing conducted by the director in accordance with R. C. 119.09 and 119.10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We note appellee\u2019s argument that the denial of the hearing <em>de novo </em>was not an appealable order, but that contention was not reached by the court below. Therefore, for the determination of that question, and the resolution of other issues consistent with this decision, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
