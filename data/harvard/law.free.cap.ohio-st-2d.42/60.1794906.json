She maintains, first, that the Common Pleas Court lacked jurisdiction to commit her to Lima State Hospital before her indictment by a grand jury. In <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Reshetylo </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 35, a case in which there was no information or indictment against petitioner, either before or after his commitment to Lima State Hospital, petitioner attacked his pre-indictment commitment. This court held that \u2018 \u2018 a Court of Common Pleas has jurisdiction over an accused pursuant to R. C. 2945.37 and 2945.-38 when a magistrate\u2019s transcript has been filed against the accused.\u201d In the case now before this court, the Common Pleas Court had jurisdiction to commit petitioner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Lima State Hospital before indictment, after an affidavit had been filed against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The principal contention of petitioner is that her commitment to Lima State Hospital by reason of her inability to stand trial offends her right to dne process because, she claims, it is unlikely she will be able to be tried in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Petitioner relies <em>on Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1972), 406 U. S. 715. Jackson was charged with robbery. A pretrial competency hearing was held, and the court found that Jackson lacked \u201ccomprehension sufficient to make his defense\u201d and committed him to the state Department of Mental Health until such time as \u201cthe defendant is sane.\u201d Jackson filed a motion for new trial, arguing that there was no evidence that he would ever be competent to stand trial and that, therefore, his commitment was unconstitutional. That motion was denied, and, on appeal, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that Jackson\u2019s incompetency commitment violated his due process and equal protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Medical and other evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before the trial court in <em>Jackson </em>showed that petitioner would never be able to comprehend the charges against him or be able to participate in his defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court noted (page 726) that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that even points to any probability that Jackson\u2019s present condition can be remedied at any future time,\u201d and held (page 738) that \u201ca person charged <em>* * * </em>-with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial Ccinnot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>stantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Until the time of the crime she is accused of committing, petitioner, Horvath, had no history of mental disturbance. The only witness, a doctor on the staff of Tima. State Hospital, testifying at the hearing before the Court of Appeals was asked on direct examination, on cross-examination and by the court whether it was reasonable to expect that petitioner would have the capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future. The witness responded that petitioner \u201chas a reasonable expectation of going into remission, becoming restored, if you will, within a reasonable future\u201d; \u201cthere is a reasonable expectation of her recovery in the reasonable future\u201d; and \u201cthere is. Foreseeable.\u201d Petitioner offered no evidence to the contrary. Her evidence consisted solely of a copy of the appearance and execution docket, her motions before the Common Pleas Court and the hospital records from which the witness testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, dismissing the petition and ordering that petitioner remain in the custody of respondent, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-9\">0 \u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">At Ms competency hearing, Jackson was represented by .counsel who cross-examined the testifying doctors and called witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Jackson was described as a \u201cmentally defective deaf mute with a mental level of a pre-school child\u201d who could not \u201cread, write, oar otherwise communicate except through limited sign language.\u201d There was evidence that it was extremely unlikely that he could ever learn to read or write.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The court declined to \u201cprescribe arbitrary time limits,\u201d but said only that Jackson was confined \u201con a record that sufficiently establishes the lack of a substantial probability that he will ever be able to participate fully in a trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
