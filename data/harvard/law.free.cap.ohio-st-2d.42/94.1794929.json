See <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 131, 214 N. E. 2d 219; <em>Oberdier </em>v. <em>Kennedy Ford </em>(1970), 23 Ohio App. 2d 168, 261 N. E. 2d 348; <em>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sandford </em>(1966), 8 Ohio App. 2d 259, 221 N. E. 2d 596. However, the above cases dealt with the phrase as used in a family insurance policy. It is our conclusion that a like criterion would be improper when construing the meaning of the term in a garage insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Family automobile policies often contain a clause excluding coverage for sums the insured is obligated to pay which result from driving a non-owned vehicle furnished to him for his regular use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One purpose of such an exclusion is to protect the company from a situation where an insured purchases one automobile, acquires liability insurance thereon, and then uses that protection while continually operating non-owned vehicles for which no premium has been paid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Pulsifer </em>(Me. S. D. <em>1941), 41 </em>F. Supp. 249; <em>George B. Wallace Co. </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1960), 220 Ore. 520, 349 P. 2d 789. Additionally, however, it is known that insureds often drive non-owned vehicles on trips where driving chores are shared, or around town for short trips in a friend\u2019s or relative\u2019s car. Hence, the construction placed upon the term \u201cregular use\u201d in family policies is quite favorable to the insured. Although some benefit also derives to the insurer, the affording of protection to the insured during occasional or incidental use of non-owned cars is significant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The purpose of the \u201cregular use\u201d coverage in a garage insurance policy differs from the purpose of such coverage in a family policy. The garage type \u00a9f policy is obtained, in part, by an automobile agency, service station or repair shop to provide coverage for those vehicles used in their business. In a business, such as a repair garage or agency, it is not only foreseeable, but common practice that automobiles are loaned to customers, or potential customers. The insurer offers the \u201cregular use\u201d provision in a garage policy to implement the intent to protect the insured from liability in circumstances involving a loaned vehicle. This interpretation is also consistent with the risks the insurer should be expected to assume, since in a garage policy, unlike a family policy, the insured pays a specific premium for the \u201cregular use\u201d coverage. Additionally, the ambiguity of the policy supports a construction favorable to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In light of the above factors, we construe the term \u201cregular use,\u201d in this garage policy, to provide coverage of loaned automobiles when used within the scope of the permission given by the insured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where a garage liability policy provides coverage for automobiles \u201cfurnished for the use of * * * any person or organization to whom the named insured furnishes automobiles for their regular use,\u201d \u201cregular use\u201d is that use of the vehicle which is usual and customary for the person for whose use the automobile was furnished. This meaning allows for coverage the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>siired reasonably expects under the policy, and is consistent with the limitation on \u201cregular use\u201d coverage in appellant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In the ease at bar, Greenwood Auto placed no conditions on the use that Thomas Berry, Jr., was to make of the automobile during the time it was loaned to him. The ear was loaned to Berry for his usual and customary use and, therefore, the insured furnished the loaner for Berry\u2019s regular use within the terms of the policy.

The College Dictionary, Kandom House (1978), defines \u201cregular\u201d as meaning both \u201cusual, normal, customary,\u201d and \u201crecurring at fixed or uniform intervals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Appellant\u2019s policy, in part, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u201cPersons insured\u2014Each of the following is an insured under Part I, except as provided below:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u201c(4) With respect to an automobile to which the insurance applies under paragraph 1(b) of the Automobile Hazards, any person while using such automobile with the permission of the person or organization to whom such automobile is furnished, <em>provided such person\u2019s actual operation </em>* * * is <em>within the scope of such permission.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b141-9\">Paul W. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_i\">dissenting. To sustain its allegation that Thomas Berry, Jr., is primarily covered by a garage liability policy issued to Greenwood Auto, Inc., by the Travelers Indemnity Company, appellee, The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, relies upon Sections 1(a) and 1(b) of the \u201cautomobile hazards\u201d portion of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Section 1(a) provides coverage for any automobile used for garage operations; for any automobile, principally used in garage operations, which is occasionally used for other business purposes; and for any automobile, principally used in garage operations, which is used for non-business purposes. The parties agree that Section 1(a) under proper circumstances covers, among other things, one-shot, short-term \u201cloaners,\u201d including, but not limited to, automobiles loaned to persons whose automobiles are being repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">However, appellee offered no evidence which indicates that the 1968 Javelin was loaned to Thomas Berry, Jr., in the course of Greenwood\u2019s garage operations, or that the automobile, whether loaned for a business or nonbusiness purpose, was \u201cused principally in garage operations.\u201d Bather, appellee relies on ten meager stipulations, none of which present facts sufficient to constitute such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Section 1(b) of the policy provides coverage for any automobile owned by the named insured, and furnished for the use of \u201c (i) the named insured, a partner therein, an executive officer thereof or, if a resident of the same household, the spouse of any of them, or (ii) any other person or organization to whom the named insured furnishes automobiles for their regular use.\u201d Subsection (i) contemplates automobiles used by the corporation\u2019s owners and executives, and their wives. Subsection (ii) contemplates automobiles furnished to individuals and organizations for their consistent use over the long-term. Common examples include automobiles furnished to company salesmen, public officials, charitable organizations, and public schools for driver-education programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Clearly, the one-shot, two-day loan in the present case was not the loan of an automobile \u201cfurnished for regular use,\u201d as that technical language has been defined in past Ohio insurance cases. See <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 131; <em>Oberdier </em>v. <em>Kennedy Ford </em>(1970), 23 Ohio App. 2d 168; <em>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sandford </em>(1966), 8 Ohio App. 2d 259. Regular use, as the majority notes, requires frequent, steady, or constant use over a substantial period of time. Only by persuading the majority to redefine this concept in the context of a garage policy does appellee limit its liability to providing \u201cexcess\u201d coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The upshot, of course, is that Ohio now defines \u201cregular use\u201d differently when used in a garage liability policy than when used in the standard family automobile policy. Absent policy language justifying this difference, it cannot be rationalized or justified. Further, the majority\u2019s definition of \u201cregular use\u201d reduces the garage liability policy herein to an absurdity, providing coverage for short-term loans where none was contemplated, reducing technical language to redundant verbiage.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Many courts have held that \u201cregular use\u201d is not ambiguous, and hence not subject to construction. See <em>Liggett </em>v, <em>Fahey </em>(1972), 30 N. Y. 2d 680, 283 N. E. 2d 610; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Kern </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(C. A. 8, 1968), 398 F. 2d 958; <em>Teixeira </em>v. <em>Globe Indemnity Co. </em>(C. A. 9, 1965), 349 F. 2d 502; <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C. A. 5, 1963), 321 F. 2d 96; <em>Century Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>United States Casualty Co. </em>(C. A. 5, 1962), 306 F. 2d 956. Indeed, there can be no ambiguity, within the meaning of the rule requiring strict construction against an insured, once a term has been judicially defined. I Couch on Insurance 2d 824, Section 15:83; 30 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 231, Insurance, Section 218. For this reason, we held in <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., supra </em>(5 Ohio St. 2d 131), at page 134, that application of \u201cregular use\u201d language is a factual problem, not a definitional one. Our inquiry is limited to determining whether specific facts and circumstances constitute \u201cregular use,\u201d as that phrase has been heretofore defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">A single period of use consisting of two days, the purpose of which is unexplained, can not constitute a regular use, under either a standard automobile or a garage liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Nor can I agree, as the majority contends, that \u201cthe insurer offers the \u2018regular use\u2019 provision in a garage policy to implement the intent to protect the insured from liability in circumstances involving a loaned vehicle.\u201d No liability of the insured can ever be predicated upon the mere loan of a vehicle. Coverage (which alone is in question here) must be grounded upon policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">I find judicial tampering with the unambiguous terms of an insurance policy no less onerous than the \u201cjudicial legislating\u201d this eourt so often deplores. The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-8\">Corrigan and W, Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
