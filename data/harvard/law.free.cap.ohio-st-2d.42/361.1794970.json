S. 226, 227. See, also, <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(1971), 404 U. S. 189; <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Washington (1963), 372 U. S. </em>487; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956), 351 U. S. 12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 114, 326 N. E. 2d 667. Appellant disputes both the indigency of appellee and his need for a complete transcript of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellant asserts in his Proposition of Law No. 1 that \u2018 \u2018 a defendant in a criminal case whose legal fees are being paid by a relative is not indigent to the extent that a transcript of trial proceedings should be furnished to him at public expense.\u201d This assertion of nonindigency is based on the fact that appellee\u2019s brother provided the funds for retaining both trial and appellate counsel. However, this fact is immaterial. Here, we are concerned with appellee\u2019s ability to secure a transcript, not his brother\u2019s; a criminal defendant\u2019s brother has no legal duty to provide the accused with the monetary means to prosecute an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Appellant specifically determined, in response to appellee\u2019s motion for a transcript, that appellee was indigent. The record does not disclose any new evidence relevant to the issue of indigency. Therefore, appellant\u2019s original determination of indigency must stand. Since none of appellee\u2019s relatives volunteered to purchase a transcript for him, the expense of providing a transcript, if one is needed, must be borne by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\"><em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra </em>(404 U. S., at 227), identifies the two factors which must be considered in determining whether an indigent criminal defendant needs a transcript for an effective defense or appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u201c* * * (i) the value of the transcript to the defendant in connection with the appeal or trial for which it is sought, and (2) the availability of alternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as a transcript.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The substantial value of a complete written transcript of the testimony at appellee\u2019s trial is unquestionably clear in this case. Counsel representing appellee on his criminal appeal was not appellee\u2019s trial attorney. Appellee\u2019s petition for mandamus alleged that the appellate counsel \u201c* * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>is completely unfamiliar with what transpired at the trial\u201d and that \u201ccounsel needs a full and complete transcript in order to represent the rights of the defendant [appellee] on appeal.\u201d Appellant has not disputed these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Appellant has questioned, however, appellee\u2019s need for a complete written transcript of the trial testimony. This testimony was preserved hy means of electronic audio recordation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant argues that since appellee\u2019s counsel does not know if any prejudicial error was committed at the criminal trial, he must first review the tapes to determine if a written transcript is necessary for an appeal. Be-wording this argument in light of the <em>Britt </em>case, appellant is asserting that the audio tapes of the trial are available to appellee\u2019s counsel and that they would fulfill the same function as a written transcript. We disagree. Under present rules, the untranscribed audio tapes could not be submitted as part of the record on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, in a criminal appeal, audio tapes are not a proper substitute for a written transcript of the trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-5\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\">This is a recognized method of preserving trial proceedings in Ohio.
