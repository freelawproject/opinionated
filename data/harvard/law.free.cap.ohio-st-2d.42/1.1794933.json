Also, in consideration of respondent\u2019s objections and contentions, we find no facts in mitigation or justification of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Therefore, the report and recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline are confirmed, and it is the judgment of this court, pursuant to Gov. R. V(6) (b), that respondent, Halbert E. Whitaker, be suspended for an indefinite period from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-11\">O\u2019Neill, C.
