The charter does not require that such submission be by way of an \u201cordinance\u201d enacted only after council follows the procedures outlined in any other articles of the charter for the enactment of \u201cordinances or resolutions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The proposed charter amendments were properly submitted to the electors of Broadview Heights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, denying the writ of prohibition, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-9\">O\u2019Neill, C.
