C. 4123.519 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u2018 \u2018 The claimant or the employer may appeal a decision of the Industrial Commission in any injury case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted or in which the contract of employment was made if the injury occurred outside the state. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Past decisions of this court interpreting the above provisions have consistently held that an order constituting a denial that is absolute and which goes to the basis of claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund is not a \u201cdecision as to the extent of disability,\u201d and is appealable pursuant to R. C. 4123.519. <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Flowers </em>(1972), 28 Ohio St. 2d 230, 277 N. E. 2d 422; <em>State, ex rel. Campbell, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 154, 277 N. E. 2d 219; <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Flowers </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 40, 271 N. E. 2d 769; <em>State, ex rel. Mansour, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 94, 249 N. E. 2d 775; <em>Keels </em>v. <em>Chapin &amp; Chapin </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 112, 214 N. E. 2d 428; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Scanlon </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 139, 151 N. E. 2d 561. Where an appeal is available from an order of the commission, an action in mandamus may not be maintained. See <em>State, ex rel. Ferris, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St. 2d 49, 245 N. E. 2d 357; <em>State, ex rel. Foley, </em>v. <em>Greyhound Lines </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St. 2d 6, 241 N. E. 2d 904; <em>State, ex rel. Benton, </em>v. <em>C. &amp; So. O. Elec. Co. </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St. 2d 130, 237 N. E. 2d 134; <em>State, ex rel. Latino, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St. 2d 103, 234 N. E. 2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Conversely, where the commission\u2019s order constitutes a finding as to the extent of disability, an appeal is unavailable and mandamus is proper to test the commission\u2019s exercise of its discretion. See <em>State, ex rel. Campbell, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra; Rummel </em>v. <em>Flowers, supra; Reeves </em>v. <em>Flowers, supra; State, ex rel Shewalter, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 12, 249 N. E. 2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In the case at bar, both appellant and appellee Industrial Commission argue that the relevant provisions of E. C. 4123.519 do not allow an appeal from the commission\u2019s order of May 30, 1972. That decision, finding claimant permanently and totally disabled, clearly was not an absolute denial of claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund, but was a determination as to the extent of disability. Therefore, an appeal did not lie and appellant\u2019s only available remedy was an original action in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Appellant argues that the commission abused its discretion by accepting for review claimant\u2019s motion for permanent disability without evidence of new and changed circumstances required by E. C. 4123.57(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the medical report of Dr. Eoemer did not constitute substantial evidence of changed conditions since the last examination, we disagree with appellant\u2019s position that the relevant provisions of E. C. 4123.57(B) must be construed <em>in pari materia </em>with the provisions of E. C. 4123.58, relating to permanent and total disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>As our prior eases have noted, a distinct difference exists between the goals of compensation for partial disability and for permanent and total disability. Although an award for permanent and total disability is generally aimed at compensating for impairment of earning capacity, benefits for partial disability are more akin to damages for work-related injuries. See <em>Fleischman </em>v. <em>Flowers </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 131, 267 N. E. 2d 318; <em>State, ex rel. Latino, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra </em>(13 Ohio St. 2d 103). See, also, Young, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio, 107, Section 7.22. As can be seen from a reading of R. C. 4123.57 (B), the phrase \u201csubstantial evidence of new and changed circumstances\u201d relates to the concept of partial disability. Additionally, R. C. 4123.95 states: \u201cSections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d It is our conclusion that the language from R. C. 4123.57(B) discussed above, being absent from R. C. 4123.58, was intended by the G-eneral Assembly to apply only to partial disability claims pursuant to R. C. 4123.57(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Appellant contends further that the Industrial Commission\u2019s determination that claimant is permanently and totally disabled is unsupported by the evidence, and that such determination constitutes an abuse of discretion. We disagree. This court has often recognized that the determination of disputed factual situations is within the final jurisdiction of the commission, subject to correction by action in mandamus only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State, ex rel. Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 278 N. E. 2d 24; <em>State, ex rel. Reed, </em>v. <em>Indus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Comm. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 200, 207 N. E. 2d 755; <em>State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 47, 139 N. E. 2d 41. Thus, where the record contains evidence which supports the commission\u2019s factual findings, this court will not disturb that determination. See <em>State, ex rel. Coen, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 550, 186 N. E. 398; <em>State, ex rel. Allied Wheel Products, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., </em>supra; <em>State, ex rel. Mees, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 128, 279 N. E. 2d 861; <em>State, ex rel. Breno, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 227, 298 N. E. 2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In the case at bar, the commission considered the medical opinions of three doctors concerning whether claimant was permanently and totally disabled. Only Dr. Koenigshoff indicated that claimant was not so disabled, and his opinion was based upon the medical proof on file with the commission, not upon an examination of claimant. Dr. Roemer\u2019s report, although insufficient in other respects, supported a finding of permanent and total disability. The report submitted by Dr. Katz also stated that claimant was permanently disabled, and provided a detailed description of claimant\u2019s medical problems arising out of the 1958 and 1966 injuries. A reasonable interpretation of this report is-that the effects of the 1966 injury, when superimposed upon the 1958 injury, caused claimant to be permanently and totally disabled; the 1966 injury was not only a contributing factor, but the \u201cfinal straw\u201d which produced such disability. Because the commission did not base its conclusion upon a claim over which jurisdiction no longer existed (the 1958 injury),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there was no abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>tion in viewing the evidence in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Although the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that appellant had a right of appeal from the decision of the Industrial Commission, that court correctly found that the record supports the commission\u2019s factual determination. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
