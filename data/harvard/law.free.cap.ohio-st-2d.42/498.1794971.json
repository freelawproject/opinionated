C. 149.43, and, therefore, are required to be available for inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">E. C. 149.43 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u201cAs used in this section, \u2018public record\u2019 means any record required to be kept by any governmental unit, including, but not limited to, state, county, city, village, township and school district units, except records pertaining to physical or psychiatric examinations, adoption, probation, and parole proceedings, and records the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u201cAll public records shall be open at all reasonable times for inspection. Upon request, a person responsible for public records shall make copies available at cost, within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">In enacting this statute, the G-eneral Assembly defined, with certain exceptions, \u201cpublic record\u201d as \u201cany record required to be kept by any governmental unit.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, if the records in question in the instant case are specifically required to be kept by law, their availability for inspection is mandated by E. C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">E. C. 3317.021 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">\u201cA membership record shall be kept by grades in each school district which shall show the following information for each pupil enrolled: Name, date of birth, name of parent * *</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">E. C. 3319.32 states, in part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201cBoards of education shall require all teachers and superintendents to keep the school records and to prepare reports in such manner as to enable the preparation of the annual reports required by law * * *. The records of each school, in addition to all other requirements, shall be so kept as to exhibit the names of all pupils enrolled therein, the studies pursued, the character of the work done, and the standing of each pupil * *</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Additionally, R. C. 3321.12 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe principal or teacher in charge of any public, private, or parochial school, shall report to the clerk of the board of education of the city * * * in which the school is situated, the names, ages, and places of residence of all pupils below eighteen years of age in attendance at their schools * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">It is clear from a reading of R. C. 3317.021, 3319.32, and 3321.12, that documents disclosing the names of all pupils, and the address of those pupils under eighteen years of age, are records which school districts are required, by law, to maintain. R. C. 3319.32, by prescribing that each school keep records which exhibit the names of pupils and \u201cthe studies pursued,\u201d requires the records to show what courses each pupil is taking. Therefore, the above records, under present statutes, are \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of R. C. 149.43.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and a writ of mandamus, consistent with this decision, is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-10\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-14\">None of the exceptions to this definition are applicable to the instant record. The federal law dealing with divulgence of certain records neither prohibits the release of the records sought by appellants, nor exacts a sanction for their release under the circumstances of the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-11\">The instant case does not require us to weigh the effect of R. <em>C </em>149.43 upon any breach of a competing right to individual privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
