C. 5739.13, begins to run when service of the notice of assessment is effectuated, or from the date the taxpayer receives actual notice of such assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">R. C. 5739.13 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\u201cIn each case the commissioner shall give to the person assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served upon the person assessed personally or by registered or certified mail. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">&lt;\u00ab# # #</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">\u201cUnless the vendor or consumer, to whom said notice of assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof * * * said assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable, from the vendor or consumer so assessed, to the treasurer of the state. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Appellants contend that the issue herein should be resolved consistent with the rationale of the Court of Appeals in <em>Fell </em>v. <em>Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1972), 30 Ohio App. 2d 151, 283 N. E. 2d 825, where actual notice to the licensee was found to be a condition precedent to suspension of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>driver\u2019s license under R. 0. 4511.191(E).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To reach that conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied upon the mandate of this court in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Given </em>(1884), 39 Ohio St. 661, in which the second paragraph of the syllabus states \u201c [w]here a statute requires notice of a proceeding, but is silent concerning its form of service, actual notice will alone satisfy such requirement.\u201d In the case at bar, R. C. 5739.13 is not silent concerning the manner of service, but specifically designates registered or certified mail as a means of notifying the taxpayer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">R. C. 5739.13 provides for appeal from the notice of assessment, if the taxpayer \u201cfiles within thirty days after service thereof.\u201d In deciding whether that time period is to be construed as running from the date when the taxpayer receives actual notice of the assessment, guidance is available from a perusal of how mail service is employed pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure. Civ. R. 4.1(1) provides, in part: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Service of any process shall be by certified mail unless otherwise permitted by these rules.\u201d Service by mail is therefore encouraged and preferred under the Civil Rules, as a party cannot invoke personal or residence service unless he specifically files a written request for such process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The use of mail service, under R. 0. 5739.13, is not only preferred under the Civil Rules, it also is consistent with due process and modern service requirements. Such service is reasonably calculated to give notice of the assessment and allow the taxpayer to present his objections. See <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1950), 339 U. S. 306, 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It should also be noted that certified mail, under the Rules of Civil Procedure, no longer requires actual service upon the party receiving the notice, but is effective upon certified delivery. Prior to its amendment in 1971, Civ. R. 4.1(1) stated that \u201c* * * if the return receipt shows failure of delivery <em>to the addressee </em>the clerk shall forthwith notify, by mail, the attorney of record * * V\u2019 (Emphasis added.) However, the above-italicized words were subsequently deleted,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> evidencing an intent to avoid the impression that certified mail, to be effective, had to be delivered to and signed by the addressee only. The above considerations, and the recognition that a need for actual notice would be contradictory to modern service requirements, represent persuasive arguments for the rejection of appellants \u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Finally, there are significant practical problems inherent in the taxpayers\u2019 contentions. As pointed out heretofore, R. C. 5739.13 allows for a 30-day period for appeal before the tax assessment becomes conclusive and payable to the state. A requirement of actual notice would permit a taxpayer to evade service and not be liable upon the assessment until such time as the Tax Commissioner could show the requisite notice and passage of the 30-day period. In that situation, the ability of the commissioner to prove actual receipt on a particular day would be elusive at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>It is oui conclusion that where an assessment for sales taxes is made pursuant to R. C. 5739.13, and notice of such assessment is served upon the vendor or consumer by registered or certified mail, service is effective when the notice is delivered and properly receipted for by an appropriate person at the vendor or consumer\u2019s residence, and the 30-day period within which the vendor or consumer must file a petition objecting to such assessment begins to run from that date.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any language to the contrary in <em>State, ex rel. Sherrick, </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 122, 107 N. E. 2d 145, is disapproved, and the first paragraph of the syllabus of that case is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-6\">0 \u2019Neill, C.

In the case at bar, however, the record reflects an absence of factors which would render service improper and allow appellants to file for reassessment beyond the time permitted by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-8\">William B. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Acy\">dissenting. In <em>State, ex rel. Sherrick, </em>v. <em>Peck </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 122, this court construed G. C. 5546-9a as requiring <em>actual receipt of notice </em>of assessment by a taxpayer before the 30-day period, in which the taxpayer could file objections to the assessment, began to run. G. C. 554-6-9a is, where pertinent, identical<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8 to R. C. 5739.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The rationale requiring actual receipt of notice of a taxation assessment is expressed by the unanimous court in <em>Sherrick, </em>at page 125, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201cThe problem of construing this statute with respect to the time and manner of serving the notice and filing the petition must be approached realistically. The statute from which the above portion is quoted authorizes the Tax Commissioner to make an assessment against the vendor or consumer \u2018based upon any information within his possession, or that shall come into his possession.\u2019 The notice of assessment so authorized to be served upon the vendor or consumer is not a preliminary notice that an assessment is contemplated but is a final notice that an assessment has been made. In this respect the situation differs materially from the institution of an ordinary action at law where summons is served preliminary to the rendering of a decision. Here the decision has been made before the notice is served. With these facts in mind it would seem reasonable to conclude that the legislators intended that the vendor or consumer have 30 days within which to prepare his objections to the assessment and his petition setting out those objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u201cUnder this hypothesis it becomes significant that the legislators provided with respect to the notice that it \u2018may be <em>served upon </em>the vendor or consumer <em>personally </em>or <em>by registered </em>mail\u2019 and that with respect to the petition it shall be <em>'filed </em>\u2018either personally <em>or by registered </em>mail.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.) Obviously, the vendor or consumer was entitled to actual notice of the assessment which would have the effect of a judgment against him if not contested. Actual service of the notice upon him was contemplated by the statute, which service could be made either personally or by registered mail delivered to him. Although a registered return receipt card bearing the purported signature of the addressee would presumably show actual delivery to him, the addressee could rebut that presumption by evidence. If some unauthorized person receipted for the communication and the addressee did not receive the communication until several days or weeks after its purported delivery, he would have no opportunity within 30 days of the purported delivery date to file his petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>^ if\" ? ?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The foregoing reasons still apply and provide a sound basis to continue the requirement of actual notice. Process and other legal documents dispatched from a courthouse are generally recognizable as such. However, a letter from an administrative agency may appear so harmless as to not prompt an \u201cappropriate person\u201d to timely deliver it to the addressee.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Even though <em>Sherrick </em>amply illustrates how the institution of a lawsuit differs remarkably from taxation assessment procedures, the majority erroneously<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seek guidance from the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The majority is confident that the requirement of constructive rather than actual notice in the civil practice may be incorporated into taxation procedures. However, one who picks and chooses his sources of law, should do so with great caution. It is immediately obvious that safeguards<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> contained in the Rules of Civil Procedure sufficiently offset possibly harsh results occasioned by strict application of the constructive notice provisions. However, R. C. 5739. 13 contains no such safeguards because it contemplates <em>actual </em>notice only.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Any suggestion that actual notice is a relic of a bygone era is negated by the date on which R. C. 5739.13 was last amended\u20141974 (unchanged since authoritatively construed in <em>Sherrick </em>in 1952), and the date on which R. C. 324.06 was enacted\u20141967 (containing the same notice and service requirements as R. C. 5739.13).</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-9\">Celebrezze and P. Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The only material change in the statute is that the word \u201ccertified\u201d has been added to authorize service by \u201cregistered or certified mail.\u201d However, the two terms are legally synonymous. R. C. 1.02(G) reads: \u201c \u2018Registered mail\u2019 includes certified mail and \u2018certified mail\u2019 includes registered mail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The Rules of Civil Procedure do not purport to apply to anything other than proceedings before the courts of this state.
