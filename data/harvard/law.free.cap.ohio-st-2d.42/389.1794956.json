C. 4123.519.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, appellant contends, mandamus was available because it had no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>This court agrees. In the recent case of <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 278, an employee who suffered a back injury in the course of his employment and was again injured in a work-related incident, filed a motion for permanent total disability, which was allowed. The employer then filed a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals seeking to have the order allowing permanent total disability vacated. The Court of Appeals held that General Motors had a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law by way of appeal and denied the writ of mandamus. Upon appeal, this court held that the decision of the commission \u201cfinding claimant permanently and totally disabled clearly was not an absolute denial of claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund, but was a determination as to the extent of disability. Therefore, an appeal did not lie and appellant\u2019s only available remedy was an original action in mandamus.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In this case, the December 20, 1973, order allowing benefits for temporary total disability was clearly a determination as to the extent of disability. Claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund had previously been established. Hence, the order allowing temporary total disability was not appealable, and Commercial Motor Freight\u2019s only available remedy was an original action in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Accordingly, on authority of <em>State, ex rel. General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm., supra, </em>the judgment of the Court of Appeals, dismissing Commercial Motor Freight\u2019s action in mandamus, is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for a hearing on the merits of relator\u2019s complaint in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\">R. C. 4123.519.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u201cThe claimant or the employer may appeal a decision of the Industrial Commission in any injury case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted or in which the contract of employment was made if the injury occurred outside the state. * * *\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals was, however, affirmed for the reason that \u201cthat court correctly found that the record supports the commission\u2019s factual determination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
