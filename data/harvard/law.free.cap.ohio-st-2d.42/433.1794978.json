C. 2945.71 (C) (2) and (D) for commencing trial does not begin to run until the Juvenile Court relinquishes jurisdiction and transfers the accused to the \u201cadult\u201d court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The time limits set forth in R. C. 2945.71 (C) apply only- to \u201c[a] person against whom a charge of felony is pending * * *.\u201d A juvenile who has lodged against him an affidavit alleging that he is delinquent because he com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>mittecl ail act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony is not a person against whom a charge of felony is pending. See <em>In re Agler </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 70, 249 N. E. 2d 808; <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 475, 196 N. E. 2d 457 (paragraph one of the syllabus); <em>In re Darnell </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 335, 182 N. E. 2d 321; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>State </em>(1869), 19 Ohio St. 184. The juvenile becomes such a person and is, therefore, included within the scope of R. C. 2945.71 (C) only if and when.the. Ju-. venile Court relinquishes jurisdiction over the case \u2022 and transfers it to the appropriate \u201cadult\u201d court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In the present case, the Juvenile Court relinquished jurisdiction over appellant and transferred him to the General Division of the Court of Common Pleas on March 26, 1974. Trial was subsequently scheduled for June 20, 1974, which was less than 90 days from March 26th. Therefore, R. C. 2945.71 (C)(2) and (D) were not violated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment- of the \u25a0 Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\">This holding- is based solely on the language of R. C. 2945.71 (C) and the nonfelonious nature of a delinquency allegation made against a juvenile. We find it unnecessary to decide whether \u25a0 aniinor has a constitutional right to a speedy disposition of juvenile charges pending against him. In passing, however, it should be noted that this court has taken action to assure the prompt convening of juvenile adjudicatory hearings. Juv. R. 29 (A) provides: \u201cThe date for the adjudicatory hearing shall be set when the complaint is filed, or as soon thereafter as is practicable. \u25a0 If' the child who is the subject of the complaint is in detention or shelter care, the hearing shall be held not later than ten days after the filing of the complaint; upon a showing of good cause the adjudicatory hearing may be contained and detention or shelter care extended.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
