C. 4511.19 were applicable to Ms. Bolan\u2019s case. One such provision is R. C. 4511.99 (A), which states: \u201cWhoever violates section 4511.19 of the Revised Code is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, in addition to the license suspension or revocation provided in section 4507.16 of the Revised Code. <em>At least three days\u2019 imprisonment is mandatory under this division.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Appellee contends that R. C. 4511.99 (A) unequivocally commands a trial judge to impose and execute a minimum sentence of three days\u2019 incarceration upon any person convicted of driving while intoxicated. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Appellant argues that R. C. 4511.99 (A) does not prohibit a trial judge from suspending actual confinement of a person convicted of violating R. C. 4511.19, and placing that person on probation. This argument is grounded on the premise that the word \u201cimprisonment,\u201d as used in R. C. 4511.99 (A), denotes not only physical confinement in' jail, but also a probationary period or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Appellant\u2019s premise is faulty. E. C. 1.05 defines the word \u201cimprisoned\u201d: \u201cAs used in the Eevised Code, unless the context otherwise requires, \u2018imprisoned\u2019 means imprisoned in a county or municipal jail or workhouse if the offense is a misdemeanor, and imprisoned in a state penal or reformatory institution if the offense is a felony, or if imprisonment in a state penal or reformatory institution is ordered pursuant to division (E) (3) of section 2929.41 of the Eevised Code.\u201d Nothing in the language of E. C. 4511.19 and E. C. 4511.99 (A) indicates that this definition is not applicable to the mandatory three days\u2019 imprisonment specified by E. C. 4511.99 (A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The intent of the General Assembly contained in E. C. 4511.99 (A) is unmistakably clear: A person convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs must serve at least three days in jail. A mandatory minimum jail sentence for such an offense is one of the General Assembly\u2019s responses to what many experts consider a leading cause of traffic accidents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ,, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">For an example of the statutory use of the word \u201cimprisonment\u201d in a context which requires ascribing to the word a definition broader than actual incarceration, see <em>State, ex rel. McKee, </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St. 2d 65, 320 N. E. 2d 286 (interpreting the meaning of the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment,\u201d as that phrase is used in R. C. 5143.05).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u201cDrinking is indicated to be a factor in at least half of the fatal motor-vehicle accidents, according to special studies.\u201d National Safety Council, Accident Facts (1974 Ed.), 52.
