Progress and the increased use of motor vehicles have made it necessary that Boute 422 be improved for the convenience and safety of the travelling public. The improvement was made entirely within the right of way originally acquired by the state and there was no substantial interference with, or added burden on, appellees\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">The property owners contend that the elimination of their direct access to Boute 422 \u201chas created a substantial impairment of ingress and egress which constitutes a compensable talcing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\"><em>State, ex rel. Merritt, </em>v. <em>Linzell </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>97, involved the abandonment of a portion of U. S. highway on which relators\u2019 commercially-used property abutted and the relocation of that part of the highway. Access to the new highway was afforded relators and their customers only by aecess lanes to and from the old highway. Relators claimed that their property had, in effect, been taken and that they were entitled to compensation. This court held, however, that \u201cmere circuity of travel, necessarily and newly created, to and from real property, does not of itself result in legal impairment of the right of ingress and egress. <em>* * * \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">See, also, <em>Richley </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In denying appellees a writ of mandamus, the Court of Common Pleas correctly held that there was no taking of appellees\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-10\">O\u2019Neill, C.
