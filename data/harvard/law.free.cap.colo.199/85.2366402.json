Vol. 8). Two grounds for reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment are asserted. She alleges that dismissal in the federal court of an unlawful flight to avoid prosecution charge constituted <em>res judicata </em>as to the present extradition proceedings. The appellant also alleges that the Governor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>warrant was insufficient in that there were improprieties in the affixing of the state seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The record reveals that neither of these arguments was ever presented in the trial court. It is fundamental that an appellate court will not pass upon issues which have not been presented for determination in the trial court except in the case of plain or fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">After a careful review of this record, we find no such error exists in this case. From this review, we comment also that the two grounds for reversal raised by the appellant are totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
