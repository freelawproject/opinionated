From this judgment, the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s declaration contains a special count on a contract between the parties and also three of the common counts, in assumpsit.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The contract is set out in the first count of the amended declaration and appears from the record to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">\u201cBel Air, Md., May 18, 1903.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">\u201cThe Bel Air Suburban Improvement Association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">\u201cIf your association will build and complete or cause to be completed the sewer from Scotts X-Boads along Main street extended to the railroad cut and thence to the outlet of said sewer, and will cause to be settled the pending injunction proceedings of George M.

The witness Somerville was asked by the counsel for the appellant upon examination in chief the following question: \u201cIn your judgment is that pipe there as constructed sufficient to drain the surface water of that road?\u201d The Court sustained an objection to the question and properly refused to allow the witness to answer it. Apart from other objections to this question the witness had not qualified as an expert and his opinion as to whether or not the work was done according\u201d to the requirements of the contract was a question which the jury could decide upon the facts without the opinions of witnesses. Bat<em>lo. Belt R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Sattler, </em>100 Md. 306; <em>Consolidated Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>109 Md. 198; <em>Stumore </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>68 Md. 11; <em>B. &amp; Y. Turnpike Road </em>v. <em>Leonhardt, </em>66 Md. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">This brings us to the exceptions relating to the rulings upon the defendant\u2019s nine prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant\u2019s first prayer asked the Court to instruct the jury that there was no evidence in the case legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover under the first count of the declaration and their verdict must therefore be for the defendant under the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">This count, it will be seen, was based upon the agreement, as set out in tire letter of May 18, 1903, and the prayer ignored entirely the evidence that the contract had been performed by the plaintiff as modified by the County Commissioners in 1914, and the recognition of their liability in furnishing the necessary pipe in 1914 to complete and construct the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The witness Eorris, one of the County Commissioners, testified that in 1914 two or three gentlemen came before the board and asked the board to refurnish or return the pipe. Mr. Wilson, the president of the board, referred the matter to Mr. Shanahan, one of the Commissioners as it was in his district. Mr. Shanahan said: \u201cGentlemen, I would like to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ask the board to go out and look the condition over'.\u201d We went out and looked the situation over and the pipe was furnished to complete the work on the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Mr. Stevenson A. Williams, a witness for the plaintiff, testified: \u201cMr. Shanahan mot the parties interested on the ground, and at the next meeting of the Commissioners we appeared before them and they told us to go ahead, they would order the pipe there, provided we did as we agreed to do to pay the expense of completing it, which we did. The pipe was put down there through the instrumentality of Mr. Hays and Mr. Carroll, and payment was made for it, then we appeared before the County Commissioners, having done as we considered our part of the agreement, and asked for the payment of the money. They made no objection to the way the work had been done, they simply said they did not think they were liable on the old paper. We called attention to the fact that the money was not payable until after the work was done. It took a long time to get the objections away, but it did not influence the County Coamnissioners, they simply said they would not pay it. I never heard of any complaint at any of the meetings., if there was any, as' to the way the work had been done. This $750 has never been paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">There was also evidence that the defendant waived the stipulation in the contract that the sewer avas to be so constructed by the plaintiff as to take ca.re of the surface water along the line of the same, and that the County Commissioners, would take care of the drainage and surface water.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Tu view of the testimony we have set out and the other evidence in the record, it is clear, that the defendant\u2019s first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth prayers were properly rejected. The Reporter will set out these prayers in his report of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The seventh and eighth prayers present a. question of limitations, and these prayers, under the evidence were properly refused. The payment under the contract was to be made upon the completion of the sewer, and the work was not completed and finished until August, 1914. It appears that suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>was instituted within one year after the completion of the work and upon the refusal of the defendant to pay the amount agreed upon. The plea of limitations was in no way a bar and did not apply to the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The defendant\u2019s ninth prayer undertook to deny a right of \u2022recovery on the contract, upon the ground that the plaintiff had failed to secure a written permit from the State Board of Health to construct and complete the sewer, under Chapter 810 of the Acts of 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">This statute it will be seen, does not affect the contract between the parties made prior to the passage of the Act, and even if it be assumed, that it applied to the class of construction work, done under this contract, it would not be a valid defense to a suit to recover for a breach of the contract itself. The plaintiff\u2019s objection to the granting of this prayer was sustained by the Court below and the prayer was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Finding; no reversible error in the rulings of the Court, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
