The only question to be decided on this appeal is whether he was a casual employe within the meaning of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which excepts \u201ccasual employes\u201d from its provisions. Code, Art. 101, sec. 63, par. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The injured man, who was a farmer and teamster, had been employed to do hauling for the factory whenever he was needed for that service. His employer testified: \u201cHe was engaged to me early in the canning season to&gt; work for me at such times as I might need him, and he promised to help me out at all such times as I might call upon him, and he did so, the day of the accident being the last of the work he had for the season.\u201d To the question: \u201cWas there no separate engagement or contract of hiring for the work he was doing-on the day of the accident?\u201d The employer replied: \u201cNothing more than just to tell him to come; the same wages paid all the time, always during the season the same wages.\u201d Under this general engagement the teamster who was injured had been called upon repeatedly for hauling service in the course of the packing, season, being paid at the uniform rate of three dollars per day when he hauled with his own team, and one dollar and a half per day when a factory team was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of this State does not define the term \u201ccasual\u201d as therein used to describe one of the classes of employees to whom the Act is not intended to apply. It is a purely relative term and, in the absence of a statutory definition, its application should be determined in each case according to the particular facts presented. The Act defines an \u201cemploye\u201d to be \u201ca person who is engaged in an extra-hazardous employment in the service of an employer carrying-on or conducting the same upon the premises or at a plant, or in the course of his employment, away from the plant of his employer.\u201d There can be no dispute as to the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the appellee\u2019s son was an \u201cemploye,\u201d within the definition of the Act, at the time he was injured, but it is contended that his employment was so irregular that it should be characterized as only casual, within the meaning of' the Act, and therefore expressly excluded from its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The question whether an employment is casual must be determined with principal reference to the scope and purpose of the hiring rather than with sole regard to the duration and regularity of the service. One who enters into a contract of employment for an entire season is not a casual employe merely because he may be required to work for only short and irregular periods. When there is a continuing engagement to serve the employer in his business at such times as the particular and essential service may be needed, the employment is not \u201ccasual\u201d according to any of the judicial definitions of that term. In this case the service required and rendered was occasional, but it was in pursuance of an engagement covering the whole of the working season at the employer\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>Sabella </em>v. <em>Brazileiro, </em>86 N. J. L. 505, where a longshoreman was employed at a certain sum per hour to help load a ship, having frequently rendered similar service to the same employer on previous occasions, it was held that the employment was not casual under the New Jersey Employer\u2019s Liability Act. It was decided in <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Mahoney </em>(Conn.), 103 Atl. 127, that one who kept machinery and boats in order at an amusement, park, whenever called upon for such service, was not a casual employe within the meaning of those words as used in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. of Connecticut. In <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Weinman </em>(Wis.), 167 N. W. 810, a boy who was called in at irregular intervals for service in a butcher\u2019s shop, when extra help was needed, or in the absence of a regular employe, was held not to he serving under a casual employment within the terms of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Wisconsin.. Also in <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>James Block M. &amp; C. Co. </em>(Mich.), 158 N. W. 959, where a man employed in other work on a building was engaged to assist in unloading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>glass as it arrived from time to time for use in the same building, it .was held that the latter employment was. not casual, under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Michigan, though there was an interval of ten days between the only two occasions when the service was performed. But in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Begg </em>(1908), 2 K. B. 802, where there was no regular engagement for the service, it was held that the employment of a man at intervals to clean windows was of a \u201ccasual nature\u201d under the provisions of the British Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Likewise in <em>Cheever\u2019s case, </em>219 Mass. 244, the employment of a teamster at various times to haul coal from the employer\u2019s coal yard was held to be casual under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Massachusetts, and in <em>Gaynor\u2019s case, </em>217 Mass. 86, a similar conclusion was reached in reference to the employment of a waiter' by a caterer to serve at a banquet, the engagement having no relation to- any past or future hiring between the same parties. Other cases in which occasional employments were held to be casual and hence not subject to the operation of statutes providing for such exceptions are: <em>Md. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>172 Cal. 748; 158 Pac. 1031; <em>Chicago Great Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission (I</em>ll.), 120 N. E. 508; <em>Thede Bros. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission (Il</em>l.), 121 N. E. 172; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Industrial Board, </em>281 Ill. 100; 117 N. E. 819; <em>Aurora Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Board, </em>277 Ill. 142; 115 N. E. 207; <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>248 Fed. 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The work in which the appellee\u2019s son was engaged when he received the injury which caused his death was a. necessary part of his employer\u2019s business. It was a service rendered under an employment which was not limited to the hauling then in progress, but applied to every recurring; occasion for such assistance during the whole of one of the annual produce tive periods of the employer\u2019s enterprise. Upon the facts of the case we agree with the ruling of the Court below, that the-employment was not casual within the meaning of the statute, and that the appellee is entitled to compensation under its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs and case remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
