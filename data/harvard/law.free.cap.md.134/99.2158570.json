The appellant is one of twelve laundries of Baltimore which are attempting to be relieved from the payment of taxes upon their apparatus by Chapter 561 of the Acts of 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Legislature by Chapter 32 of the Acts of 1912, now codified under sub-paragraph (C), sub-title \u201cAbatement to encourage manufacture\u201d of paragraph 28, title \u201cTaxes/\u2019 of the new Charter of Baltimore City,\u2014Revised Edition, 1915, whereby it gave power and authority to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u201cto provide by general ordinance, whenever it shall seem expedient for the encouragement of the growth and development of manufactories and manufacturing industry in the said city, for the abatement of any or all taxes levied by the authority of the said Mayor and Council of the City of Baltimore or by ordinance thereof, for any of the corporate uses thereof, upon any or all personal property, of every description owned by any individual, firm or corporation in said city and property subject to valuation and taxation therein, including mechanical tools or implements, whether worked by hand or steam or other motive power, machinery, manufacturing apparatus or engines, raw materials on hand, stock in trade, bills receivable, and business credits of every kind, whill said personal property shall be actually employed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>used in the business of manufacturing in said city; provided that such abatement shall be extended to all parties, firms and corporations engaged in the branches of manufacturing industry proposed to be benefited by any ordinance passed under the provisions of this paragraph of this section, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The Mayor and City Council pursuant to this power and authority expressly given to them by the above Act enacted on July 6, 1912, Ordinance Flo. 140, which is practically the same language of sub-paragraph (C) of Chapter 32 of the Act of 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">in 1914, by Chapter 324 of the Acts, of that year, now codified as section 88 (0) of Article 23 of Bagby\u2019s Code, the Legislature enacted a new scheme of taxing laws relating to \u201cordinary business corporations\u201d which authorized the State Tax Commission of Maryland, when dealing with this type of corporation, to tax</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201call personal property of such corporations exclusive of bonds, shares of stock, and securities as enumerated in Article 81, Section 214 of the Code of Public General Laws (1912), and property which, by law, is exempt from taxation, and exclusive of manufacturing plants situated in any city or county in which, by law or ordinance, manufacturing plants are exempt from county or municipal taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">By Chapter 561 of the Acts of 1916 the Legislature repealed the Act of 1912 and re-enacted the same in the identical language of that Act with the addition, however, that in the last paragraph thereof they enacted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201cand provided further, that laundry machinery when employed or used in the business of laundering shall be classed as manufacturing within the purposes of this sub-paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">We have already said that the Act of 1916 is in the' identical language as the Act of 1912, so, of course!, we find that the Act starts with the language under the head of Abate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ment to encourage manufacture \u201cto provide by general Ordinance, whenever it shall seem expedient for the encouragement of the growth and development of manufacturiesi and manufacturing industry in the said city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The Mayor and City Council have never availed them-, selves of the power and authority granted under this Act as they did under the Act of 1912, by the enactment of an ordinance, and thus the Ordinance No. 140, approved on July 6, 1912, is the last expression of the Mayor and City Council upon the subject. We, therefore, are forced to the opinion that until the city does enact an ordinance pursuant to the authority of the Act of 1916 this appellant, and others like situated, can claim no right to this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">' We are of the opinion that the lower Court was correct, and we will therefore affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
