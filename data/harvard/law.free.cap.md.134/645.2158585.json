Strange, Mayor of Annapolis from appointing George T. Melvin, or any other person, as president of said Water Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The learned Court below based its. decision on the ground that said Act was passed as an Emergency Law under\u201d Article XVT of the Constitution of Maryland, known as The Referendum, and therefore violates the proviso in section 2 of said Article \u201cthat no measure creating or abolishing any office, or changing the salary, term or duty of any officer, or granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>any franchise or special, privilege, or creating any vested right or interest shall he enacted as an emergency law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The three questions argued on this appeal wer e:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">1. Was the appointment of George T, Melvin as President of the Water Company actually made before the granting of the preliminary injunction ?</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">2. Was any office created, or the salary, term or duty of any officer changed, within the meaning of said constitutional provision, by tbe Act of 1918 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">3. Assuming that the constitutional provision was violated by the attempt to make the Act an Emergency Law, did that render the entire Act unconstitutional ?</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In the view we take of this case it is unnecessary to consider any of these points. In our opinion the Act of 1918 does not come within the purview of Article XVI of the Constitution. That Article was clearly not intended to apply to public local laws for any city other than Baltimore City, there being no provision for a referendum except in eases of public general laws applicable to the State, and public local laws for a county or tbe City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Section 3 (a) of the said Article is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-11\">\u201cThe referendum petition against an Act or part of an Act passed by the General Assembly, shall be sufficient if signed by ten thousand qualified voters of the State of Maryland, of whom not more than half shall he residents of Baltimore City, or of any one county; provided that any Public Local Law for any one County or the City of Baltimore, shall be referred by the Secretary of State only to the people of said County or City of Baltimore, upon referendum petition of ten per cent, of the qualified voters of said County or City of Baltimore as the case may be, calculated upon the whole number of votes cast therein respectively for Governor at the last preceding Gubernatorial election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">It is manifest that a public local law for tbe City of Annapolis does not come within the above quoted provision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>there is no other provision in Article XVI applicable to such an Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">This Oourt decided in the case of <em>Beall </em>v. <em>State, </em>131 3\u00a3d. 669, that Article XVI did not supersede section 31 of Article 3 of the Constitution, but that said provision of the Constitution remained in full force except as to the cases provided for in Article XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The declaration by the Legislature that an Act is an emergency act does not make it so if it does not come within the purposes and provisions of Article XVI. In our opinion it was perfectly competent for the Legislature to provide that the Act of 1918 should go into effect immediately under section 31 of Article 3 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">It follow\u2019s that the Court below erred in declaring said Act unconstitutional and in granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed and b\u00fcl dismissed, with costs to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
