These samples were not satisfactory to Mr. Straus, the president of the Ginger Ale Company, because all of them did not weigh sixteen ounces. Mr. Hamburger contended that the terms of the contract which required the bottles to be of \u201caverage 16 ounce weight\u201d meant, according to \u201ca general custom of the trade,\u201d bottles weighing between fifteen and sixteen ounces; and that the samples complied with the contract; that if the appellants insisted upon bottles weighing not less than sixteen ounces, the contract should specify an average weight of seventeen ounces, which would cost more than the \u201caverage 16 ounce weight\u201d bottles. The appellee also wrote the appellants as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">\u201cMar. 20, T7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201cMr. W. L.

He, Mr. Hamburger, in turn writes us under date of the 19th, that since receipt of our communication he had been trying to get in communication with you in order to impart the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>circumstances, but bad failed to do so, and lie was incidentally called out of tbe city and would be absent for tbe week and suggest tbat we communicate with you direct in order to get a prompt decision in tbe matter, as this is most important, both the promptness and decision referred to. We do not have any too much time to complete your order and under these, treacherous conditions Re\u2014Supplies, etc., it is most imperative that we have your approval by return mail if at all possible. Tbe question is, if bottles are required to be 16 oz. 'down weight we must have a <em>17 </em>ounce base weight from which to work, and this incurs an additional cost of twenty-five (25) cents per gross.

Pie did not say anything about not taking the rest of the contract at all. After I got home, I received his letter of June 11th, and since then he had never taken any more bottles, though he did take and pay for the first shipment. The carload of 16 ounce bottles referred to in the telephone conversation were made up' during; the interval of Mr. Hamburger\u2019s discussion with Mr. Straus in regard to the change in the terms of the contract in regard to the weight of the bottles,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u25a0which resulted in the letter of March 29th.\u201d Mr. Coffin also testified \u201cthat neither the Gosman Ginger Ale Company nor Mr. Straus had ever complained of the quality, capacity or Weight of the carload of hot,ties, which they accepted and paid for, and that he had not at any time agreed to release the defendants from their obligation to- take the balance under the contract. That the reference in the letter of June 9 th, 1917, from the Keystone Bottle Manufacturing Company to \u2018causes and circumstances of the delay\u2019 alluded to the scarcity of labor in molding shops, generally, owing to the laborers and mechanics going to munition factories,, and the consequent delay in the remodeling of the molds; that the United States declared War April 6, 1917, a few days after March 29th, and delays in transportation were also common at that time, and the first shipment was made as soon as possible under the circumstances. That the plaintiff was, ready, able and willing to deliver the remainder of the fifteen hundred gross in accordance with the terms of the contract, that the plaintiff\u2019s loss, due to the defendants\u2019 notice to the plaintiff that they considered the contract cancelled and to the refusal of the defendants to accept any more shipments under the contract, amounted to $2,622.96, said sum being the difference between what it would have cost the plaintiff to have manufactured and delivered the remainder of the goods called for by tbe contract of February 5th, 1917, as modified by the letter of March 29th, 1917, and the price of such goods as fixed by said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Mr. Straus\u2019 testimony as, to, the conversation between him and Mr. Smart on the 15th of June is as; follows: \u201cOn the morning of the 15th of June, I returned from Cleveland a little after 7 o\u2019clock; I was at home between 8 and 9 of clock, and Mr. Smart, called me up at the house, and spoke to me about this car of bottles; and I told Mm\u2014finally be said to me we are under considerable expense here with that carload of bottles, and I want you to do me a favor and take them,; it is an expensive thing to have the bottles come bare and stay here, and I want you to take the car of bottles; I then' told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>him, after talking over the phone, I would, take the car of bottles providing they were of the weight we agreed oar in the modified contract, but I would not take any more, and I would consider the contract cancelled, and if that was satisfactory I would take the car of bottles; he said that is perfectly satisfactory, and I want you to give me some of your future business, and I then said I would not object to that; that is. the entire conversation which passed between us; * * * that he told Mr. Smart at the interview the reason for refusing to take any more bottles wto that the company had sufficient bottles; that not hearing from him they had been obliged to go into tire market and buy them; * * * that he did not tell Mr. Smart in the telephone conversation that he would not take any more bottles now; that he told him that he would take the carload if they were of the weight agreed on, and he would not take any more, if Mr. Smart was satisfied with this, and would consider the contract cancelled, and that Mr. Smart agreed to this; that in the telephone conversation with Mr. Smart on June 15th, Mr. Smart asked about the carload of bottles, and witness told him they had been rejected. Mr. Smart replied that they had gone to considerable expense and the bottles were in Baltimore, and he wished as a favor that the defendants would take them; the witness finally told him that if they complied with the terms of the modified contract he would take them provided Mr. Hamburger agreed to cancellation of the contract as to the balance; that he explained that not having heard from Mr. Hamburger he had been obliged to fill his wants in the open market. Mr. Smart replied it was perfectly satisfactory, and he trusted I would give them some of our future business, which I said I surely would not object to. Mr. Smart said he would send the bill of lading and the invoice to the office and these were received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The defendants accepted and paid for the carload of bottles shipped on the 7th of June, but refused to' accept any more bottles under the contract, and this suit was brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>by tbe plaintiff to recover damages for an alleged breach of the contract by thn defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">To the declaration, setting ont the contract and the alleged breach thereof by the defendants, the defendants filed five pleas. The first and second pleas are that the defendants did not promise and were never indebted as alleged. The third plea alleges that the contract was cancelled by an agreement of the parties. The fourth plea is, that after the delivery and acceptance, of one carload of bottles, the plaintiff abandoned performance of the contract and the defendants, assented thereto-, and the fifth plea charges that the plaintiff defaulted in the performance of its contract, and in consideration of the defendants, agreeing to accept one carload of bottles,, the plaintiff agreed to cancel the contract, and the defendants did accept and pay for said carload of bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony the plaintiff offered seven prayers: the first, second, fifth, sixth and seventh of which were granted, the Court below <em>noting on </em>the first prayer that it, was granted in connection with defendants\u2019 first, second and fourth prayers. The defendants offered four prayers, all of which were granted in connection with plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, except the third, which was rejected. The reporter is requested in his report of the case to set out the plaintiff\u2019s, first and seventh prayers, and defendants,\u2019 first, second and fourth prayers,, correcting the error in the record so as, to make the note of the Court below on the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer refer to defendants\u2019 first, second and <em>fourth </em>prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The verdict and judgment being in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The first twelve exceptions in the record are to the admission of evidence offered for the purpose of showing' the meaning of the words \u201caverage 16 ounce weight\u201d in the original contract, as understood by those engaged in the manufacture and sale of bottles. As we have stated, the original contract \u25a0was modified by charging the specification in regard to the weight of the bottles, and it is conceded, or not denied, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the bottles furnished under the contract as modified were satisfactory. The evidence referred to in these exceptions could not, therefore, have injured the defendants, and its admission could not constitute reversible error. <em>Carroll Springs Co. </em>v. <em>Schnepfe, </em>111 Md. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The thirteenth and fourteenth exceptions refer to the evidence of Mr. Smart, offered in rebuttal, denying that he made certain statements in his conversation with Mr. Straus tending to show that he agreed to abandon the further performance of the contract, and were not pressed in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The ruling of the Court below in granting the plaintiff\u2019s prayers, rejecting the defendants\u2019 third prayer, and granting the defendants\u2019 first, second and fourth prayers in connection with plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, and the action of the Conrt in overruling defendants\u2019 motion to strike out certain evidence, are made the subject of the fifteenth exception. In reference to this exception the appellants contend: (1) that the plaintiff\u2019s first and seventh prayers are had because they instructed the jury that a shipment of the first car-load of bottles \u201cwithin a reasonable time under the circumstances\u201d after March 29th was a compliance with the contract requiring it to be shipped \u201cas soon as possible\u201d; (2) that the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer ignores the evidence relied on by the defendants to show that the contract had been cancelled by agreement, or the performance thereof had been abandoned by the plaintiff with their assent, and (3) that the granting of the defendants\u2019 first, second and fourth prayers in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer made the instructions of the Court below confusing and misleading, and practically deprived the defendants of the benefit of their said prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u25a0 Eirst.\u2014As to the first contention, it would seem sufficient to say that the <em>only </em>evidence in the record hearing upon the question whether there was unnecessary delay in the shipment of the first carload of bottles is the evidence to the effect that the bottles were shipped \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d and the jury, in determining whether the first carload was shipped \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d was confined to that evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>But We also, think the prayers properly construed the contract. It is said in <em>Words and Phrases, </em>Vol. 1, 528, upon the authority of the cases there cited: \u201cA contract by a manufacturer to furnish certain specified goods \u2018as soon as possible\u2019 means within a reasonable time, regard being had to the manufacturer\u2019s ability to produce them, and the orders he may already have in hand,\u201d and it is said on page 529, \u201cThe phrase \u2018as soon as possible,\u2019 in an insurance policy requiring that notice of loss,, accident or death should be given to the insurer as soon as possible, means with due diligence, or without unnecessary procrastination or delay under the circumstances of the case.\u201d In the case of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Balto. Fire Ins. Co., </em>3 Gill, 176, the Court said: \u201cTo enable us to judge of the correctness of the Court\u2019s conduct, in granting this prayer, the meaning of the terms, \u2018forthwith,\u2019 and, \u2018as soon as possible,\u2019 as used in the policy of insurance, ought to be ascertained. To give to them their literal import, would, in almost every case of loss by fire that occurs, strip the insured of all hope for indemnity for the loss incurred; and policies of insurance against fire, would, as to the insured, instead of being contracts of indemnity, as they profess, to be, become engines of fraud and injustice in the hands of the underwriters, and a recovery by the insured, would be rarely, indeed, if ever practicable. Such a construction, therefore, has not been sanctioned by courts of justice. The true meaning of those terms is, with due diligence, or without unnecessary procrastination or delay, under all 'the circumstances of the ease. See <em>Inman </em>v. <em>Western Fire Ins. Co., </em>12 Wendell, 461, where it was determined that, \u2018forthwith,\u2019 in such a policy, imposes upon the insured nothing more than what is called due diligence under all the circumstances of the case; and <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>9 Wendell, 166, where it was decided, that \u2018the assured is., as soon after the fire as. possible, to deliver in a, particular account of such loss or damage, and this, means no more, than it is. to be done with due diligence, under all the circumstances of the case; there is. to be no unnecessary procrastination or delay.\u2019 In all ordinary eases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>whether due diligence has been used by the insured, or he has been guilty of no unnecessary procrastination or delay under all the circumstances of the respective cases, are questions of fact to he determined by a jury. We cannot assent to the proposition contended for by the appellees, that the same trans-mission of notice of loss necessary to constitute due diligence on the part of the insured in this case, that according to <em>\u2018The Law Merchant/ </em>and an unbroken chain of decisions of courts of justice, is deemed due diligence by the holder of a bill of exchange or promissory note, seeking to charge those contingently liable for the payment thereof, viz: that notice must he transmitted to those sought to be charged by it, by the next mail after the dishonor of the bill or note. Such a rule, as an unbending principle of law, has not, and we think ought not, to be applied to contracts like that now before this Court.\u201d In the later case of <em>Providence Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>32 Md. 310, the Court said: \u201cThe construction of the terms \u2018forthwith\u2019 and \u2018as soon as possible,\u2019 in a similar condition in a fire policy, with reference to notice and furnishing preliminary proofs of loss, has been settled in this State by the decision in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Balto. Fire Ins. Co., </em>3 Gill, 187.\u201d As pointed out in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., supra, </em>and as indicated by the authorities cited by the appellants, there are cases in which the words \u201cas soon as possible\u201d may be given, and have been given a different construction, but in a contract like the one under consideration we think the construction given them in the prayers more in accord with the intention of the parties, especially in view of the statement in the contract of their understanding \u201cthat date of shipments are approximate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Second.\u2014The first prayer, as granted by the Court in connection with the defendants\u2019 first, second and fourth prayers, is not open to the objection urged by the appellants. If the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer had been the only instruction granted by the Court there would be force in the appellants\u2019 contention. But this Court has repeatedly said that in passing upon the instructions of the lower Court-, the granted prayers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>should he read together. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Staylor, </em>93 Md. 471; <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Tyng, </em>123 Md. 119; <em>Hochschild, Kohn &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>131 Md. 70. In the ease of <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Tyng, supra, </em>the Court said: \u201cObjection has been made by the defendant to the granting of the third and fourth prayers of the plaintiff, because of the fact that these prayers did not embody the contention of the defendant as to the cancellation of the contract by use of the long-distance telephone; but that aspect, of the case was fully covered by the 17th prayer of the defendant. Both parties were entitled to have their respective theories of the case presented to the jury by the instructions of the Court; had the defendant offered no prayers there would be force in the contention of the defendant that the granting of the third and fourth prayers of the plaintiff was a segregation of their case to the prejudice of the defendant; but inasmuch as. the defendant had offered, a prayer upon this very subject, the criticism now made of the plaintiff\u2019s prayer is. unsound.\u201d In the case a.t bar, the learned Judge noted on the plaintiff\u2019s, prayer that it was granted in connection with the defendants\u2019 prayers., the effect of which was. to call the jury\u2019s attention to the evidence relied on by the defendants, and to instruct, them that, notwithstanding they found the facts set out in the plaintiff\u2019s, prayer, if they also found the facts stated in the defendants.\u2019 prayers their verdict should be for the defendants. This method of instructing the jury is in accord with the practice in this State, and is recognized in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>120 Md. 47, and <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitehill, </em>104 Md. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Third.\u2014The third contention of the appellants, presents a somewhat different question. The facts stated in their first, second and fourth prayers, if found by the jury, would have constituted a complete bar to a recovery by the plaintiff, and it was not necessary in granting them to note on the prayers that they were granted in connection with plaintiff\u2019s first prayer. But as all of the prayers were to be considered by the jury together, the fact that the Court below noted on the defendants\u2019 prayers that they were granted in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s first prayer conld not have confused or misled tho jury, as the plaintiff\u2019s prayer limited the finding of the jury to \u201cthe issues joined on the first and second pleas of the defendants,\u201d while the defendants\u2019 prayers instructed them that if they found the facts therein stated their <em>verdict </em>should be for the defendants. While it was not necessary to note on the defendants\u2019 prayers that they were granted in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, and it did not tend to simplify the instructions of the Oourt, we would not, under the circumstances, be justified, in view of the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, in holding that the action of the Court misled the jury and deprived the defendants of the benefit of their prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">No special objection is urged against the other prayers of the plaintiff, and the defendants\u2019 third prayer is covered by the plaintiff\u2019s second prayer, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We have considered the ruling on the prayers notwithstanding the exception includes the ruling of the Court on the motion of the defendants to strike out certain evidence, and notwithstanding this Court has repeatedly called attention to the rule which requires a separate bill of exceptions for each ruling of the Court excepted to, the action of the Court on the prayers being regarded as a single act. <em>Morrow Brothers </em>v. <em>Arthur and Boyle, </em>134 Md. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">No question was raised in the Court below, or in this Court, as to the right to sue the Gosman Ginger Ale Company and William L. Straus together, and it follows from what has been said that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
