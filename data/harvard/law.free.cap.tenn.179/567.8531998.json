T. Grimes is sought. The will was executed in March, 1932. Grimes died in July, 1938. Meanwhile, June 1, 1932, he had married and his surviving\u2019 widow dissented from the will and has been awarded $3,000 as her year\u2019s support, $750 for her personalty exemption, and a dower interest in certain real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The validity of this will was sustained by the Court in <em>Grimes et al. </em>v. <em>Nashville Trust Co., </em>176 Tenn., 366, 141 S. W. (2d), 890, in which case, while finding that the testator had apparently forgotten its existence, or was under the impression that it had been destroyed, it was held that it had not been bindingly revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The need now for construction grows out of (1) the subsequent marriage and the widow\u2019s dissent, and (2) changed conditions in the testator\u2019s estate, due chiefly to the investment in real estate of a larg\u2019e proportion of the testator\u2019s estate which, when the will was executed, was in cash. Stating these changes more exactly, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>appears that when the will was executed the estate consisted of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">(1) Cash on deposit in Bank of approximately $33,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">(2) A house and lot at 303 Treutland Street, Nashville, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">(3) A 120 acre tract of land on the westerly side of the Dickerson Road in Davidson County, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">At the time of the death of the decedent on July 20, 1938, his estate consisted of the following items:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">(1) Cash in bank, $7,380.37; other personalty, made up of live stock and farm equipment and accrued rents, $4,193.29, a total of $11,573.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">(2) A 120 acre tract of land on the westerly side of the Dickerson Road in Davidson County, which he owned when the will was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">(3) A 207 acre tract of land on the westerly side of Dickerson Road, deeded to the testator on May 4, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">(4) A 216- acre tract of land qn the easterly side of the Brick Church Pike in Davidson County, deeded to the testator on May 4, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">The will provided first for payment of debts and burial expenses. Item Three reads: \u201cI direct that all Inheritance and Estate Taxes be paid out of my general estate.\u201d And Item Four, particularly pertinent for consideration at this time, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">\u201cI give and devise certain real estate as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-15\">\"Property at 303 Treutland Street, in Nashville, Tennessee, to A. M. Phipps,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">\"My property on the Dickerson Road near Nashville, Tennessee, to my grand-nephew, Gilbert Lowe; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-17\">\"My lot in Spring Hill Cemetery near Nashville, Tennessee, to my niece, Mrs. Elsie Lowe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">In Item Five the testator gives and bequeaths a total of $19,500.00', \"to be paid by my executor in cash,\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>fifteen, different named beneficiaries, in amounts of from $500 to $2,500', most of them described as relatives or connections by marriage. To one be gives $5,000', to another $2,500, to eleven $1,000 each and to two $500 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\">By Item Sis, be gives in trust to Nashville and American Trust Company, for bis grandnephew, Gilbert Lowe, to whom be bad devised, in Item Four, bis \u201cproperty on Dickerson Boad,\u201d the sum of $10',000, to be used for bis education and any balance to be paid over to him upon bis majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Item Seven reads</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cAll the rest and residue of my property of every kind and wheresoever situated, I desire to have distributed among my heirs at law the same as though I bad died intestate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The concluding item names Nashville and American Trust Company (now complainant Nashville Trust Company) as executor, with full powers of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The bill was filed by the Trust Company-executor and all interested parties were brought before the Court. The cause was heard on a stipulation of facts and the decree of the Chancellor was appealed from by Gilbert Lowe only, the beneficiary to whom the will devised \u201ccertain real estate,\u201d to-wit, \u201cMy property on the Dickerson Boad near Nashville, Tennessee,\u201d which the stipulation shows consisted, at the time of the making of the will, of 120' acres of farming land; and, also, bequeathed ten thousand dollars, to be held in trust for his benefit, he being then a minor. This favored grandnephew assigns a number of errors in this Court to the decree below, but on the brief of counsel, pages 6 and 7, learned counsel summarizes appellants\u2019 complaint stating it in the form of three questions, namely: (1) Does the lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>guage \u201cgeneral estate\u201d in Item Three of the will include both personalty and realty? (2.) Does Gilbert Lowe take only the 120 acre tract of land on Dickerson Road the testator owned when he made this will, or does he take also the 107 acres on Dickerson Road subsequently acquired and owned at the time of his death? (3) Is the residuary clause, Item Seven of the will, a valid testamentary disposition?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><em> </em>We are satisfied with the disposition the Chancellor makes of the first of these queries. We quote him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The word \u2018 estate \u2019 when unqualified is generally construed to embrace every description of property, and it is the conclusion of the Court, that the testator intended by the use of the term \u2018general estate\u2019 in his will, \u2022to include realty, and therefore intended to charge the payment of Inheritance and State taxes to the unde-vised realty and personalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cIn the case of <em>Latta </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>96 Tenn., 343 [34 S. W., 417, 31 A. L. R., 840], the Court in discussing compensation of disappointed devisees, uses the language, \u2018There being no general or residuary legacy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cSee <em>Gourley </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>34 Tenn. (2 Sneed), 387; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>[Cincinnati, N. O. </em>&amp; <em>T. </em>P.] <em>Railway Co., </em>133 Tenn., 1 [179 S. W., 375, Ann. Cas., 1917C, 1212]; and authorities cited in 69 C. J., 372.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">And see 69 C. J., pp. 981, 1173, 1174, 1176; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>86 Tenn., 464, 7 S. W., 126; Pritchard on Wills, Sec. 470; <em>[Rinehart </em>v. <em>Rinehart, </em>98 W. Va., 93, 126 S. E., 402], 42 A. L. R., 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">What we conceive to be the substantiaL and mainly controverted issue on this appeal is presented by the second query : Does Gilbert Lowe take under Item Four not only the property on Dickerson Road owned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>testator when he made the will, but also an additional tract of 107 acres, also located on Dickerson Road, subsequently acquired?</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The Chancellor looked to the language of the will, in the light of all the relative facts existing at the time of its execution, and the changes which took place before the death of the testator in his personal relations and the investment of his estate, and found that the intention of the testator was plain; that the property passing to Gilbert Lowe was that and that only definitely designated in the will; that the testator could not possibly have intended when -he made this will to include in the description \u201cMy property on the Dickerson Road\u201d property which he did not then own, and could not have foreseen subsequent ownership. , We think the Chancellor properly followed the rule that for the purpose of construction of the language describing property devised, the will must be considered as of the time of its execution. As was well said by Chancellor Cooper <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>1 Tenn. Ch., 621): \u201cThe plainest dictate of common sense would be, it seems to me, to seek the subject-matter of devise, and the object of benefit at the date of the will. And so are the authorities.\u201d So, in 28 R. C. L., Sec. 196, it is said: \u201cBut for purposes of construction a will must he considered in reference to th\u00e9 circumstances which existed at the time of its execution. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Appellant Lowe apparently relies chiefly, on Code, Section 8133, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cA will shall he construed, in reference to the real and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator; and shall convey all the real estate belonging to him, or in which he had any interest at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>decease, unless,a contrary intention appear by its words and context.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The argument is that, if the will is construed \u201cto speak and take effect as if it bad\u2019been executed immediately before the death of the testator,\u201d then Lowe would take the 207 acre tract in addition to the 120 acre tract, both fronting- on the Dickerson Road, under the language in Item Four, wherein the testator devised to him \u201cmy property on the Dickerson Road.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">This argument fails to give due consideration to the concluding language of the statute, \u201cunless a contrary intention appear by its words and context. \u2019 \u2019 And, as we have seen, the facts and surrounding circumstances may be looked to in arriving at this \u201cintention.\u201d This principle was aptly stated by Chief Justice Nicholson in his opinion in <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>53 Tenn (6 Heisk.), 489, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201cThe result of all the authorities may be stated to be, that notwithstanding all the nice distinctions which have been taken by the courts on the subject, we must come at last to the plain common sense question, what was the intention of the testator, as indicated by his language, viewed in the light of surrounding circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In <em>Nichols </em>v. Todd, 20 Tenn. App., 564, 570, 101 S. W. (2d), 486, 488 <em>(certiorari </em>denied by this Court), Presiding Judge Faw made the following comments on the statute under consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">\u201cSection 8133, <em>supra, </em>was enacted to alter the unyielding common-law rule that a will of real estate spoke as of the time of its execution, and real property acquired by the testator after the execution of the will could not pass thereby. See Annotation, 75 A. L. R., page 484 et seq. This was for the reason that, by the common law, \u2018a devise of realty was in the nature of a conveyance by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>deed, and only operated on lands of which the testator was seized when he made his will.\u2019 <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>73 Tenn. (5 Lea), 644, 655. See also, <em>Wynne </em>v. <em>Wynne, </em>23 Miss., 251, 57 Am. Dec., 139.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201cIn Tennessee, this common-law rule was modified by the Act of 1842, chapter 171, the fourth section of which act was as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201c \u2018That any estate, right, or interest in lands acquired by a testator, after making\u2019 of his will, and of which he died seized or possessed as aforesaid, shall pass thereby in like manner as if owned by him at the time of making of the will, if such clearly appear by the will to have been the testator\u2019s intention.\u2019 See <em>Wynne\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Wynne, </em>32 Tenn. (2 Swan), 405, 407, 58 Am. Dec., 66.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cLater, the common-law rule was abrogated by the second section of the Act of 1851-52, chapter 180, which was carried into the Code of 1858 as section 2195, Shan. Code as section 3927, and the Code of 1932, as section 8133, above quoted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">And in the later case of <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>22 Tenn. App., 239, 241, 242, 120 S. W. (2d), 993, 995 <em>(certiorari </em>denied by this Court), this was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u2018 \u2018 Under this statute many cases hold that a will speaks and takes effect as from the death of the testator, and not from its date, unless its language by fair construction, indicates a contrary intention. Among cases so holding are <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>96 Tenn., 369, 370, 34 S. W., 693, and <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>14 Tenn. App., 594.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\u201cIf, construing the will as a whole, a different purpose be disclosed, and it appear that the testator intended the objects of his bounty to be reckoned from the execution of the will, that purpose and intention will be controlling in ascertaining who those objects were. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hunt, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The question of the applicability of the rule of strict construction of the statute relied on for appellant has arisen most frequently where the person rather than the property intended in the devise was in question. But the applicable principle is the same. For example, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>96 Tenn., 369, 34 S. W., 693, where the devise was to \u201cthe children of my deceased sisters\u201d and brothers, which \u201cchildren now reside in Louisiana,\u201d this Court held that this designation of particular children intended controlled and the will was construed as of the making of the will, and not as of the death of the testator. The Court looked to see who were these particular \u201cchildren\u201d who at the making of the will resided in Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">So in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>it was held that a devise by a husband to \u201cmy dear wife\u201d applied exclusively to the individual answering this description at the date of the will, and not to an after-taken wife. Said Chancellor Coopeb:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cThe property in that item is devised and bequeathed, it will be noticed, to \u2018my dear wife.\u2019 And the solution of the question turns upon the point whether the will designates the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, or, in the absence of any positive language designating the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, is to be construed, so far as the object is concerned, as of the date of its execution or as of the date of the testator\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201cThe original intent of the testator, every one will concede at once, was to give the property devised to his then existing wife. The words \u2018my dear wife\u2019 point to a person then existing, the qualifying adjective necessarily implying affection for an individual. Such affection being, of course, inconceivable of a- person not then occupying the designated relation. To substitute another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>object of the testator\u2019s bounty, would be to violate his intent and to make a will for him. In the absence of all authority, I should consider it too plain for argument that the will does effectually designate the wife existing at the date of the will as the object of the testator\u2019s bounty as if she had been mentioned by her Christian name. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The rule appears to be that where a general descriptive term is used, such as \u00a3\u00a3my children,\u201d or \u00a3\u00a3my property,\u201d with obvious reference to definite existing persons or things, the description will be related and applied to the particular persons or things thus designated, and not extended to include other persons or objects subsequently coming within the general terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Applying this rule here, we have a devise of \u00a3 \u00a3 certain real estate, \u2019 \u2019 as follows: \u00a3 \u00a3. . . My property on the Dickerson Boad near Nashville, Tennessee.\u201d The stipulation shows just exactly what this \u00a3\u00a3property\u201d consisted of. Here is a definite designation of a specific thing. Viewing this will as a whole and in the light of all the circumstances surrounding its making, we think there can be no doubt that it was the intention of the testator to devise to this grandnephew this property, consisting of 120 acres, on Dickerson Boad, and that only.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The third question relates to the validity of the residuary clause which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cAll the rest and residue of my property of every bind and wheresoever situated, I desire to have distributed among my heirs at law the same as though I had died intestate.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The insistence of appellant is that this is not a valid residuary clause because the testator devised thereby the same estate that the beneficiaries would have taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>descent, that consequently the beneficiaries of this void clause take by descent and not under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">As said for the appellee, it does not appear that appellant has any such interest in this question (which, as said by the Chancellor, is largely academic, the result in either event.being practically the same) as entitled him to be heard on appeal. He is not an heir at law of the testator. See <em>Harmon </em>v. Harmon, 141 Tenn., 64, 206 S. W., 333; <em>Glosson </em>v. Glosson, 104 Tenn., 391, 58 S. <em>W., </em>121.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">All assignments are overruled and the decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
