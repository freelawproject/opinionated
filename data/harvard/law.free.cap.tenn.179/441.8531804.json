Justice DeHaven</author>\n<p id=\"Aig\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><em> </em>This is an appeal by McKinley Haskins from a conviction for petit larceny. It is contended that the trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment upon the ground, among others, that the indictment did not conclude with the words, \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State of Tennessee.\u201d The indictment does conclude with the words, \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d Section 12, Article VI, of the Constitution of Tennessee provides in part, as follows: \u201cIndictments shall conclude, \u2018against the peace and dignity of the State.\u2019 \u201d The indictment in this case is, therefore, in strict compliance with the constitutional requirement. Section 11623 of the Code provides that indictments shall conclude \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State of Tennessee.\u201d In adding the words \u201cof Tennessee,\u201d the Legislature went beyond the constitutional requirement, and the added words must, therefore, he construed as merely directory and not mandatory. <em>Grover C. Reed </em>v. <em>State, </em>(unpublished opinion) Knoxville term, 1941. In the case of <em>Paul Stallings </em>v. <em>State, </em>September term, 1933, in an unpublished opinion of this court, among other things, it was said: \u2018 \u2018 This indictment meets the constitutional requirement because it concludes \u2018against the peace and dignity of the State, \u2019 and these words are synonomous with and impart the same meaning as the conclusion \u2018against the peace and dignity of the State of Tennessee,\u2019 which is the only sovereignty that exercises criminal jurisdiction through the courts of Knox County. The omission of the words \u2018of Tennessee\u2019 could not therefore impair the validity of the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Our conclusion is that the trial judge did not err in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to quash, the indictment. We have filed a separate opinion, not for publication, dealing with the other questions made on the appeal and finding them to he without merit. The result is that the judgment of the trial court must he affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
