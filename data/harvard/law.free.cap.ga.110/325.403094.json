The employer is entitled to a reasonable time after the expiration of the sixty days to give this notice. What is a reasonable time is a question to be passed upon by the jury in the light of the facts of this particular case. <em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"AbhE\">\n<em>All the Justices concurring.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
