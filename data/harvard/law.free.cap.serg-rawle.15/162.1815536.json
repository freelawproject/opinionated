The plaintiff declared in his first count, on a promissory note drawn by <em>Charles </em>Miller, payable to the defendant or his order, and indorsed by the defendant to the plaintiff, who discounted it. This note was , Red <em>October </em>11 ih, 1819, for two hundred and forty dollars, at sixty days. It fell due the 18th of <em>December, </em>1819, and was protested for non-payment, and notice whereof was given to the defendant, the indorser. The second count was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>on a note for the same sum, drawn and indorsed by the same parties, dated the 14th of <em>December, </em>1819, due <em>February </em>15th, 1820. it was not paid, neither was it protested, or'notice of nonpayment given to the defendant. On the trial of the cause, it became a question whether the seeond note was in satisfaction of the first. The President charged the jury,that this was matter of <em>law, </em>that the second n\u00f3te was not a satisfaction or discharge of the - first, and therefore the plaintiff was entitled to their verdict on the first count.\u201d To this charge the counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-6\"><em>Miller </em>and <em>Lowber, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC0\">cited <em>Chilly on Bills, </em>371. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Becket, </em>13 <em>East, </em>187. <em>Brown v.

But if so accepted, it is a satisfaction. The <em>quo animo </em>it was accepted is matter of <em>fact, </em>which the cour|t cannot take to itself, and exclude the jury from the decision of it. The intent may often be deduced from circumstances, though nothing positive was expressed. We are of opinion, therefore, that the District Court erred in assuming, the determination of this point, as matter of <em>law. </em>It should'have been submitted to the consideration of the jury, whether the second note was accepted in satisfaction. The judgment is to be reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
