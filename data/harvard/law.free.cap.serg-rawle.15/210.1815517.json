There may be a delivery by words without acts, or by acts without words.- I shall put the case to the jury upon the mere question of intention. If <em>Tuttle </em>went to Mr. <em>Kittera\u2019s </em>office for the purpose of executing a release according to the provisions of the assignment, \u00e1nd, with the full intent of absolutely releasing <em>Thomas Williams, </em>and taking under his assignment, executed the paper in question on the 23d of <em>June, </em>1823, with the intention that such execution so made, without other or further act to be done, should be a complete and effectual release of <em>Thomas Williams, </em>no formal act of delivery was necessary; such execution under the circumstances amounting to a delivery in law. <em>Williams </em>was absent on a journey to <em>New-Orleans </em>until the <em>last </em>of <em>June, </em>or <em>first </em>of <em>July: </em>an actual delivery, therefore, could not be made or tendered to him on the 23d of <em>June; </em>nor is it necessary that there should have been such delivery, or tender, either to <em>Williams, </em>or to a third person for his use. The offer of the release to <em>Williams, </em>on his return from <em>New-Orleans, </em>was doing all that the law required of <em>Tuttle; </em>nor is the fact, that after the execution of the release, <em>Tittle </em>took it, and kept possession of it until <em>Williams\u2019s </em>return on the first of <em>July, </em>1823, otherwise material than as a circumstance for the jury, upon the question of <em>Tuttle\u2019s </em>intention at the time of its execution. If the execution of the release was intended to be complete, and was complete, on the 23d of <em>June, Tuttle </em>could not countermand it; and if incomplete, he was not in time on the <em>first o\u00ed July </em>to complete it. <em>Tuttle </em>as assignee of <em>Williams </em>had authority to accept releases from <em>Williams\u2019s </em>creditors; and the very release in question was drafted by <em>Williams\u2019s </em>counsel, and delivered to <em>Tuttle </em>at the time of the assignment, and together with the assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>ment </em>The fact, that <em>Tuttle </em>was an assignee of <em>Williams, </em>I consider a material circumstance in the cause, and differs his case from that of an ordinary creditor, executing a release in a similar way. I put this part of the case to the jury on the question of fact. As to the notes discounted at <em>Girard\u2019s </em>Bank, and not paid by <em>Tuttle </em>on the <em>first </em>of <em>July, 1823, </em>the defendants object, that he is not entitled to a preference. I, however, instruct the jury in point of law, that he is entitled to a preference for those notes: the fund created by this assignment was for his indemnity against the consequences of responsibilities he had incurred for account of <em>Williams, </em>and he was entitled to the fund to relieve himself from them; it-cannot be denied, that upon all those notes he had incurred, and was under complete legal responsibilities, which he had extinguished previous to bringing this action; being entitled to the fund, therefore, he may support the action to recover it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-6\">To this charge the counsel for the defendants excepted, and the court sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">The errors assigned in this, court were almost a literal copy of the charge of the court below, almost every word of the charge being excepted to; but in substance they may be.reduced to two points, viz:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">1.

The legal right of <em>Tuttle </em>to recover, depended upon his having executed a release in such a manner as the law recognizes; and his <em>intention </em>to execute a release, without actually doing it, is not sufficient. <em>Pierpont </em>v. <em>Graham, C. C. Penn. Dist. April, </em>1820, <em>M. S. Whart. Dig. </em>179, <em>No. </em>82. Where the grantee is absent, there must be a delivery to some third person for his use.

Sowell settled is this principle, that putting a deed upon record does not amount to a delivery. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>10 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>556. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>421. The whole doctrine of delivery is to be found in <em>Verplank </em>v. <em>Sterry, 12, Johns. Rep. </em>636, and the cases there cited. In the present case there was no delivery to the grantee <em>himselfi, </em>and if it be objected, that by his own act he had rendered it impossible, the answer is, that it might have been delivered to <em>Mudge </em>for his use; and by so doing, all chance of improper dealing with it, as circumstances might induce him, would have been avoided. <em>Tuttle, </em>however, kept it in his own pocket, and in his own power; and unless such a course be discountenanced by the courts, fraud will be the necessary consequence. In this case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>strong objection is, that <em>Tuttle </em>created a paper to be used or not, as occasion required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-6\">There was no discussion, or argument, as to the right of <em>Tuttle </em>to recover, founded upon the objection that the notes were unpaid on the <em>first </em>of July, 1S23.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-7\"><em>Ingraham, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APU\">The release of <em>Tuttle </em>bore upon its face all the marks of a deed regularly executed^ It had a seal, the signature of <em>Tuttle, </em>and of a witness; in whose presence it was stated in the usual terms to have been sealed and delivered. A foundation was laid for its going to the jury, by proof of the circumstances under which the three releases were prepared, and by proving the hand-writing of the subscribing witness, who was absent. This proof was alone sufficient to submit the deed to the jury, and from it, and the rest of the testimony, they had a right to presume a delivery, the essential ingredient of which is the <em>intention </em>of the party, without which, neither words nor acts, however solemn, a,re binding upon a jury. The error of the argument on the opposite side, consists in supposing, that the jury had no right, from facts proved, to presume the delivery of a deed. But the law is not so; the question properly being, whether the evidence is sufficient to go to the, jury at all, for if there be no subscribing witness, the jury may infer the delivery from proof of the hand-writing of the grantor. Formal delivery is never required to be proved; but any act evincing the intention is sufficient. <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>1 <em>Johns. Ca. </em>250; and even words, alone have been held sufficient, as being evidence of intention; nor is the doctrine new, that from the circumstances attending a particular case, a jury have a right to presume the delivery of a deed. <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Straphan, Cowp. </em>210. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>507; the last of which affords the strongest possible illustration of the principle. In <em>Shelton\u2019s Case, Cro. Eliz. </em>7, a deed was sealed in the presence of divers, and of the grantee himself, but not delivered, nor did the grantee take it, but it was left behind in the same place, yet it was held to be a good delivery in law. And in <em>Pigott </em>v. Holloway, 1 <em>Bin. </em>436, the witness said, he knew nothing of the execution of the deed, but that his name was subscribed to it in his own hand-writing, and from that, and other circumstances, he drew the conclusion that he must have witnessed its execution; the jury presumed a delivery in that case, though, as in this, there was an effort made to prevent their passing upon the question at all; the objection there, as here, being, that the execution was not sufficiently proved to goto the jury. The case of <em>Benn v. Mason, </em>1 <em>Coxe's N. J. Rep. </em>10, is very similar to- <em>Pigott </em>v. Holloway. The presence of the grantee was not deemed necessary in <em>Smith v. The Bank of Washington, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>318.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-8\">[Tilghman, C. J. Is there any case in which it has been left to a jury to presume a delivery, where the grantor retained the cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tody of the deed himself; because in the last case cited it was delivered to the cashier for the daughter\u2019s use ?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-6\">The case of <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>tried before Judge Stork, in 1824, in the Circuit Court, (since reported, 3 <em>Mason\u2019s Sep. 398,) </em>involved the very point; and though one of the grantors retained the custody of the deed, and the grantee was not present, nor any one on his behalf, yet the jury, upon its being left to them as a question of fact, presumed a delivery. But there is no occasion to go so far to support the release in this case; for <em>Tultlg </em>was, as assignee, the attorney-of <em>Williams, </em>by express appointment authorized <em>\u201c </em>to do all acts necessary in the premises,\u201d one of the most essential of which, for <em>Williams\u2019s </em>interest, was the acceptance of a release to him. -If this view of the case be correct, the charge was too favourable to the defendants below ; for the question was put to the jury, as to the .intention of <em>Tuttle </em>in such a way, as to place the <em>bonajides </em>of any secret view he <em>might </em>have had in the transaction, too exclusively, perhaps, before them. The true view of the question was, could <em>Tuttle </em>have got rid of this release, after executing it in the presence of three witnesses, one of whom subscribed the paper, the existence of which was known also to the counsel who prepared it? Uncertainly could not be heard to say, there was no execution, as against any one to be benefited by his act. Lord Eldon, (19 <em>Ves. </em>295,) cites the opinion <em>o\u00ed </em>Lord Mansfield, that where one has put his name to a sealed paper, he is estopped from denying its delivery. <em>Pierpont </em>v. <em>Graham </em>has no bearing whatever on this case. The question there was, whether the creditor was entitled to relief in equity, having in proper time offered to execute a release which ,the. trustee had promised to have prepared, but which was not prepared; no question certainly as to-execution, could arise in relation to a paper which never had existence; and the creditor clearly could not found an equity upon his own <em>laches, </em>it being <em>his </em>duty to prepare and execute the release, if he wished the benefit of it; and his own fault if he let the time pass by without executing any release at all.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> For this case the Reporters are indebted to E.

Theassignment was dated <em>March, </em>28th 1823; and the provision was, that none of the creditors \u201cshould have or receive any benefit or advantage under the assignment, unless within <em>three </em>months after its execution, and notice thereof for <em>thirty </em>days in two of the daily papers of the city of <em>Philadelphia, </em>they executed and delivered a complete release of all demands, &amp;c. to <em>William#, the assignor.\u201d </em>The assignees were <em>Edward Tuttle, </em>the defendant in error, <em>Enoch Mudge, </em>and <em>Benjamin Mien, </em>who were parties to, and executed the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The evidence of .delivery, as stated in the paper book, is, that when the assignment was made, there were also <em>three </em>releases prepared by the counsel who drew it, one of which, was delivered to each of the assignees; that <em>Tuttle </em>executed the release which was in his possession on the 23d of June, 1823, in the office of Mr. <em>Kittera, </em>and two of his students, and after the execution of it, put it into his pocket, and went away with it in his possession;-that <em>Williams </em>left the city of <em>Philadelphia </em>for <em>New-Orleans, </em>a few days before the 17th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1823, and did not return until <em>Sunday </em>the 30th' of June'following; that the said release was; offered on behalf of <em>Tuttle </em>to <em>Williams, </em>on the <em>first </em>of <em>July, </em>1823, and the latter refused to accept it; that the person who offered it to <em>Williams </em>got it from <em>Tiittle </em>for that purpose, and after the refusal returned it to him. The release of all the creditors claiming under the assignment, except <em>Tuttle, </em>was executed within the three months, and delivered to <em>Mudge, </em>with whom it remained. Notice was given within the <em>thirty </em>days, in the terms prescribed by the assignment, by the terms of which, <em>.Tuttle </em>was the first preferred creditor, but he had not, on the <em>first </em>of July, 1823, paid the notes which were indorsed by him, and discounted by <em>Williams </em>at <em>Girard\u2019s </em>Bank. The part of the charge excepted to, is contained in the <em>second </em>specification of errors assigned; that there was no delivery of the release of the 23d <em>June, </em>1823; and if there was error in that, the judgment must be reversed. The doctrine as to the proof of the delivery of deeds has much abated in its rigor of late years. Delivery is essential, but it is a matter of fact to be decided by the-jury. The court may decide, and reject the deed if the proof be altogether defective; but they may, and most frequently do, leave it to the jury. <em>Comm. of Berks Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, 3 Binn. 539. </em>At one time it was supposed that a deed could not be good without subscribing witnesses, because the delivery could only be proved by a witness who saw it delivered; but there is no general rule which has so many exceptions as this; for if there be no subscribing witnesses, the hand-writing of the grantor may be pi\u2019oved; or if the subscribing witnesses are dead, or cannot be found, are interested, become infamous, insane, or blind, proof of this hand-writing will be sufficient. The reasoning of the Chief Justice in <em>Long </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>72, is conclusive. He observes, \u201cthat subscribing witnesses of late are not necessary; it is enough if there was a sealing and delivery, and of that the jury were to judge, and upon proof of the hand-writing of the obligor, they may presume the sealing and delivery.\u201d The great difficulty in this case arose from the grantor keeping the deed in his possession; but in deciding questions of evidence, we must look to the subject matter, the situation of <em>the parties, </em>and the object of the deed. The rule has been .relaxed to suit the convenience of mankind. Rules of evidence are continually accommodating themselves to the exigencies of society, and in nothing is this more re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>markable, as we have stated, than in the case of proof of deeds. What is-now evidence of delivery, would not have been so fifty years ago. The jury are judges of the fact, of what is probable, and make their own deduction as to the fact of delivery. But even in days of the extreme rigor, no particular form of words or <em>acts </em>was required; for a deed might be delivered to the party himself, or to some stranger, for his use, without his authority; his assent precedent, or assent subsequent, was sufficient. In <em>Shelton\u2019s Case, (Cro. Eliz. </em>7.) the deed was sealed in the presence of the grantee, but not delivered, nor did the grantee take it, but it was left behind the parties in the same place, yet in the opinion of all the justices, it was a good grant, for the parties came for that purpose, and performed all'that was requisite for the perfecting it, except an actual delivery. So in <em>Alford </em>&amp; <em>Lea\u2019s Case (2 Leon. </em>110,) <em>Alford </em>brought debt upon a bond against <em>Lea, </em>and the case was, that the parties were bound one to the other, upon condition to stand to the award of B. and C., who awarded, that the said <em>Lea, </em>before such a feast, should make a release to <em>Alford, </em>but no place was assigned where the release should be delivered to the plaintiff. <em>Lea, </em>before the said feast, sealed a release according to the award, and delivered the .sam\u00e9 to one <em>Pine, </em>to the use of the plaintiff, who delivered it to one <em>Mason, </em>one of the servants of <em>Alford, </em>the plaintiff, who; two or three days after, offered it to <em>Alford, </em>who refused to receive it, but it was held, that the award upon this matter was well performed, notwithstanding the refusal of <em>Alford. </em>So <em>Tawe\u2019s Case, Dyer, </em>167, A. enseals <em>quoddum scriptum obligat. </em>and delivered the same to one C. to deliver it to the obligee, who delivered it accordingly as the deed of A.; the obligee refused to receive it, but afterwards got the obligation, and recovered upon it. If a man throws a writing on a table, and says nothing, and <em>the </em>other party take it up, this does not amount to a delivery, unless it be found that he put it there with an intention to deliver it as his deed, <em>Chamberlain &amp; Staunton\u2019s Case, </em>1 <em>Leon. </em>140. <em>Owen, </em>45. The question was fairly left to the jury, whether the release was executed with a full intent to come in under the assignment, or with a lurking design on the part of <em>Tuttle </em>to use it, or not to use it, according to circumstances. The deed purported to be sealed and delivered, and from that alone the jury might presume, and ought to have presumed a delivery. The circumstance of his keeping the release, was very different from the case of an obligor keeping the bond, for that would be inconsistent with a delivery. There was no one in this case to deliver the release to; for though <em>Williams </em>had bound himself, under his hand and seal, to receive the release, he went to <em>New Orleans; </em>so that it could not be delivered to him, after its execution, within the three months; it was offered to him as soon as he returned, which was a few days after the time had elapsed, and he refused to receive it. The releases, by the terms of assignment; were to be delivered to one of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>signees; each one had authority to receive them; forms were left in their hands by <em>Williams's </em>direction for. this purpose: the releases of the other creditors were delivered to <em>Mudge, </em>one of the assignees, whose own release must have been delivered to himself, and kept by himself; <em>Tuttle </em>was a proper recipient of the release under the assignment, at least, as proper as <em>Mudge. </em>If there is a circumstance by which the will of the obligor appears that, it should be delivered, and the obligee agrees to receive it, and the obligor considers and treats it as a deed delivered, a circumstance by which it shall be known that he treats it as his deed, without condition or explanation, it will be sufficient, and from- it a jury may presume a delivery. \u2022 By the trust deed, <em>Williams </em>agreed to receive the release of Tuttle, and that too, under his hand and seal. While the old rule was in force, that none but the witnesses could prove the fact of sealing and delivery, still, when they did nolappear, upon being subpoenaed, and the party produced .an indorsement upon the deed, reciting, that if he paid such a sum, the deed should be void, and acknowledging the said sum was not paid; this acknowledgment was held proof of the deed. <em>Dillon </em>v <em>Crawley, </em>12 <em>Mod. Rep. </em>500 If any circumstantial evidence could prove a sealing and delivery, nothing could be stroriger than the circumstances of this case, or better presumptive evidence to \u00e1 jury of the fact of delivery, and accordingly the jury have found, <em>that Tuttle did bona fide </em>intend by what he had done, to execute the release, and considered it, and treated it, as a release. If he had brought an action against. <em>Williams for </em>his original debt, <em>Williams </em>could have set up this instrument as a release; he could have proved its execution by <em>Tuttle, </em>who would not have been heard, against this public and notorious execution, to allege a mental reservation; and it is npt an immaterial circumstance, that immediately on <em>Williams's </em>return, the release was offered to him; and thereby acting, as he did, in the double relation of trustee and creditor, <em>Tuttle </em>would be estopped to deny it; and it ought to- be presumed to have been left in his custody by mutual consent. The proof would be on <em>Williams to </em>show that this deed, attested by <em>two </em>witnesses, as a deed sealed and delivered in their presence, was not the deed of <em>Tuttle; </em>to prove that there was no delivery, and that it was so understood at the time. An act so public and authentic as this, <em>could not </em>be qualified by any secret mental reservation. Whatever may have been the fact as to the custody of the deed, I do not think that it can alter its operation, provided it was duly delivered in the first instance, so as to'become valid in law. The inquiry into the subsequent history of the release tends to confirm <em>the </em>facts of scaling and delivery; for immediately \u00abpon the return of <em>Williams, </em>the release was offered to him, not by redelivery, or recreation, but as a deed delivered on the day it bore date. In <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>1 <em>Johns. Ca. </em>550, and <em>Soubervie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>v. <em>Arden, </em>1 <em>Johns. Cha. Rep. </em>240, it was held, that a <em>formal </em>delivery was not essential, if there be any act evincing the intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">I am therefore of opinion, that under the circumstances of this case, and, keeping in view the particular situation .of the parties, and the'public, authenticated execution of this paper, it was binding on Tuttle, and consequently a release delivered within three months. The charge with respect to the notes discounted at <em>Girard\u2019s </em>Bank was quite right; and in the main, the plaintiffs in error had no just reason to complain of the instruction given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b216-8\">Ro&amp;jeks and Huston, Justices, came upon the Bench after the cause was argued, and therefore gave no opinion,</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
