Williams </em>to make a transfer to the plaintiffs of thirty shares in the said bank. The deed of assignment under which the plaintiffs claimed, was dated the third of <em>August, </em>1822. On the 7th of <em>August, </em>the plaintiffs called at the bank, in company with Messrs. <em>Williams, </em>and asked permission to have a transfer made on the books of the bank, agreeably to th.e provisions of the act o\u00a3 assembly of the 21st of <em>March, </em>1S14, by which the company was incorporated. The bank refused permission, unless payment was made, or satisfactory security given for the amount of several promissory notes drawn by <em>T. </em>and <em>B. Williams, </em>and indorsed by <em>John Pray, </em>which had been discounted by the said bank, but had not fallen due at the time the transfer was demanded. It was understood, that at that time both the drawer and indorser of the notes were insolvent. This action was brought to recover damages, for the refusal to.permit the transfer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-14\"><em>J. R.

Until the statute 7 <em>Geo. </em>1, no creditor whose debt was not due could prove under a commission of bankruptcy, or claim a dividend. <em>Blackstone </em>defines a debt to be a contract, by which a sum of money is due. The act renewing this and other charters, passed the 25th of <em>March, </em>1S24, restricts the power of the bank to withhold a transfer to the case of a person indebted to the bank for a debt actually due and unpaid. This may be considered a legislative exposition of the former act. The construction contended for by the defendant is contrary to the custom and usage of banks. . It was proved, on .the trial, that it was customary, for this bank to make loans on actual security of stock expressly pledged, and also that it was the usage to permit tranfers and pay di vid' nds wheee the debt was not actually due. .

The plaintiffs have no equity to induce the court to strain the law. Indebted means a note discounted, but not due. <em>Johnson\u2019s Dictionary </em>defines indebted, <em>\u201c </em>having incurred a debt.\u201d All money <em>owing, </em>is a debt in the language of the acts of assembly. Article 6th speaks of the total amount of debts of the bank; and section 15th, of a yearly abstract of debts and credits of the bank, to be transmitted to the auditor general. By section 16, the legislature appoints a committee to ascertain the debts and credits of the bank. Surely all debts are included in this phraseology, though not actually payable. So, in the Insolvent Debtors\u2019 Act, of <em>March </em>26th, 1814, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>361, where the debtor is required to exhibit an account of his debts: and the court mky make an order to discharge him from all debts contracted and due. This has been construed to include debts not then payable. 3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>559. The language of the Intestate Act must receive the same construction. The act of <em>March, </em>1824, was an alteration, not an explanation of the act of 1814.. It was a new law, conferring a new charter. No usage has been proved, bearing on the case. The witness knew no instance where a stockholder had transferred after he had failed. The act, therefore, must be construed according to its words, under which we cohtend that the drawer of a note is indebted to the holder the moment he delivers the note. The clause was meant to benefit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Bank;.but the benefit is little, if the bank may not stop a transfer, on account of a note discounted, but not yet payable. One bound in a bond to pay, when <em>J. S. </em>comes from beyond sea: it is a debt presently. <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Sheffield, Cro. Jac. </em>254. A bond payable <em>in futuro, </em>is released by a release of all debts. <em>Cro. Jac. </em>300. <em>Yelv. </em>215, <em>S. C. </em>The drawer of a foreign bill is indebted from the date of the bill. 3 <em>Wils. </em>17. The statute 7 <em>Geo. </em>1, we takee.to be declaratory. It recites, that it hath been a question, and then goes on to enact. Not only in legal strictness, but in popular use one is indebted before the time of\u00bb payment. All our numerous assignments, in trust for the use of creditors, use it in this' sense. There is a marked distinction between the words of the act in. question, and those of the act incorporating the <em>Philadelphia </em>Bank, on this subject. In the latter, which was passed the 5th of <em>March, </em>1804, all debts due to the bank from a stockholder, days of grace being past, must be satisfied before transfer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-4\"><em>Chauncey, </em>in reply.-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzC\">When the act of <em>March, </em>1814, was passed, it was not. considered that a stockholder pledged his stock by obtaining discount. By section 9, these banks are required to make loans t\u00ab the amount of one fifth of the capital paid in to farmers, mechanics, and manufacturers for one year, taking security by bond, mortgage, or otherwise. The inconvenience would be great, if a stockholder who has given a note to a third person, which is by him discounted at the bank, shall be cut off from his dividends and right of transfer. <em>Indebted </em>is, it is true, a word of large import, hut may, if the subject requires it, be properly restricted to a debt actually due: on the contrary, if .the subject requires it, it may be include debts contracted but not actually due. Whatever may have been the case in the country, the city banks always took an express lien on stock when they meant to rely on it as security.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b138-6\">Tirghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agb\">The case depends on the eleventh fundamental article in the seventh section of the act of the 21st of <em>March, </em>1814, entitled \u201c <em>an act regulating banks.\u201d </em>This article, so far as concerns the present question, is in the words following: \u201cThe stock of each of the said companies shall be assignable and transferable on the books of the company only, and in such manner as the byrlaws shall ordain, but no stockholder <em>indebted to the institution, </em>shall be authorized to make a transfer, or receive a dividend, till such <em>such debt </em>shall have been discharged, or security, to the satisfaction of the directors, given for the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">It will be recollected that this act brought into existence forty banks, scattered through the state, and most of them out of the city of <em>Philadelphia; </em>so that, in a doubtful case, it would be wrong to give it a construction different from the common import of the words, in order to make.its provisions conformable to any supposed custom of doing business in the city. Indeed, no custom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>of the Mechanics\u2019 Bank, which can affect the present question, was proved,- so that I throw out of consideration all arguments drawn from that source. Where words have acquired a <em>technical </em>meaning, it is to be presumed that they are used in that sense, unless there be something in the statute which shows a contrary intent; for wherever the-intent of the legislature plainly appears, it governs the construction. But where words are not technical, their meaning is, in general, best ascertained by common par-lances. Laws afe made for the people, \u00e1nd should be expressed in language which they understand. Now the word <em>indebted </em>has not acquired a technical signification, and, in common understanding, means a sum of money which one has contracted to pay to another, whether the day of pajunent be come or not. Even in <em>law </em>language we speak of <em>debitum in prsesenti, solvendum in </em>futuro,\u2014a present debt, to be paid in a future time. So, in <em>act of assembly language, </em>a debt signifies money payable at a future time. For example,- the Intestate Law of the 19th of <em>%Upril,\\794, </em>section 14, enacts, that \u201c <em>all debts owing by any person within this state at the time of his </em>decease,\u201d shall be paid by his executor or administrator in a certain <em>order </em>prescribed by the said act. No man ever doubted that this <em>order </em>extended to all money which the intestate was bound to pay, whether <em>actually due </em>at the time of bis death or not. Suppose one who had drawn notes and circulated them, to a large amount, should make a voluntary transfer of his property before they fell due, could it be said that this was fair, because, at the time of transfer, he was <em>not indebted </em>on these notes? But let us consider whether there is any thing in the general policy of the act of <em>March, </em>1814, which should divest this word <em>indebted, </em>of its usual meaning. It is said by the counsel for the plaintiffs, that it would be extremely inconvenient, and hard, on stockholders, if (hey were to lose the right of making transfers, or receiving dividends, merely because they happened to draw or indorse a note, which was discounted in a bank, perhaps without their knowledge. That' an inconvenience might sometimes happen in this way, is .true; but it is believed not often, because the directors would not be apt to refuse permission to transfer, or withhold dividends in stock, unless there was danger of loss; besides, the stockholders derived no small advantage from the facility with which they obtained discounts on the faith of a lien on their stock. The question is, however, not whether stockholders might be put to inconvenience, but what was the intent of the law. Now, no doubt, this restraint on the transfer of stock was intended for the benefit'of the bank. But of what benefit would it be, if the stockholder had the unrestrained right of transfer, at atiy time before his note fell due? The time of making this loan, is that at which the directors must look out for security. If the stock was pledged by law, they might be easy as to other security. But if, trusting to this pledge, they discounted a stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>holder\u2019s note, who had the right to withdraw his stock at pleasure, then the security in fact amounted to nothing. To be sure, if it were clearly ascertained, that by <em>indebted </em>the law meant nothing but a debt <em>actually due, </em>the bank directors would have no right to complain; because they would know that the stock was no security, and therefore they must look well to the character and property, (other than stock,) of the drawers and indorsers, before a note was discounted, or demand an actual pledge of the stock. And indeed this is the actual situation of the Mechanics\u2019 Bank and many others incorporated by the same original act of <em>March, </em>1814, and rechartered by the act of the 25th of <em>March, </em>1824, entitled \u201c <em>An- Act to recharter certain Banks.\u201d </em>In this last act, the words of the eleventh fundamental article are strikingly different from those of the same article in the act of 1814. Instead of saying, \u201cno stockholder <em>indebted </em>to the institution,\u201d the expressions are, \u201c no stockholder indebted to the bank, <em>for a debt actually due and unpaid, </em>shall be authorized to make a transfer,\u201d &amp;c. This, however, was not intended as an <em>explanation </em>of the first law, but an <em>alteration, </em>in consequence of a change of policy. What occasioned this change of policy, it is unnecessary to inquire. This right of lien in the bank was brought before the court, in the case of <em>Rogers and others </em>v. <em>The Huntingdon Bank, </em>at <em>Chambersburg, October </em>Term, 1824, which will be reported in 12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>now in the press.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I will not undertake to be positive that the very point now in question was decided, but I am satisfied that it was in the mind of the court, and their opinion was in favour of the lien. In the present case, therefore, the plaintiffs had no right to a transfer, the notes of Messrs. <em>Williams, </em>(the owners of the stock,) which had been discounted by the bank, not having been paid, or security given for payment, and consequently this action is not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">There was a second count in the declaration, for money had and received, &amp;c.-, intended for the recovery of the dividends on the stock which fell due after the 7th of August, 1822. As the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of dividends stands precisely on the same ground as their right to receive a transfer, I have thought it unnecessary to say any thing particular on that head.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> Since reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
