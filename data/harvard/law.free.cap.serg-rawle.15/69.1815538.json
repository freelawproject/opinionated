On the 17th of <em>September, </em>1805, <em>Shryock </em>and <em>Brotherton </em>settled their administration account, on which there was a balance of thirteen hundred and thirty-eight pounds, nine shillings, and three pence,-due from them, to be distributed among the personal representatives of <em>William Glass, </em>Of this balance <em>Hetty M\u2018 Williams, </em>then a minor, for whose use this action on the administration bond was brought, was entitled to a portion, viz. one hundred and forty-six pounds. She arrived at full age, onthe22d of <em>July, </em>1817, and on the 27th of <em>November </em>following, came to a settlement with <em>Shryock, {Brother-ton </em>being then dead,) on which the sum of six hundred and forty dollars, was agreed to be due from <em>Shryock, </em>for which he gave his bond of the same date to the said <em>Hetty M\u2018 Williams, </em>payable with inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>est in twelve months from the date. Partial payments were made by <em>Shryock, </em>at different times, amounting in the whole to three hundred and eighty dollars and eighty-three cents; and the question submitted to the Court of Common Pleas, was, whether on these facts, <em>James </em>Jack, the security in the administration bond, was discharged. The opinion of the court was, that he was discharged.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-5\"><em>Dunlop, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP4\">contended that the plaintiff could recover on the administration'bond, notwithstanding his having taken <em>Shyrock\u2019s </em>bond. 8 <em>Serg. % Rawle, </em>110. 2 <em>Johns.

It is conditioned for the administration, of the estate of a deceased person. It is given to the Commonwealth for.the benefit of all persons interested. It was not affected by the circumstance of a new bond given by <em>Shryock </em>to one of the persons interested. <em>Hetty Ml Williams </em>had no power over the bond given to the Commonwealth, nor has she pretended to any power, nor undertaken to stop the suit on it. The taking of <em>Shryock\u2019s </em>bond was not a giving of time: it did not discharge the debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AkB\"><em>Crawford, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3e\">insisted, 1.

L</author>\n<p id=\"AW2\">Questions ofthis kind have been several times before us, and although we have expressed bur disinclination to extend the law in favour of sureties further than it has been already carried, yet we have always declared that we hold ourselves bound by principles that appeared to be well settled. One of these principles,' I take to be, that when the creditor, without the the privity of the surety, enters into an engagement with the principal, for extending the time of payment, so as to tie up his hands from bringing suit for a limited period, the surety is thereby discharged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Now, that is just the present case, for .certainly <em>Hetty. Mi Williams </em>would have been enjoined by chancery from bringing suit on the .administration bond before the time fixed for the payment of <em>Shryock\u2019s </em>bond to her. The acceptance of that bond amounted to an agreement not to proceed against the obligor, for the recovery of her share of <em>William Glass\u2019s </em>estate, b\u00e9fore the expiration of twelve months from its date. But, it has been objected, that the administration bond having been given, not to <em>Hetty M\u2018 Williams, </em>but the Commonwealth, for the benefit of all persons interested in the estate of <em>William Glass, </em>it was not in her power to suspend a 'Suit on that bond. It is very true, she could not have prevented others from suing; but she might make an agreement binding on herself. I find on the record in this case, an agreement, that this cause should be tried on its merits as if judgment had been obtained on the administration bond in the name of the Commonwealth, and then a <em>scire facias </em>had issued according to our act of assembly, for the recovery of the claim of <em>Hetty Mi Williams. </em>So that she has separated her case from that of'all others interested in the official bond of the administration. The whole transaction bears strong intrinsic evidence, of an intent to look to <em>Shryock, </em>and to him only. Otherwise the settling with him, and taking his bond, without consulting his security, is not to be well accounted for. At all events, the case comes within the range of numerous authorities. The law on this.subject was carefully considered in <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Smith, 8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>110.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">I have no doubt that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in* the case now before us, was right, and am therefore of opinion that it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
