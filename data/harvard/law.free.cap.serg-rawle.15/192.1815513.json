All the executors (except <em>John Lardner) </em>and the executrix, the said <em>Ann, </em>are dead. <em>Laurence </em>and <em>Lewis </em>died intestate, unmarried and .without issue, after the decease of the testator, and during the life of. the widow <em>Ann. John, </em>one of the said devisees, residing in <em>New-York, </em>made his last will and testament, dated on the 4th October, 1817, whereby he devised and bequeathed all the real and personal estate of which he was possessed, and to which he might be entitled according to the will of his father, the said <em>Reynold Keen, </em>deceased, after the death or marriage of his mother, to his sister <em>Julian Keen, </em>and his t.wo nephews <em>Laurence </em>and <em>John, </em>sons of his brother <em>Elisha </em>and their heirs for ever, and afterwards during the widow\u2019s life died, all the remainder of the testator\u2019s children, viz. <em>Elisha, Elizabeth, Lucy Ann, Ann Le Conte, </em>and <em>Juliana </em>are still alive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">The house in <em>Market Street </em>mentioned in the will pf the said <em>Reynold Keen, </em>was sold for the payment of the debts of the testator, and the surplus vested in bonds and mortgages, remains in .the hands of <em>John Lardner, </em>the surviving executor, ready to be divided as the court shall decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">.The first question for the. court is whether there was such an, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>interest in the house and the proceeds of the sale thereof, in <em>John Keen, </em>as enabled him to dispose of the same by his will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\">The second question for the court is, whether there was such a right vested in <em>John Keen </em>as to enable him to dispose of any part of the real estate of <em>Reynold Keen, </em>deceased.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1u\"><em>P. </em>\u00ab4?. <em>Browne, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlRh\"><em>John </em>had not. a present devise, but the devise was a contingent limitation; and consequently he had nothing to transfer by his will. There must be a devisee <em>in esse </em>when the interest is to vest. <em>Bret </em>v. <em>Rigden, Plow. </em>345. The insertion of the word heirs, will not strengthen the case. From the whole will, it is evident that-the intent was that the estate should not vest in the life of the widow. 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>83, 84. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>1 <em>Ca. in Eq. </em>216. <em>Tit. dev. No. </em>5.

A devise of rents, issues and profits is a devise of the house itself. 1 <em>Burr. 228. Hayward </em>v. <em>Whitby, </em>is the very case before the court. 3 <em>Com. Dig. </em>415, 16. <em>Tit. devise, No. 2. </em>Lease of land at 10 pound rent, a devise of the rent carries the land. \u2022 Here my position is, that this was a present devise of the house to the wife and children, for support of children. 2 Vern. 561. 2 <em>Stra. </em>1020. <em>Kerlin's Lessee </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>175, is very like the present. The distinction is between legacies and devises.\u2014The first, is governed by the civil and ecclesiastical law. 4 <em>Bac. </em>394. 2 <em>Vern. </em>673. 2 <em>Vent. </em>342. Even a legacy bearing interest is vested. 2 <em>Eq. Ca. Abr. </em>543. If any of these children had left children, it never would have been the intention of the devisor to disinherit them; yet they must be so on the construction of the plaintiff. 1 <em>P.

There the court held it a vested devise. The words tenants in common could make no.difference. The words are applicable to those who survive the father. The general intention was t0 provide for his offspring, and the Court will modify all minor intents. The testator has not himself given a-construction different from mine: he only empowers the wife to accelerate the time of enjoyment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-10\"><em>Browne, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARoX\">Here the whole property is not devised with a particular interest devised out of it.

But we may safely rule this cause on the authority of <em>Goodtitle </em>v. Whitby, (1 <em>Burr. </em>228,) which is in point. There the devise was to trustees to apply'the rents and profits to the maintenance and education', of the testator\u2019s nephews during their minority, and <em>when, </em>and <em>as </em>they should respectively attain the age of twenty-one, then to the use and behoof of the said nephews and their heirs equally: And this was held to be a present devise to the nephews, chiefly on the authority of <em>Boraston\u2019s Case </em>(3 <em>Rep. </em>210) which contains a rule that will be found to govern every case of the kind; namely, that where an absolute property is given, and a <em>particular </em>interest is given <em>in the mean time, </em>that circumstance shall not operate as a condition, but as a description of the time when the remainderman is to take in possession: and Lord Manseiexd remarks that this is sufficient to answer the intention of the testator, the devisee not wanting the estate in the mean time. In the case before us the devise is to the testator\u2019s widow for life, or during widowhood, in trust to apply the rents and profils to the maintenance and education of the testator\u2019s children, and to the suppdrt of herself; and on her death or second marriage, he devises the -premises to'the children and their .heirs respectively, share and share alike. The devise is then, in trust, for the children and the widow in the mean time: and according to <em>Boraston\u2019s </em>case, this is a present devise to the children along with the widow. They are even beneficially interested in the trust, which is to apply the profits to their maintenance and education: ,and a devise of the profits is a devise of the land. <em>(Kerry </em>v. <em>Derrick, Cro. Jac. </em>104.) It is true there is a beneficial interest given to the trustee; whereas in <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Whitby </em>there was none;..but the difference is disposed of by the rule in <em>Matthew Manning's </em>case (8 <em>Rep 95. </em>b.) according to which the interest of the trustee is to be considered only as an exception out of the absolute property given to those who are the chief objects of the testator\u2019s bounty. But what puts his intention out of all doubt is the authority given to the widow, if she shall think fit, to divide the \\estate among the children in her life time, and <em>before </em>her second marriage. From this it is evident he intended that only the time of enjoyment should be postponed till the happening of one of the contingencies; and it is beside incredible that he should have intended to disinherit the issue of any of his children who might happen to die in the life time of the widow, and before her second marriage. The point is not new;- but cases like the present have frequently occurred in this country: as <em>in Kerlin's Lessee </em>v. <em>Bull </em>(1 <em>Dall. </em>175.) <em>Doe v Provoost, </em>(4 <em>Johns. </em>61.) and <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Enslin &amp; Ray, </em>(2 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>554.) I am of opinion- then that the- widow took an estate for life in trust for the purposes declared in the will, with \u2022a vested remainder to the children in fee, as tenants in common: &amp;Rd that the judgment be rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
