Judgment was rendered in his favor. He relied upon a written contract with the defendant. The contract in part is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">\u201cNew York, Nov. 14, 1904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201cMr. S. O. Wallach: I hereby engage you as my salesman for the year 1905, and for your loyal and exclusive services as such I agree to pay you $50 per week. I will advance your traveling expenses when on the road for me, not to exceed $60 weekly. All money so advanced, including compensation, are charged to your account, against a commission on net amount of sales at the rate of 7% per cent., etc. * * * I also agree to give you a bonus of $250, if your sales for the year 1905 will amount to $50,000 net. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cJ. P. Slater.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">' \u201cS. O.

Hence this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs, on the authority of Isaacsen v. Andrews, 64 App. Div. 408, <em>72 </em>N. Y. Supp. 177; Schlesinger v.
