The plaintiff sought to recover the value of certain goods which the defendant, as a carter, was to bring to him from the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The goods were brought to plaintiff\u2019s store about 9:30 p. m. At that time plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9 refused to receive them. They were then brought to the store the next morning. The driver would not deliver the goods until he got a receipt and his pay. Plaintiff would not agree to this. The defendant then took the goods away and stored them. Hence this suit for the value of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">Defendant interposed a counterclaim for his charges and storage, amounting to $32.18. The right to this counterclaim' was based upon section 10 of a city ordinance; but no ordinance was proved, as required by section 941, Code Civ. Proc. So far as we can discover, no court takes judicial notice of a corporation ordinance. Porter v. Waring, 69 N. Y. 250. Nor was there the least proof of any counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-20\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
