In their bill of particulars plaintiffs itemize their damage as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">Oct. 29, 1906, to Jan. 1, 1907, 9 weeks, at $12 per week...............$108 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">Sept. 17, to Oct. 29, 6 weeks, unpaid $2.............................. 12 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">Findings supplied by plaintiffs on garments........................ 1 92</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">Total ...................................................... $121 92</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The answer is practically a general denial, except that it admits that \u201csome understanding\u201d was entered into between the parties, and it counterclaims $37 by reason of an alleged failure of plaintiffs to do the work given to them by defendant. One of the plaintiffs took the stand and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\u201cI worked some time before for the Lennox Company [defendant] on a small, salary, and he [Kahn, defendant\u2019s manager] calls up on that day [September 17, 1906] and made an agreement for $12 a week up to January 1st for alterations, pressing, and sewing, and to hold off $2 each week up to January 1st on account that we should not break the contract. The defendant said, as to the findings to be supplied on the garments, that we are supposed to.be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">A memorandum written on defendant\u2019s letter paper was introduced in evidence, which is conceded to be signed by defendant\u2019s manager, which memorandum reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">\u201cSept 17, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">\u201cWe hereby agree to pay Mess. Graff &amp; Frankel the sum of thirty (30) dollars, two (2) dollars extra each week, from this date until Jan. 1, 1907, if said Graff &amp; Frankel continue to do all our work (alterations, pressing, etc.) satisfactorily during said time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">\u201c[Signed] Lennox Clothing Co., Isidore Kahn, Mgr.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">Plaintiffs further showed that they worked about four weeks after September 17th, were paid $10 a week, but were supposed to get $13, defendant taking off $3, and that defendant refused to give more work, although plaintiffs were ready and willing to do the work. At the end of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony the court dismissed the complaint for failure of proof, without prejudice to the bringing of another action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>As the complaint was dismissed on plaintiffs\u2019 evidence alone, that evidence is entitled, not only to belief, but to all favorable inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. While the testimony cannot be_ regarded as entirely satisfactory, we think plaintiffs made out a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The counsel for the appellants states that the reason given by the justice for dismissing the complaint was that tire plaintiffs had not affirmatively shown that they had tried to find other employment and had been unable to find any. If this were the reason for the dismissal, the learned justice fell into error. The plaintiffs were not bound to show affirmatively, as part of their direct case, that such employment was sought and could not be found. It was for the defendant, as part of the defense, to show either that the plaintiffs had found \u00e9mployment elsewhere, or that other and similar employment had been offered and declined, or that such employment might have been found. In an action to recover damages for the breach of a contract, the, plaintiff is, prima facie, damaged to the extent of the amount stipulat-' ed to be paid. Howard v. Daly, 61 N. Y. 362, 371, 19 Am. Rep. 285; Milage v. Woodward, 186 N. Y. 252, 78 N. E. 873. The court, in the case of Milage v. Woodward, supra, further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201cUpon the breach by an employer of a contract of employment by discharging the employs before the expiration of his term of service, the latter is only bound to use reasonable diligence to procure other employment of the same kind, in order to relieve the employer as'much as possible from a loss consequent upon the breach. He is not bound to look for or accept occupation of another kind. Fuchs v. Koerner, 107 N. Y. 529, 14 N. E. 445. -It is clear that the defendant did not sustain the burden of proof resting upon him to show that the plaintiff found or could have found employment elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We think, in the interests of justice, a new trial should be granted. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs' to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
