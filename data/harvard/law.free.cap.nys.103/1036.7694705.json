J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmUu\">The evidence in this case supports the finding of the learned trial justice that the property in question has been damaged during the period of six years prior to the commencement of the action by reason of the inadequacy of the sewers maintained by the defendant to carry off the waters occasioned by ordinary storms.. The damages awarded are not excessive. The plaintiff\u2019s proof of ownership of the premises, however, was not very clear. On the argument of the appeal, the plaintiff produced and put in evidence a full-covenant warranty deed of the premises affected, recorded in the year 1896, conveying the premises to him. No objection was made to the reception of the deed, nor was any suggestion made that the record could be answered or changed. The record furnishes additional evidence, if such additional evidence is necessary in order to sustain the judgment. See Dunford v. Weaver, 84 N. Y. 445; Day v. Town of New Lots, 107 N. Y. 148, 13 N. E. 915; Dunham v. Townshend, 118 N. Y. 281, 23 N. E. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-20\">The point raised by the appellant, that the injury was occasioned by the faulty connection between the plaintiff\u2019s premises and the sewer and by the absence of proper check valves to prevent the backing of water from the sewers, is disposed of by, the decision, of this .court m the case of McCallister v. City of New York, 115 App. Div,-, 100 N. Y. Supp. 1127, where a similar question was raised and necessarily decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-23\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-24\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
