' The complaint alleged, in general terms, that plaintiff was hit by flying rock and splinters scattered by the explosion through the carelessness and negligence of the defendant and his agents or servants, and particularly because of the failure of defendant to make and enforce proper rules for the safe conduct of such work and by the negligence of the person employed by the defendant to superintend the same. The defendant moved that the plaintiff furnish a bill of particulars, setting forth his claim as to whether the defendant was personally in charge of the work, or whether it was in charge of a servant, and, if so, who such servant was or what position he occupied, and in what particular the blast was improperly fired, and of what the negligence therein consisted, and what rules would have been made for the greater safety of the work. The motion was denied, and the order of denial is attempted to be sustained on the ground that the defendant knew as much about the cause of the accident as the plaintiff, \u2022 and. possibly more.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">This answer does not meet the situation. 'The question in applications of this kind is, not what may have been the actual facts, nor the knowledge of the opposite party concerning them, but rather what the aggrieved party claims them to be. What they claimed to be is the issue that is to be met and tried; and where the pleading is not specific in this regard a bill of particulars is properly ordered to point out such claims aqd thus make definite the issues to be litigated. It is not the office of a bill of particulars to expose to his adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the evidence of the party giving it. The purpose of such a bill is to amplify the pleadings and to indicate, with more particularity than is ordinarily required in a formal plea, the nature of the claim made, in. order that surprise upon the trial may be avoided and that the issues may be more intelligently met. Slingerland v. Corwin, 105 App. Div. 310, 93 N. Y. Supp. 953. We think the defendant was entitled to know what the plaintiff will claim upon the trial respecting the following matters: Whether the work of blasting was under the personal charge of defendant at the time of the accident, or in charge of an employ\u00e9, and his name or a description \u00f3f him and his duties; 1 in what claimed negligent manner the blast was fired, or from what claimed negligent cause; what rules should have been made for blasting or warning; or what existing rule was disregarded temporarily or habitually. To this extent the order for a bill of particulars should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The order is reversed, without costs, and the motion granted as indicated, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
