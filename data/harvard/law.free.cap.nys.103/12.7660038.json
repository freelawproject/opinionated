The defendant has not yet answered. The complaint sets up the contract in ipsissimis verbis, and alleges the acceptance of two deliveries thereunder, and upon certain specific dates the refusal by the defendant to accept three other duly tendered deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">In American Credit Indemnity Co. v. Bondy, 17 App. Div. 328, 45 N. Y. Supp. 267, this court held that, where no answer has been served, a motion by the defendant for. a bill of particulars, on the ground that it was necessary for his defense, must be denied, as it cannot be said that a defense will be made until an issue is raised by the service of an answer; and it was further held that such an order would not be granted to enable the defendant to answer, where he was wholly ignorant of the particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, inasmuch as Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 500, permits him to deny any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the allegations of the complaint. That \u25a0case was followed upon both points by the Appellate Division in the Second Department in Hicks v. Eggleston, 95 App. Div. 162, 88 N. Y. Supp. 528, and Schultz v. Rubsam, 104 App. Div. 20, 93 N. Y. Supp. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>It follows, therefore, that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and. the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
