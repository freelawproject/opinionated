The issues in regard to the proper factum of the will and testamentary capacity are those involved in the case in the Supreme Court of Wyman v. Wyman, 103 N. Y. Supp. 64, in which the opinion was handed down herewith. The trial in the Surrogate\u2019s Court came on after the trial in the Supreme Court, and upon practically the same evidence the learned surrogate reached the same con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>elusion as that arrived at\u00fan the Supreme Court, namely, that the will had been duly executed, published, and declared, and that the decedent had testamentary capacity, and refused to revoke the decree admitting the instrument to probate heretofore made.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">For the reasons stated in Wyman v. Wyman, 103 N. Y. Supp. 64, the decree of the surrogate was right, and should be affirmed, with costs against the appellant, Lorsch. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
