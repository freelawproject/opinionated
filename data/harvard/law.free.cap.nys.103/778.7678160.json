The proposition most strenuously contended for by the appellant is that the complaint should have been dismissed because of the failure on the part of the plaintiff to prove any demand. Decisions in other jurisdictions are relied upon in the appellant\u2019s brief, but the rule in this state is that, as between the maker and the holder, a promissory note payable upon demand is due forthwith.

The only effect of qualify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ing a promise to pay by a mere specifying of demand at a fixed time and place is that if the debtor is ready with the money at that time and place, and no demand is made, he is exonerated from paying costs and interest for subsequent time, provided he keeps ready, pays the money into court when sued, and pleads these facts in his answer.

Y. 360; Abbott\u2019s Forms of Pleading, vol. 1, p. 221, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The defense that the plaintiff was not the real party in interest was set up, but was not substantiated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
