O\u2019Kell, one of its employ\u00e9s, to make the collection, and that such employ\u00e9 received from the debtor, the West Machine Works, four checks in varying amounts to make up the full amount of the debt; that each of said checks was drawn to the order of plaintiffs, under their firm name of Morris, Wheeler &amp; Co.; that said employ\u00e9 wrongfully, and without its or plaintiffs\u2019 authority, indorsed all of said checks by forging plaintiffs\u2019 name and depositing them to his individual credit with the Colonial Trust Company; that the latter collected the whole of the $640, and paid the same to said O\u2019Kell; that subsequently plaintiffs demanded of the trust company the said amount, and, failing to receive it, brought an action against said trust company to recover the same; that afterwards the action was settled, and plaintiffs were paid by the bank $443.20, and they executed to the trust' company a general release, which contained this reservation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">\u201cThis release to be without prejudice to the rights of Morris, Wheeler &amp; Co. (plaintiffs) against the North American Mercantile Agency Company (defendant).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">The release is set out at length in the supplemental answer by way of a \"second separate and complete defense,\u201d and the plaintiff demurred thereto. The demurrer was sustained, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">While the defendant has urged upon us with much plausibility that, if it is deprived of the defense conferred by the release, it will be remediless as against the Colonial Trust Company, we are not inclined to agree with the views' so expressed. When the account was sent to the defendant for collection, it had the same effect as if it had been a note or draft, and the defendant occupied the same relation to plaintiff as a collecting bank usually holds, and therefore, when plaintiffs discovered that their funds had been diverted from the proper source, it had the right to follow the same in whosesoever hands they might be found. Bank of Clark &amp; Co. v. Gilman, 81 Hun, 486, 30 N. Y. Supp. 1111, affirmed 152 N. Y. 634, 46 N. E. 1145; Bank of America v. Waydeli, 103 App. Div. 25, 92 N. Y. Supp. 666; Salen v. Bank of State of New York, 110 App. Div. 636, 97 N. Y. Supp. 361. The funds were traced into the hands of the Colonial Trust Company, and a compromise was effected, followed by the execution of the release. If the liability of the defendant to plaintiffs was contractual, and joint with the Colonial Trust Company, the right to make the compromise without releasing the defendant is undoubted, under section 1942 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On the other hand, if the liability rests in tort, the release of one joint tort-feasor, where a ri\u00b0rht to proceed against an-ther is preserved. has the effect of a covenant not to further proceed against the one released, but preserves the liability as against the one expressly exempted from its provisions. Gilbert v. Finch, 173 N. Y. 455-466, 66 N. E. 133, 61 L. R. A. 807, 93 Am. St. Rep. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">The defendant is a stranger to the release, and is not affected by it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Its right to proceed against the trust company that received the avails of the checks is coextensive with that of plaintiffs, and if the trust company paid only a part of the claim, and the defendant shall be obliged to pay the residue, it may proceed against the trust company to recover the balance of the fund not paid by it.' This privilege does not necessarily mean a right to subrogation, nor, indeed, of contribution; but, as already seen, it arises from the very fact that the trust company received the funds unlawfully, of which the defendant, as collecting agent, could no more be deprived than could the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
