He testified that he informed the president of the defendant in June, 1904, that he had entered into a contract to go into the service of another newspaper at the end of his service with the defendant, that he intended to stay out his contract with the defendant, that he would not break it, but .asked him to release him from it, as it would be a loss of $10,000 to him to carry it out; that the said president told him (in substance) he would lose nothing By staying, that a bonus of $10,000 would be given him by the defendant at the end of his service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-18\">B. served out his time, and this action is to recover the said $10,000.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b336-19\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

There was no consideration for the agreement to pay the additional $10,000 at the expiration of the term of service, the promisee being already bound by the written contract to serve for the time and the yearly salaries therein fixed. Tolhurst v. Powers, 133 N. Y. 460, 31 N. E. 326; Arend v. Smith, 151 N. Y. 502, 45 N. E. 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">There is no room for the claim that the doubtful meaning of the contract (if it were doubtful) in respect of the amount of the salaries <em>to </em>be paid (\u201cnot less than,\u201d being the phrase) furnished a consideration for the new agreement as a settlement of a dispute. It suffices that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>it was made on no such basis. On the contrary, the employe claimed no right to an increase of salary, and assured the defendant\u2019s president in advance that he did not intend to quit service under the contract. To keep him from quitting unless his salary were raised was therefore not the consideration for the new agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">The new agreement being oral was also void under the statute of frauds, for that it was not by its terms to be performed within one year from the making thereof. It was made in June, 1904, and was not to be performed until October 20th, 1905. If it could be said that the employ\u00e9 performed under it, it would be void just the same. If he would have any right of action it would not be on the void agreement, but on a quantum meruit. Erben v. Lorillard, 19 N. Y. 299. The statute of frauds creates a rule of evidence, and he could not prove the new agreement at all for lack of writings. Cases where the contract was carried out by both sides, like Kramer v. Kramer, 90 App. Div. 176, 86 N. Y. Supp. 129, have no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">That the terms of the written contract are that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was to be paid \u201cnot less than\u201d the salaries specified in such contract, presents no different case. Those were the salaries to be paid unless the parties agreed upon larger ones, and such new agreement would still have to be a valid one under the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Judgment unanimously affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
