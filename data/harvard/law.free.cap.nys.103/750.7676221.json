The plaintiff\u2019s wife went to the defendant\u2019s drug store and asked for something to wash out a wound or cut which her husband had received on his knee. The clerk gave her a small bottle bearing the words, among others: \u201cPoison. Carbolic Acid.\u201d She took this home and applied it to the wound. The result was that the kne\u00e9 was burned, and turned black, and caused serious trouble. Upon chemical analysis the solution was found to contain between 86 and 90 per cent, of carbolic acid. Two questions are presented: (1) Was the the act of selling the preparation, under the circumstances shown, one that would have constituted legal negligence if done by the defendant himself, instead of his clerk? <em>(2) </em>Is this a case where the employer should he held responsible for the act of his clerk?</p>\n<p id=\"b790-22\">On the first point it has been held in this state that a druggist is liable in negligence for damage caused by the sale of poisonous medicine without proper label or instructions. Wohlfahrt v. Beckert, <em>27 </em>Hun, 74, .affirmed, <em>92 </em>N. Y. 490, 44 Am. Rep. 406. In the present case there can be little question that it was a negligent act for .the druggist to sell a solution of carbolic acid of such strength. Section 67\" of the Sanitar}'- Code prescribes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201cNo phenol, commonly known as carbolic acid, shall bo sold at retail by any person in the city of New York, except upon the prescription of a physician, when in a stronger solution than 5 per cent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-3\">It was conceded on the trial, by the defendant\u2019s attorney, that no druggist has a right to furnish such acid of a stronger solution than 5 per cent., unless accompanied by the prescription of a doctor. But, aside from such prohibition of the Sanitary Code, we do not think there can be any doubt that it is an act'of negligence for a druggist, when asked for a solution to wash a wound, to sell a preparation of such a dangerous character as was furnished in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">On the question whether the act of the clerk is chargeable to the defendant there is little room for doubt. The general rule is that an act done by the servant in the prosecution of the business that the servant was employed by the master to do is chargeable to the master. Cosgrove v. Ogden, 49 N. Y. 255, 10 Am. Rep. 361; Schultz v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 89 N. Y. 242. That this rule applies in the case\u2018of the preparation and sale of drugs has been held in this and other states. Thomas v. Winchester, 6 N. Y. 409, 57 Am. Dec. 455; Norton v. Sewall, 106 Mass. 143, 8 Am. Rep. 298. In the former of the two cases just cited the defendant was held liable for injuries flowing from the act of his assistant in business in putting up belladonna, labeled as \u201cdandelion,\u201d, which, through the medium of several intermediate dealers, was ultimately sold to the plaintiff and used by her, to her serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">It is suggested by the appellant that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, but we see no ground for any such contention. The plaintiff had a right to suppose that the defendant and his employes would perform their duty with care, and, when applied to for some solution to wash a wound, that they would furnish something, if not efficient, at least harmless, and was warranted in applying it without further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
