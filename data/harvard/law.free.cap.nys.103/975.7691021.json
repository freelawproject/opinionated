Section 46 (Laws 1899, p. 1593, c. 712) requires that if there has been paid to the city, town or village for the tax year, \u201cunder any agreement therefor, or under any statute requiring the same, any sum based on a percentage of gross earnings, or any other income, or any license fee, or any sum of money on account of such special franchise, granted to or possessed .by such person, copartnership, association or corporation, which payment was in the nature of a tax,\u201d all amounts so paid shall be deducted from the tax. In this there are two inconsistent phrases applied to the payments mentioned, the one \u201cunder any agreement therefor,\u201d and the other \u201cin the nature of a tax\u201d (if the latter refers back to the former), for that which is paid under an agreement is not of the nature of a tax. A tax is an exaction of sovereignty, and not something derived from an agreement. This inconsistency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>and lack of scientific precision affects the interpretation of the statute. It cannot be said that only sums paid as taxes may be deducted, for the statute classifies sums paid under agreement as taxes\u2014which they may be in a loose sense\u2014and directs them to be deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"AEJf\">The relator runs its cars across the Brooklyn Bridge under an agreement with the city requiring it to pay a toll of 5 cents the round trip for each car. This payment is within the meaning of the statute, provided the relator\u2019s contract right to such use of the bridge is a special franchise. Inasmuch as the state has treated it as such and assessed it, it is not open to the city comptroller to refuse to make the deduction on the ground that it is not. If the tax is to be imposed and collected the deduction must be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The order should be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Order modified, in accordance with the opinion of GAYNOR, J., and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
