The appellant contends that the omission of the street number rendered the summons absolutely void, and that no jurisdiction was acquired by the service of the summons upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">The summons filed with the judgment roll contains the office address of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which was omitted in the summons served upon the defendant. It further appears that the defendant had actual knowledge of the office address of the attorney for the plaintiff, and' he retained the summons from the 17th day of May, 1906, to the 3d' day of November, 1906, a period of'almost six months. The omission-of the street number does not constitute a jurisdictional defect. It is an irregularity. Wiggins v. Richmond, 58 How. Prac. 376; Hull v. Canandaigua Elec.
