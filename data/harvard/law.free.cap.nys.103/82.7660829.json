The court below denied the motion, not upon the merits, but solely, as stated in his order denying the same, upon the ground of want of power. In this the \u2022court below was clearly in error. There has been a failure to distinguish between the case of Lefenfeld v. Adler (Sup.) 99 N. Y. Supp. 799, and cases like the case at bar, where the defendant is clearly in default and has a right to have it determined whether or not he is \u2022entitled to his day in court. In the Lefenfeld Case the plaintiff appeared upon the adjourned day and asked for a further adjournment. This was refused, and the complaint dismissed, and as Mr. Justice Leyentritt very properly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">\u201cThe judgment of reversal was not the result of the nonappearance of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-19\">In that case there was nothing for the trial judge to do, having refused an adjournment, except to dismiss the complaint, and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was to either sue again, or appeal from the judgment upon the ground that such adjournment was one to which he had a legal right. In the case at bar the defendant, it is true, appeared and .asked for an adjournment, which was refused, and thereafter an inquest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>was taken; the judgment thus rendered being one rendered upon the defendant\u2019s default. The respondents\u2019 attorney alleges in his brief that the defendant\u2019s attorney remained in court during the inquest, and after its conclusion moved for a stay of execution, and therefore cannot be considered as having been in default. This does not appear by the record. One of the affiants states that he was informed by his clerk that a \u201cfew days\u2019 stay had been granted,\u201d and the affidavit of the clerk says that the court, after hearing the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses, gave a judgment for $468, \u201cat the same time saying that the execution be stayed for five days to enable us to make a motion,\u201d and this statement is not disputed in the opposing affidavit.' The proceedings and testimony taken upon the trial are not made a part of the return, and it nowhere appears in the record that the defendant in any way appeared after the refusal to grant the adjournment asked for, but suffered an inquest to be taken.. The moving affidavits, together with the \"affidavit of merits, presented sufficient grounds for opening the defendant\u2019s default, and the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Order reversed, and new trial ordered, upon payment of $10 costs in the court below and the defendant stipulating that the judgment stand as security until the final determination of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
