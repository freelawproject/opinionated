There . was no affidavit of the plaintiff submitted with the motion, the plaintiff depending upon the allegations of the complaint. As the proof before the trial court showed that the plaintiff was never a customer of the defendant, that she had never made any application to be supplied with gas, and that defendant had never supplied her with gas, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>and never threatened to cut off any gas, it was improper to continue the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application for an injunction denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
