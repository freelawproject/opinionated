The first claim made by the appellants is that such an assignee has no standing to obtain a discharge of the liens. The statute only expressly authorizes the discharge upon the application of the contractor, but the courts have held that it should be construed as authorizing a discharge upon the application of an assignee of the contractor, who stands in the shoes of the original contractor. Sections 18 and <em>22, </em>Mechanic\u2019s Lien Law (Laws 1897, c. 418, pp. 523-525) section 20 (Laws 1898, p. 318, c. 169); Matter of Hudson Water Works, 111 App. Div. 860, 98 N. Y. Supp. 33. See, also, Hawkins v. Mapes-Reeves Construction Co., 82 App. Div. 72, 81 N. Y. Supp. 794. . It is claimed that the decision last cited does not authorize an assignee of part of the fund merely to make the application. We are of opinion, however, that either an assignee of the entire contract or an assignee of part of the moneys' due thereunder, should be permitted to obtain the funds upon giving the undertaking required by the statute. It is not conceivable that <em>z.ny </em>one can be prejudiced by such course, and an assignee of part of the fund is quite as much within the spirit of the statute as an assignee of the contract. The point is that the person claiming to be entitled to the money earned under the contract, may obtain it upon giving an undertaking to protect the other claimants. The undertaking, upon the giving of which the court is authorized a discharge of these liens, however, does not conform to the statute. The order merely requires an undertaking \u201cconditioned for the payment to each lienor, respectively, of any sum found clue on account of said lien, to the extent that the said sum shall be found to have priority over and above the lien, if any, created by the said assignment of Flood &amp; Ryan to the Twelfth Ward Bank.\u201d If the assignee of the entire contract, or the assignee of part of the moneys due thereunder, wishes to obtain the benefit of the statute, and have the liens canceled and receive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>money, he must take the same responsibility that the original contractor would have been obligated to assume, which is to give an undertaking for \"the payment of any judgment which may be recovered in an action to enforce the lien.\u201d Lien Law, art. 1, \u00a7 20, subd. o (Laws 1898, p. 318, c. 109). This would of course, make the bank and its surety responsible for the debts of third parties; but if it wishes to obtain the moneys, it must assume that responsibility, for it is only upon executing such an undertaking that the original contractor, who would have been liable to the lienors, was entitled to obtain the fund. The authority of the court to discharge such a lien by motion is wholly statutory, and therefore the discharge may only be granted on complying with the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">It follows that the order should be modified b)r requiring an undertaking in the language of the statute, and, as modified, affirmed without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
