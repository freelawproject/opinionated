In opposition to the motion the affidavit of Chester A. Robinson, an attorney employed by the defendant in the action, was read, wherein it was set forth that the plaintiff was guilty of laches in delaying to move to have the case restored to the day calendar; that the moving affidavit was insufficient, in that no reason was given for the long delay. The motion was denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">While the plaintiff has been very slow in his prosecution of the action, still no motion has been made by defendant to dismiss the complaint on that ground, nor is there any claim that defendant has been prejudiced by the delay. We think the plaintiff, under the circumstances, should be allowed his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">The order is reversed, without costs to either party, and with leave to the plaintiff to make another application in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
