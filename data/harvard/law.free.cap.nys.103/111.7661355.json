Plaintiff was removing dirt from the floor and conveying it in a basket out on a platform in'front of the house, and workmen were over him. He was directed by the defendant\u2019s foreman to do this work, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>assured there was no one at work overhead; that the workmen engaged on the upper floor had gone for the day. Upon 'this assurance of safety he continued, his work, and while at work received the injury. The appellant only claims that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, but he fails to note that the plaintiff had an absolute assurance of his safety, and thus the defendant is liable. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
