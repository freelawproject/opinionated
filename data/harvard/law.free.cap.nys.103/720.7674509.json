[L. SJ \u201cBertha Brasch. [L. SJ\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXq1\">It was shown upon the trial that Jacobi had failed to account for-various sums collected by him, and judgment was rendered for the aggregate of the sums so misappropriated. On behalf of the defendant surety it was urged upon the trial, among other objections,, that no demand had been made before suit brought. In support of the proposition that no demand was necessary the plaintiff cites Wilson v. Field, 27 Hun, 46, Krause v. Rutherford, 37 Misc. Rep. 382, 75 N. Y. Supp. 773, and Epstein v. U. S. Fidelity Co., 29 Misc. Rep. 295, 60 N. Y. Supp. 527; but the two former actions were upon the customary form of undertaking given on procuring an order of arrest,, while the latter was on the form of such undertaking given on procuring an attachment, neither of which forms of undertaking provides for any demand. In this case, on the contrary, there is an express provision for a demand; and not only on the general rule that the contract of a surety should be construed strictly in his favor, but also because of the nature of this case, such requirement should be-enforced. Until demand was made, the surety would have no means of knowing how much the misappropriation amounted to, or, indeed, that there had been any misappropriation. As was said by this court in Packard v. Long Island R. R. Co., 52 Misc. Rep. 98, 101 N. Y. Supp. 660;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">\u201cWhen, the fact upon which the defendant\u2019s liability depends is within the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, notice should be given to the defendant before bringing the action\u201d\u2014citing Cole v. Jessup, 2 Barb. 309, Bunn v. Lett, 65 Hun, 43, 19 N. Y. Supp. 728, and Wangler v. Swift, 90 N. Y. 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">The respondent attempts to argue that the failure of the defendant to plead a want of demand was a waiver; but, in the view I take oL the contract, the proof of such demand was a part of the plaintiffs5' case. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants-to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
