It is shown by the moving papers that on Monday defendants\u2019 attorney was actually engaged in the trial of a case in the Supreme Court in Brooklyn. In view of the fact that the court had before it an unfinished case, and another case ready for trial, which was actually tried, and of the fact that the defendants\u2019 counsel was actually engaged in a trial in the Supreme Court, the case should have been marked \u201cReady,\u201d and a default ordered when the cause was actually called for trial, if the defendants were not ready to proceed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">In McEwen v. Dimond, 81 App. Div. 626, 81 N. Y. Supp. 365, and Goodness v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 49 App. Div. 76, 77, 63 N. Y. Supp. 476, the facts are not the same as in this case. In the latter the case appeared on the day calendar for trial on January 8th, and was adjourned from day to day, on account of the engagement of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, until January 19th, and during that time the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on account of whose engagement the case was postponed, tried three other cases. The counsel then went into the trial of other cases, notwithstanding that this case had been held on account of his engagements. In the former, the case before the one in which default was taken, and which was thought to be ready for trial and would be tried, was not tried, and the case in which default was taken stood next upon the calendar, and was immediately reached. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>trial court insisted that it should either be-tried or go over the term, and the plaintiff, having no other alternative, took an inquest. In view of all the circumstances disclosed by the printed papers on appeal, the inquest should not have been ordered until the case was actually reached for trial and the defendants defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The order of January 17, 1907, granting the motion made by the defendants to be relieved from the default, should be modified, by striking out so much thereof as allows costs to the plaintiff, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs in this court to either of the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
