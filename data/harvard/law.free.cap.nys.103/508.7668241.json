If this agreement was made as claimed on behalf of the defendants, then the plaintiff was not entitled to recover what the services were reasonably worth, but was necessarily limited by the terms of his contract to 25 per cent, of the recovery. It is true that the defendants refused to attend the trial of the actions, but that was after the plaintiff had refused to proceed under the contract as claimed by the defendants, and they had refused to proceed with the actions because of plaintiff\u2019s repudiation of the contract as claimed by them. If the defendants were right in their contention, they were under no obligation to-continue the services of the plaintiff, and had incurred no liability for what he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">We are clearly of the opinion that questions of fact were presented by the evidence which required the case to be submitted to the jury,, and it was error to direct a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
