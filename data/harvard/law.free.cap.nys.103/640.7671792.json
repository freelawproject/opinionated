Co. (decided herewith) 103 N. Y. Supp. 638. There is a slight difference in the form of the exception, which in this case is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\u201cIt is a condition of this policy that this company is not liable for any loss or damage to an automobile, any of its parts, or its contents, Insured under this policy, caused by fire originating in the automobile itself.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">It seems to me that the reasonable construction of this clause, as in the \u00bfEtna Case, is that the exception is to relate to a fire the exciting cause of which .proceeds from the .vehicle itself, and not from the outside. That this was the constr'uction that the insurance company itself gave to this policy is shown by the fact that the assured warranted that the filling of the reservoir of an automobile was to take place by daylight only; for, if the exception covered a fire caused in consequence of the ignition of this gasoline in any other way, except in the interior of the machine, such a warranty would have been quite unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">\"It follows that the judgment appealed from is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except CLARKE, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
