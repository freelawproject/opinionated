The answer was a general denial. The action was tried before a jury, and at the trial, after he had delivered his main charge, the justice was requested by the defendant\u2019s counsel to charge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-17\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that in a penal action of this kind the laws of evidence require that the plaintiff prove his case, not by a preponderance of evidence, as in an ordinary negligence case, but beyond a doubt, as\u00edn a penal case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">And the court said, \u201cI so charge, beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d to which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel noted an exception. It ought hardly be necessary to cite any authorities to show that such instruction is erroneous. The decisions in the recent cases of Kurz v. Doerr, 180 N. Y. 88, 72 N. E. 926,105 Am. St. Rep. 716, and Wood v. Wyeth, 106 App. Div. 21, 94 N. Y. Supp. 360, settle the rule conclusively that in a civil case the plaintiff rests only under the burden of proving his case by a preponderance of evidence, and not beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-21\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
