The relator was removed without an opportunity of making an explanation, and the grounds of his removal were not entered upon the records of the department of the office in which he had been employed, nor was a copy thereof filed with the state civil service commission. The relator claims upon this appeal that he held a position in the classified civil service and subject to competitive examination, and was entitled before his removal, under the provisions of section 21 of the civil service law (chapter 370, p. 809, Laws 1899), to an opportunity of making an explanation, and to have the grounds of his removal entered upon the records of the department, and a copy filed with the state civil service commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">It is necessary that the relator show in his petition that he held his position lawfully and had passed the examinations required to make his appointment legal; for, if he had not done so, he was an officer de facto only, and had no title to the position. People ex rel. Hanna v. Board of Health, 153 N. Y. 513, 47 N. E. 785. The only allegation in respect to his right to hold the office is that on \u201cthe 1st d\u00e1y of January, 1903, your petitioner was duly appointed to the position of assistant deputy sheriff by the then sheriff of the county of Kings,\u201d was assigned to duty, and immediately entered upon a discharge of the duties of his position, and continued therein continuously up to the 1st day of January, 1906. The only allegations of the relator\u2019s affidavit or petition, which are taken to be true, are the allegations of fact that are undisputed, and any allegation contained therein which is a mere conclusion of law should not be considered. People ex rel. Corrigan v. Mayor, 149 N. Y. 215, 43 N. E. 554; Knapp v. City of Brooklyn, 97 N. Y. 520. And, inasmuch as the answering affidavits dispute the initial right of the relator to hold the office, observance of this rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>important. The statement that the relator was duly appointed is a conclusion of law, rather than a statement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with costs. All concur; JENKS, J., however, being of the opinion that the court could and should have granted an alternative writ. (</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
