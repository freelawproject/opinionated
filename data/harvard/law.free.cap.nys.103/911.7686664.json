It is alleged that the several transactions were made without consideration and with a continuing intent to cheat and defraud creditors. Brinkerhoff v. Brown, 6 Johns. Ch. 139; Wood v. B. &amp; F. Co., <em>92 </em>Hun, <em>22, </em>37 N. Y. Supp. 885; Porter v. Inter Bridge Co., 163 N. Y. 79, 57 N. E. 174. As a pleading simply we hold it to be good.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs, with leave to defendant to-withdraw demurrer and to answer within 20 days, upon payment of costs, in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
