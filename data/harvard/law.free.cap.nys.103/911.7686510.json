Our order of which a review is sought was made on the 11th day of January, 1907. The ensuing term of this court began on the fourth Monday of February, 1907, and ended on March 22, 1907. The present term began, on the third Monday of April, 1907. If we could grant this motion, we would do so, but our view is that we lack the power. Our power was spent with the lapse of the January and the March terms (Porter v. International Bridge Co., 163 N. Y. 79-85, 57 N. E. 174), and we cannot now by an order nunc pro tunc \u201cdo indirectly\u201d what we are \u201cforbidden to do directly\u201d (Guarantee Trust Co. v. P. R. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co., 160 N. Y. 1, 54 N. E. 575).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">For this reason, the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">Motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
