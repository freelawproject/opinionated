We think that the motion to open the default should have been granted. On the day before the inquest was taken defendants\u2019 counsel had been notified to go on with the trial of a case in the Supreme Court on the next day (19th December). It also appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>defendants\u2019 attorney had to answer a motion on the calendar of part 1, Special Term, of the Supreme Court on the 19th. In view of these facts, we think the motion to open the default should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The order denying the motion to open the default and vacate the judgment is reversed, with costs to appellant to abide the event. The appeal from the judgment is dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
