The answer is, first, a general denial; and, secondly, for a separate and distinct defense, the defendant alleges, in substance, that the plaintiff agreed that, if the defendant would withdraw an appeal which he had taken from a judgment in favor of one Dattelbaum, who was the plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law, the plaintiff would render any and all services in an action to be brought against one Joseph Rundback and one Edward Rundback to recover the amount of said judgment, and would assist in any suit that had been brought or was about to be brought, without any charge whatsoever, and that, relying upon the said agreement and having entered into the same with the plaintiff, the defendant caused said appeal to be withdrawn, and that the serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ices mentioned in the complaint were \"the services performed under that agreement. The employment of the plaintiff and the value of his services were admitted upon the trial. Evidence was adduced <em>by </em>the defendant to establish the separate defense set up in the answer, and at the conclusion of the case the following requests and exceptions were noted in the record;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I ask your honor to charge that the burden of proof Is upon the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201cThe Court: I so charge. (Exception.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I ask your honor to charge that, if the testimony is so evenly balanced that they cannot tell who has the greater weight of the evidence, then the defendant is entitled to a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\u201cThe Court: I so charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I except. I ask your honor to charge the jury that the burden of proof as to the separate agreement is on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">\u201cThe Court: I decline to so charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I except.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">I do not think these rulings can be sustained. .The plaintiff\u2019s case was made out when he proved his retainer, the rendition of his services, and their value. It was then incumbent upon the defendant to establish his separate defense, namely, that the services were to be gratuitous in the event of the defendant\u2019s complying with the plaintiff\u2019s request to withdraw the appeal from the judgment against plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law. It was error to refuse to charge, as requested By the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that the burden of proof as to the special agreement was on the defendant. Merzbach v. Mayor of N. Y., 163 N. Y. 16, 57 N. E. 96; Smith v. L. I. Ry., 102 N. Y. 190, 6 N. E. 397, As was said in Merzbach v. Mayor of New York, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">\u201cThe jury were instructed, in substance, that the burden was on the plaintiff to establish an agreement that he should be paid; whereas, they should have been instructed that the burden'was upon the defendant to establish an agreement that he was not to be paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Eor the reasons above stated, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
