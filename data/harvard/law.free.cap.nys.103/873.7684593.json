If, on the contrary, it is in tort, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The complaint alleges the title to the personal property in the plaintiff .under a promise by defendant to deliver it upon demand. Demand was made and refused. It is clearly a case where possession by the defendant until demand made was rightful, but the detention after demand is wrongful, and it amounted to a conversion at the election of the plaintiff. The title to the personal property in question is placed in the plaintiff by the allegations of the complaint, with the right of possession upon demand. It must be apparent that a refusal to surrender possession as an incident to the title constituted conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, with costs, and demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to defendant to amend within 20 days after entry of order and payment of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
