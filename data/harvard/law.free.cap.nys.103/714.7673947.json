Defendants swear that at this interview, subsequent to the stoppage of payment, plaintiff told defendants that he had only advanced \u201c$10 in drinks\u201d on the check. Be that as it may, it is cle_arly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>established that the check was valid in its inception, and that plaintiff took it without knowledge of any equitable defenses that defendants might have as against Berkowitz\u2019s right to payment of the check. Whether Berkowitz sold the check for its face value, or less, is no concern of the defendants; and plaintiff has shown himself by uncontradicted evidence to be a bona fide holder and entitled to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
