The trial court excluded the contract, because it was not the contract of the corporation. It was signed by the president and the vice president of defendant, although not in their representative capacity. In the body of the instrument it was, however, recited that they were acting in the capacity of the president and vice president of the defendant, and .that their act in entering into the contract was \u201con the exclusive account\u201d of the defendant, which act they had been legally authorized to perform. The contract should have been received in evidence. The agreement was a simple contract, and did not require the corporate' seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
