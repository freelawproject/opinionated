The application was opposed, but, notwithstanding that fact, it resulted1 in the order appealed from, 'which appointed a receiver of \"the publication and sale of the song \u2018He\u2019s a Cousin of Mine\u2019 \u201d during the pendency of the action, and' authorized the receiver during that time to publish and sell the composition;, ordered and directed the officers, directors, and agents of the defendant to deliver to the receiver the plates, books, memoranda, statements,, papers, and documents relating to the publication and sale of such composition; also restrained the defendant, its officers, and agents from in any way interfering with the receiver in the sale of such composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The order appealed from must be reversed. There is no legal principle of which I am aware by which it can be sustained. The action is not brought for a dissolution of the partnership or for the sale of its property. There is no authority which justifies the appointment of a receiver of partnership property unless the partnership has been terminated, or there has been a breach of the partnership agreement or other cause which justifies a dissolution. In case of the death of one partner, the survivor must wind up the business, pay the debts, and distribute the assets among those legally entitled thereto. During the lives of the partners, the business must be conducted by them, and cannot be taken out of their hands, unless facts be shown justifying a dissolution and sale of the partnership property. Here a dissolution and sale is not asked, and, so far as appears, is not desired. What the plaintiffs want is an accounting and payment of whatever may be found due them, and not a fact is alleged which would justify even an inference that the defendant is not responsible or able to respond to any judgment which plaintiffs may recover. There is nothing in the moving papers to show that the defendant has done, threatened, or is about to do any act which would injure the. plaintiffs or render in any degree ineffectual a judgment which might be obtained, or during the pendency of the action injure or depreciate to any extent the partnership property. Under such circumstances a receiver could not be appointed, or the defendant restrained from carrying on the partnership business.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Before the defendant could be enjoined from doing that which the agreement gave it the right to do, the plaintiffs were bound to show that the defendant, unless restrained, would do some act during the pendency of the action which would produce injury to the plaintiffs, or that it had threatened to do some act in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 rights, incident to or connected with the subject-matter of the action. Clark v. King &amp; Bro. Pub. Co., 40 App. Div. 405, 57 N. Y. Supp. 975; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Other errors are alleged, but it is unnecessary to. consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
