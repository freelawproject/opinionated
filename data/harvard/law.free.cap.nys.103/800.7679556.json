The premium paid was based upon an assumed aggregate compensation which it was calculated would be paid to the employ\u00e9 during the period. The policies contained a further provision that, if the compensation actually paid should exceed the sum estimated, then the assured should pay an additional premium, while, if less, the company would return a portion of the premium. The action is brought upon the theory and upon the claim that the compensation actually paid greatly exceeded the amount estimated as the basis for the premium which the company received at the time the policies were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>There was a sharp issue upon the trial as to what employes were covered by the policies and as to what was embraced under the word \u201ccompensation\u2019\u2019 used in the policies\u2014whether the compensation of officers and the office staff and the like, or whether only outside employ\u00e9s. This issue was presented in the pleadings, as well as litigated upon the trial. It therefore became important that the exact forms of the policies should be before the court. Upon the trial it was stated by the defendant\u2019s counsel, in response to a notice to produce\" the policies of insurance in suit, that the originals had been destroyed by the defendant after the expiration of the periods specified in them. The plaintiff produced what it claims were copies. Its own witness, Phelan, stated that it was the practice of the company to issue policies according to the applications submitted by the one seeking insurance, and that the original applications were sent on from' the New York office, from which these policies were issued, to the home office of the company at Hartford. These original applications were not produced upon the trial, nor was there evidence by any one who had made a comparison that either the alleged copies of the applications retained\" in New York or the alleged copies of the policies which were produced at the trial conformed to the original applications in Hartford. In the absence of these prerequisites, the admission of these papers in evidence was unwarranted (Nichols v. Kingdom Iron Ore Company, 56 N. Y. 618); and, as proof of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action rested entirely upon them, there was thus no legal proof of the same. . In this view, the justice should have rendered judgment that the action be dismissed without prejudice to a new action (Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. 1561, c. 580, \u00a7 248); but, instead of doing so, he gave judgment absolute in favor of the defendant. This he clearly had no right to do, and, since we must render judgment according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors or defects which do not affect the merits (Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. 1583, c. 580, \u00a7 326), we think that the judgment should be modified, by directing that the dismissal be without prejudice to a new action, and affirmed, as so modified, without costs of this appeal to either party. _</p>\n<p id=\"b841-33\">_ Judgment modified, by directing that the dismissal be without prejudice to a new action, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
