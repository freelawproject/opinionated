He called no witness. He was between 14 and 15 years of age at the time of the accident. On his own story, it is questionable that any negligence of the defendant was shown. The motorman testified that the plaintiff suddenly came from behind a wagon. The driver of the wagon (an ice wagon) and his helper testified that the plaintiff was riding without leave on the rear step of the wagon, and when they made him get off he went in front of the car suddenly, and was hit. Another disinterested witness corroborated this. There was no reason for disregarding the testimony of these witnesses. The verdict was plainly against the weight of evidence and should have been set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-19\">The judgment and order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur, except HOOKER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
