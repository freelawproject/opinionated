The trial justice rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the balance of $162.85, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove delivery of several of the items in the bill of' particulars. Whether such motion was well grounded or not at the time it' was made need not be considered, because the defendant in his testimony admitted the receipt of cigars in the precise amount sued for, thus bringing the case within the rule that a defect in the proof existing at the time of the making of a motion to dismiss is cured by evidence afterward adduced by either party.

Supp. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Aside from the point just considered, there is no question in the case, \u2022except one of the weight of evidence; and upon that question we find no reason for differing with the conclusion reached by the trial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
