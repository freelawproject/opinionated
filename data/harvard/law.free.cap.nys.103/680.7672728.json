There is no pretense or suggestion that defendant has rendered himself liable to pay double commissions, and he, conceding his liability to one or the other of the claimants, but unable to, determine between them, and unwilling to do so at his own risk, asks to interplead them, paying the sum claimed into court, and leaving the rival claimants to litigate over it between themselves. There is good reason and ample authority for granting his motion. Rasines v. Ives, 85 App. Div. 483, 83 N. Y. Supp. 228; Dreyer v. Rauch, 3 Daly, 434; Shipman v. Scott, 12 Civ. Proc. R. 109; Bickart v. Hoffmann (Com. Pl.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 472. We find no foundation in'the papers for the claim that, in any legal sense, the appellant has. disputed the plaintiff\u2019s claim. At the most he has expressed only ,an opinion that it is not well founded. This is not sufficient to defeat his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 .costs, upon the payment into court by defendant of \u00a1the amount claimed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
