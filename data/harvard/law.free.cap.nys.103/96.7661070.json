The order of the Appellate Term affirmed the judgment of the City Court, and granted leave to the defendant to withdraw his demurrer and plead over within six days upon payment of the costs \u201cin this court and the court below.\u201d Thereupon the plaintiff served a bill of costs and gave notice of taxation thereof. Upon such taxation the defendant appeared and objected to several of the items, some of which were allowed and some disallowed. Subsequently the defendant moved for a retaxation, and upon such motion asked to have disallowed the following items :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">Oosts before notice of trial............................................ $25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">Motion costs......................................................... 10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">Oosts on demurrer............................... 20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">Oosts on affirmance............. 40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">Serving summons and complaint........................................ 2</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The defendant\u2019s objections to the taxation of the foregoing items are, first, that the plaintiff is stayed by an order entered on September 25, 1906, which awarded the defendant $10 costs against the plaintiff, which costs the defendant avers have never been paid. The order of the Appellate Term was made on November 14, 1906. The case appeared upon the October, 1906, calendar, and was noticed for argument by the defendant. By thus serving a notice of argument he waived any stay then existing. Reeder v. Lockwood, 30 Misc. Rep. 532, 62 N. Y. Supp. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">The defendant also objects to such taxation of costs upon the ground that the plaintiffs are-not entitled .thereto, for the reason that they served no notice of argument of the appeal, and did not argue said appeal orally or submit any brief thereon. This objection could only apply to the costs of such appeal, and the defendant\u2019s objection to the allowance of costs upon appeal should have been made to the Appellate Term on a motion for resettlement of the order. The clerk of the City Court was required to carry out the order of the Appellate Term, and had no authority to refuse to tax the costs as directed .by such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">The item of \u201ccosts before notice of trial, $25,\u201d was improperly allowed. When, upon the entry of an interlocutory judgment, a defeated party is allowed to plead over upon the payment of costs, the successful party is entitled to tax costs after notice and before trial, and a trial fee and disbursements. Garrett v. Wood, 61 App. Div. 294, 70 N. Y. Supp. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">\u201cMotion costs, $10,\u201d is also an improper item.' They were costs subsequently imposed upon a motion made for a reargument, and form no'part of the costs referred to in the order affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">The item of \u201ccosts on demurrer, $20,\u201d evidently refers to the costs which were or should have been taxed on the entry of the interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>judgment in the court below, and therefore are not properly taxable now.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Costs of $2, for serving summons and complaint, are taxable upon entry of the final judgment, and are not properly taxable under the order, and should have been disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The item of $40 on affirmance was evidently intended to be $40 for argument on appeal, and may be so considered, and the plaintiff had the right to tax that item (Campbell v. Hallihan, 46 Misc. Rep. 409, 92 N. Y. Supp. 413), under the order of the Appellate Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The order taxing the costs in the court below is modified, by striking therefrom the following items: Costs before notice of trial, $25; mo-</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">tion costs, $10; costs on demurrer, $20; serving summons and complaint, $2\u2014and allowing the other items objected to, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
