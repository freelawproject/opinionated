The plaintiff gave notice of motion at the Special Term for motions in Kings county for judgment thereon as frivolous. Instead a decision was made overruling the demurrer as upon a trial of the issue of law, and an interlocutory judgment to that effect was entered, with leave to plead over. If this was a mistake the defe-qdant should have moved before the court below to correct it. But it doejs not seem to be a mistake. The decision and judgment recite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>that the issue of law was brought on for trial and tried, counsel on both sides being heard, and this imports absolute verity. The issue could be tried at the Special Term for motions on consent, and that is what occurred according to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-3\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.
