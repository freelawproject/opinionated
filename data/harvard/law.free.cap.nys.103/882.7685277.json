The plaintiff filed a written complaint, alleging the sale and delivery of goods, wares, and merchandise during the preceding ten years. The defendant \u201cmakes a general denial, pleads payment, and asks for a bill of particulars,\u201d and the case was adjourned to March 1st following. On February 19th a written answer was filed, containing the defenses pleaded orally, and further pleading the statute of limitations. On the adjourned day the parties again appeared by counsel. The return of the justice shows the following entry made in his minutes on that day: \u201cMarch 1/06, court convened 9 \u00e1. m., cause called, plaintiff appeared by L. B. Haskins, attorney. Defendant appeared in person and by Parsons <em>&amp; </em>Griffiths, attorneys. Attorney for defendant appeared and put in an oral answer and asked leave to put in a written answer in place of oral answer, and asked for a bill of particulars and court granted permission to file written answer and the attorney for plaintiff stated that a new written complaint would be \u25a0 filed before trial; written answer of defendant was filed February 19/06.\u201d The return then states that, no bill of particulars having been filed with the court, the defendant asks for an adjournment, and that plaintiff be directed to file a .bill of particulars. The attorney for the plaintiff objected to an adjournment. The justice directed a bill of particulars to be filed within four days, overruled the plaintiff\u2019s objection, and adjourned the case to March 8th, to which ruling the plaintiff excepted. On March' 8th the plaintiff appeared specially by his attorney, and, upon the calling of the case, the defendant\u2019s attorneys moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that no bill of particulars had been served or filed as ordered by the justice, and, \u201cthere being no proof offered in evidence, the motion to dismiss is granted with costs to the defendant.\u201d Judgment was accordingly entered, which was reversed on appeal to the County Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b923-5\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, GAYNOR, and RICH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b923-6\">Frederick H. Kellogg, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b923-7\">Lincoln B.

The plaintiff\u2019s complaint had been in no manner amended, which excludes the provisions of section 2944. The power given by section 2965 cannot be exercised except for a single reason, viz., that the defendant \"cannot safely proceed to trial for want of some material testimony or witness\u201d which he has used due diligence to obtain, proof of which facts must be made by the defendant\u2019s own oath, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the justice. The adjournment was asked and granted for an entirely different reason, viz., that no bill of particulars had been served or filed. The justice had no right to adjourn the case for this reason, and by his unauthorized act he lost jurisdiction of the action, and the judgment subsequently entered was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">The judgment and order must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
