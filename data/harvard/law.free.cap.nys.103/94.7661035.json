Subsequently, the defendant having moved for a resettlement of such order, the Appellate Term made an order granting leav\u00e9 to the defendant to plead over upon payment of the costs of the appeal and the costs in the court below within six days. It appears that the plaintiffs, after the affirmance of the judgment overruling the demurrer by the Appellate Term, had entered a final judgment in the action against the defendant, and this judgment the defendant, after the entry of the resettled order permitting the defendant to plead over, moved to vacate. This motion was granted, and both parties handed up orders for signature. By inadvertence the justice hearing the motion signed both, orders, and they were both filed in the clerk\u2019s office; but it does not appear that either order had been entered. The defendant\u2019s order, after reciting the preliminary facts, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">\u201cIt is ordered that the motion be, and the same is, hereby granted in all respects, that the final judgment * * * be and it hereby is vacated, and that the clerk of this court be and he hereby is directed to mark on the judgment docket of this court that the aforesaid judgment is vacated by order of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 order, so far as we need consider it, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201cIt is ordered that the motion to vacate the final judgment * * * be, and the same is, hereby granted, and the stay obtained by Chas. Muller be, and the same is, hereby, vacated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The stay referred to in the order was one obtained by the defendant, staying the plaintiffs pending a motion made by the defendant in the Appellate Division for leave to appeal. After the orders were filed the attention of the justice was called to the fact that he had signed two orders, and, as appears from the opposing affidavit used on the motion, which statement contained therein the court below had a right to believe, he then, in the presence of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and a representative from the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, sent for the two orders, and, after examining them, declared that the plaintiffs\u2019 order was the proper order, and that he never intended to sign the order proposed by the defendant, and thereupon destroyed the plaintiffs\u2019 order, and instructed the representatives of the parties there present to inform the clerk that he had so destroyed it. To this action it does not appear that the defendant\u2019s representative offered any protest or exception, and the act of the justice was evidently done in perfect good faith, although the proper practice would have been to have made an order vacating the plaintiffs\u2019 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">It will be observed that the two orders in their effect are substantially alike. The defendant\u2019s order, so far as it directs the clerk to vacate the judgment, contains the proper recitals, and the plaintiffs\u2019 order is deficient in that respect; but we think there can be no question but that, under the recital in the plaintiffs\u2019 order, the clerk would have been justified in entering, opposite the judgment on the docket of judgments, the words \u201cVacated by order of the court,\u201d upon request being made of him so to do. So far as the order of the plaintiff vacating the stay is concerned, it is undoubtedly correct. We fail to see, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>fore, how the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to have filed and entered a copy of the destroyed order affects a substantial right of the defendant, and, unless it does so, it is not an appealable order. Section 1342, Code Civ. Proc. The defendant had an ample remedy to correct the plaintiffs\u2019 order, if he so desired and considered it essential,-by a motion to resettle the same; and if such motion was denied, and the defendant was injured in a substantial right by such denial, an appeal would lie. We think the order now appealed from,, under, the circumstances shown by the recital, is not an appealable one, and the appeal must be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
