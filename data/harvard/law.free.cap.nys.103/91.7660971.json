The action was brought by plaintiff as payee of a promissory note. The note reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-23\">\u201c$1,750. New York, April 27, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-24\">\u201cOn July 2d after date we promise to pay to the order of Dunbar Box &amp; Lumber Company seventeen hundred and fifty 00Aoo dollars at Phenix National Bank, 49 Wall street. Value received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-25\">\u201cVarick Contracting Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-26\">\u201cJohn L. Martin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-27\">\u201cNo: -. Due July 2, 1900.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The defendant is sued as executrix of John R. Martin.- Verdict-was directed for the plaintiff on the theory that the note was unambiguous and on its face the individual note of John R. Martin. The defendant claimed that the note was either the note of the Varick Contracting-Company alone or, if not that, the joint, but not joint and several, obligation of John R. Martin and the Varick Contracting Company, and that in either case the court erred in directing a verdict for the-plaintiff. The defendant further claims that the note is ambiguous on its face; that, although Martin\u2019s name is signed to the note, the stamp of the Varick Contracting Company is also there, and Martin\u2019s \u00f1am\u00e9is inserted in the space evidently intended to hold an officer\u2019s signature. The note also reads, \u201cWe promise to pay,\u201d etc., and this would indicate that it was not the promise of a single individual. Moreover, it appears from the testimony of Mr. Reid, the president of the plaintiff, that he received the note from Martin and saw him sign it, and that his company had no account with Martin personally, but only with the Varick Contracting Company, of which Martin was president.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Under these conditions we think the note was ambiguous, and that it. does not appear absolutely to be the personal note of defendant\u2019s testator. It follows, therefore, that evidence showing that the note was the-company\u2019s note, and accepted as such by the plaintiff, would be proper. Such evidence was offered by the defendant and excluded under objection. For instance, after proving the signature of Mr. Reid, who was-president of the plaintiff at the time, defendant offered in evidence the-following memorandum signed by Mr. Reid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201cJune 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">Mr. Reid wants check for $750 ex int. of which R. will notify us, and note for 1,000.00 at 3 mos. of V. G. O. to John L. Martin and endorsed by him to Dunbar Box &amp; Lumber Go. Date note June 29. Mr. R. promises to retire and return V. O. Co. note for 1750, of July 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201cJune 4/06.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">\u201cThos. T. Reid.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">This paper was excluded as tending to change the meaning of the-note sued upon. As stated above, the note in suit is ambiguous.. It was, therefore, error to exclude this memorandum. It shows quite clearly that the president of the plaintiff regarded the note as that of the Varick Contracting Company alone, and that he was looking forward to retiring the note on June 29, 1906, upon a payment of $750 on account and taking a new note of the company, upon which Martin would be personally liable as indorser. The giving of the new note-on June 29th was prevented by Martin\u2019s death on June 13, \u00cd906.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">It may be suggested that Reid had no power to bind the plaintiff by the declarations and admissions in this memorandum. A sufficient answer to that objection is that he was its president, and presumably in charge of these very matters for his company. Under these circumstances we think the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the-event.'</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant: to abide the\" event. All concur. . , ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
