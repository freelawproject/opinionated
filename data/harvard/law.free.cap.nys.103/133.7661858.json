Hough v. Baldwin, 50 Misc. Rep. 546, 99 N. Y. Supp. 545. The new trial was had, and the plaintiff again recovered; and this is an appeal from that judgment and from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">The testimony on the new trial did not differ materially from that given on the first trial. The action is for broker\u2019s commissions. The plaintiff claims to have earned his commissions for having produced a party ready and willing to exchange property with the- defendant. It appears now that the party produced by the plaintiff would not \u00a7ign the contract agreed upon the day before, unless there were inserted therein the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-18\">\u201cIt is understood between the parties hereto that, if the party of the second part rejects title on the ground of bay window or stoop ledge encroachments, then the deposit paid herein shall be returned in full for all claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">The contract was signed with this provision inserted. By this provision the exchange was made to depend upon the mere option of the plaintiff\u2019s customer to take or not in case of these encroachments. The contract was thus not a binding, enforceable contract, and the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>produced by the plaintiff was not ready and willing to take upon the terms proposed to the plaintiff. These encroachments would not have been a good ground for rejecting the title, if there were not a special agreement to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Judgment reversed, and judgment directed for the defendant dismissing the complaint, with costs in the court below and the costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
