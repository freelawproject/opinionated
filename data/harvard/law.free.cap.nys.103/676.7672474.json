In short, plaintiff desires to examine the officers of one defendant, not for use upon the trial, nor to prove any allegation of the complaint, but to find out upon whom she can serve a summons, in order to bring another defendant into jurisdiction. We are aware of no provision of statute, and are referred to none, authorizing\" an examination for that purpose; and it was distinctly held in Dudley v. N. Y. Filter Mfg. Co., 80 App. Div. 164, 80 N. Y. Supp. 529, that such an examination could not be held merely to enable a party to prepare for trial, but only when it fairly appears that it is the intention of the party to use the examination upon the trial. Here the contrary distinctly appears.</p>\n<p id=\"AB4\">There is no force in the suggestion that the refusal of the justice who made the order for examination to vacate it ex parte was a bar to this motion made on notice. It is true that when appellants applied ex parte for the vacation of the order to the justice who granted it, they were instructed by him to invite the respondent\u2019s attorney to submit his views, and, as courtesy required, they did informally inform their opponents that such ex parte application was pending and would be considered by the justice at a certain time. This did not suffice, however, to turn the motion into one made on notice. The application remained none the less an ex parte one, and the order denying the application, whatever its form, can only be regarded as an ex parte order, not conclusive upon the appellant as a bar to a formal motion to the court upon proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The order must be reversed, with $10 cost's and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
