Bingham, as police commissioner of the city of New York, to compel the reinstatement of relator as a member of the police force. Motion granted, and defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The following is the opinion of Garretson, J., in the court below:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8x\">The denials and averments of the answering affidavit submitted by the defendant upon information and belief do not put in issue the allegations of the relator\u2019s petition. People ex rel. Kelly v. Common Council, 77 N. Y. 503, 33 Am. Rep. 659; People ex rel. Frost v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R., 61 App. Div. 494, 70 N. Y. Supp. 684; s. c. 168 N. Y. 187, 61 N. E. 172. Hence the positive averment in defendant\u2019s affidavit that after he became police commissioner on January 1, 1906, upon the report of the police surgeons of February 6, 1906, and on March 19, 1906, he ordered that the petitioner, \u201chaving been absent without leave for more than five consecutive days, has ceased to be a member of the police force and has been dismissed therefrom in accordance with section 303, New York City Charter (Laws 1901, p. 130, c. 466), from March 9, 1906,\u201d taken with the allegations of the relator\u2019s petition and particularly the allegation therein that the relator\u2019s absence was the result of personal illness, and that he did not deem himself absent without leave, because he believed that he had been reported ill, are the only facts essential for consideration upon the merits of this application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-9\">It may be said in passing that the defendant\u2019s action, so far as it is alleged to hav.e been based upon the proceedings had before his predecessor, was of no validity. He could not acquire jurisdiction over charges pending at the time he entered upon his office, and -which, although tried, had not then passed to final judgment. People ex rel. Cassidy v. Commissioner, etc., 7 App. Div. 144, 40 N. Y. Supp. 102.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-10\">The facts appear, therefore, that the defendant assumed to declare relator\u2019s office vacant and dismissed him from the force solely for the reason that he was absent without leave for five consecutive days, and the relator shows that during that time he was ill. Absence under the section (303) of the charter, which is substantially the same as section 273 of the consolidation act (Laws 1882, p. 71, c. 410), which is caused by the act of God, does not bring the penalty of dismissal upon the absentee. The absence that will deprive the officer of his place must be voluntary and intentional. People ex rel. Mitchell v. Martin, 143 N. Y. 407, 38 N. E. 460.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-11\">Certiorari is not the relator\u2019s remedy. No trial, was had before the defendant. As the facts are undisputed, the present proceeding is available to the relator, and a peremptory writ should issue in accordance with the prayer of the petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-12\">Motion granted, with $50 costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b658-13\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, MILLER, and GAYNOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b658-14\">Edward Lazausky, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b658-15\">Jacob Rouss, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b658-16\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoc4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, on the opinion of Mr. Justice Garretson at Special Term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
