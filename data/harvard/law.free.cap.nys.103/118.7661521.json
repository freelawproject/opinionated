It was therefore erroneous to direct a verdict against the plaintiff, since the codefendant Tucker, the trustee in bankruptcy of the defendant, took no greater interest in or better title to the goods than Stratton had, save as he also represented the creditors of Stratton. Upon that subject the evidence is entirely silent, except as it may be inferred from the fact of bankruptcy upon the part of Stratton. Even if it be assumed that there were creditors represented by the trustee in bankruptcy who could have attacked the plaintiff\u2019s title to the goods upon the ground that there was not such an immediate and actual change in the possession thereof as section <em>25 </em>of the personal property law (Laws 1897, p. 511, c. 417) requires to effect a valid sale as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>such creditors, the facts and circumstances were such as to require \u25a0the submission of that question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The judgment, and the order denying the motion for a new trial, should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the.event. Adi concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
