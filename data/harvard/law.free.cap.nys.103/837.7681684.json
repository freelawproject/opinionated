McCurdy, the son, through the employment of a firm, of- which he was a member, as an agent of the company, on an unusual contract of agency, made without authority, by which the firm was paid exorbitant commissions, grossly in excess of the fair and reasonable compensation for the services rendered, and by the appointment of the defendant Robert H.'McCurdy to the office of superintendent of the foreign department of the plaintiff at an exorbitant salary, grossly in excess of the fair and reasonable compensation for the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"AWiA\">The allegations of the complaint are sufficiently definite. Although renewals of the agreements from time to time at increased commissions are alleged, yet it is alleged that this was pursuant to the original corrupt and fraudulent agreement and conspiracy, and therefore they merely constituted steps in the consummation of the single scheme, plan, and purpose conceived at the outset to wrongfully and fraudulently obtain the moneys from the company. The complaint states b.iit a single cause of action to recover the moneys lost to the company through the fraudulent acts of the defendants, acting in concert in exccuting a preconceived conspiracy to obtain the moneys from the company wrongfully and without authority. People v. Tweed, 63 N. Y. 194; Bosworth v. Allen, 168 N. Y. 157, 165, 61 N. E. 163, 55 L. R. A. 751, 85 Am. St. Rep. 667; Mabon v. Miller, 81 App. Div. 10, 80 N. Y. Supp. 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">It follows that the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
