The testimony of the plaintiff as to the efforts made to obtain possession was corroborated by the evidence of other witnesses, and we are unable to agree with the learned county judge in the statement that it was vague, unsatisfactory, and contradictory. There was a conflict of evidence upon this question, and as to whether the defendants refused to permit the plaintiff to occupy the premises, but we think the evidence was at least as strong and convincing in behalf of the plaintiff as of the contesting defendants. However that may be, there was not such a strong preponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>proof in favor of the defendants as to warrant a reversal as against the weight of evidence under the rule laid down in Murtagh v. Dempsey, 85 App. Div. 204, 83 N. Y. Supp. 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">It is true that a covenant for quiet enjojunent imports no warrant}1, express or implied, as respects the acts of strangers (Gardner v. Keteltas, 3 Hill, 330, 38 Am. Dec. 637) ; but it is well settled that, if the lessor himself denies the lessee\u2019s right, and refuses to permit him to occupy the premises, or if he is directly connected with the withholding of the property, the lessee may bring his action for the damages sustained (Trull v. Granger, 8 N. Y. 115).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The order of the County Court should be reversed, and the judgment of the City Court affirmed, with costs in this Court and in County Court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
