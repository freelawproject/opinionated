It cannot be said as matter of law that the ice was the proximate cause, for it was at least a question of fact whether it was the ice which caused her to fall. Nor was the fact that she was familiar with the place and knew it to be dangerous sufficient to justify the nonsuit. The fact that one goes over a defective sidewalk is not negligence as matter of law. Bullock v. Mayor, etc., 99 N. Y. 654, 2 N. E. 1; Pomfrey v. Village of Saratoga Springs, 104 N. Y. 459, 11 N. E. 43. The case of a street torn up for repair, and littered (Whalen v. Citizens\u2019 Gaslight Co., 151 N. Y. 70, 45 N. E. 363), or where a person deliberately steps on a dangerous obstruction or defect (Weston v. City of Troy, 139 N. Y. 281, 34 N. E. 780), is entirely different. If one walks through such litter, or knowingly and intentionally steps on a dangerous place, he takes the risk. It is not here intimated that this plaintiff was careful, or that the street was dangerously defective; these are questions of fact for the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The judgment should he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new tidal granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
