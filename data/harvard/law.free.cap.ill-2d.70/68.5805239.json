The clerk of the appellate court sent it to the trial court after the 30-day period expired, and the appellate court dismissed the appeal for failure to file the notice within time. Leave to appeal is allowed, and in the exercise of this court\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction the appellate court is directed to reinstate the appeal.</p> <p id=\"b81-9\" pgmap=\"81\">Supervisory order entered.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
