Kernel* brought this action against Amasa Leonard and his wife, for the foreclosure of a mortgage on property situated in the city of New York. The defendants resided at Morristown, New Jersey. On November 3, 1873, the plaintiff obtained an order in the usual form for the service of the summons, by publication (once a week for six weeks). On November 5, 1873, the summons and complaint were served on the defendants personally at their residence in New Jersey. On November 26, the plaintiff applied to the court for judgment as upon a default, and on the 28th of the same month judgment was entered on his application, directing sale. Before the day of sale defendants moved to set aside the judgment as irregular in being prematurely entered, the defendants\u2019 time to appear and answer not having expired.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-9\"><em>J.
