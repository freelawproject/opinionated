Julio against Henry T. Ingalls and others. The defendants moved upon an affidavit showing non-residence of the plaintiff, and that a former action had been brought against the defendants by the same plaintiff, in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in which judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants, and for their costs, \u00a7115.44. The defendants, likewise, submitted an authenticated copy of the record of the action in Massachusetts. At the hearing of the motion, the plaintiff gave evidence showing that he was a resident of this State.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-11\"><em>Charles </em>Tracy, for the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFER\">cited Julio <em>a. </em>Ingalls (1 <em>Allen, </em>41; 1 <em>Burr. </em>Pr., 410); Jackson <em>a. </em>Miller (3 <em>Cow., </em>57); Perkins <em>a. </em>Hinman <em>(19 Johns., </em>237); <em>Exp. </em>Stone (3 <em>Cow., 380); </em>Jackson <em>a. </em>Carpenter <em>(Ib., </em>22); Kentish <em>a. </em>Tatham (6 <em>Hill, </em>372); Edwards <em>a. </em>Ninth Av.

The defendant has referred to no case sustaining his motion, and I have not been able to find any. If the action had been still pending, he could not have set up the pendency of such action as a defence; and the same rule, by analogy, applied to this case would be an answer to the motion. The enforcement of that rule has been confined to courts within the State; and not always applied even here, where the different courts proceeded by different- modes of practice, or were governed by different principles in their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">With much more force it and may be said that it should not be applied to cases where the courts were in different States, and, perhaps, governed by entirely different modes of proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The rule has never been extended to costs in actions pending in other States or countries, and there are good reasons why it should not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
