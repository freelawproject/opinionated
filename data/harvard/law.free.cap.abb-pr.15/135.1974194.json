There having been a new trial ordered in the action, the clerk allowed to defendant five circuit term fees, after the order for a new trial, in addition to five like term fees before the first trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">Plaintiff appealed to the special term from this adjustment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-6\"><em>Orlando L.

Also, that under \u00a7 307 of the Code, no more than five term fees could be allowed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-7\"><em>J. R.

Y., </em>260, determines that the provisions of the Revised Statutes giving double costs to public officers (2 Rev. <em>Stat., </em>617, \u00a7 24), is not repealed by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Rot being repealed, that law' prescribes what items are to be computed in fixing the sum to be paid as double costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">Sections 24 and 25 (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>617), show what is meant by double costs. They consist (first) of the whole sum included in a bill of costs, and taxed as costs, and (second) of one-half that sum, \u25a0 in addition to the ordinary or single bill of taxed costs (Patchin v. Parkhurst, 9 <em>Wend., </em>443; Stainland <em>v. </em>Ludlum, 8 <em>B. &amp; C., </em>889).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">The Code, \u00a7\u00a7 258, 303, abolished all laws regulating \u201cthe costs or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>fees of attorneys, solicitors and counsel in civil actions,\u201d, and in lieu thereof gave to the prevailing party certain sums by way of indemnity ; which sums or allowance it denominates costs. But it does not interfere with the rates of compensation to witnesses or jurors, nor enact that any item previously denominated or treated as costs, and still taxed in favor of the prevailing party, shall cease, to be so denominated or regarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">The principle on which the clerk acted in doubling the costs, is the true one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-5\">Fancher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZV\">Where a sheriff succeeds in Ms de- . fense, he is entitled to <em>\u201c </em>double\u201d costs, including disbursements ; that is, to the adjusted bill of costs and disbursements, fifty per cent, more must be added. The statute as to double costs is not affected by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Subdivision <em>7 </em>of section 307 of the Code allows but \u2022 <em>five </em>term fees, and no more. All above that number must be stricken from' the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
