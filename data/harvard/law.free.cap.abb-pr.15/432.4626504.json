The landlord must make out a plain case, and leave nothing to he inferred. (6 <em>Hill, </em>314; 4 Den., 71-118; 5 <em>N. Y., </em>388; 24 <em>Barb., </em>438; 22 <em>How. Pr., </em>183-186; 16 <em>Ib., </em>449; 16 <em>Barb., </em>474; 32 <em>Ib., </em>540; 5 <em>How. Pr., </em>95; 9 <em>N. Y., </em>35; 15 <em>Wend., </em>226; 9 <em>Ib., </em>227; 1 <em>Hill, </em>512; 8 <em>Cow., </em>13.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">II. The relation of landlord and tenant is not sufficiently set forth. The estate could not have gone to the executors of Isaac Worden but to his heirs; so the conclusion is, that the respondent is not landlord by her own showing. The due appointment of the executors, and their <em>power </em>under the will, if they had any, should have been shown. (6 <em>Hill, </em>314; 17 <em>How. Pr., </em>197; 27 <em>Barb., </em>337.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">III. It does not appear by the affidavit that the tenant was in arrears for rent. 1. The complaint is, that she had not paid taxes. 2. But taxes are not rent, and are not shown to have been reserved as rent, by the affidavit. 3. Rent, at common law, must be capable of being reduced to a certainty by either party. (3 <em>Cruise Dig., </em>312.) 4. It does not appear how taxes were to be made rent, nor when they were to become due, and these very necessary connections of rent <em>cannot </em>be inferred. (See cases above cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">IY. If the affidavit was insufficient, the justice could not acquire jurisdiction either by a trial on the merits or by consent. (9 <em>Johns., </em>239; 3 <em>Cai., </em>129.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-10\"><em>Edwin R. Bogardus, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-11\">Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHA\">Without waiting to examine whether Swayze has shown that she stands in the relation.of landlord to the relator, I do not think that she has sufficiently shown in her affidavit presented to the justice, that the relator had made any default in the payment of rent. She has only shown that the relator did not pay the taxes for several years. The lease provides for the payment of $27.50 per annum as rent; and in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>separate provision, there is a covenant for the discharge of taxes, &amp;e., by the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The second subdivision of section 28 of the act, allowing these summary proceedings (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>513), applies only to cases of default in the payment of rent. It is clear that the covenant to pay taxes cannot be considered as part of the rent, because the taxes are not payable to the landlord, but to the public authoritiesand the landlord could not make a legal demand \u25a0of the taxes, as required by the statute, if the same were a part \u25a0of the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">It also appears by the affidavit, that the landlord has paid the taxes, and thereby changed his demand against the tenant into a mere action of damages for breach of the covenant to pay the taxes;\u2014if she has any remedy after such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Proceedings reversed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Sutherland, P. J.,- and Ingraham, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
