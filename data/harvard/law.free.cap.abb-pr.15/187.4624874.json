The cause was tried in December, 1860, at special term, where decision was reserved. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>at length dismissed the complaint, but without costs, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant without costs, in February, 1861. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed, also without costs. Shortly after the commencement of' the action, the court ordered the allowance of a counsel-fee and alimony at the rate of five dollars a week; the counsel-fee was paid, and also the alimony, till the close of the trial, though not till decision rendered. In June, 1862, plaintiff\u2019s motion to enforce the order respecting payment of alimony and for additional counsel-fee and allowance for expenses of suit, was denied by Mr. Justice Barnard. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-5\"><em>William R. </em>Stafford, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-6\"><em>Fine &amp; </em>Chittenden, for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqeq\">I. \u201c An order of the special term denying alimony, or an allowance for expenses of suit, in an action for divorce, is in the discretion of the court at special term, and is not reviewable.\u201d (2 <em>Rev.
