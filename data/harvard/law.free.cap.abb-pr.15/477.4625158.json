Williams. Decree was entered June 8th, 1842, and the money judgment remained unsatisfied of record. On June 6th, 1862, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>obtained an order for the examination of the judgment-debtor in supplementary proceedings, and delivered it to the sheriff for service on the same day. The order was served on the judgment-debtor on June 8th.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-5\"><em>John Sessions, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqhA\">The order ought to be set aside as upon a judgment paid subsequent to the issuing of the order, and simultaneously with its service. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 92; 2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>301, \u00a747.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-6\">II. This is in no sense a proceeding to revive the judgment, but merely to enforce its execution. It is not the commencement of an action within any of the provisions of law, and precludes the judgment-debtor from the exercise of a constit\u00fational right to take issue upon the validity of the judgment and a trial by jury of that issue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-7\"><em>William S. Sears, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU0\">The present proceeding is a substitute for the creditor\u2019s bill, and if the creditor\u2019s bill had been filed on the 6th and subpoena issued on that day and in good faith put in the hands of an officer to be served, the judgment could not have been barred by the statute. <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 99.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b496-8\">Clerke,</author>\n<p id=\"ABP9\">J.\u2014It has been generally, and I think correctly, held that an order for the examination of a judgment-debtor is not a mere process like the execution to enforce satisfaction of the judgment. It is not based upon the judgment alone but on a presentation of new facts which the plaintiff must prove to entitle him to the relief he seeks. It is, in short, in all respects, a substitute for a creditor\u2019s bill, and is, in all its essential features, equivalent to a new suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">If, then, the institution of a new suit (a creditor\u2019s bill), would stop the operation of the statute presuming payment of a judgment at the expiration of twenty years, this proceeding, by a parity of reasoning, produces the same effect. The order in this case was issued and served before the expiration of that period, and, consequently, the presumption of payment cannot be entertained. The defendant must submit to an examination. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavits undoubtedly contain impertinent matter which must be expunged. Indeed, as it is not necessary to consider the question for which the respective affidavits were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>presented, both parties are at liberty to withdraw them ; otherwise the objectionable matter in plaintiff\u2019s affidavits must be expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
