H. Servoss, wife of Thomas L. Servoss, upon a note for $425, in which she agreed to make the amount chargeable upon her separate estate. The note was dated March, 1862. The complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s separate estate consisted of certain land, and sought judgment, specially charging it. The defendant demurred for want of cause of action.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-11\"><em>John Owen, </em>in support of the demurrer, insisted that the contract was invalid, for the want of the husband\u2019s assent. <em>(Laws of </em>1860, ch. 90, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-12\"><em>Matthews &amp; Griffin, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-13\">Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW8\">The 3d section of the act of 1860 <em>{Laws of </em>1860, 157, ch. 90), authorizing a married woman to bargain, sell, and convey her real estate, does not apply to any act of hers, by which she creates a charge or lien on her separate estate. Therefore, the restriction contained in that section, which says that no such conveyance shall be valid without the assent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>writing of her husband, is confined to what may be deemed strictly a transference of her estate. Specifically charging her estate is entirely a different thing from conveying or transferring it; and her right to do the former continued as it had existed before the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The demurrer must be overruled, with liberty to answer in ten days, on payment of costs of demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
