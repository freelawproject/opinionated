Sturdy, Jonathan P. Bryant, Solomon Frederick, and sixteen others. It was in the nature .of a creditor\u2019s action, founded upon a judgment against four of the defendants for $1427.94. It set forth that such judgment-debtors being insolvent, had given three mortgages\u2014one to defendants, Bryant, Richmond &amp; Draper, one to defendant Albert. W. Carpenter, and the other to the remaining defendants. These mortgages were averred to be fraudulent as against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The defendants, Bryant, Richmond <em>&amp; </em>Co., put in an answer by B. &amp; S. D. Cozzens, attorneys; defendants, Dederiek, Sears <em>&amp; </em>Co., put in an answer by the same attorneys; the defendant, Frederick put in an answer similar to that of Sears <em>&amp; Go., </em>by John Cochrane, attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">The defendants\u2019 attorneys occupied the same offices. Leave was given to the plaintiff <em>to </em>discontinue, on payment of one bill of costs. From the decision the present appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-8\"><em>B. &amp; S. D. Cozzens, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-9\"><em>William B. Carpenter, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6h\">I. The last two answers put in by separate attorneys are exactly the same, the issues are the same, and the language in each identical. This fact <em>per se </em>shows that the object in severing them was only to double the costs; and that the separate appearance was not put in, in good faith. These answers must have been drawn by the same hand. (15 <em>How. Pr., </em>114, where 4 <em>Sandf., </em>671, is reviewed; 13 <em>How. Pr., </em>31.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-10\">II John Cochrane, who nominally appears for S. Frederick, has a desk in the office of B. <em>&amp; </em>S. D. Cozzens, and always has had. Hothing but his name, as attorney, has ever appeared in this action. It is in effect an appearance by the same attorney. (Perry <em>a. </em>Livingston, 6 <em>How. Pr., </em>404. See, also, 5 <em>Ib., </em>104; 6 <em>Ib., </em>9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-11\">III. The two sets of defendants, who appeared by the same attorneys, viz.: Bryant, Richmond &amp; Co., and Dederiek, Sears &amp; Co., though they put in separate answers, can have but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>one bill of costs. (5 <em>How. Pr., </em>104.) 1. Separate answers were not necessary in this case by any defendant, and hence but one bill is taxable. (8 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>341, and cases there cited.) 2. But one judgment could have been recovered by the plaintiff, or by the defendants, should the action proceed (13 <em>How. Pr., </em>33), and hence but one bill is taxable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">IV. When persons severally liable are united as defendants, but appear by different attorneys, and answer separately, and after issue joined, and the cause has been noticed, settled, and agreed to pay plaintiff\u2019s legal costs, he is entitled to only one bill of costs. He cannot have a bill against each defendant. (13 <em>How. Pr., </em>416.) The same rule should obviously apply, where plaintiff offers to discontinue and pay legal costs. (See, also, 3 <em>Code P., </em>73.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">V. Separate bills of costs cannot be allowed under section 306 of the Code: 1. Because these defendants are all united in interest. 2. Because no \u201cfailure to recover a judgment against all the defendants\u201d has been made by the plaintiff, no judgment whatever having been recovered by either party in the action. 3. The discretion allowed by this section to the court, could not, in this case, be exercised in favor of the defendants, since the ground of this application for discontinuance is the irresponsibility of the defendants, which has happened since this action was commenced.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">By the Court.\u2014Ingraham, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYq\">The appeal in this case is from that part of the order which holds that the defendants are not entitled to separate bills of costs. Whether this decision is correct or not, depends upon the finding of the court below, as to the fact of separate employments by different attorneys. The affidavits are contradictory. The plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits show a state of facts which, if true, would establish the employment of Frederick\u2019s attorney to be collusive, and intended only to increase the costs. In such a case the parties are only entitled to one bill of costs. On the other hand, the defendants deny the statements made on the part of the plaintiff, and claim to be entitled to full costs for both attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">With these contradictory statements, we cannot interfere with the order appealed from. There is strong ground for presuming that the separation of defences between attorneys occupying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>same office, is generally done for the purpose of increasing the costs, and such practices are not encouraged by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Whether that was so or not, has been passed upon by the judge on the motion, and we do not see in the affidavits any thing to warrant us in reversing his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Order appealed from, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Leonard and Barnard, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
