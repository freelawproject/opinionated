Dwight, and executed to him the usual certificate, and then returned the executions to the proper \u25a0county, with indorsements of satisfaction thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-14\">Dwight was not a plaintiff or defendant in any of these three suits, but he claimed to be a creditor of Tallmadge, and to have some interest in the judgments. After the return by the sheriff of the executions, as above stated, Dwight moved at special term, upon notice to the sheriff and the defendant, Tallmadge (the plaintiff\u2019s attorney consenting), to vacate the returns and the satisfactions of the judgments under them; and, also, that the sale and all proceedings thereon be declared void, and that new executions be allowed to issue. The ground of his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>was, that he had been advised by the attorney for the plaintiffs to purchase the land in question, but that after the sale he had discovered a previous conveyance by Tallmadge of the land so-sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">Hr. Justice Barnard, at chambers, directed the entry of an order vacating the returns and satisfactions, together with the-sale and all proceedings thereon; and authorizing the plaintiffs-to issue new executions for the amount of the judgments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">From this order, the defendant Tallmadge appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-7\"><em>Elbridge T.

Not being a party to any of these suits, Dwight was a stranger to the judgments, and not entitled, on motion, to impeach the regularity of, nor to move to set aside, proceedings thereon. 1. The case is widely different from that of a purchaser under a foreclosure-sale ; for there, specific property is pointed out by the decree of the court. 2. But a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale is not entitled to any such favor; and as the present motion was not merely to set aside the sale, but also the executions, the court, at special term, erred in entertaining such a motion by him. (Berry <em>a. </em>Riley, 2 <em>Barb., </em>307; Smith <em>a. </em>McGowan, 3 <em>Ib., </em>404; Pierce <em>a.. </em>Alsop, 3 <em>Barb. Ch., </em>184; <em>Crocker on Sheriffs, </em>\u00a7 491; Price a. Shelby Circuit, <em>Hardin (Ky.), </em>254; Weisiger <em>a. </em>McClure, 5 <em>J. J.

In a particular instance, a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale has a remedy by statute\u2014not on motion. (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>375; 3 <em>Ib., </em>5 ed., 658, \u00a7 97.) 4. The consent of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to the motion does not improve Dwight\u2019s <em>status. </em>(Laws <em>a. </em>Thompson, 4 <em>Jones (N. C.), </em>104.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-8\">H. By the terms of the sale, Dwight acquired only \u201c the right, title, and interest\u201d of Tallmadge in the land sold; and the rule is settled that, on such sale, the maxim <em>caveat emptor </em>applies. (2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>373; 3 <em>Ib., </em>5 ed., 655, \u00a7 78; The Monte Allegre, 9 <em>Wheat., </em>616, 647; Stafford <em>a. </em>Williams, 12 <em>Barb., </em>240, 243; Homesley <em>a. </em>Hogue, 4 <em>Jones (N.

Dwight seeks to overthrow this rule, and to avail himself &lt; of his own folly, in not ascertaining the facts before purchasing. 1. He never caused any search for prior conveyances to be made. 2. He makes no excuse for his carelessness, and is not entitled to favor. (Biddle <em>a. </em>Moore, 3 <em>Penn., </em>161.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>Albert Comstock, </em>for Dwight, opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjJ\">I. The objections to the right of Dwight to move in the action are of a technical and preliminary nature, and the motion having been heard on the merits, they cannot now be considered. (Main <em>a. </em>Pope, 16 <em>How. Pr., </em>271; Roosevelt <em>a. </em>Dean, 3 <em>Cai., </em>105; S. C., <em>Col. &amp; C. Cas., </em>460.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">H. Besides, the right of any party to an action to ask relief \u2022by a summary application therein, and in no other way, against the purchaser, is indisputable; that the purchaser should have the right in a similar manner to apply, seems natural, just, and \u2022 correlative. (Brown <em>a. </em>Frost, 10 Paige, 243 ; Requa <em>a. </em>Rea, 2 <em>Ib., </em>339; Darvin <em>a. </em>Hatfield, 4 <em>Sandf., </em>468; Lents <em>a. </em>Craig, 13 <em>How. Pr., </em>72; King <em>a. </em>Morris, 2 <em>Abbotts' Pr., </em>296.) A creditor certainly has.' (May <em>a. </em>May, 11 Paige, 201; Nicholl <em>a. </em>Nicholl, 8 <em>Ib., </em>349.) \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\">III. But beyond elementary principles, authorities for vacating judicial sales in behalf of purchasers, and others aggrieved \u25a0 on the ground of mistake, &amp;c., are numerous; and sheriffs\u2019 returns on executions have been vacated, and new executions ordered to issue, for reasons similar to those here urged. (Hoppock <em>a. </em>Conklin, 4 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>582; American Ins. Co. <em>a. </em>Oakley, 9 <em>Paige, </em>259; McGown <em>a. </em>Wilkins, <em>lib., </em>120; Williamson <em>\u2022a. </em>Field, 2 <em>Sandf., </em>533; Suydam <em>a. </em>Holden, in Court of Appeals, <em>Soward\u2019s Code of </em>1859, 440.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-12\">IY. The maxim <em>caveat emptor </em>does not apply to Dwight\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>prejudice within the ruling of the authorities referred to; and the statutory provisions referred to by the appellant\u2019s counsel-are not conclusive as to the manner of seeking, or nature of the relief, for the action by the purchaser must be in the original-suit. (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 658; Hicholl <em>a. </em>Richoll, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-5\">By the Court.\u2014Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">In the Ontario Bank <em>a. </em>Lansing (2 <em>Wend., </em>260), on the sale of the property under a <em>fi.fa., </em>the-plaintiff inadvertently bid a sum less than the amount of his execution, and the sale on his application was set aside. Again in Mulks <em>a. </em>Allen (12 <em>Ib., </em>253), the plaintiff and deputy sheriff, were deceived, as to the locality of the property, by the representations of the defendant; in consequence of which the plaintiff bid $800 for it, when it was not worth more than $150; it was struck off to him, and on motion a resale was ordered. There are other cases, no doubt, in which the court refused to interfere, either on the ground that junior judgment-creditors had acquired rights, or that a court of equity was the proper tribunal to grant relief. But neither of these grounds apply to the present case. It resembles the case of Hulks <em>a. </em>Allen, where the purchaser was deceived by the representations of the-defendant as to the locality. Here the purchaser was deceived, to be sure, by the misrepresentations of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney;; but the misrepresentations were equally mischievous in the one case as in the other. They induced the purchaser to do what he otherwise would not have done. The purchaser in Hulks Allen was not obliged to rely on the misrepresentations any more than in this case; he could have obtained correct knowledge as t\u00f3 the locality of the property by further inquiry; but still the court relieved him from the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">As to the objection that the person making this application is not a party to the actions in which the executions were issued, if it is at all proper to consider that objection now, I think it should not be sustained. Parties, other than parties to suits, are frequently allowed to address themselves to the equitable consideration of courts of law; as, for instance, judgment-creditors in other actions against the same defendants, on motions-to set aside fraudulent judgments. Besides, in analogy to applications like the present, in foreclosure and partition suits in courts of equity, there is no reason why a person, not a party.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>on the record, addressing the equitable summary jurisdiction of a court of law, should not obtain the relief to which he would be entitled if he was a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The order of the special term should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Baehaed, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Ingbaham, P.
