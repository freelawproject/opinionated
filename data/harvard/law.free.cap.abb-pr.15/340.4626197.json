After an angry dispute between them, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>told the defendant that he <em>\u201c </em>would be satisfied\u201d if he (the defendant) would swear that they agreed at 78 cents. The defendant made a positive affidavit to that effect, which he showed to the plaintiff, a few days afterwards. The plaintiff desired to have possession of this affidavit, but the defendant refused to give it up, unless the plaintiff would give him a receipt in full, which the latter would not do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">The justice before whom the action was tried, gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount claimed, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-6\"><em>Thomas G. </em>Shearman, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_y\">I. The affidavit of the defendant was a complete defence to this action. Whether true or not, it was the test which the plaintiff chose to apply, and it is a sufficient consideration for his promise to be satisfied. (Hurd <em>a. </em>Pendrigh, 2 <em>Hill, </em>502; Brooks <em>a. </em>Ball, 18 <em>Johns., </em>337; Stevens <em>a. </em>Thacker, <em>Peake N. P., </em>187; Lloyd <em>a. </em>Willan, 1 <em>Esp. N. P., </em>178.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\">H. The plaintiff did not stipulate for the delivery of the affidavit to him. It was enough, therefore, that it was made, and the knowledge thereof communicated to him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-8\"><em>Daniel B. Taylor, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGN\">contended that the plaintiff only meant that he would be satisfied that the defendant was a bad man, if he made the affidavit; that it was a mere hasty expression, by which he ought not to be bound; that the affidavit should have been made and tendered on the spot, and was unavailing by reason of the delay in producing it, and of the defendant\u2019s refusal to deliver it the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-14\"> It is worthy of notice that a different rule has been laid down for an agreement to pay on a certain contingency, provided that its happening should be proved by a certificate of a third person; in which case it would seem that the certificate is not conclusive ; and if it were, it would be competent to show that it was fraudulently false.
