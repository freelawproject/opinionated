We answer, that every so-called physician, every medical institute, or college or association that advertises medicine or medical advice, by circular or otherwise, is a quack ; in short, a swindle. The whole tribe of those who advertise \u2018 marriage guides,\u2019 \u2018 female medicines,\u2019 \u2018 advice to the young,\u2019 \u2018errors of youth,\u2019 \u2018eye doctors,\u2019 \u2018ear doctors,\u2019 \u2018consumption curers,\u2019 \u2018 cancer doctors or medicines,\u2019 &amp;c., &amp;c., are positively quacks and impostors, to whom it is unsafe to address even a letter of inquiry; also, the \u2018 Golden Remedies,\u2019 inquired about by several, are nonsensical quackery. We have not room for a lot more of humbugs on hand, but will renew the war upon them in the next volume ; and, as hitherto, we expect to shield at least all our readers from swindlers, and, through them, many other people.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">The plaintiff alleged also, that the defendants, by means of these words, published as hereinbefore set forth, insinuated, and meant to be understood by those to whom it was published, and to the public at large, as charging the plaintiff with being a quack, impostor and swindler, and that the said \u201c Golden Remedies,\u201d manufactured solely by the plaintiff, were wholly valueless and useless, and possessing no medical qualities whatever, and that by means of the publication the plaintiff has been injured in his reputation and in his business, and been deprived of custom and trade, and lost the sale of goods and profits, which he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>-otherwise have made, to his damage twenty-five thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">The defendants in their answer admit, in substance, that they are publishers of the <em>American Agriculturist, </em>and that, in December, 1872, they published the article under the caption of \u201c Sundry Humbugs,\u201d above set forth. They allege also, that the publication is substantially true, and was published with good motives and for j ustifiable ends. They also set out, in <em>extenso, </em>the circulars sent forth by the defendant with his \u201cGolden Remedies,\u201d in which the plaintiff describes himself as a physician who has had a general practice in all parts of the world ; and they aver various facts tending to show that the alleged medicines -of plaintiff are valueless as remedies for disease, being \u25a0compounds costing but a few cents per bottle, and selling at several dollars, which the public would shun if the constituent parts were known.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The defendants propose in their answer to give evidence of all the various facts alleged, both in justification and in mitigation of damages.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">Issue being joined, the defendants upon affidavit procured an order and summons for the examination -of plaintiff as a witness on their behalf, before the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">On such examination, the plaintiff testified that a bottle marked \u201cDr. Richau\u2019s Golden Remedies, Ho. 2,\u201d was one of the medicines he advertises and vends to the public. He was then asked of what balsam Ho. 3 was composed ? He refused to answer the question, on the ground that it was irrelevant, immaterial, and a secret in his trade. The judge directed the plaintiff to answer the question. He then answered: \u201cIt is a secret compound, composed of various ingredients, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>which possess great medicinal properties;\u201d and refused to state the names of the ingredients.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">He then gave evidence showing that he was not a \u2022doctor of medicine, and had never received a diploma, and had not been engaged in a general practice of medicine in any part of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">He then testified that he advertised \u201c Doctor Rieham s Grolden Elixir de Amour, or Elixir of Love and being asked, \u201cof what is it composed?\u201d here-fused to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">The court at special term, after argument, ruled that the plaintiff must answer the question which had been propounded; and on the question being repeated to him, he answered: \u201cIt is a secret compound of various ingredients which possess great medicinal properties ;\u201d and refused absolutely to give any other answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\"><em>The court at special </em>term, on presentation of these facts, held that the answer was evasive ; and the plaintiff, under the advice of his counsel, refusing to give any other answer, the court ordered his complaint to be stricken out and dismissed, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-10\"><em>John S. </em>Walker, for plaintiff, appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8b\">Insisted that the constituents of the medicines were not in issue <em>(Greenl. on Ev., </em>\u00a7 51); and even were they revealed, the only question would be, will the medicines cure ? (Murch <em>v. </em>Davidson, 9 <em>Paige, </em>580; Swift v. Dickerman, 31 <em>Conn., </em>285). The court cannot compel specific articles to be produced by the party (Anson <em>v. </em>Tuska, 19 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>391). A defendant in libel cannot call on plaintiff to help him prove his defense by revealing the constituents of the goods (Day <em>v. </em>Tucket, 1 <em>Bail. Ct., </em>203; Met. Saloon Co. <em>v. </em>Hawkin, 4 <em>Hulst. &amp; M., </em>146; <em>Townshend on Slander &amp; </em>L., 366). The secret of the manufacture of the remedies is plaintiff\u2019s property,.a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>subject- of sale, and cannot be taken without due process of law (Jarvis <em>v. </em>Peck, 10 <em>P.

[After stating the facts.]</author>\n<p id=\"AHC\">By the allegations of his complaint the plaintiff had invited an issue as to the medicinal qualities and value of the \u201cGolden Remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The statement of the alleged libel, so far as it pointed directly to the plaintiff or his remedies, was to the effect that his \u201cGolden Remedies\u201d are \u201cnonsensical quackery ;\u201d and it is chiefly of this statement that the plaintiff complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The defendants undertake by their answer to show that this statement is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">No one can read the circulars of the plaintiff, as proved by himself on his examination, without observing the importance of the investigation sought to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">It was competent to disprove the assertions of the 'circulars and of the complaint, by ascertaining the ingredients of the several compounds, for the purpose of showing that they possess no such medicinal virtues as are claimed by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">For instance, he asserts in his circular that his \u201cElixir of Love\u201d is composed of the most powerful ingredients of the vegetable kingdom, \u201charmless, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>speedy in restoring healthy action ;\u201d and. again: \u201cIt is the fountain of youth to old. age; the rejuvenator of pristine vigor in the young ; to the barren women of our land it is a special blessing.\u201d Indeed, it is impossible to read the vulgar, and in many respects shameful assertions and instructions that accompany the compounds of plaintiff, without being struck with the vileness of the impostures. That he can bring an action of libel for injury alleged to be done to his trade in his medicines, by denouncing them as arrant quackery, and at the same time protect himself against exposure by claiming them to be valuable secrets, is a proposition that cannot be maintained (Byrn <em>v. </em>Judd, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>390; and see 11 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Kern.], </em>347).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">' In the laudable exposure of such \"humbugs \u201d as the pretended medicine of plaintiff and others, the defendants take upon themselves great risks, and subject themselves to the annoyance of suits ; but I think they are not exposed to any danger that courts will interpose any shield for the protection of parties guilty of fraud and deception of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">If the plaintiff did not choose to try the question of the true character of his \u2018\u2018Golden Remedies,\u201d he should have kept out of a court of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The order of the court below was correct, and should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs and dis-\" bursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Daniels and Donohue, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\"> Present, Davis, P.
