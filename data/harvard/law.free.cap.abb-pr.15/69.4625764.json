Brown, and William Brown, as trustees, and numerous others, for an accounting and the payment of a judgment against the steamship company, in favor of the plaintiffs, for $2528.52. There was a similar action against the same defendants by John W. Cooper and John B. Cooper, also judgment-creditors. The two actions were argued and determined together. The complaint in the first action was substantially as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">The plaintiffs commence this action in behalf of themselves and such creditors of the Rew York and Liverpool United States Mail Steamship Company as may choose to participate therein, and respectfully allege\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">That in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, an act or statute of the State of Rew York was passed, entitled \u201c An act to incorporate the Rew York and Liverpool United States Mail Steamship Company, passed April 11, 18\u00e99,\u201d under and by virtue of which the said corporation was created.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">That after the passage \u2022 of. said act the corporation -thereby created proceeded to organize themselves in the manner prescribed in said act, and commenced the business designated in said act. That in the years 1856, 1857, and 1858, the said corporation did business as such corporation in the city of Rew York. That some time in the year 1858 the said corporation discontinued their business.

The said judgment was duly made or given, and now remains of record in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-10\">That on the 3d of March, 1858, the plaintiffs issued and delivered to the sheriff of the city and county of New York an execution upon said judgment against the property of said corporation, to obtain payment and satisfaction of said judgment.

And that any other creditor of said corporation who is entitled to participate in said money, may have the like relief, or such other or further relief as the court may direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">Various demurrers were interposed to this complaint, all objecting that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and several that there was a misjoinder of causes of action, and defect of parties. The demurrers were tried before Hr. Justice Hogeboom, who sustained the same. (10 <em>Ahbotts\u2019 Pr., </em>229.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">The plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-8\"><em>William Curtis Noyes, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-9\"><em>Clarkson N. Potter, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahu\">I. It does not appear plaintiffs brought their action against the company within one year after their debt became due. They made various sales in 1856. They began their suit, February 10, 1857. All their sales payable prior to February 10, 1856, they cannot recover of stockholders for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-10\">II. But if it were otherwise, this action would not lie. The defendants\u2019 liability, if any, to the plaintiffs, arises under the act of incorporation, section 11, which provides that the stockholders shall be \u201c severally individually liable\u201d to the creditors of the company to an amount of stock in their names, &amp;c. Severally is not jointly, and relates rather to the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>remedy </em>than their <em>right. </em>No authority or indication is given by the statute that a joint suit, or any suit looking to a general accounting, can be sustained. The whole theory of the statute is, that a creditor shall first exhaust his remedy against the property of the company by sequestration, then resort to the liability of the stockholders to. make up the deficiency. (3 <em>Per. Slat., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>5 ed., '766, \u00a758.) This bill has nothing of the kind in it. There is no application to sequestrate the property of the corporation, even as incidental to a general accounting. ' PTo proceeding to exhaust its property first. Had it been such a suit, it would have been multifarious and improper. It joins parties without its appearing whether they held stock at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 debt -was contracted. (Judson <em>a. </em>Rossie Galena Co., 1 <em>Paige, </em>598.) And had it been in proper form in this respect, against stockholders jointly and severally, it would still have been improper. (2b.) The omission to show this would wholly deprive the plaintiff of his <em>locus standi. </em>It is an absolute \u25a0 prerequisite to a recovery, that the defendants should be stockholders at that time. If it were a bill to account it would not lie. Bills to account must be between privies in estate, contract, or interest. These stockholders are neither. PTo contract has been made; no estate is in question; no joint interest exists, for they are liable, if at all, \u201cseverally individually\u201d to the creditor\u2019s.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">HI. So far as it purports to be a bill for accounting, it ought not to lie. The question is not what rights the other judgment-creditors have, but what is the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. They cannot have any, so far as they seek to recover their debt (which is their sole basis for any claim) in this way. The method is prescribed by the statute itself. The statute of sequestration of corporations clearly points out, that the receiver, as officer of the court, stands charged with the duty of settling the affairs of an insolvent corporation. The act of incorporation of the steamship company, comes in aid of the first statute, and simply gives additional guaranties to creditors, assets to the company, and power to the receiver. It is better that this power of the court, now so thoroughly understood and elaborated, should be exercised, than that the unfortunate stockholders, or equally unfortunate creditors, should be subjected to the multiplied suits, proceedings, orders, and counter-orders, which have been brought against the defendants above-named. There being at least six bills in equity, and as many suits at law, to accomplish the result here sought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">IV. But the defendants Brown are trustees. They are not liable, but only their trust-fund. Can they be sued without notice; without payment demanded; without being asked to disclose whether their trust still exists, or the liability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>fund under this charter has been exhausted, or any averment that they have funds in their hands? And surely they cannot be included in a general- suit like this. (Alger <em>a. </em>Scoville, 6 <em>How. </em>Pr., 131.) Hor a suit be brought against them as trustees and individuals at the same time. (Landau <em>a. </em>Levy, 1 <em>Ab</em>botts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>376; McMahon <em>a. </em>Allen, 3 <em>Ib., </em>89; Latting <em>a. </em>Latting, 4 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>31.) Here are three suits against stockholders, whose liability is charged from mere omission to file a certificate\u2014a liability\u2014simply legal and statutory\u2014to have these suits commenced without inquiry or notice of demand; to recover in some way unauthorized by statute, or to find out what could have been had by asking, thus swelling costs to no end, is surely most unjust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">V. It is not charged that these defendants were stockholders when the debt was contracted\u2014if not, they are not liable. (Moss <em>a. </em>Oakley, 2 <em>Hill, </em>265; Adderly <em>a. </em>Storm; 6 <em>Ib., </em>624; Tracy <em>a. </em>Yates, 18 <em>Barb., </em>152, 155.) Hor is this doctrine reversed in McCullough <em>a. </em>Moss (5 <em>Den., </em>567).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b93-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">The defendants were not jointly liable in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The complaint should also show that they were stockholders when the debt was contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs in both cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
