Eoble, an attorney, to recover certain moneys all\u00e9ged to have been placed in his hands by the plaintiff. It appeared from the complaint, that the plaintiff had employed defendant as his attorney in managing his affairs as executor' of the estate of Ann Levins, deceased, and that in his character, as such attorney, he had paid to and deposited with him certain moneys, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>amounting to $947.60, for the repayment of which he demanded judgment. Upon an affidavit, setting forth the facts more fully, but in accordance with the complaint, an order of arrest was issued. A motion was subsequently made by the defendant upon affidavit to vacate the same. The motion was granted and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-5\"><em>George V. N. </em>Baldwin, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azqq\">I. Where the cause of action has been practically sworn to, the courts have refused to hear counter-affidavits where the ground of the application for discharge constituted a defence to the action. (Welsh <em>a. </em>Hill, 2 Johns., 100; Watkinson <em>a. </em>Langton, <em>Ib., </em>307; Hart a. Falconer, 5 <em>Ib., </em>262; <em>Petersdorf on Bail, </em>194.) Affidavits involving the merits of the action should not be heard. (Copeland <em>a. </em>Childs, 18 <em>Eng. L. &amp; E., </em>375.) The Code must be reconciled with the old practice: (Corwin <em>a. </em>Freeland, 6. <em>N. Y., </em>561; Frost <em>a. </em>McCarger, 14 <em>How. Pr., </em>131; Gellen <em>a. </em>Seixas, 4 <em>Abbotts' Pr., </em>103; 2 <em>Hilt., </em>179.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\">II. Where the defendant makes a case which may properly be brought before a jury, the court should deny a motion to set aside an order of arrest where the cause of action and the facts authorizing the order of arrest are identical. (Frost <em>a. </em>McCarger, 14 <em>How. Pr., </em>131; Barret <em>a. </em>Gracie, 34 <em>Barb., </em>20; Anonymous, 6 <em>Abbotts\u2019 Pr., </em>319, <em>note.) </em>But in any event, on such motion, the burden of proof is upon the defendant, and must satisfy the court that his defence will certainly be established on the trial. (Republic of Mexico <em>a. </em>Arrangoiz, 5 <em>Duer, </em>634; Barrow <em>a. </em>Sandford, 14 <em>How. Pr., </em>443; Courtland <em>a. </em>Davis, 4 <em>Bosw., </em>619; Corwin <em>a. </em>Freeland, 6 <em>N. Y., </em>56.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-7\"><em>Solomon B.

The rule in such cases is, that the order of arrest will not be discharged unless the defendant clearly makes out such a case as would call on the judge presiding at the trial to either nonsuit the plaintiff or direct a verdict for defendant. (Frost <em>a. </em>McCarger, 14 <em>How. </em>Pr., 131; Barret <em>a. </em>Gracie, 34 <em>Barb., </em>20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The defendant here has evidently not made out such a case. Indeed, after a careful examination of the papers, I have been unable to detect any preponderance of proof in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Order reversed, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\"> Present, Ingraham, P.
