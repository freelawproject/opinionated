With the view of obtaining costs in the action the plaintiff applied for a certificate that \u2022 the title to land came in question.

The lease under which plaintiff claimed was distinctly admitted in the answer, and all testimony in reference to the lease was unnecessarily introduced. (Rathbone <em>a. </em>McConnel, 20 <em>Barb., </em>311.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-10\">II. <em>The fact of possession </em>was specially set forth in the answer. This was the material question at issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-11\">III. The defendant simply claims to have held possession of the premises'by virtue of an understanding with the plaintiff which amounted to a license and not to a lease or a trust. (Bunel. <em>a. </em>Kelly, 10 <em>How. Pr., </em>406; Ehle <em>a. </em>Quackenbush, 6 <em>Hill, </em>537; Chandler <em>a. </em>Duane, 10 <em>Wend., </em>563; Radley <em>a. </em>Rice, 6 <em>Ib., </em>539; Brown <em>a. </em>Majors, 7 <em>Ib., </em>495.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-12\">Robertson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5p\">This is an application for a certificate that the title to land came in question under \u00a7\u00a7 54 and 304 of the Code. The action was for a trespass in entering upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises unlawfully and carrying away certain movables belonging to him. The answer denies every allegation in the complaint not therein specifically admitted. It alleges that the defendant was \u201c <em>in lawful occupation and possession </em>of the premises in question, with the knowledge, consent, and approval of the plaintiff, and also that <em>the latter took a lease there</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>for, for a year, </em>and it <em>was understood and agreed </em>between them that \u201c such lease should be for the benefit of the defendant,\u201d and <em>\u201cin aeoordance with that understanding, </em>he occupied the premises and paid the rent.\u201d The rest of the answer refers to the other wrongs alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defence in regard to breaking the plaintiff\u2019s close, therefore, seems to be a justification both by the understanding between the parties, that the interest in the land obtained by the plaintiff should be for the defendant\u2019s benefit, and his occupation of the premises with the former\u2019s consent. This substantially admits the plaintiff\u2019s legal title to the <em>locus in guo, </em>but justifies the act complained of either by the claim of a license to occupy, or tenancy on sufferance, or some right arising out of holding the premises for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The term <em>\u201ctitle\u201d </em>in the statute is held to mean \u201cright of possession\u201d (Ehle <em>a. </em>Quackenboss, 6 <em>Hill, 537), </em>and of course legal possession. It does not include <em>either possession in fact </em>or mere <em>right of property (Ib), </em>and where <em>actual possession </em>is enough to maintain the action, evidence in regard to that does not draw the title in question, although it may be the basis of a right. The trespass in this case was a technical one of entering to carry off movables, and a mere temporary one, not extending to retaining possession, which might be justified under a claim of title. The injury committed was the temporary disturbance of possession only. The answer does not defend the act on the score of right adversely to the plaintiff\u2019s title, but in subordination to it by his agreement and permission. A plea of a license does not bring the title to land in question. (Chandler <em>a. </em>Duane, 10 <em>Wend., </em>563; People <em>a. </em>N. Y. Com. Pl, 18 <em>Ib., 579.) </em>Proof of possession by the plaintiff was all that was necessary under the pleadings, if the defendant had violated it. The evidence given on the trial consisted only of the production of a lease which was admitted in the answer, the rest of the evidence of a trespass consisted in resisting the defendant\u2019s claim of entry and occupation by license of the plaintiff. The principal damage done being by carrying off the personal property, there being no injury to the premises committed, it looks as if the suit were brought for trespass, to get full costs although the damages were under 50 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">I do not think it a proper case for a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
