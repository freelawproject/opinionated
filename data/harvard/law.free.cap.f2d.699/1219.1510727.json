Since 1974, the FCC\u2019s Telecommunications Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) has periodically met with representatives of foreign telecommunications administrations and carriers to discuss matters of common concern, particularly the planning of shared facilities. These gatherings, known as \u201cconsultative process\u201d (\u201cCP\u201d) meetings, have routinely been transcribed and open to all interested parties, including representatives of American carriers. Beginning late in 1979, however, the Committee moved to expand the focus of the CP meetings and to exclude American carriers from the expanded discussions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-30\">One of the excluded carriers, ITT World Communications, Inc. (\u201cITT\u201d), has since engaged in a two-front campaign to have these meetings reopened. The present appeals concern both prongs of that campaign. In Numbers 80-2324 and 80-2401, ITT appeals a judgment of the district court dismissing its complaint that the Committee\u2019s actions at the closed meetings are <em>ultra vires. </em>The Commission cross-appeals accompanying judgments rendered against it under FOIA and the Sunshine Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Number 80-1721, ITT petitions for review of a Commission order denying its petition for a rulemaking that would establish regulations governing the conduct of the CP.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-31\">For the reasons set forth below, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-32\">(1) reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of ITT\u2019s <em>ultra vires </em>complaint and remand for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-33\">(2) affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand in part the district court\u2019s order directing the Commission to disclose all materials identified in response to ITT\u2019s FOIA request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-34\">(3) affirm the district court\u2019s determination that the CP meetings are governed by the provisions of the Sunshine Act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-35\">(4) reverse in part and remand in part the Commission\u2019s rulemaking denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"AGm9\">A. <em>The Closed CP Meetings</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACLI\">International record service<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> has long been dominated, at the American end, by four firms known as the International Record Carriers (\u201cIRCs\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ITT is one of those carriers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In an effort to foster greater competition in this field,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Commission in 1977 authorized two smaller common carriers, GTE Telenet Communications Corp. (\u201cTelenet\u201d) and Graphnet Systems, Inc. (\u201cGraphnet\u201d), to offer specialized international service.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s competition policy, however, has met a formidable obstacle: American carriers obviously cannot provide international service without links to correspondent carriers abroad,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and to date Telenet and Graphnet have been unable to secure interconnection agreements with European administrators.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The foreign administrations apparently oppose greater competition in the private sector, preferring instead to deal exclusively with the established American carriers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>In response, the Commission in 1979 turned to the consultative process as a forum for encouraging foreign cooperation with the newly authorized carriers. The CP had been initiated five years earlier as a means to exchange and discuss technical information related to the operation of jointly owned communications facilities; meetings were transcribed and open to all interested parties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At the October 1979 CP meeting in Dublin, Ireland, however, the Telecommunications Committee persuaded its foreign counterparts to expand the meeting\u2019s focus to include \u201cthe United States\u2019 authorization of new telecommunications services and carriers,\u201d and to exclude representatives of American carriers from this part of the meeting.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition to the Dublin meeting, a February 1980 meeting in Ascot, England, and an October 1980 meeting in Madrid, Spain, were closed during discussions of this topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">The specific nature of these off-the-record discussions is sharply contested and cuts to the heart of these appeals. Conceding that \u201cinternational negotiation is the province of the State Department,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Commission characterizes the closed encounters as merely \u201cinformal talks\u201d that, like the public CP meetings, facilitate \u201cthe exchange of information and views.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> More precisely, the sessions are designed \u201cto improve foreign understanding of the bases for and the nature of our pro-competition policies and, at the same time, to increase our knowledge of any unique telecommunications problems or policies which may exist in a particular country.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> According to the Commission, the Committee does not officially lobby on the Commission\u2019s behalf: To the extent that \u201csome commissioners have <em>encouraged </em>the foreign entities to cooperate with the policies of the FCC,\u201d as opposed to merely <em>informing </em>them of Commission policies, \u201cthese comments represent the personal views of the Commissioners, not official agency policy ....\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">ITT argues that the Committee\u2019s efforts at the closed meetings constitute negotiation, and there is considerable evidence that would appear to contradict the Commission\u2019s characterization of the discussions as mere unofficial \u201cinformation exchanges.\u201d First, the Commission concedes that Committee members attend CP meetings in their official capacities,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and indeed argues that their attendance is necessary to discharge its statutory duty to regulate inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>national communications.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, Commission representatives have described the closed exchanges as a \u201cmechanism\u201d to \u201cnarrow differences and to move toward consensus ... on common principles and approaches\u201d; <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Commission acknowledges that such consensus is designed to \u201clead ultimately to operating agreements for ITT\u2019s competitors.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, ITT presents evidence that the Commission has used the meetings as a forum to advise foreign administrations of a linkage between their cooperation with the newly authorized American carriers and the Commission\u2019s receptivity to their needs in other areas.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">B. <em>The Rulemaking Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">ITT filed a petition for rulemaking on October 29, 1979. After questioning the Commission\u2019s authority to meet privately with foreign administrations on behalf of individual American carriers, ITT proposed that if such contacts continue they should be governed by published rules of policy and procedure. Such rules, it argued, are necessary to guard against Commission prejudgment of pending and future proceedings, to protect against <em>ex parte </em>influences, to ensure an effective record for judicial scrutiny of any disputes growing out of the meetings, and generally to enhance the quality of the CP exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">ITT characterized its proposed rules as addressed to \u201cthe what\u201d and \u201cthe how\u201d of CP meetings <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> With respect to \u201cthe what,\u201d ITT proposed that the Commission (1) \u201cexpressly disclaim[] any intention to negotiate with foreign administrations\u201d;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (2) delineate the authority of commissioners attending CP meetings; and (3) direct commissioners to refrain from discussing pending proceedings at the meetings or \u201cadvancing the interest of one American carrier or service at the expense of any other.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> With respect to \u201cthe how,\u201d ITT proposed that the Commission (1) require the transcription or recording of all CP meetings; (2) open the meetings to the public in accordance with the requirements of the Sunshine Act; (3) provide comprehensive notice-and-comment procedures prior to the meetings;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and (4) provide an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>for interested parties to make oral or written presentations at the meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">After receiving comments and reply comments,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the Commission on May 2, 1980, released its order denying ITT\u2019s petition. The Commission addressed itself to four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-5\">(1) whether the Commission has engaged in \u201cnegotiations\u201d; (2) whether the Commission has statutory power to make <em>any </em>contacts with foreign governments or telecommunications entities; (3) whether the <em>Government in the Sunshine Act </em>is applicable; and (4) whether there are <em>ex parte </em>and other due process questions involved here.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">The Commission devoted a substantial part of its discussion to the first issue. Characterizing the closed discussions as \u201c[i]nformal talks ... to improve foreign understanding,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it insisted that it had not ventured \u201cinto the area of formal international negotiation.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> According to the Commission, negotiation \u201cconnotes a formal diplomatic process for the development and formulation of various kinds of binding executive agreements and treaties.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The parties at the CP meetings, however, have not formulated such accords. Moreover, \u201cparticipants in such negotiations ordinarily have authority to speak for their respective countries and to commit them,\u201d subject to formal ratification procedures.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Telecommunications Committee, on the other hand, has no authority to bind our government to any agreements. This lack of negotiating authority, the Commission added, is clearly understood by foreign administrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">Turning to its authority to engage in informal talks, so construed, the Commission concluded that \u201ccontacts with foreign administrations are not only permissible but are encouraged by the Communications Act.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Citing sections in the Act that grant it authority to license international communication by wire and radio,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> the Commission characterized the discussions as a means to \u201cadvance our progress toward realization of statutory goals\u201d and as \u201ca necessary and natural corollary\u201d of its statutory authority.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">The Commission then considered whether the CP discussions are \u201cmeetings\u201d within the meaning of the Sunshine Act. The Act defines a \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201cthe deliberations of at least the number of individual agency members required to take action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that, for two reasons, this definition does not encompass the consultative process. First, the presence of at least four of the seven commissioners \u2014 a quorum \u2014 is required for the Commission to transact business, unless it delegates authority pursuant to 47 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>\u00a7 155(d)(1) (1976).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Commission has not delegated authority to the Committee to act on its behalf at the CP sessions, however, and because only three commissioners sit on the Committee, the threshold requirement of an authorized quorum has not been met. Second, because informal exchanges of information are not a \u201cdeliberative process,\u201d the Committee\u2019s activities do not constitute \u201cthe joint conduct or disposition of official agency business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">The Commission concluded that \u201c[mjost of ITT\u2019s remaining arguments are in reality addressed to the advisability, rather than the legality, of informal discussions with foreign administrations.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It labelled ITT\u2019s prejudgment and <em>ex parte </em>arguments as \u201cspeculative,\u201d and argued that existing rules adequately protect against these dangers.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">The Commission did, however, announce that as a discretionary matter it would (1) provide a notice-and-comment period on the time and place of each individual meeting, the persons expected to attend, and the topics to be discussed; (2) open the meetings to observers \u201cunless it is determined that circumstances exist which warrant closure\u201d;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and (3) hold public briefings before and after the meetings. The Commission emphasized that \u201c[tjhese procedures are flexible, and we expressly reserve the right to depart from them where necessary to accommodate any special circumstances which may arise with respect to a specific conference.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">This petition for review followed. ITT maintains that the Commission\u2019s order denying its rulemaking petition is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">C. <em>The District Court Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">ITT filed this action on February 12, 1980, while the Commission was considering its rulemaking petition.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Its complaint asserts three claims for relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">Count I (\u201cthe <em>ultra vires </em>count\u201d) alleges that the Commission has used the closed CP meetings to negotiate with foreign governments on behalf of ITT\u2019s competitors, and it asserts that the alleged negotiations \u201care unlawful and <em>ultra vires, </em>and in excess of the authority conferred on the FCC by the Communications Act.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The count asks for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">Count II (\u201cthe FOIA count\u201d) seeks disclosure under FOIA of a number of documents pertaining to the regulation of international record service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">Count III (\u201cThe Sunshine Act count\u201d) alleges that the Telecommunications Committee\u2019s participation in the closed CP discussions violates the Sunshine Act\u2019s open meeting rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">The Commission moved for dismissal or summary judgment, and ITT cross-moved for summary judgment on the FOIA and Sunshine Act counts. The district court (1) dismissed the <em>ultra vires </em>count, holding that ITT did not have standing to secure judicial review and that the issue was not ripe for adjudication; (2) granted ITT\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the FOIA count, holding that the Commission had failed to substantiate its claim of \u201cdeliberative process\u201d privilege with respect to the disputed documents; and (3) granted ITT\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Sunshine Act count, holding that the CP discussions are \u201cmeetings\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-19\">ITT appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the <em>ultra vires </em>count. The Commission cross-appeals the court\u2019s summary judgment on the FOIA and Sunshine Act counts. Because our review of the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>court action sheds considerable light on issues presented by the rulemaking denial, we first consider in turn the three counts of ITT\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">II. The <em>Ultra Vires </em>Count</p>\n<p id=\"AHpT\">The district court \u201cseriously doubt[ed]\u201d whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over the <em>ultra vires </em>count.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> It did not reach this issue, however, dismissing instead on standing and ripeness grounds. We conclude that the district court\u2019s reservations about its jurisdiction were unfounded and that it erred in its rulings on standing and ripeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">A. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ak_r\">ITT argues that the district court has jurisdiction to hear the <em>ultra vires </em>claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1976 &amp; Supp. Y 1981), the general grant of federal question jurisdiction. The Commission counters that jurisdiction over the issue lies exclusively with this court as part of our review of the order denying ITT\u2019s petition for rulemaking. Invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1) (1976) and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a) (1976), which together grant exclusive jurisdiction to review FCC final orders to the courts of appeals, the Commission argues that the <em>ultra vires </em>count is a collateral attack against that part of its order defining the scope of its authority to meet with foreign administrations. District court intervention, the Commission contends, would therefore circumvent the prescribed review procedure and require an \u201cunwarranted duplication of the work of the Court of Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">A strong presumption against concurrent district court jurisdiction would be appropriate if the issues presented by ITT\u2019s rule-making petition and its <em>ultra vires </em>count were indeed identical.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s argument, however, blurs an important distinction between the rulemaking petition and the <em>ultra vires </em>count. The petition asked the Commission for a declaration of the nature of its authority with respect to the CP meetings and argued that \u201cnegotiation\u201d is outside the scope of that authority. The Commission fully agreed that it has no authority to negotiate, but it disagreed as to the necessity of rules spelling out this lack of authority with greater clarity. The gravamen of the <em>ultra vires </em>count is very different. There ITT asserts that the Commission, irrespective of what it acknowledges as the proper scope of its authority, has <em>in fact </em>secretly exceeded that authority and will not admit to having done so. Contrary to the Commission\u2019s argument that\" \u201c[t]he specific content of the CP meetings is only evidence for [the] general issue\u201d of the scope of its authority,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> the \u201ccontent\u201d of the meetings is <em>itself </em>the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">We have emphasized that the jurisdiction of the district courts is properly invoked where <em>de novo </em>judicial factfinding is necessary for a fair examination of the disputed issues.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The instant controversy presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>paradigm of this circumstance. Rather than call for review of an agency action that has itself been embodied in a record, the <em>ultra vires </em>count requires scrutiny of conduct occurring outside the formal administrative process. The agency \u201crecord\u201d in the rulemaking denial, which consists simply of the Commission\u2019s conclusory assertions that it has not negotiated and of certain statements by Commission officials that contradict these assertions, is manifestly inadequate for such an evaluation.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> ITT\u2019s colorable <em>ultra vires </em>claim can therefore be tested only through the kind of independent, <em>de novo </em>factfinding appropriate in the district court.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The Commission seems to argue, however, that even if its <em>instant </em>order does not provide a suitable vehicle for review, <em>future </em>agency actions based on its alleged <em>ultra vires </em>conduct would, so that district court intervention would nevertheless be unwarranted. Thus, the Commission asserts that if it \u201ctake[s] some action detrimental to ITT in the future, as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for European cooperation today,\u201d ITT \u201cwould have the opportunity ... to challenge <em>that </em>action and its basis\u201d in a statutory review proceeding.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-11\">Again, however, the Commission misstates the focus of ITT\u2019s allegations. Where an agency action is not reviewable in the courts of appeals, district court jurisdiction may nevertheless be inappropriate if the action is interlocutory in nature and can be corrected on court-of-appeals scrutiny of a subsequent, final action.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> We have emphasized, however, that such preclusion of district court review is inappropriate where the challenged action would be \u201cbeyond the capabilities of the statutorily-prescribed methods of review to repair.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Such a danger of \u201cirretrievable subversion\u201d of ITT\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> is readily apparent in this case. The Committee\u2019s activities at the CP meetings are not calculated to result in a final order, but rather to lead to unreviewable action by foreign administrations. Thus, as we discuss more fully in Part II-C below, subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings would not likely provide an adequate remedy for the Commission\u2019s alleged misconduct. The district court therefore has subject matter jurisdiction over the <em>ultra vires </em>count.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>B. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a party has standing to secure judicial review of any \u201cagency action\u201d that causes a \u201clegal wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The district court held that ITT has not suffered a legal wrong, reading its complaint solely to allege a violation of the Logan Act\u2019s prohibition of unauthorized negotiation with foreign governments.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Because only the Department of State is aggrieved by violations of that criminal statute, the court reasoned, ITT\u2019s alleged injury is not legally cognizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">We respectfully conclude that the district court misread ITT\u2019s complaint. The gravamen of ITT\u2019s allegation is quite specific: \u201cThe activities of the FCC ... are unlawful and <em>ultra vires, </em>and in excess of the authority conferred on the Commission by the <em>Communications </em>Act.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Whether the complaint\u2019s two references to the Logan Act<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> should be construed as an attempt to state a separate cause of action (as the Commission insists) or as mere illustrative matter not intended to assert a claim (as ITT argues), a cause of action under the Communications Act has clearly been alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">As a regulated carrier, ITT has standing to complain of <em>ultra vires </em>Commission actions that threaten it with competitive injury.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> If ITT\u2019s allegations are correct,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> the Commission is engaged in a course of conduct that clearly rises to the level of reviewable \u201cagency action.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> If successful, that action will cause substantial injury to ITT\u2019s economic interests.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>over, there can be no question that the interests sought to be protected by ITT are within the Communications Act\u2019s broad zone of protected interests.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s argument that ITT has no right to avoid enhanced competition misses the mark. ITT has standing to insist that the Commission <em>implement </em>its competition policy in a manner that does not exceed its authority under the Communications Act.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">C. <em>Ripeness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The district court held that the <em>ultra vires </em>count was not ripe for adjudication, reasoning that \u201c[t]he two new carriers have not yet been accepted by the foreign entities. When and if they are so accepted, Plaintiff can object through the formal rulemaking process, and derive relief if its claim is cognizable and meritorious.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">This holding is flawed under familiar ripeness doctrine, which requires an evaluation of (1) \u201c[t]he fitness of the issues for judicial decision,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The Committee has already engaged in three closed meetings with foreign administrations. The threatened injury to ITT resulting from these encounters does not depend on other types of Commission action. The issue whether the Committee\u2019s efforts at the meetings were unlawful is therefore eminently fit for judicial consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">Moreover, contrary to the district court\u2019s reasoning, a subsequent judicial proceeding would not likely provide an adequate remedy for the Commission\u2019s alleged misconduct.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Actions by foreign administrations obviously could not be overturned in American fora, and the new carriers\u2019 certificates of public convenience and necessity, awarded before the Committee began to meet privately with foreign administrations, could not be revoked on the basis of subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>quent Commission misdeeds. In addition, prospective rulemaking after the foreign administrations had acted could not undo the harm that ITT seeks to prevent: coerced entry of foreign administrations into agreements with Telenet and Graphnet. The <em>ultra vires </em>issue is therefore ripe for judicial consideration.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">III. The FOIA Count</p>\n<p id=\"Ase\">Three days after the first closed meeting in Dublin, ITT requested the Commission to identify and release all agency communications \u201cwith respect to dealings or possible dealings between foreign correspondents and U.S. carriers not now providing international services through direct connections with foreign correspondents.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The Commission released eight items but withheld fifteen others.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> After exhausting its administrative remedies,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> ITT brought this action to compel disclosure of those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">The Commission relies exclusively on the executive \u201cdeliberative process\u201d privilege embodied in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) (1976) (\u201cExemption 5\u201d), which protects from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> To sustain its burden of proof,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> the Commission submitted an index to the documents, five affidavits, and a memorandum of points and authorities.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">The fourteen items still being withheld<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> fall into three broad categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">(A) Seven items do not pertain directly to the CP meetings, but instead to specific docket proceedings concerning carrier authorizations and facilities planning.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>(B) Six items are background memoranda and draft statements for the use of commissioners in their contacts with foreign administrations.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">(C) One item is a compilation of staff members\u2019 notes reporting the substance of the CP discussions in Dublin.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">The district court granted ITT\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered the Commission to release all fourteen items. The court\u2019s analysis was limited to one short paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-6\">In the instant case, <em>the FCC cites no specific policy or process in order to protect the documents in question. </em>In fact, they [sic] consistently defend the Consultative Process as a means of receiving information without having to formulate policy or utilize United States regulatory jurisdiction.... Upholding the use of Exemption 5 in the instant case \u201cwould go a long way toward undercutting the entire Freedom of Information Act,\u201d . .. and detract from the Act\u2019s dominant objective of disclosure.... The documents at issue herein must be disclosed.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">We have recurrently emphasized that \u201cDistrict Court decisions in FOIA cases must provide statements of law that are both accurate and sufficiently detailed to establish that the careful <em>de novo </em>review prescribed by Congress has in fact taken place.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Our review of the materials submitted by the Commission leads us to con-elude that the district court\u2019s evaluation of the instant items did not reflect the quality of <em>de novo </em>review required by this standard. With respect to the documents listed in categories (A) and (B), we accordingly reverse the district court\u2019s disclosure order and remand for additional <em>de novo </em>proceedings.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Our decision does not apply to item 7, however, for we conclude that the Commission failed to carry its burden of establishing its right to withhold any of the material therein. Turning to the item listed in category (C), we conclude that the Commission has failed to carry its burden of proof, and we accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s disclosure order with respect to that item.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-15\">A. <em>Material Pertaining to Commission Docket Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-16\">With one exception, each of these seven items was prepared by staff attorneys or engineering assistants to advise Commission officials on pending docket proceedings.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Item 4 is a legal analysis of the \u201cApplicability of Resale Decision to international communications market,\u201d and gives advice and opinions on the applications of Graphnet and Telenet to extend their services to overseas markets.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Item 9 recommends how the Commission should modify the Graphnet authorization to comply with a recent judicial decision.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Item 11 advises a commissioner how he should vote on a proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>authorization of a new transatlantic communications cable.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Item 12 contains similar recommendations regarding Commission authorization of a new communications satellite.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Item 13 contains, <em>inter alia, </em>recommendations on factors the Commission should consider when ruling on carrier applications, and analyses of issues raised by carriers in pending docket proceedings.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Item 14 analyzes a tariff filing by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and recommends how the Commission should respond.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Item 15 contains recommendations on whether the Commission should have a national security briefing by the Department of Defense in connection with a proposed transatlantic cable authorization.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">With respect to these items, the district court\u2019s sweeping assertion that \u201cthe FCC cites no specific policy or process in order to protect the documents\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> is clearly erroneous. The items bear all the indicia of predecisional status.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> They were written by subordinate agency personnel to advise Commission officials on issues presented in pending docket proceedings. The authors themselves had no decisionmaking authority; their memoranda were \u201crecommendatory\u201d and \u201cdeliberative in nature, weighing the pros and cons of agency adoption of one viewpoint or another.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The items contain suggestions that could \u201cbe freely disregarded\u201d; <footnotemark>98</footnotemark> rather than expressing \u201cthe law itself,\u201d they simply contain \u201cthe ideas and theories which go into the making of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Thus, the deliberative material in these items is without \u201cprecedential significance\u201d and cannot be considered \u201csecret law.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Finally, the Commission did not expressly adopt any of the material in these items when it issued its final decisions in the relevant proceedings.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s judgment ordering the disclosure of items 4, 9,11,12,13,14, and 15. In accordance with previous cases, we remand to the district court for <em>de novo </em>factual determinations of two segregability issues.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">First, the deliberative process privilege does not protect \u201cpurely factual material appearing in ... documents in a form that is severable without compromising the private remainder of the documents.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> On remand, the district court must ensure that <em>only </em>deliberative material in these items is withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Second, the privilege does not protect material that merely sets forth official agency views and practices with respect to the interpretation and implementation of existing policies.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> To the extent that some of the material in these items may \u201c \u2018embody the agency\u2019s effective law and policy,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> the district court must be certain that it is excised and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-12\">These determinations may well require the district court to \u201cexamine the contents of [the items] <em>In camera </em>to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld\u201d under Exemption 5.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> The court should also take care to provide a sufficiently detailed analysis to enable thorough appellat\u00e9 review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-13\">B. <em>Material Preparatory to the CP Discussions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1304-14\">There are six items in this category. Items 2 and 3 are drafts of telexes sent by Commission Chairman Charles Ferris to his Swedish and Canadian counterparts.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Items 5, 7, 8, and 10 are background memoranda for the use of commissioners attending the CP meetings, and are generally claimed to contain \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201coptions\u201d on issues to be discussed, and \u201cproposed responses should the parties reject\u201d Commission proposals.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>ITT argues, and the district court agreed, that because the Commission contends that the CP meetings <em>themselves </em>are not deliberative or decisional in nature, material preparatory to the meetings cannot be withheld. We agree that the Commission has engaged in much obfuscation about the substance of these discussions. It has, however, consistently stated that the meetings involve the exchange of information <em>and views </em>concerning its competition policy. There is an important distinction between the commissioners\u2019 actual statements and the drafts and background memoranda from which those statements emerged. The commissioners\u2019 remarks were statements of proposed action<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> and explanations of agency positions<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> that, as we discuss below, are not exempt from disclosure.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> The instant items, on the other hand, are the raw materials that went into the formulation of those remarks. Like the items discussed in part III-A, they are documents from subordinates to superiors that are merely recommendatory in nature.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> We have held that \u201cinternal self-evaluation[s] ... about the relative merits of various positions which might be adopted\u201d in agency dealings with the public normally fall within the deliberative privilege; this protection extends to \u201cdiscussion of the merits of past efforts, alternatives currently available, and recommendations as to future strategy.\u201d<footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-12\">Moreover, the policies behind the deliberative privilege apply in full force to this advisory material. Disclosure might well discourage subordinates from \u201cprovid[ing] ... their uninhibited opinions and recommendations without fear of later being subject to public ridicule or criticism.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Disclosure might also \u201cconfus[e] the issues and mislead[ ] the public by ... suggesting reasons and rationales for a course of action which were not in fact the ultimate reasons for the agency\u2019s action.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1305-14\">We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s disclosure order with respect to most of these items. We have examined the final telex that resulted from the drafts in item 2;<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> it consists entirely of policy proposals, and we see no purpose in remanding for further factual findings. With respect to items 3, 5, 8, and 10, however, we remand to the district court for segregability determinations in accordance with our discussion in Part III-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-15\">We emphasize an important caveat. A consistent assumption running through judicial decisions permitting nondisclosure of deliberative material has been that the <em>actual </em>policy or legal positions adopted will be disclosed to the public.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> The district court should be certain that the disclosed documents and other material will provide the public a sufficient view of the Committee\u2019s efforts at the CP meetings. If they do not, release of some of the material in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>items, to the extent that it reflects positions actually taken, may well be necessary to give the public an adequate understanding of the Committee\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">Our decision does not apply to item 7.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> The affidavit submitted by its author stated simply that the document \u201ccontained my thoughts on what information would be useful to the Commissioners in discussing\u201d two issues at the Dublin conference.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> This characterization could easily extend to simple summaries of factual information, which, as we discuss below, are not exempt from FOIA disclosure.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The Commission therefore failed to carry its burden of establishing any right to withhold this document,<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment ordering its disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">C. <em>Material Reporting the CP Discussions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">Item 1 is a compilation of staff members\u2019 notes reporting the substance of the closed CP exchange at Dublin.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that this material must be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-7\">Communications between agency members and persons from outside the agency generally are not protected by the deliberative process privilege.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Because these notes embody such communications, they cannot acquire predecisional status simply by virtue of being circulated within the agency. Moreover, reports of extra-agency discussions are factual in nature; courts have long emphasized that factual material usually is not exempt from disclosure.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> And unlike the background evaluative material discussed above, commissioners\u2019 comments that may be reported in these notes are actual explanations of the Commission\u2019s policies and actions. Although the public has only a marginal interest in the release of inter-Commission material debating positions to be taken at international conferences, it has a substantial interest in knowing the positions that Committee members actually take.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-15\">The Commission advances three rationales against disclosure. First, it argues that \u201c[s]uch notes are evaluative, because the persons making them were not secretaries or other neutral observers, but were FCC staff attorneys, who can be expected to write down only those comments made by speakers at the meeting that they feel are significant.\u201d<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> This argument is similar to one we recently considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 in <em>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Justice.</em><footnotemark><em>127</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the government argued that a Justice Department investigative report reflected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>\u201cchoice, weighing and analysis of facts,\u201d and was therefore protected from disclosure by the deliberative privilege.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> We responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-5\">Anyone making a report must of necessity select the facts to be mentioned in it; but a report does not become a part of the deliberative process merely because it contains only those facts which the person making the report thinks material. If this were not so, every factual report would be protected as a part of the deliberative process.<footnotemark>129</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">Like <em>Playboy Enterprises, </em>this case is distinguishable from suits seeking disclosure of staff summaries of record evidence in adjudicatory and rulemaking proceedings.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> The courts in such cases have found that, where analyses are prepared for the sole purpose of evaluating the relative factual merits of different positions in pending proceedings, disclosure would invite \u201cprobing [of] the decision-making process itself.\u201d<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> Here, on the other hand, the Commission has cited no specific pending proceeding for which the notes were compiled, and in any event it has presented no evidence that the notes are evaluative in nature rather than straightforward factual narrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">The Commission argues, however, that the notes \u201cmay be used by the staff in making recommendations to the Commissioners concerning future consultative meetings.\u201d<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> We have rejected this sort of sweeping argument before. Such an interpretation would \u201cswallow up a substantial part of the administrative process\u201d and \u201cwould result in a huge mass of [factual] material being forever screened from public view.\u201d<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> It is not enough for an agency to assert that factual material \u201cmay be used\u201d in future deliberations; the agency must demonstrate that the material at issue is inextricably intertwined with a <em>specific </em>deliberative proceeding.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-15\">Finally, the Commission asserts that these notes are protected by the \u201crelated governmental privilege\u201d that protects \u201cinformation provided to the government by persons who would not provide information unless given a promise of confidentiality.\u201d <footnotemark>135</footnotemark> We need not consider the scope of this exemption,<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> however, for the Commission provided no evidence to the district court that confidential treatment had actually been promised to the foreign participants or that the foreigners would not otherwise have met with the Committee to discuss the Commission\u2019s competition policy.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">IV. The Sunshine Act Count</p>\n<p id=\"AM-\">The Government in the Sunshine Act is grounded on the principle that \u201cthe public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government.\u201d<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Act requires that all meetings of multi-member agencies be open to public observation.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> Meetings may be closed, however, where they would likely involve the discussion of information protected from disclosure under one or more of ten narrowly defined exemptions.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The sole question presented in this count is whether the consultative process exchanges are \u201cmeetings\u201d within the meaning of the Act. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that they are. We conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact, and we affirm. The public may therefore be excluded from these discussions only in accordance with the Act\u2019s stringent closure provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">The Sunshine Act defines a \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201cthe deliberations of at least the number of individual agency members required to take action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business.\u201d<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> Under the Act, the Commission bears the burden of demonstrating that this definition does not encompass the CP discussions.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark> It has advanced three arguments, which we consider in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">A. <em>The Authorization Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">To be a meeting covered by the Sunshine Act, a gathering must include \u201cat least the number of individual agency members required to take action on behalf of the agency.\u201d <footnotemark>143</footnotemark> This language requires the presence of <em>either </em>a quorum of the full agency <em>or </em>a quorum of a \u201csubdivision ... authorized to act on behalf of the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> Although it is undisputed that a quorum of the Telecommunications Committee attends the CP exchanges, the Commission argues that it has not \u201cauthorized\u201d the Committee to \u201cact\u201d on its behalf at the discussions. Because such an authorization could only be accomplished through an express delegation of power pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(d)(1) (1976),<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> the Commission contends, the threshold requirement of an authorized quorum has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">We disagree. The applicability of the Sunshine Act manifestly cannot turn on whether an agency has in fact followed proper procedures for delegating authority to a subdivision, for the requirements of the Act could otherwise be evaded at will. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>Commission concedes in the instant case that (1) Committee members attend CP exchanges in their \u201cofficial roles\u201d;<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> (2) their goal is to build a \u201cconsensus\u201d that will \u201clead ultimately to operating agreements for ITT\u2019s competitors\";<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> and (3) they convey the information and views \u201cexchanged\u201d at the meetings to the full Commission for its consideration.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> Indeed, the Commission insists in its rulemaking denial that the Committee\u2019s participation in the meetings is necessary for the Commission to carry out its statutory duty to regulate international communications.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> Whatever the actual scope of the Committee\u2019s endeavors, there can therefore be no question that they are undertaken \u201con behalf of\u201d the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">B. <em>\u201cConduct or Disposition of Official Agency Business\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">A more difficult question is whether the Committee\u2019s efforts are \u201cdeliberations [that] determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business.\u201d <footnotemark>150</footnotemark> The statutory language is ambiguous. \u201cDeliberations\u201d might be read narrowly to encompass solely the internal process of weighing and examining proposals that precedes a formal decision <em>by </em>the agency. On the other hand, \u201cconduct ... of official agency business\u201d suggests a much broader range of activity, including, <em>inter alia, </em>hearings and meetings with outsiders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">The Commission advances three arguments, based on the statutory language and the legislative history, in support of the narrow interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-15\">1. <em>\u201cOfficial Agency Business\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-16\">The Commission argues that the Committee does not transact \u201cofficial agency business\u201d at the meetings; members participate solely to \u201cexchange information and views,\u201d and not to vote, \u201cnegotiate,\u201d or otherwise engage in a \u201c \u2018rump\u2019 FCC meeting.\u201d<footnotemark>151</footnotemark> The Reports of the House and Senate Committees on Government Operations, however, clearly demonstrate that \u201cofficial agency business\u201d encompasses far more than simply \u201cagency actions\u201d of the sort reviewable under the APA.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> The Senate Report, for example, states that \u201c[i]n addition to business meetings of the agency,\u201d the definition of a covered meeting \u201cincludes <em>hearings and meetings with the public.\u201d </em><footnotemark>153</footnotemark> Similarly, both Reports indicate that subdivisions are covered by the Act where they are \u201cauthorized to submit recommendations, ... or to conduct hearings on behalf of the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> So long as hearings and meetings with outsiders result in the actual conduct of official business, agencies cannot avoid the openness requirements where they are otherwise subject to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-17\">The Commission has advanced no reason to distinguish the discussions at issue from \u201chearings\u201d or \u201cmeetings with the public.\u201d There can be no question, moreover, that the closed discussions involve agency business of the first import. These encounters play an integral role in the Commission\u2019s policymaking processes in at least two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>ways. First, the Commission has emphasized that the meetings are an important means for gathering information and opinions from foreign administrations, and that this material is essential in its deliberations regarding the future structure of international telecommunications.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> The Act extends to subdivisions\u2019 activities that result in the submission of \u201crecommendations,\u201d and we agree with the district court that the Commission has failed to rebut the common-sense presumption that the Committee\u2019s activities are, at least in part, evaluative and recommendatory in nature.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> Second, the success of the Commission\u2019s established competition policy depends on its achieving a \u201cconsensus\u201d and \u201cfavorable climate\u201d with foreign administrations,<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> and the agency has chosen the CP as the vehicle to assist Graphnet and Telenet in obtaining interconnection agreements. The broad sweep of the Sunshine Act does not support a distinction between an agency\u2019s <em>predecisional </em>activities and its <em>postdecisional </em>efforts to implement, interpret, and promote its policies. Both are important components of \u201cofficial agency business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">2. <em>Meetings \u201cof\u201d the Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">The Commission argues, however, that the CP discussions are not meetings <em>of </em>the Committee, but simply meetings attended <em>by </em>the Committee. Put another way, the discussions do not involve the \u201cjoint\u201d conduct of business <em>among </em>Committee members, but rather exchanges <em>between </em>the Committee and outside parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-11\">Again, this argument fails to overcome the presumption that agency hearings and meetings with outsiders be open to public observation. An agency cannot avoid this requirement through the facile expedient of having an outside party \u201chold\u201d the discussion, for the Sunshine Act\u2019s policy that hearings and meetings with the public be open could otherwise be ignored with impunity.<footnotemark>158</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-12\">Moreover, the intended meaning of the phrase \u201cjoint conduct\u201d offers the Commission little comfort. The House Report emphasizes that the phrase \u201cdoes not exclude the situation where a subdivision authorized to act on behalf of the agency meets with other individuals concerning the conduct or disposition of agency business.\u201d<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> Rather, the phrase was intended to exempt solely those situations \u201cwhere the requisite number of members is physically present in one place but not conducting agency business as a body.\u201d<footnotemark>160</footnotemark> Both the House and Senate Reports cite as an example a gathering where one member gives a speech concerning agency business while other members are in the audience.<footnotemark>161</footnotemark> The instant situation is readily distinguishable. The full Committee meets with its foreign counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>parts, and the record shows that all members are active participants in the give-and-take.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">3. <em>\u201cInformal Background </em>Discussions\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6oP\">The Commission relies heavily on a statement in the Senate Report that \u201c[i]t is not the intent of the bill to prevent any two agency members, regardles [sic] of agency size, from engaging in informal background discussions which clarify issues and expose varying views.\u201d<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> The Commission contends that the CP meetings are precisely the sort of discussions that Congress intended to exclude by this language. We conclude that this passage from the Senate Report, read in context, does not support the Commission\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">The definition of a \u201cmeeting\u201d was recurrently revised during the course of the legislative process.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> Many members of Congress, both supporters and opponents of the Act, were particularly concerned that the evolving definition might mechanically be extended to informal discussions among members that did not truly constitute the \u201cconduct\u201d of agency business. Examples cited included passing references to agency business at social gatherings,<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> casual background conversations in offices and corridors,<footnotemark>166</footnotemark> banter on the golf course,<footnotemark>167</footnotemark> and breakfast or luncheon discussions among members about the day\u2019s business.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">Although many legislators felt that the phrase \u201cconduct ... of official agency business\u201d <em>by definition </em>excludes such encounters,<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> the language cited by the Commission was inserted into the Senate Report to ensure that discussions of this sort were not construed as actual meetings. The Report emphasizes that the line between these kinds of informal encounters and those amounting to the actual conduct or disposition of agency business is fine, and it reiterates that the Act\u2019s presumption of openness requires that all doubts be resolved against closure.<footnotemark>170</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">The thrust of the language in the Senate Report therefore concerns \u201cinformal background discussions\u201d <em>among </em>agency members rather than <em>between </em>members and outsiders.<footnotemark>171</footnotemark> Although we believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>Sunshine Act does not <em>per se </em>forbid all informal off-the-record discussions between a quorum of an agency and outside parties, we conclude that an agency\u2019s burden of persuasion must be especially great in such situations. Congress intended that \u201chearings\u201d and \u201cmeetings with the public\u201d be open; many such gatherings could easily be characterized as \u201cinformal background discussions which clarify issues and expose varying views.\u201d If we did not apply the narrowest of interpretations to this language, it would readily swallow up the requirement of open \u201chearings\u201d and \u201cmeetings with the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">In the instant case, the Commission has failed to overcome the presumption in favor of openness. The CP discussions are not \u201cchance meetings,\u201d \u201csocial gatherings,\u201d or \u201cinformal discussions\u201d among members,<footnotemark>172</footnotemark> but prearranged conferences held to effectuate public business of the greatest import. They focus on concrete issues and are conducted to build a \u201cconsensus\u201d that will have far-reaching effects on the structure of the communications industry. They are, in short, an integral part of the Commission\u2019s policymaking processes, and as such they constitute the \u201cconduct ... of official agency business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">C. <em>Policy Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">The Commission invokes a number of \u201cadverse practical consequences\u201d that would allegedly result from extending the Sunshine Act to the consultative process.<footnotemark>173</footnotemark> These difficulties, the Commission argues, demonstrate that \u2014 \u201cat least in the absence of a clear statement by Congress\u201d \u2014 the Act should not be interpreted to cover meetings between an agency and its foreign counterparts.<footnotemark>174</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">The absence of a clear statement by Congress, however, cuts in the other direction.<footnotemark>175</footnotemark> The Sunshine Act\u2019s presumption in favor of open meetings is sweeping and, with the exception of enumerated exemptions, unqualified. The Commission points to nothing in the history or structure of the Act to indicate that Congress intended <em>sub silentio </em>to permit the closure of agency meetings simply because foreign representatives are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">Moreover, the Act permits agencies to close meetings that likely would involve the discussion of information exempted from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(c) (1976); the district court specifically invited the Commission to take advantage of this provision. For example, section 552b(c)(9) permits an agency to close meetings involving \u201cinformation the premature disclosure of which would ... be likely to frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action.\u201d Similarly, section 552b(c)(l) permits closure where discussions would involve national defense or foreign policy information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>that is exempt \u201cunder criteria established by an Executive order.\u201d<footnotemark>176</footnotemark> Thus, Congress fully recognized that certain meetings should not be open to public scrutiny. As we have emphasized, however, \u201c[t]he means Congress chose to accomplish this objective, .. . was to permit an agency to close a <em>particular </em>meeting on an <em>individual </em>basis because of the adverse impact public proceedings would be likely to have upon the rights of individuals and the ability of the government to function properly.\u201d<footnotemark>177</footnotemark> Rather than acting upon an \u201cindividual and particularized basis,\u201d<footnotemark>178</footnotemark> the Commission has sought to exempt an entire category of its business from the requirements of the Sunshine Act. We therefore reject the Commission\u2019s restrictive interpretation of \u201cmeetings\u201d covered by the Act.<footnotemark>179</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">V. The Rulemaking Denial</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">We turn finally to the Commission\u2019s order denying ITT\u2019s petition for rulemaking. Our scope of review is defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (1976), which requires that we \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with <em>law.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>180</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">We have noted that the arbitrary and capricious standard is not \u201ca fixed template to be imposed mechanically on every case,\u201d<footnotemark>181</footnotemark> but instead requires calibration in accordance with the nature and context of the challenged action. Where an agency promulgates rules, our standard of review is \u201cdiffident and deferential,\u201d<footnotemark>182</footnotemark> but nevertheless requires a \u201csearching and careful\u201d examination of the administrative record to ensure that the agency has fairly considered the issues and arrived at a rational result.<footnotemark>183</footnotemark> Where, as here, an agency chooses <em>not </em>to engage in rulemaking, our level of scrutiny is eve^ more deferential: \u201cIt is only in the rarest and most compel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>ling of circumstances that this court has acted to overturn an agency judgment not to institute rulemaking.\u201d<footnotemark>184</footnotemark> This added measure of deference, however, is appropriate only where the rejected proposal is addressed to matters within the agency\u2019s broad policy discretion.<footnotemark>185</footnotemark> Where a rule-making petition challenges an agency\u2019s compliance with substantive and procedural norms, on the other hand, our standard of review must perforce be \u201cexacting\u201d to ensure that the agency has \u201cscrupulously\u201d followed the law.<footnotemark>186</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">ITT\u2019s rulemaking petition involves both issues of discretion and questions of compliance with statutory and procedural commands. The Commission has considerable discretion, beyond the statutory minima, in fashioning rules for public participation in its processes.<footnotemark>187</footnotemark> Some of ITT\u2019s proposals go well beyond minimum statutory requirements, and the Commission might reasonably conclude that they are cumbersome and counterproductive.<footnotemark>188</footnotemark> On the other hand, many of the issues presented in the rulemaking petition call into question the Commission\u2019s compliance with the Communications Act, the APA, and the Sunshine Act. Our review of its disposition of these issues must be \u201cthorough, probing, [and] in-depth\u201d;<footnotemark>189</footnotemark> the Commission\u2019s explanation and the evidence it marshalls \u201cmust be such as to enable [us] to determine with some measure of confidence whether or not the [actions are] arbitrary [or] capricious.\u201d<footnotemark>190</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">Applying these standards, we reverse the Commission\u2019s rulemaking denial in part, and remand the remaining issues for further consideration in accordance with our discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">A. <em>The Sunshine Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">For the reasons set forth in Part IV, the CP discussions are \u201cmeetings\u201d within the meaning of the Sunshine Act, and are therefore governed by the Act\u2019s stringent closure provisions. In its rulemaking denial, however, the Commission concluded that these exchanges fall outside of the Sunshine Act\u2019s ambit.<footnotemark>191</footnotemark> This determination is not in accordance with law, and we therefore reverse this part of the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">B. <em>The Commission\u2019s Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-13\">The Commission\u2019s assessment of the scope of its authority deserves defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>ence.<footnotemark>192</footnotemark> Before we can sanction the Commission\u2019s course of conduct, however, we must ascertain the nature of its actions, its reasons for the actions, and whether those actions comport with the Communications Act and the APA.<footnotemark>193</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s explanations and the \u201crecord\u201d it has assembled are patently inadequate for such a determination.<footnotemark>194</footnotemark> We are asked, in essence, to approve of actions about which we know almost nothing. The record consists simply of the Commission\u2019s assertions that it has not negotiated, and of numerous statements by agency members that would appear to undercut these assertions. Self-serving representations are no substitute for an adequate record that would enable us to determine with confidence the actual scope of the Commission\u2019s endeavors. By refusing to develop any such record of its contacts with foreign administrations, the Commission has frustrated meaningful judicial review of its rulemaking denial.<footnotemark>195</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">The Commission argues, however, that no record is required because (1) no one is prejudiced by the informal, off-the-record meetings, and (2) no reviewable \u201cagency action\u201d occurs at the meetings. This argument must be rejected. ITT has pointed to a number of factors that raise serious questions about the Commission\u2019s claim that no \u201cagency action\u201d occurs in connection with the consultative process.<footnotemark>196</footnotemark> This court certainly has authority to determine whether activities engaged in by the Commission are subject to judicial review; the circular claim that these activities are unreviewable makes such a determination impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-12\">In addition to the paucity of the record, several additional \u201cdanger signals\u201d suggest that the Commission may not have engaged in \u201creasoned decision-making\u201d in its rule-making denial.<footnotemark>197</footnotemark> First, ITT pointed to a number of statements by agency officials that would appear to contradict the Commission\u2019s characterization of the CP meetings as mere \u201cinformation exchanges.\u201d<footnotemark>198</footnotemark> In its order, however, the Commission failed completely to acknowledge these statements or to explain the apparent contradictions.<footnotemark>199</footnotemark> Second, the Commission dismissed ITT\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>and prejudgment claims as \u201ctheoretical\u201d and \u201cspeculative, for in the absence of a pending proceeding, be it formal or informal, [such] questions ... simply do not exist.\u201d <footnotemark>200</footnotemark> Reference to the Commission\u2019s FOIA materials, however, suggests that a number of pending docket proceedings have in fact been discussed at the CP meetings.<footnotemark>201</footnotemark> Finally, there is evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>suggesting that the rulemaking denial was crafted in part to enhance the Commission\u2019s litigation posture in the district court action.<footnotemark>202</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">On the basis of the Commission\u2019s statement and the record before us, we therefore cannot sustain the Commission\u2019s characterization of its actions, its conclusion that these actions are authorized, or its rejection of <em>all </em>APA safeguards. We must therefore remand the order to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">Our normal course would simply be to instruct the Commission to consider the issues further and develop an adequate record for judicial review.<footnotemark>203</footnotemark> In the instant case, however, we also have a district court action that is simultaneously being remanded for <em>de novo </em>proceedings on the <em>ultra vires </em>issue.<footnotemark>204</footnotemark> To the extent that there is tension in such a \u201cdouble remand,\u201d it is largely of the Commission\u2019s own making. As discussed in Part II-A, the issues raised by the <em>ultra vires </em>count are distinct from those presented in the rulemaking denial<footnotemark>205</footnotemark> District court scrutiny, moreover, is appropriate in large measure because the consultative process has taken place outside of normal administrative channels, thereby necessitating <em>de novo </em>factfinding.<footnotemark>206</footnotemark> At the same time, the necessity for district court intervention does not lessen the degree of scrutiny we apply to the Commission\u2019s rule-making denial,<footnotemark>207</footnotemark> and in no way excuses the Commission\u2019s failure to generate a contemporaneous administrative record of the consultative process.<footnotemark>208</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">Nevertheless, we are concerned that the practical effect of our decision is fraught with the potential for duplication, conflicting resolutions, and further delay. The Commission may avoid these difficulties through the simple expedient of staying further action on ITT\u2019s rulemaking petition pending the district court\u2019s resolution of the <em>ultra vires </em>issue. If the district court determines that the Commission may not engage in the consultative process, the question of rulemaking will become moot. If the Commission\u2019s actions are upheld in part or in whole, the Commission can then consider afresh the extent to which rulemaking may be appropriate, informed by the district court\u2019s resolution and guided by the considerations we have set forth today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-11\">C. <em>Delegation of Authority to the Telecommunications Committee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-12\">The Commission may delegate its authority to subdivisions or individual members, but such delegation must be accomplished \u201cby published rule or by order.\u201d <footnotemark>209</footnotemark> The Commission has delegated power to the Committee to act upon certain common car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>rier applications and requests.<footnotemark>210</footnotemark> Its published rule, however, provides no explicit authorization to the Committee to engage in the consultative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">If the Commission argued that the CP exchanges were important to the Committee\u2019s discharge of its delegated responsibilities, we might well conclude that no explicit authorization to participate was necessary. Interaction with the public is the \u201cbread-and-butter\u201d of government administration; <footnotemark>211</footnotemark> dialogues with its foreign counterparts might reasonably be characterized as necessary and proper to the efficient transaction of the Committee\u2019s business.<footnotemark>212</footnotemark> In the instant case, however, the Commission adamantly maintains that the Committee\u2019s functions are <em>strictly </em>limited to its delegated responsibilities, that the CP meetings do <em>not </em>relate to these responsibilities, and that the Committee itself has <em>no </em>authority to act on the Commission\u2019s behalf at the meetings.<footnotemark>213</footnotemark> The Commission characterizes the Committee members\u2019 attendance as pursuant to their personal capacities: \u201cThe authority to meet with foreign entities is not something for which delegation is required since any commissioner, given the nature of his regulatory responsibilities, has the right \u2014 indeed, the responsibility \u2014 to meet with the public to educate himself regarding the issues.\u201d <footnotemark>214</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">This argument easily fails. The Commission concedes elsewhere that the commissioners attend the meetings in their official capacities and <em>qua </em>the Telecommunications Committee, and the record amply shows that the Committee acts on the Commission\u2019s behalf in seeking to effectuate official agency business.<footnotemark>215</footnotemark> Taking the Commission at its word that the Committee\u2019s delegated authority does not encompass such endeavors, we direct that, so long as the Committee continues to play this role in the consultative process, it do so only pursuant to a proper and precise delegation of authority from the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-12\">To summarize our decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-13\">First, with respect to the <em>ultra vires </em>count, we conclude that (a) the district court has subject matter jurisdiction, (b) ITT has standing, and (c) the controversy is ripe for adjudication. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing that count and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-14\">Second, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment ordering disclosure under FOIA of items 1 and 7. We reverse with respect to item 2. As to the other documents contested in this litigation, we reverse and remand to the district court for further consideration and findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-15\">Third, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment that the CP discussions are \u201cmeetings\u201d within the meaning of the Sunshine Act. The public may therefore be excluded from these discussions only in accordance with the Act\u2019s stringent closure provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>Finally, we (a) reverse that part of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking denial concluding that the Sunshine Act does not encompass the meetings at issue, and (b) remand the remainder of the order to the Commission for further action in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1291-22\">.

It is not inconceivable that, independent of the Commission\u2019s efforts, the foreign administrations will enter into operating agreements with the new American carriers.
