In addition to the evidence above described, answers of the street railway company to interrogatories propounded by the plaintiff under the provisions of St. 1913, c. 815, were introduced and in them that company stated that, as the street car approached a street intersecting that on which it was running, the truck \u201ccame out of\u201d the intersecting street \u201cat a fast rate of speed and came directly in front of the\u201d street car, which then was going about seven or eight miles an hour, that the street car was struck by the truck on the car\u2019s left front, the damage being to the vestibule and the left [front step. <em>Held, </em>that there was no evidence warranting a finding of negligence on the part of the employees of the street railway company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-14\">At the trial together of two actions of tort for personal injuries by the same plaintiff against different defendants, each action alleging the defendant therein to be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>responsible for the injuries, answers by the defendant in one of these actions to interrogatories propounded by the plaintiff under St. 1913, c. 815, are not competent evidence against the defendant in the other action.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">Four actions of tort, the first two being by a woman to recover for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from a collision of a street car, upon which she was a passenger, with a motor truck, and the second two being by her husband for consequential damages.

The evidence bearing upon the cause of the collision came almost wholly from the female plaintiff, neither the motorman of the trolley car nor the driver of the motor truck being called as witnesses. She testified that after the collision she saw the auto truck \u201cafter it had bumped go up by us . . . pretty fast\u201d by the left side of the car. She was unable to tell whether the cause of the sudden stopping of'the trolley car was the application of brakes by the motorman or the impact of the collision. She did not know where the automobile truck was when the collision happened, whether it had got pretty well across the track or where it was on the track when it happened. She did not see the truck strike against the car and did not see the truck at all before the jolt of the car. Whatever happened to her seemed to be the result of the truck striking against the front of the electric car. At the time of the collision the electric car was going at a medium rate of speed and was stopped quickly</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">In answer to interrogatories the Boston Elevated Railway Company described the accident as follows: \u201cAs the car was approach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ing Rawson Street an auto truck came out of said Rawson Street at a fast rate of speed and came directly in front of the elevated car;\u201d the electric car just before the time of the accident was going \u201cabout seven or eight miles an hour;\u201d the electric car was damaged as follows: \u201cdamage to vestibule, left front step, and broken glass.\u201d It further appeared from the answers to these interrogatories that the electric car was struck on the left front end, and that the left corner of the other vehicle was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The utmost effect of this evidence failed to show that the collision was caused by negligence. It does not fasten negligence upon either defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The answers of the Boston Elevated Railway Company to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories, whether believed or disbelieved, do not aid the plaintiffs as against that defendant. The case upon this branch is covered by <em>Stangy </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>220 Mass. 414. It is plainly distinguishable from <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>207 Mass. 27, where there was some evidence of negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The answers of the Boston Elevated Railway Company to interrogatori\u00e9s, were not competent evidence against the New England Motor Trucking Company. <em>Edgerton </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>6 Gray, 453. <em>Rosseau </em>v. <em>Deschenes, </em>203 Mass. 261. Answers to interrogatories in this respect stand upon the same footing as admissions or other statements made by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
