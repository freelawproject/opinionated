'</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-3\">In an action upon the first policy under the circumstances above stated, it was <em>held </em>that a provision in that policy, that it should be void \u201cif the insured shall make any attempt to defraud the company either before or after the loss,\u201d did not warrant the ordering of a verdict for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">Contract upon a policy of fire insurance. Writ dated October 9, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">In the Superior Court the action was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. The material evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the Chief Justice on motion of the defendant ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-6\"><em>C. Fairlmrst, (W. A. Davenport </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-7\"><em>F. L.

It follows that when the plaintiff submitted his proof of loss in which he declared under oath that the defendant\u2019s policy was \u201cthe only insurance in effect,\u201d the statement was true and correct. We assume that the policy declared on is in the standard form prescribed by St. 1907, c. 576, \u00a7 60. But the clause that the policy should be void \u201cif the insured shall make any attempt to defraud the company either before or after the loss,\u201d upon which the insurer relies to avoid payment, did not of itself as matter of law warrant the ordering of a verdict for the defendant for reasons previously stated. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Milford Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>170 Mass. 492, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">It becomes unnecessary to consider the rulings relating to the admission and exclusion of evidence to which the plaintiff duly excepted, or the question whether under <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>4 Met. 151, <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Benefit Association, </em>146 Mass. 519, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>529, and <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>198 Mass. 375, the jury were to determine if the plaintiff made the statement with the intention of defrauding the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">The exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
