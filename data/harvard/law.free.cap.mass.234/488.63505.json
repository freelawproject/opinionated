In his brief before this court, upon the subject of the scope of the decree, he argued that, at most, the decree \u201cought to restrain the defendant from opening or engaging in a competing business. In the absence of evidence showing that the person enjoined has a special or peculiar value to a particular business, it is submitted that the injunction ought not to restrain him from securing employment in a like business.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-7\"><em>A.

He placed in the windows signs which advertised, among other things, \u201cImportant \u2022\u2014No Interest in Any Store on Massachusetts Avenue \u2014 Phil &amp; Eddie \u2014 This is the Only Legitimate Phil &amp; Eddie Store on Massachusetts Avenue.\u201d The trial judge finds: \u201cHe has announced his intention of opening on March 1, and has engaged the services of Sara Cooper, who had been one of his clerks for two years when he had run the store which the plaintiff now owns, and is now the plaintiff\u2019s clerk. The defendant has expressed his intention of running the plaintiff out of business. By his advertisements and announcements he has not only made a direct and pointed effort to get back his old trade, but he has declared war upon the plaintiff.\u201d He also finds that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontention that he did not intend to sell the good will of his business is not sustained by the evidence, even if it were material.\u201d An examination of the record shows that these findings are not plainly wrong; indeed they are fully justified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">When the defendant sold the good will of his store, in connection with the stock of goods and fixtures, he thereby precluded himself from setting up a competing business which will deprive the buyer of the benefits of the good will he has purchased. The \u201cprobability that the old customers will resort to the old place,\u201d that the concern will continue to receive the patronage which has been built up by reason of its location, the quality of the goods and service there furnished, the skill and solicitation of the former owner, is the essence of that good will. The judge has found that the new business which the defendant is setting up at 546 Massachusetts Avenue does in fact derogate from the good will which he sold in 1918. The injunction which was, ordered does not seem broader than is necessary for the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. <em>Old Corner Book Store </em>v. <em>Upham, </em>194 Mass. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
