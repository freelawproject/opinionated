But, even if the defendant owned, and his son was using the car, the plaintiff, in order to recover, was obliged to introduce evidence from which the jury could find that the son acted as the father\u2019s servant. <em>Trombley </em>v. <em>Stevens-Duryea Co. </em>206 Mass. 516. If the material evidence on this question as shown by the record was accepted by the jury as true, but one conclusion is possible, that the son without his father\u2019s knowledge was out on a \"joy ride\u201d or \u201cfrolic of his own.\u201d If, however, the evidence either wholly or partially could be disregarded, as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel urges in argument, there is no proof of liability. The defendant accordingly is entitled to judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-31\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
