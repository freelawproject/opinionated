The jury were fully instructed on the question of negligence of the defendant and the responsibility of keeping the record and no exception was taken to the charge. <em>Held, </em>that, so far as the omission referred to in the requested ruling was to the making of records when the plaintiff himself took bis car out and returned it, the ruling was immaterial and its refusal was not re- . versible error; and, so far as that omission referred to the occasion when the car was wrongfully taken from the garage after the plaintiff had returned it, the ruling rightly was refused.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">Tort or contract with a declaration in two counts.

Material portions of the charge of the judge to the jury were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-4\">\u201cIt is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that he left that car there on the second day of December, and that neither he nor any one having authority from him took that car after that. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">\u201c The duty that the defendant owed the plaintiff was such duty as a bailee for hire owes. For this automobile was left in the garage by the plaintiff to be looked after by the defendant, that is to say, to be stored in its garage and the plaintiff was to pay therefor five dollars a month. And the duty that such a bailee owed to the party who leaves his automobile in his custody is to have exercised reasonable care in looking after the automobile, and I mean in looking after it to this extent to protect it against theft or loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">\u201cIn determining that question you will consider all the circumstances testified to in this case, the size of the garage, the number of cars kept there in the part of the garage wherein this was kept, and the provision that the defendant made for looking after the cars, the supervision that the defendant provided for and the method adopted by the defendant not only in the daytime but at night in looking after the car. All the circumstances will be taken into account by you in determining this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">\u201cA statute has been introduced in evidence and'read to you, a part of which provided that where a car is entering or leaving a garage the fact that it enters or leaves shall be entered in a book kept by the owner of the garage or his employees, and except in the case of chauffeurs, the entry showing when the cars leave or enter the garage shall be made by the owner of the garage or his employees. And the statute provides the responsibility for keeping that book properly shall rest with the owner of the garage or his employees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">\u201cNow the contention of the plaintiff is that the defendant violated that statute, that some one took that car from the garage after December 1,1917, and no entry was made of the taking of the car by the defendant or any employee of the defendant. If you find that to be so that would be a violation of that statute, and as such would be evidence of negligence. It wouldn\u2019t be conclusive, but it would be evidence for you to consider in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>other circumstances tending to show whether or not the defendant was negligent, and whether or not the defendant used reasonable care in protecting the automobile against theft or loss. And if you find that the defendant or its employee violated that statute, it is for you to say what weight is to be given to that circumstance. You have heard the argument advanced by the counsel for the plaintiff in respect to the significance which should be attached to the failure on the part of the defendant or its employee to make such an entry in the book kept by the garage, but it will be for you to decide in the first place whether the defendant or its employee has violated that statute, and in the second place if the defendant or its employee has violated it what the significance of that violation is, considering the question to be decided in this case. What weight, in other words, such a violation if you find there was such should have in your judgment in determining the question whether or not the defendant exercised reasonable care in protecting the car against theft or loss. The counsel for the defendant has argued that the plaintiff was familiar with the automobile laws and that if he brought that car there on the 2nd of December, he ought to have either entered or caused to be entered the fact in the book, and the counsel for the defendant has argued that his failure to do so ought to lead you to say that he really did not bring the car in on the 2nd of December. And it is a matter for you to take into account when you are trying to satisfy yourself whether the plaintiff did come there on the 2nd of December and got the car and afterwards returned it to the garage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">No exception was saved to the charge and no objection to any part of the charge was expressed to the trial judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">There was a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $322; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">Material portions of St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 28, are as follows: \u201cEvery person operating or running a motor vehicle into or out of a garage, or into or out of a stable, shop or place of business of a manufacturer or dealer, shall enter or cause to be entered in said book, in the columns under the proper headings, the date and tima of entering and leaving, the register number and letter, if any, of the motor vehicle, and the full name of the operator or chauffeur.

About thirty cars of customers were in the defendant\u2019s care. A book required by St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 28, was kept for recording the coming in and going out of motor vehicles. On the morning of November 30, 1917, one Clark at the plaintiff\u2019s request drove the car from the garage and an entry was made in the book showing the time of its departure. The plaintiff testified that he returned the automobile that evening about six o\u2019clock, no record being made at the time; that on Sunday night, December 2, about half past seven o\u2019clock, he took the car from the basement where it was kept and in about an hour drove it back, placed it in its accustomed place, and, on leaving the garage, shut the door without locking it; that he saw no one in charge of the garage at the time and no entry was made of the departure or return of the car; that this was the last time he saw it and its loss was discovered December 4,1917. He further testified that he had a switch key to switch the current on or off, but no locking device. The defendant\u2019s president testified that he had no knowledge that the plaintiff took the car out or brought it back; that a man was employed continuously from half past six o\u2019clock in the morning to half past six o\u2019clock in the evening and another from half past six o\u2019clock in the evening to half past six o\u2019clock in the morning to care for the live storage on both floors; that it was a part of these employees\u2019 duties to sell supplies, to see that cars were taken out only by the owners or by their authority, and to take care of the stored cars; that, leading from the basement, was an incline and the noise from a car in passing up this incline would be heard all over the building; that there was a door from the basement and one from the first floor, opening on the street, and the men in charge were instructed to keep the doors in the basement locked. An employee in charge of the first floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and basement from half past six o\u2019clock in the morning to half past six o\u2019clock in the evening, testified that he had no knowledge that the car was returned after the morning of November 30, 1917, when it was taken from the garage by Clark. Attention was called to St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 28. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denied. The jury found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">1. On the facts presented the court could not rule there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. If the jury believed the testimony of the plaintiff, the automobile was left in the defendant\u2019s garage on the night of December 2, and it was then in the defendant\u2019s care and custody. The automobile could not be started and driven away from its stall in the basement and up the incline without being heard, and if the employee in charge of the building neither heard nor observed it when taken away, the jury could find he was negligent. Although the defendant\u2019s employees were instructed to keep the basement doors locked, there was evidence for the jury that on December 2, when the plaintiff left the garage with his automobile and when he returned the door was open; and that no employee of the defendant in charge of the property, was seen by the plaintiff at either time. In addition to this, St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 28, required a record to be kept by the , owner, proprietor or person in control of a garage where five or more motor vehicles are stored or housed for pay, of every automobile which enters or leaves the garage. If the agents of the defendant permitted the plaintiff\u2019s property to leave the garage after it was returned to the defendant\u2019s control on December 2, without the entry in the record book as required by the statute, the jury could consider this circumstance as bearing on the lack of proper diligence in the care and custody of the bailment. And if the employee in charge, whose duty it was to protect the plaintiff\u2019s property, was not present and the automobile was taken away without his knowledge, this also could be found to constitute a failure to exercise that degree of care and diligence which was reasonably to be expected of the defendant, considering the nature of the bailment, the place where it was left, and all the facts and circumstances shown in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">2. The defendant asked the judge to rule there was no evidence that the defendant or any of its employees stole the car. The judge was not required to give these requests. The record does not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>close that the plaintiff contended that the car was stolen by the defendant or its employees. The plaintiff complained of the loss of his car, he did not complain that it was stolen by the defendant, or its employees. There was no occasion, therefore, to give either the first or second requests. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Leighton, </em>150 Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">3. The defendant asked for this instruction: \u201cThe law requires that an owner of an automobile driving into a garage or taking a car out shall make a record under \u00a7 28 of the act introduced in this case.\u201d The defendant was called on to keep in a book provided for the purpose, a record showing the date, time of entering and leaving, register number and letter, if any, with the name of the operator or chauffeur of every motor vehicle leaving or entering the garage. By \u00a7 1 of the statute \u201cchauffeur\u201d is defined, with exceptions not material to the case, to be . \u201cany person who operates a motor vehicle other than his own and who directly or indirectly receives pay or any compensation whatsoever for any work or services in connection with motor vehicles.\u201d Whatever may be the duty of an operator of an automobile, other than a chauffeur, to cause the entry to be made, the entry in the record when the car is not \u201coperated or run into or out of a garage\u201d by a chauffeur, is to be made by the proprietor or person in control of the garage, or by some person specially designated for this duty, and not by the owner of the car when he is operating it. Responsibility for making the entries in all cases except when the car is in the control of a chauffeur, is upon the proprietor of the garage, and he is responsible for the keeping of the record; the request that the owner of the automobile when operated by himself was required to make the record, was refused rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">4. The evidence was admitted without objection that no record was made when the car was taken out and returned on Sunday, December 2. The defendant asked for the instruction:' \u201cThe omission to make a record of the coming in or the going out of the car on Sunday night is not evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d Assuming that this request refers to the going out and coming in of the car while in the plaintiffs control, it was not reversible error to refuse it. The question before the jury was the negligence of the defendant in permitting the car to leave the garage, or in neglecting to prevent its departure after half past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>eight o\u2019clock Sunday, December 2, when the plaintiff testified he left the car in its proper place in the basement. The defendant\u2019s negligence previous to this time was not material; and the failure to make the entry when the car was taken out and returned by the plaintiff on Sunday evening, had no bearing on the defendant\u2019s negligence in the subsequent loss of the automobile. The jury were fully instructed on the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence and the responsibility of keeping the record, to which no exception was taken. Apparently counsel for the defendant argued to the jury that the plaintiff was familiar with the automobile laws and if he brought the car to the garage on December 2, he should have entered that fact or caused it to be entered on the book; and therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to do this was evidence that he did not in fact return the car on December 2. The judge left this matter to the jury to consider in passing on the question whether the plaintiff did in fact return the car on that date. While the omission to make the record on December 2, when the automobile was in the control of the plaintiff, was not material to establish the defendant\u2019s negligence, in view of the instructions given on the failure to make the record when the automobile was finally taken away without the consent of the plaintiff, there was no reversible error in refusing this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
