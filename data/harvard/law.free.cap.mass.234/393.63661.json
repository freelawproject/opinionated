The grades of said avenue are established according to the lines of revised grade of edgestone, shown on red, on said plan.\u201d A location, the exact date of which does not appear but which presumably followed the layout, was granted to the West End Street Railway Company to whose rights the defendant has succeeded, to construct, maintain and use a double track on Huntington Avenue from Dartmouth Street to the Brook-line line in accordance with the plan of one Plimpton \u201cdated July 18,1895, and deposited in the office of the Superintendent of Streets.\u201d If not expressly conceded, no question is raised that the railway was located, constructed and has since been maintained in the reserved space. Nor is any contention made that the accident to the plaintiff, a pedestrian, did not happen within the boundaries described, at a point where no break or opening in the reserved space as shown on the plan appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">If, without deciding, it is assumed, that there was evidence for the jury of the plaintiff\u2019s due care and of the defendant\u2019s negligence, <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583, <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Norton &amp; Taunton Street Railway, </em>180 Mass. 104, <em>Chaput </em>v. <em>Haver</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>hill, Georgetown &amp; Danvers Street Railway, </em>194 Mass. <em>218, 220, Foster </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>213 Mass. 79, 84, the defendant contends that, the layout having been in accordance with the authority conferred by the statute, its occupation is paramount. It would follow that the plaintiff while walking? upon the reserved space where there was neither a break nor a crosswalk, and which never had been fitted or opened generally for the use of travellers, was at most a bare licensee as between herself and the defendant, to whom it owed no duty except to refrain from wanton or reckless conduct toward her of which there is no evidence. <em>Menut </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>207 Mass. 12. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co. </em>223 Mass. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The plaintiff as a traveller undoubtedly was entitled <em>to </em>use the public ways for free and unobstructed passage; a use which as long ago settled is not restricted to crosswalks or sidewalks, or to the part not used by the railway in a street where cars are operated. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>213 Mass. 79, 84, 85, and cases cited. It must be assumed however that the Legislature in framing the statute was not forgetful of the law as thus declared by this court, <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>213 Mass. 79, 85, and whatever the object may have been, the wording and meaning of the act is unmistakable. While the words \u201cand for grass\u201d appear in the layout as well as in the purposes named in the statute, for which reservations may be made, the grant of the location coupled with the layout conferred upon the railway company an exclusive right to lay and maintain tracks, and to operate its cars in that portion designated on the plan, and in the layout which followed the plan, as a special or reserved space set apart and distinguished from the remainder of the avenue which was open to the use of the general public. <em>Eustis </em>v. <em>Milton Street Railway, </em>183 Mass. 586, 589, 590. <em>Farrington </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>202 Mass. 315, 319. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, 214 </em>Mass. 168; <em>S. C. 226 </em>Mass. 87. See <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad </em>v. <em>Central Massachusetts Electric Co. </em>219 Mass. 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The verdicts having been ordered rightly the exceptions in each case must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
