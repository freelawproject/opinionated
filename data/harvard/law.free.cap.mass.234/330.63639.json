He was paid $6.50 per diem for his own services and the use of his property. He not only drove his team, but did other work incidental to its use. It did not appear that he received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>orders except as to places of receipt and delivery of his loads. On the day of his injury, July 11, 1918, he had been hauling coal from a pile near a railroad. During the noon hour, he sat on the railroad track, and leaned against a railroad car while eating his luncheon. While he was so sitting, an engine was attached to another car, and thereby the car against which he was leaning was caused to \u201ckick,\u201d and Haggard was \u201crolled under\u201d that car and injured. While he was eating, his horses stood at the coal pile near by and were being fed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Even if, as the board found, he was an employee, as to which see <em>Centrello\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 456, <em>Winslow\u2019s Case, 232 </em>Mass. 458, <em>Eckert\u2019s Case, 233 </em>Mass. 577, and <em>Robichaud\u2019s Case, ante, </em>60, the board was justified in finding, if not constrained to find, that the accident did not arise out of his employment. Haggard was not in a place in which it was necessary for him to be in the course of his work, or in going to or coming therefrom. The act in which he was engaged when injured had no relation to his employment; indeed, his going upon the railroad track seems to have been in violation of St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 232, although the decision of this case is not based on that statute. <em>Fumiciello\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 488. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.
