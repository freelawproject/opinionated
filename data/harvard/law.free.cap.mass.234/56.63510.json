The indictment was in three counts. In the first count it was charged that the murder was accomplished \u201cby shooting . . . with a revolver loaded with leaden bullets;\u201d in the second count, by stabbing with a knife, and in the third count by shooting and stabbing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">The indictment was tried in the Superior Court before <em>N. P.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>Brown, </em>J. Under the circumstances described in the opinion, separate confessions of the defendants were admitted in evidence. Teregno admitted in his alleged confession that for some time and clandestinely he had been having illicit relations with the other defendant, wife of the deceased, in their home, and had planned to kill him; that he had shot the deceased with a revolver, but that the stabbing had been done by the other defendant, the decedent\u2019s wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\">When the confession of the defendant Maria Cammerota was admitted in evidence and read to the jury, the jury were \u201cexpressly told that the statements therein contained were only evidence against Maria.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-9\">A preliminary examination of a witness for the Commonwealth, Civitella Cammerota, disclosed that she was seven years \u2022 old, was a daughter of the decedent and of the defendant Cammerota and lived with them and knew the defendant Teregno. When asked by the judge when she was seven years old, she stated that she did not know. She testified that she went to school near her home but that she did not know what grade she was in; that she went to Sunday school near her home, that she did not know the name of the church, that the name of her teacher was Miss Zanetti, that she knew, when she held up her right hand, that it was an oath, and that \u201clittle girls who don\u2019t tell the truth . . . die and they go to hell, \u201d and that, if she did not tell the truth in testifying that day, she would \"go to hell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>In the direct examination of the defendant Teregno, he stated that he had had improper relations with the other defendant at her home, but that such relations were at her urgent solicitations. He also testified that his confession was improperly secured from him. He admitted in his direct testimony that he had shot the decedent, but stated that it was done when he was attacked with an axe, and contended at the trial that the death was caused by a blow of an axe and not by the shooting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">Other material evidence, instructions and rulings by the judge and exceptions of the defendant are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">The jury found the defendant Cammerota guilty of manslaughter and the defendant Teregno guilty of murder in the first degree.

It , was not too remote in time, and the environment as portrayed would enable the jury to understand and properly to apply the subsequent evidence descriptive of the means used, and the manner whereby the homicide was accomplished. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>123 Mass. 244. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>157 Mass. 233. <em>Laplante </em>v. <em>Warren Cotton Mills, </em>165 Mass. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The defendants were tried jointly aqd the confession of each, not having been improperly obtained, was admissible under the instructions of the judge, that the jury were to consider the admissions as affecting only the party making them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storti, </em>177 Mass. 339. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Killion, </em>194 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Mass. 153. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>207 Mass. 240. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borasky, </em>214 Mass. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Nor can we hold that the evidence of Civitella Cammerota, daughter of the decedent and of Maria, was improperly admitted. It is true she was only seven years of age, yet, the presiding judge after a preliminary examination having found that she was a competent witness, no error of law is shown. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>211 Mass. 86, 90, and cases there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The questions asked by the district attorney in cross-examinatian of Teregno who voluntarily became a witness in his own behalf, to the admission of which he excepted, assumed that illicit relations had existed between him and Mrs. Cammerota. But the entries in the defendant\u2019s \u201csort of diary,\u201d as well as other evidence already before the jury, left, if believed, no doubt of the fact, and the questions which in substance were, \u201cAren\u2019t you man enough to take the blame for your relations with Maria yourself,\u201d were permissible within the discretion of the trial judge. It is sufficient that the legal rights of the defendant do not appear to have been invaded. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Mass. 382. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>183 Mass. 577, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The defendant\u2019s request that a verdict of not guilty should be ordered was denied rightly. If there was some evidence that a blow from a blunt instrument possibly might have caused death, there was plenary proof of the allegations of the indictment. The jury moreover were expressly instructed, that if they were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the decedent was killed by the use of a revolver and a knife, or of a revolver alone, the defendant should be acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The remaining error at the trial urged is, that counsel for Mrs. Cammerota in his closing argument to the jury having referred to the defendant as a \u201cslacker,\u201d meaning \u201ca man who refuses to fight when our homes are at stake has no right to get the benefit of our country,\u201d the court after the defendant\u2019s counsel has objected \u201c to his argument on that point, \u201d merely said, \u201c He may proceed. \u201d But without intimating whether the jury should have been instructed to disregard the argument, it is sufficient to say that no exception having been taken, the question is not presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>new trial because the verdict was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence and the law as given to the jury by the court, and the existence of irregularities during the trial which engendered prejudice and prevented substantial justice, must-fail. The granting or denial of the motion was wholly discretionary. <em>Garrity </em>v. Higgins, 177 Mass. 414. <em>Capron </em>v. <em>Anness, </em>136 Mass. 271. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>210 Mass. 487. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 82. We have fully examined and considered all the questions raised by the record, and finding no error of law the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>So ordered%</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
