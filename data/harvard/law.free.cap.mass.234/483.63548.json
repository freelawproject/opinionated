The evidence relating to the notice sent to the plaintiff by the defendant was as follows: The defendant testified that, when the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor made upon the agreement the indorsement described in the opinion, he handed to the defendant the address of one Eliot, whose full name the defendant did not remember, and told the defendant to notify that person whether the defendant would take the book on that date; that on September 23,1914, the defendant dictated and addressed to \u201cMr. Eliot, Editor-in-Chief of the Massachusetts Biographical Society at Boston,\u201d and mailed, postage prepaid, a letter. The plaintiff having been duly notified to produce the original of this letter and failing to do so, the defendant offered a copy of it in evidence, and the judge admitted it subject to an exception by the plaintiff. The copy read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">\"Dr. Samuel S.

If you find that that was the contract, that \u2022 was the agreement, you find that that agreement was made, of . course your verdict should be for the defendant. If you find that it was not made, then this contract stands and the plaintiff is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>entitled to recover $250, . . .\u201d Under this charge the case went to the jury with the liability of the defendant admitted, unless the defendant should prove that the delivery of the instrument as an operative obligation was conditional upon the exercise by the defendant of an option granted bim by the plaintiff to \u201ctake the book\u201d on September 23, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">Upon the direct testimony of the defendant the jury was fully warranted in finding, as it did, that the instrument signed by the defendant and delivered to the plaintiff was not to have effect as a binding obligation unless and until the defendant should \u201cnotify us whether or no you want it,\u201d by sending to Mr. Eliot, Editor-in-Chief of the Massachusetts Biographical Society, on September 23, 1914, a notification whether the defendant would take the book; and it is plain that it could make such finding consistently, notwithstanding the testimony of the defendant on cross-examination, that when he signed the instrument he supposed the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor would turn in to the plaintiff the signed contract not containing the indorsement; that at the time he signed the contract he considered himself bound by the contract with the indorsement on the copy he retained; and that at the time of the trial he still considered himself bound. It is well settled that the rule against the admission of oral testimony to vary the terms of a written instrument is not applicable when that testimony is offered to prove, as here, that the signed and delivered instrument never became operative as an obligation of the parties thereto. <em>Zielmann </em>v. <em>Copelof, </em>232 Mass. 393, 396. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>119 Mass. 383. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>191 Mass. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The direction of the duly authorized solicitor to \u201cnotify us\u201d by notifying Mr. Eliot, the Editor-in-Chief of the Massachusetts Biographical Society, authorized the sending of a letter on the. day named to Mr. Eliot, Editor-in-Chief of the Massachusetts Biographical Society, Boston. Had the letter sent been addressed, without the name Mr. Eliot, to the Massachusetts Biographical Society, Boston, and mailed, a presumption of fact of delivery would arise that such letter was duly delivered and received at No. 294 Washington Street, Boston, \u2014 the \u201cBoston office\u201d of the plaintiff indicated as its place of business upon its letter headings in evidence and a part of the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Taintor, </em>229 Mass. 174. It would seem plain that the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>could be found to have been delivered at the plaintiff\u2019s office and, considering its contents, reasonably probable that it was turned over by Mr. Eliot to the proper person to receive it. But whether the plaintiff received it or not is quite immaterial, if the jury should find that the defendant sent it as a notification of his purpose to the person to whom the plaintiff had chosen to have it sent; and it is equally immaterial that that person was not authorized to receive it or act upon it. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Maynes, </em>228 Mass. 350. Assuming the jury to find the testimony supported the contention of the defendant independently of the contents of the letter, the letter was admissible as evidence to prove the defendant notified the plaintiff in the manner provided by their agreement of his election not to be bound by the instrument which he had signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\">The exception to the admission of this evidence was a general one; the letter was admissible for a limited purpose, and the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
