L. c. 51, \u00a7 18, against a city for damages to a horse of the plaintiff alleged to have been caused by a defect in a bridge, the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff tended to show that the horse, after having taken one step over a plank newly laid in the floor of the bridge, was found to have a spike in his hoof, that the horse did not put his foot down again until the spike was removed, that the spike was similar to spikes used in securing planks to bridge surfaces, and that it bore no hammer or sledge marks. A verdict was ordered for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that it was a matter of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>jecture how or by whose act the spike came upon the bridge surface, and that the verdict properly was ordered.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">Tort for damages to a horse of the plaintiff caused by his stepping upon a spike on the Congress Street bridge in Boston. Writ dated July 19, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">The declaration was in two counts, the first count being under R. L. c. 51, \u00a7 18, and the second count alleging that the damage was caused by negligence of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">The action was tried before <em>White, </em>J., who at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence ordered a verdict for the defendant and reported the case to this court for determination, it being agreed by the parties that, if his ruling was right, judgment should be entered for the defendant on the verdict, and that, if the case should have been submitt\u00e9d to the jury, judgment should be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $500.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-9\"><em>A.

The horse did not put its foot on the roadway after \u201cpicking up\u201d the spike until it was removed'. The spike apparently had not been driven into the plank because it bore no hammer or sledge marks. It was similar to spikes used in securing planks to the bridge surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">There' is nothing in these circumstances to warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent or was responsible for a defective highway. How or by whom the spike came upon the highway or how-long it had been there are matters left wholly to conjecture. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Leominster, </em>200 Mass. 101. <em>Bigwood </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>209 Mass. 345. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>219 Mass. 168. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>219 Mass. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
