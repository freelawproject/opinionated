Practice, Civil, </em>Exceptions, Judge\u2019s charge. <em>Evidence, </em>Of contract, Ex- c trinsie affecting writings. <em>Contract, </em>What constitutes, Construction. <em>Damages, </em>For breach of contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b451-6\">If, at the trial of an action by a purchaser against a seller for failure to deliver burlap in accordance with a contract of sale, it appears that the contract was contained in a letter from the defendant to the plaintiff, quoting terms, a reply of the plaintiff accepting the terms quoted and a sales note signed by the defendant and enclosed in a letter which stated that it was subject to the conditions mentioned in the defendant\u2019s previous letter, and the trial judge erroneously rules that the sales note contained the entire contract between the parties and excluded the letters, an exception to such ruling will not be sustained unless, on the whole evidence, it appears that substantial rights of the defendant were impaired.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b451-8\">In the action above described, it appeared that, in the letter of the defendant which the judge excluded, prices were quoted \u201csubject to change of market.\u201d The sales note set as the selling price the same price and terms offered in the letter but did not state that the price was \u201csubject to change of market.\u201d <em>Held,, </em>that the quoted phrase in the defendant\u2019s letter referred to a variance of the price during the pendency of the offer, and did not affect the price after it had been fixed by the sales note, so that no harm in this respect resulted to the defendant from exclusion of the letter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b451-11\">The letter of the defendant, above described, also contained a provision, not in the sales note, that \u201cthe delivery would have to be strictly subject to the arrival of , our own importations.\u201d The defendant first relied on this provision in defence by an amended answer filed at the time of the trial of the action. Previous to that time, he had contended that no contract was made with the plaintiff. It appeared that the defendant never attempted to place an order for importation of burlap to fill the plaintiff\u2019s order, that it would have been impossible to procure importations to fulfil the requirements of the sale as to delivery unless the orders had been placed long before the contract with the plaintiff was made, and that the defendant did not rely on its own importations to fulfil the plaintiff\u2019s orders. <em>Held, </em>that exclusion \u00f3f the letter did not harm the defendant in this respect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b451-12\">In the letter of the defendant above described, there also was a statement that delivery was subject to marine disasters. It appeared that delivery from' the , defendant to the plaintiff was to be \u201cf. o. b.\u201d at the city where the defendant did business, and that certain \u201cmarine disasters\u201d respecting shipments to the defendant did not affect any importation ordered by the defendant in contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>plation of the plaintiff\u2019s order. <em>IIeld, </em>that the defendant was not harmed by the exclusion of the letter in this respect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-3\">In the charge to the jury in the action above described, the judge stated, \u201cThere is no question about this contract, but what it called for two bales on the first of each month, commencing with December.\u201d It appeared that the sales note stated, \u201cDelivery 2 bales per month commencing December 1st,\u201d and this construction was recognized by a letter of the defendant referring to \u201cthose two bales, which I understand, are due you February 1st.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the defendant was not harmed by the statement of fact in the charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b452-4\">At the trial of the action above described, it appeared that, in consequence of the failure of the defendant to perform the contract of sale, the plaintiff was compelled to buy elsewhere, that he had difficulty in meeting his requirements and that his mill was closed in January for that reason, that in placing replacement orders he secured minimum prices by getting three different bids on each purchase and kept the defendant informed of his needs and efforts. It did not appear that the plaintiff was able to procure burlap on the first of each month or that he could have bought at a lower price than he did. The trial judge refused to rule that \u201cThe plaintiff made no replacement purchase on a date when the goods ought to have been delivered,\u201d and that \"The plaintiff has offered no sufficient evidence of its damage.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, on the issue of damages, the defendant failed to show that his substantial rights were affected injuriously.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">Contract, for failure to deliver burlap alleged to have been sold to the plaintiff by the defendant.

It appeared that on October 23, 1915, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff as follows: \u201cReplying to your favor of the 22nd, we can offer you 36\" 10 oz / 40\" Calcutta for prompt shipment from Boston 7c, net 10 days, f. o. b.

The shipments during the month of September to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>East Coast Ports of this country were only 31,000,000 yards, which is about 50 percent of a normal shipment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-3\">\u201cWe presume you are aware that there is an embargo on exports from Calcutta making it necessary for shippers there to get a license before they can export.

With regard to the weight of the goods, the weight of all burlaps is stated pro rata to 40\". You have always received 36\" 10 oz/40\" goods from us as you can no doubt verify by weighing some of the goods you have in stock. It is quite customary in the burlap trade to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>drop the /40\" for the sake of brevity, but is universally understood that all weights are based on this width.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-3\">Other material evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Av8\">\u201c1. The sales note is the evidenciary memorandum of the contract required by law to make the contract valid. It is not the contract itself nor the sale itself. It is merely the legal confirmation of a sale theretofore agreed to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">\u201c3. The letter which accompanied the sales note stating that the confirmation is \u2018subject to the conditions of our quoting letter\u2019 is also evidence of the nature of the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">\u201c4. The letter of October 23, 1915 (the quoting letter) is also evidence of the nature of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">\u201c5. If the contract entered into by the parties provided that on account of the difficulties of doing an importing business, the prices of the goods ordered would be \u2018subject to change of market\u2019 the defendant is not liable because the plaintiff was compelled to pay a larger price to replace goods which the defendant could not import to deliver at the times specified in the sales note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">\u201c6. If the contract provided that the delivery of the goods contracted for was \u2018strictly subject to the arrival of importations\u2019 \u2014 the plaintiff cannot complain or hold the defendant liable for damages pending arrival of goods like those contracted for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">\u2018\u20187. If the contract called for delivery \u2018subject to marine disasters,\u2019 the plaintiff cannot complain or hold the defendant liable for damages if its first importation of goods of the description contracted for were destroyed by fire while <em>en route </em>to this country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">\u201c8. The contract called for a particular size and weight of burlap. The defendant was not bound and is not liable for failure to deliver any other character of burlap.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-10\">\u201c10. If the sale was a contract to sell \u2018from importations\u2019 the defendant would not be liable for failure to deliver the burlap from any stock on hand, even if it had similar burlaps on hand and not otherwise contracted for.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-11\">\u201c12. The plaintiff made no replacement purchase on a date when the goods ought to have been delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-12\">\u201c13. The plaintiff has offered no sufficient evidence of its . damage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-13\">\u201c16. The \u2018current price\u2019 which is the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>claim for damage is the current price of identical goods and not the current price of dissimilar substitute goods, if there is an available market for the identical goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\">\u201c23. The burden is upon the plaintiff to show affirmatively that the conditions prerequisite to the delivery of the identical goods contracted for were complied with, i. e., (a) that there was no marine loss; (b) that the goods had been imported by the defendant, and (c) that there had been no change in market value.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">The rulings were refused. The portion of the charge relating to delivery on December 1, referred to in the quotation from the defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions, below, and in the opinion, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">\u201cThe rights of the parties on each individual transaction are to be settled as of th\u00e9 day when the contract ought to have been shipped. There is no question about this contract, but what it called for two bales on the first of each month, commencing with December until there had been in all fifteen bales delivered, and so each of these shipments is to be settled as of the time when the thing ought to have been done, unless there was some further bargain between them on that point, and if you find there was any, follow it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">Other material portions of the charge to the jury are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">The bill of exceptions states, \u201cAt the close of the charge the defendant reserved his exceptions, (1) to what was said in the charge about what constitutes the contract; (2) to the statement in the charge that the plaintiff might purchase in advance under the conditions named in the charge; (3) to the statement in the charge that the first bales were due to be delivered on the first day of December; (4) to the portion of the charge ruling that the plaintiff had the right to make his purchases at the time it made them, and (5) to the portion of the charge which allowed the jury to draw inferences from the prices which the plaintiff paid to determine current prices on the dates at which the plaintiff should have made these purchases; also separately to the refusal of the court to give each one of the several requests for rulings which are enumerated above.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,115.07; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-3\"><em>A.

Holt, Jr., </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b456-5\">De Courcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7t\">The Wonalancet Company, of Nashua, New Hampshire, on October 25, 1915, sent an order for fifteen bales of burlap to the defendant corporation at its Boston office. On October 29 the defendant\u2019s manager wrote to the plaintiff, enclosing a sales note in confirmation of the order. The defendant failed to send the goods, notwithstanding repeated demands; and the plaintiff was obliged to buy elsewhere, at an increased price. In this action for failure to deliver the burlap the plaintiff obtained a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">I. By requests for rulings and exceptions to portions of the charge, the defendant raises the question whether the judge erred in ruling that \"the entire contract was embodied in the sales note. On this point we assume, \"in favor of the defendant, that its letter of October 23 should also be considered, in determining what were the terms of the contract; because the sales note was sent \u201csubject to the conditions mentioned in our letter quoting the goods to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The substantial rights of the defendant were not impaired, however, by the judge\u2019s erroneous construction. The clause in the letter, \u201cthese prices are subject to change of market,\u201d plainly related to the offering price, and did not affect the price that later was fixed by the contract. The only other provision relied on by the defendant, which is set out in the letter and not in the sales note, is that \u201cthe delivery would have to be strictly subject to the arrival of our own importations.\u201d This first appears as a defence in the amended answer, filed at the time of the trial; up to which time the contention of the defendant was that it never made the alleged contract. On the facts shown it is immaterial that the judge disregarded this clause. The defendant never attempted to place an order for burlap from Calcutta in execution of the plaintiff\u2019s contract; and it would have been impossible to obtain importations for delivery on December 1 unless they had been ordered long before this contract was made. That the defendant in fact did not rely upon its own importations is clear from the testimony of Mrs. Collins, wife of the president of the defendant corporation. She had charge of the \u201cburlap end\u201d of the business; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and testified in substance that the company had an adequate supply on hand for delivery to the plaintiff, and would have covered this sale if the Boston manager had informed them of the existence of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">2. For the same reasons, the clause in the sales nqte, \u201cdelivery subject to . . . marine disasters\u201d has no application, on the facts disclosed. The defendant\u2019s order of November 15, for the shipment from Calcutta of twenty-five bales, was not made in contemplation of this contract; and the burlap did not reach Boston until sometime in March, 1916. The plaintiff\u2019s rights were not affected by the fire on board the \u201cCity of Naples,\u201d which apparently was carrying jute that the defendant expected to share.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">3. There was no error in the statement in the charge, that according to the contract two bales were to be delivered on the first day of December. The express stipulation in the sales note was, \u201cDelivery 2 bales per month commencing December 1st.\u201d And this construction was recognized by the reference to \u201cthose two bales, which I understand, are due you February 1st,\u201d in the defendant\u2019s letter of January 29, 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">4. As already stated, in consequence of the defendant\u2019s failure to make deliveries in accordance with its contract, the plaintiff was compelled to buy elsewhere. It is apparent from the correspondence that it was difficult to obtain burlap, owing to war conditions. In January the plaintiff\u2019s mill was closed because of inability to secure this material. In placing replacement orders the plaintiff secured minimum prices by getting three different bids on each purchase; and it kept the defendant informed of its needs and efforts. It does not appear that the plaintiff was able to procure burlap on the first day of each month, or that it could have bought at a lower price than it did. From statements of testimony in the judge\u2019s charge it is apparent that the jury had the benefit of quotations which are only summarized in the exceptions. In short, on the issue of damages, the defendant fails to show that its substantial rights were injuriously affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">5. Further detailed discussion of the exceptions seems unnecessary. We have examined all of them, and find no reversible error in the conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
