Writ in the Police Court of Brockton dated March 16, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court the action came on to be heard before <em>Raymond, </em>J., upon the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">On March 26, 1907, the plaintiff owned certain real estate in West Bridgewater, subject to a first mortgage for $1,000, made by his predecessor in title, and to a second mortgage for $300 made by himself. Upon the second mortgage there was due $270. On that day he conveyed the premises to the defendant by a deed containing the provision, \u201cSubject to a first mortgage of one thousand dollars with accrued interest held by Edith Hayward, and to a second mortgage of two hundred seventy dollars with accrued interest to Maud F. Silver, or assignee, which grantee assumes and agrees to pay, meaning hereby to assume and pay both of said mortgages and to hold the grantor harmless thereon.\u201d The principal of the first mortgage was not paid when due and it was foreclosed by virtue of the usual power of sale, on June 29, 1907, and the premises were struck off for the sum of $805.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">One Blanchard and one Dole were holders in due course by mesne conveyance of the second mortgage. The plaintiff paid to them the interest and $120 on the principal of that note previous to or on February 25,1909, and also $156.75, damages, and $12.23, costs, on September 20, 1912, at which time judgment was entered against him in a suit by Blanchard and Dole upon the second mortgage note. The premises in question were worth, up to and at the time of the foreclosure of the first mortgage, a sum not less than $1,300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">The action was reported by the judge upon the pleadings and agreed facts for determination by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-9\"><em>R.

The foreclosure extinguished the lien of the second mortgage but not the debt, and, the proceeds of the sale having failed to pay in full the amount of the mortgage note with accruing interest, the holders brought suit against the plaintiff, and, having recovered judgment which he has satisfied, the present action is brought to recover the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The defence is, that, even if the defendant undertook the payment of each mortgage, the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued on May 16, 1907, and, more than six years having elapsed before the present action was begun, it is barred by the statute of limitations. R. L. c. 202, \u00a7 2, cl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The defendant, relying on <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>152 Mass. 108, also contends that, having assumed the incumbrances, he undertook not only to pay the first mortgage but to relieve the premises from the lien of each mortgage, and, the plaintiff having permitted the foreclosure, his damages for breach of the agreement are limited to the value of the security thereby lost. The agreement, however, is a contract of indemnity, whereby the defendant expressly engages to save the plaintiff harmless from payment of the second mortgage. The relation of the parties as between themselves became that of principal and surety, and while the security may be considered as a primary fund out of which the plaintiff as surety was entitled to have payment made, yet the grantee and principal undertook to relieve him from all personal liability on the mortgage note, as well as from all liability under the mortgage. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>152 Mass. 108. The agreement by its terms is severable and an action lies for separate breaches. <em>Badger </em>v. <em>Titcomb, </em>15 Pick. 409. <em>McQuesten </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>231 Mass. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">If it be conceded that the plaintiff might have brought suit at any time after March 26,1907, when the balance remaining on the second mortgage was overdue and unpaid, nevertheless he has as surety the option to'rely on the defendant\u2019s personal undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of complete indemnity, and, until obliged to make payment, the statute did not begin to run. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>12 Met. 130, 135. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>110 Mass. 345. <em>McQuesten </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>231 Mass. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">The contract having stipulated for full indemnity, the plaintiff\u2019s \u2022 damages are based on the loss actually sustained, which includes not only interest but legal costs and expenses. <em>Montgomery Door &amp; Sash Co. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Lumber Co. </em>206 Mass. 144, 157. <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Municipal Council of Lowell, </em>233 Mass. 174. The plaintiff accordingly is entitled to judgment in the sum of $168.98 with interest from the date of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
