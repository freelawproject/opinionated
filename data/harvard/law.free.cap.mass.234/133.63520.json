I have also prepared a draft of the order to accompany the report, and enclose a copy of the same herewith, the amount determined as the cost of the station for the purposes of this case being left in blank. I have attempted to embody in the order the terms of the agreement between parties so far as applicable. Would you be kind enough to look this over and advise me as soon as possible of any changes or additions to the order which appear to you to be desirable for a full and correct statement of the terms agreed to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The return further stated that on September 19, 1918, the petitioners\u2019 attorney replied to the above letter with the following \u25a0 letter: \u201cReplying to your favor of the 16th inst., enclosing draft of order relative to the Worcester Station rental, my only suggestion is that the effective date of the valuation of the station building should not be January 1, 1916, but should be January 31, 1918, the date of the termination of the contract between the parties. As I stated at the hearing, I understood that the parties were agreeable to having the percentages revised from January 1, 1916, but that did not apply to \u2018 Schedule A,\u2019 so-called, involving the cost of the station.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-3\">The return of the respondents then stated that on October 9, 1918, the commission made certain findings of fact and the order objected to was entered. Among the findings of fact was the following: \u201cThe parties have agreed that the award so made by the commission shall be effective from January 1, 1916.\u201d The last paragraph of the order read: \u201c4. This award shall be effective as of the first day of January, 1916, and shall continue in force thereafter until terminated in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of chapter 422 of the Acts of 1905.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\">The petition was heard by <em>Loring, </em>J.

The entire cost of the land and sixty-five per cent of the cost of the .station were paid by the Boston and Albany Railroad Company, the balance being contributed by the Commonwealth and the city of Worcester. Section 2 of the act reads: \u201cSaid station shall be used by all the railroads now entering the city of Worcester, the railroad corporations owning or operating such railroads severally yielding and paying to the Boston and Albany Railroad Company,\" its lessee, successors or assigns, a reasonable rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>for the use thereof, which, if not agreed upon by the parties, shall be determined, and may be revised and altered from time to time at intervals of not less than three years, by the board of railroad commissioners upon a petition presented to said board by either of said corporations.\u201d As the parties failed to agree, the Boston and Albany Railroad Company and the New York Central Railroad Company petitioned the public service commission (successor to the board of railroad commissioners) under this statute to determine the reasonable rental for the use of the station to be paid by the Boston and Maine Railroad and the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad Company. After due hearings and investigation the commission made an order fixing the rental, to be effective from January 1, 1916. Thereupon this petition for a writ of certiorari was brought to correct certain alleged errors of law in the proceedings of the commission. A single justice of this court, before whom the case was heard, refused to make the rulings requested by the petitioners, and ordered the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">Most of the items on which the rental was computed are undisputed. The petitioners urge, however, that the commission erred in determining that the thirty-five per cent contributed by the city and State toward the cost of the station should not be made the basis of a fixed charge to be paid by the other railroad companies, and insist that the reasonable rental should be based on the net cost of the present station to the Boston and Albany Railroad Company. Complaint is also made of the view which the commission took on the subject of depreciation. The short answer to all the contentions of the petitioners is that a writ of certiorari lies only to correct errors in law, and not to revise the decision of a question of fact. No question of law was raised at the hearing before the commission. The issue submitted to them, namely, what was a reasonable rental for the use of the station, was within their jurisdiction, their finding was within the scope of the petition, and was a finding of fact.' They prefaced their order by a preliminary statement containing a history of the proceedings, and the reasons which led them to a conclusion which they thought equitable between the parties. Without intimating that the statement fails to fully support the order, it seems plain that it contains only findings of fact. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>certainly contains no ruling of law which renders the order itself invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"AiH\">Our only doubt arises from the action of the commission in making the award retroactive to January 1, 1916. See <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad </em>v. <em>Western Railroad, </em>14 Gray, 253, 265. But we think they did not exceed their authority, in view of their express finding that \u201cThe parties have agreed that the award so made by the commission shall be effective from January 1, 1916.\u201d While the letter of counsel for the petitioners, dated September 19, 1918, indicates that this statement was not entirely in accordance with his understanding of the agreement, we must accept the finding of the commission as final, for the purposes of this petition. <em>Farmington River Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>112 Mass. 206. <em>Haven </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>155 Mass. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"AnO\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
