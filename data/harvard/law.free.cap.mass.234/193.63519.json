Release.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AqK\">If one, who has suffered personal injury in an accident caused by conduct of two persons, makes something in the nature of a claim against one of them, against whom under the rules of law he possibly might have recovered damages, and, upon receiving a sum of money from that person, executes and delivers to him an instrument under seal in the nature of a release, such release discharges from liability the other person whose conduct contributed to cause the injuries, although the person to whom the release was given in fact was not responsible for the injury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AkX\">In an action of tort for personal injuries against a street railway company, the plaintiff alleged that, when he was riding on a truck loaded with inflammable material under the defendant\u2019s trolley wire, the wire broke and fell upon the truck causing a fire which resulted in his injury. At the trial evidence of the defendant tended to show that the fire was caused in another way and that, with the load burning, the driver of the truck continued under the trolley wire, causing it to melt and fall. The owner of the truck paid the plaintiff $75 and the plaintiff executed and delivered to him an instrument which recited that such owner did not assume liability for the injury \u201cbut that this compromise is made for the purpose of adjusting any supposed or real claim which\u201d the plaintiff had against such owner \"for injuries, moneys paid out for care, medicines, etc.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the release was a bar to the maintenance of the action against the street railway company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ap1\"><em>At </em>the trial of the action above described, testimony of the plaintiff, a woman, was admitted tending to show that, although she could read, she did not read the instrument which she signed, that the money was paid to her \u201clike a gift to pay me. ... It was said they gave me a gift to pay damage to my clothes,\u201d and that she executed the instrument relying upon such statement. The owner of the truck testified that he told the plaintiff that he wanted to \u201cuse her right,\u201d that, \u201cwhatever she had lost by the fire\u201d he would \u201ctry and repay her,\u201d and that he asked her what the amount would be and she was satisfied with the amount paid by him. <em>Held, </em>without determining the admissibility of the evidence, that it raised no question for the jury because, since it did not tend to show that the agreement between the plaintiff and the owner of the truck was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>different from that set out in the instrument which the plaintiff executed and delivered, it did not lessen the legal effect of that document as a bar to the action against the street railway company.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-3\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have resulted from the fall of a trolley wire of the defendant, causing a current of electricity to come into contact with the clothing and person of the plaintiff and the igniting of a load of highly inflammable viscoloid on a truck, upon which the plaintiff was riding and which was owned by William <em>F. </em>O\u2019Brien and operated by one of his employees.

O\u2019Brien. The truck carried a load of highly inflammable vi^coloid waste and was proceeding along the defendant\u2019s tracks on Lancaster Street, Leominster. The jury could have found on the facts presented that owing to the defendant\u2019s negligence a defective trolley wire broke and fell on the truck, setting fire to it, injuring the plaintiff and burning her clothing. There was evidence that before the wire fell, a boy who had been smoking a pipe, jumped on the truck, and as he did so, knocked the pipe on the side of the truck and the ashes dropped to the ground; that a short time after this the boxes of waste caught fire and the blaze from the fire extended above , the normal position of the trolley wire. It was the contention of the defendant that the waste became ignited at some distance before the truck reached the point where the wire fell and that the heat melted the copper wire and caused it to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Subsequent to the accident the plaintiff, in consideration of $75 paid her, signed an instrument under seal releasing O\u2019Brien from all claims for damages resulting from the injury. The jury were directed by the trial judge to return a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the release signed by the plaintiff and delivered to O\u2019Brien barred her right against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The entire injury to the plaintiff was caused by the same tort. There could be but one indemnity for the wrong and the release of one joint tortfeasor released all the wrongdoers. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Dickinson, 5 </em>Allen, 29. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>196 Mass. 384. This rule applies where one is injured by the combined or concurring negligence of two or more persons acting independently of each other, with no concert of action, and where the wrong done was not intentional. <em>Feneffy. Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>196 Mass. 575,582. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The same principle is pertinent when the person released or discharged from liability was not in fact responsible for the injury, if something in the nature of a claim has been made upon him and there was a possible liability under the rules of law. <em>Pickwick </em>v. <em>McCauliff, </em>193 Mass. 70. <em>Leddy </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>139 Mass. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\">The plaintiff could have contended that after the waste took fire the driver of the truck was negligent in continuing in the defendant\u2019s track under the trolley wire, which was old and defective, when he might have seen its condition and avoided it; and the writing stated that the money was paid in satisfaction of the claims made on the defendant by the plaintiff. In <em>Pickwick </em>v. <em>McCauliff, supra, </em>the plaintiff was injured while in the employ of the Commonwealth by the defendant\u2019s negligence. He signed a paper agreeing to make no claim on the Commonwealth in consideration of its paying him his wages while incapacitated and indemnifying him for his doctor\u2019s bills and hospital expenses. He did not claim damages from the Commonwealth and it was not legally responsible to him. What the plaintiff received was not in satisfaction of his damages. The payment was in the nature of a gift or gratuity. The case is distinguishable from the c\u00e1se at bar, where there was a claim made on O\u2019Brien as shown by the terms of the release; and on the record, there was at least the possibility that she could recover against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The plaintiff was permitted, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, to introduce paroi evidence for the purpose of showing that the money paid by O\u2019Brien was a gift to her and not in satisfaction of her damages. In reply to the question if O\u2019Brien paid her money, she said: \u201cHe did; yes, like a gift to pay me;\u201d and when asked what was said about the paper, replied: \u201cIt was said they gave me a gift to pay damage to my clothes.\u201d Even if we assume that this evidence was admissible for the purpose offered against the defendant, who was not a party to the written agreement, see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Von Scholley, </em>218 Mass. 454, it was entirely insufficient to show that the actual agreement was different from that set out in the written instrument. No fraud was practised on the plaintiff, she could read and write, and she did not show that the writing failed to express correctly her agreement and understanding with O\u2019Brien. The fact that some one (it does not appear who) said that a gift was made to pay for damages to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>clothes, fails to indicate that she did not receive the money in payment of the claim for damages and in full satisfaction of her loss, and her statement that the payment was \u201clike a gift to pay me\u201d does not contradict the release. There is no evidence to the effect that the written instrument is not a true record of the entire agreement of the parties; and as the payment made by O\u2019Brien was in satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s damages, there can be no recovery against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
