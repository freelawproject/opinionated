S. St. 1913, c. 16, and U. S. St. 1916, c. 463, as amended by the war income tax act, U. S.

The covenant in the present case, however, is not thus limited. It reads, \u201cThe Lessees covenant and agree as far as at any time permitted by law to pay and discharge any taxes or excises which during the term may be lawfully levied, laid or assessed upon or against the rent payable hereunder, whether levied or assessed upon the same as rental or as income of any person or persons entitled thereto.\u201d The surtax called for under the provisions of U. S. St. 1913, c. 16, U. S. St. 1916, c. 463, and U. S. 1916, c. 463, as amended by the war income tax act, U. S. St. 1917, c. 63, is only an additional income tax graduated and collected as prescribed, and it is immaterial that this mode of taxation came into existence after the date of the lease. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>224 Mass. 267. It also is a direct tax which may be assessed on rentals when received as income, for reasons pointed out in <em>Suter </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. 225 </em>Mass. 34, and <em>Codman </em>v. <em>American Piano Co. 229 </em>Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">It being plain that the taxes in question were lawfully imposed, and perceiving no question as to the method and accuracy of the several computations and the defendants having expressly covenanted to pay them, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the sum of $3,080.61, to which by agreement of parties interest is to be added on the amount due each year for the years 1915, 1916 and 1917. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Cotting, 229 </em>Mass. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
