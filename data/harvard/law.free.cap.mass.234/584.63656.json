The note was signed, \u201cNational Realty Co. by\u201d the individuals named as defendants. <em>Held, </em>that under R.

It appeared that the note in suit was issued for money borrowed for a temporary purpose for the trust. <em>Held, </em>that the trust instrument should be admitted in evidence, both because it tended to prove under R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 37, the existence of the National Realty Company and the authority of the defendants as trustees, and because it tended to establish the equitable defence set up in-the answer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-13\">Contract upon the promissory note described in the opinion.

This agreement was dated February 13, 1912, was under seal, and was signed by the defendants and by the plaintiff. The trustees were given powers therein to acquire real estate for the company and to borrow money for temporary purposes, giving therefor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>notes signed by them in their capacity as trustees. It also in substance contained all the provisions set out in the answer of the defendants. The agreement and declaration of trust was excluded upon the ground that it varied the terms of the note, and \u201cwas not admitted upon any ground, except that it may be considered to have been admitted for the sole purpose of explaining the character and terms of the National Realty Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The trial court refused to rule (1) \u201cThat the signature \u2018National Realty Co. by Simon Swig, Edward L. McManus, Robert Luce, Louis Goldstein, Trustees\u2019 is the signature of the National Realty Company and is not the joint signature of the individual defendants;\u201d (2) \u201cIf the court finds that the plaintiff had knowledge of the \u2018Agreement and Declaration of Trust\u2019 of February 13, 1912, and was in fact a party thereto and a signer thereof, \u2014 then he is bound by its provisions and the note upon which this suit is brought must be construed as binding none of the defendants personally;\u201d (3) \u201cThe plaintiff is barred by the agreement of trust from asserting the personal liability of the defendants upon this note and in the absence of evidence that there are in their hands funds of the National Realty Company he cannot recover; \u201d and (4) \u201cThe defendants cannot be held personally responsible in these proceedings against them \u2018as they are trustees of the National Realty Company;\u201d\u2019 and \u201cfound for the plaintiff,\u201d and reported the case to the Appellate Division of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston. In the appellate court the final order was entered \u201cReport dismissed,\u201d and the defendants appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 37, reads: \u201cWhere the\u2019 instrument contains, or a person adds to his signature, words indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal, or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the instrument if he was duly authorized; but the mere addition of words describing him as an agent, or as filling a representative character, without disclosing his principal, does not exempt him from personal liability.\u201d <em>Jefts </em>v. <em>York, </em>10 Cush. 392. In the case at bar, on its face the note purports to bear the signature of the National Realty Company by the defendants as trustees. Perforce of the statute it follows that the defendants are not individually liable thereon if the National Realty Company existed and the defendants had authority to act for that company. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>First National Bank of Greenfield, </em>187 Mass. 533. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>22 Man. 330. Parol evidence was admissible to prove either or both of those issuable facts. <em>Jump </em>v. <em>Sparling, </em>218 Mass. 324. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>204 Mass. 346, 356. <em>Horgan </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>233 Mass. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The agreement of trust under seal and executed by the defendants, the plaintiff, and other subscribers, created' a voluntary association with the collective title National Realty Company. <em>Melledge </em>v. <em>Boston Iron Co. </em>5 Cush. 158, 173, 176. <em>Rand </em>v. <em>Farquhar, </em>226 Mass. 91, 97. The associate name was signed to the note in suit by the trustees, who are the defendants, under the provision of the trust agreement empowering the trustees to issue notes or bonds, to secure the payment of the same \u201cby mortgage of the whole or of any part of the trust property,\u201d and \u201cto borrow money for temporary purposes giving therefor notes, signed by them in their capacity as Trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">It follows that the note was signed in the name of a disclosed, existent principal, by the defendants as trustees, acting by virtue of an express authority conferred upon them by the associate members of the company, among whom was the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Independently of R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 37, it would seem that the excluded evidence was admissible in support of the answer considered as an equitable defence.
