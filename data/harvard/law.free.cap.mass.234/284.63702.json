Mr. Souther, before I make any attempt I have concluded to write you in regards to this accident which could very easy have been avoided, but was probably overlooked, but at the same time I think your attention should be called to prevent further accidents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-3\">Mr. Souther, I would be pleased to hear from you at once and also wishing you and your family a very happy New Year and many of them to come.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\">Very respectfully,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">Mary E.

O. Souther, Jr., advising of injury received by you on Pond Street was brought up before the Board of Selectmen yesterday, and as your communication does not enlighten the Board sufficiently, I beg to ask if you will kindly in writing or in person advise the Board of Selectmen the exact time , and place where you received the injury you write about. In fact, please give the Board full information to enable them to investigate the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-11\">Yours very truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-12\">Edward L.

Upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-16\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The statutory notice of the time, place and cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury was not sufficient, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-17\">The judge refused to rule as requested, and ruled that the letter of the selectmen of January 8 was not a sufficient demand for further notice under R. L. c. 51, \u00a7 22, to enable the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>to avail itself of an omission by the plaintiff to state in her letter dated December 5, 1914, the time, place or cause of the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-5\">The jury found in answer to a special question that the accident was due to an unsafe condition of the street amounting to a defect caused in part by or consisting in part of snow or ice, and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,500. Both parties alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">R-. L. c. 51, \u00a7 21, as amended by St. 1912, c. 221, \u00a7 1, is as follows: \u201cSuch notice shall be in writing, signed by the person injured or by some one in his behalf, and may be given, in the case of a county, to one of the county commissioners or the county treasurer; in the case of a city, to the mayor, the city clerk or treasurer; and in the case of a town, to one of the selectmen or to the town clerk or treasurer. If the person injured dies within the time required for giving the notice, his executor or administrator may give such notice within thirty days after his appointment. If by reason of physical or mental incapacity it is impossible for the person injured to give the notice within the time required, he may give it within ten days after such incapacity has been removed, and if he dies within said ten days his executor or administrator may give the notice within thirty days after his appointment. Any form of written communication signed by the person so injured, or by some person in his behalf, or by his executor or administrator, or by some person in behalf of such executor or administrator, which contains the information that the person was so injured, giving the time, place and cause of the injury or damage, shall be considered a sufficient notice.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-7\"><em>A. P. Worthen, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-8\"><em>T. II. Buttimer, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\"> It was agreed that this letter be read as dated <em>\u201c </em>Jan. -5, 1915,\u201d and the reply on the next page as dated \"Jan. 8, 1915.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b310-9\">Rugg, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS0\">This is an action of tort whereby the plaintiff seeks to recover compensation for injuries received by her while a traveller on a highway in the defendant town by reason of a defect therein \u201ccaused,\u201d as found by the jury, \u201cin part by or consisting in part of snow or ice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Within less than ten days after her injury, the plaintiff sent the letter, signed by her, which is set out above in full. It is plain that this was not a notice such as was required by the law before the enactment of St. 1912, c. 221. See now St. 1917, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>c. 344, Part IV, \u00a7 27. <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>216 Mass. 506. <em>Grebenstein </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Co. </em>209 Mass. 196. A significant change was made by that statute in R. L. c. 51, \u00a7 20 (see now St. 1917, c. 344, Part IV, \u00a7 26), to the effect that \u201cAny form of written communication signed by the person so injured . . . which contains the information that the person was so injured, giving the time, place and cause of the injury or damage, shall be considered a sufficient notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The notice in the case at bar must be tested by the law as amended by that statute. The communication here in question was not directed to the town. But it was addressed to a person who was one of the selectmen. Service of a sufficient notice upon a member of the board of selectmen of a town is adequate by the express terms of the statute. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Dedham, 188 </em>Mass. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The communication, being in writing and served on the proper officer of the town, was a sufficient notice under said c. 221. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>229 Mass. 511. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The written communication was inaccurate further in not stating the place of the injury, since Pond Street was a mile in length and without a sidewalk. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>155 Mass. 595, 597. It is provided by R. L. c. 51, \u00a7 20, that such a \u201cnotice shall not be invalid or insufficient solely by reason of any inaccuracy in stating the time, place or cause of the injury, if it is shown that there was no intention to mislead and that the party entitled to notice was not in fact misled thereby.\u201d It is conceded that there was no intention on the part of the plaintiff to mislead and no actual misleading of the officers of the town. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>162 Mass. 51. It is enacted by R. L. c. 51 \u00a7 22 (see now St. 1917, c. 344, Part IV, \u00a7 28), that a town shall not avail itself in defence \u201c of any omission to state in such notice the time, place or cause of the injury . . . unless, within five days after receipt of a notice,\u201d seasonably served, a counter notice is given calling attention to its insufficiency, and requesting written notice in compliance with the law. In the present case a letter was sent within five days after the first communication, which is set out above in full. This notice was not in compliance with the terms of said \u00a7 22 as to counter notice because it requested the plaintiff to enlighten the selectmen \u201cin writing or in person.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>A request for advice as to the exact time and place of receiving an injury either by a personal interview or in writing is not the equivalent of the request for \u201ca written notice in compliance with the law\u201d contemplated by said \u00a7 22. The terms of the letter sent to the plaintiff were satisfied by a conference had at the next meeting of the selectmen. While the town officers cannot waive the statutory requirement for a notice, <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>128 Mass. 387, they are not bound under the law to demand by counter notice in all cases the more perfect notice required by \u00a7 22, if they honestly think that the interests of the municipality may be protected otherwise. The plaintiff is not to be prejudiced because they have failed to exercise their right to ask unequivocally for a new notice in writing. The plaintiff in the case at bar complied with the law as to giving notice. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>219 Mass. 302. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>229 Mass. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">R. L. c. 51, and St. 1912, c. 221, are repealed by St. 1917, c. 344, Part VIII, \u00a7 1, but the case at bar having arisen before May 26, 1917, .is governed by their provisions under \u00a7 2 of said Part VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Since the exceptions of the defendant must be overruled, the plaintiff is not harmed by alleged errors and waives whatever rights, if any, she might otherwise possess to have them considered. <em>Defendant\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions waived.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
