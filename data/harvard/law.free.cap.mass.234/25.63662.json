Sprague <em>v. </em>said Helen E. Duquette a special attachment of the premises was made. The premises were described by metes and bounds in the officer\u2019s return, dated April 25, 1913, which return set forth that the attachment was of all the right, title and interest in the premises which the defendant had therein. . . .

At the close of the evidence, the respondent made the following requests:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201c1. That the evidence offered by the petitioner does not establish a chain of title which would entitle him to have the land registered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the evidence shows that the only title the petitioner has to the land is a life interest, and, the fee being in the name of another person who is not a party to the petition, said petitioner is not entitled to a decree of registration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\">\u201c3. That, prior to April 25th, when the predecessor in title to the petitioner caused the right of title, and interest of Helen E. Duquette to be attached, the right, title and interest having been conveyed on a sale under execution prior to said attachment, then the only claim acquired under said attachment was a bare, naked right of redemption. The mortgage was a good and valid mortgage at that time, but the conditions of the mortgage had been broken and the rights under said mortgage took precedence to the rights of any sale under said attachment. A breach of said conditions of the mortgage continued, and the mortgagee upon foreclosure took absolute title in fee to the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\">\u201c4. That an attachment of the right of redemption of a creditor is not an attachment of real estate, but an attachment of a chose in action, and the rights acquired under said attachment do not supersede an existing mortgage then on the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-8\">\u201c5. That when an entry is made by the mortgagee for breach of conditions of a mortgage and the certificate of peaceable entry is recorded there is an implied intention on the part of the mortgagee to keep possession of the premises thus lawfully acquired for the term of three years and that personal occupation of said mortgaged estate by the mortgagee during the three years following said entry is not necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-9\">\u201c6. That, whatever possession of the premises was held by others, the mortgagor was sustained with the mortgagee\u2019s possession during the period of foreclosure. A creditor who becomes a purchaser of the equity has no right to contest the validity, of the mortgage on the grounds that the mortgage was a fraudulent transaction without consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-10\"><em>\u201c7. </em>That the petitioner being a successor in title to the mortgagor, can not hold adversely to the rights of the mortgagee and he acquires only the same right that the mortgagor had. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\">The requests were refused.

A decision in favor of the petitioner has been entered in that court. The respondent, who contends that she is the owner of the land, excepted to the refusal of the associate judge to make seven rulings requested by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The following'findings of fact are recited in the decision: On May 11, 1910, Helen E. Sprague acquired title to the locus by deed which was duly recorded on May 13, 1910; afterwards she married David Duquette, and on May 22, 1912, as Helen E. Sprague Duquette conveyed the land to Thomas Boulle, (husband of the respondent,) reserving a life estate therein; on the same day, Boulle conveyed the land to David Duquette subject to the life estate of Helen E. Duquette; both of these deeds were duly recorded on May 23, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">On April 24, 1913, a deputy sheriff for the county of Franklin, by virtue of an execution issued on a- judgment recovered by William A. Davenport against Helen E. Duquette, conveyed all her right, title and interest in the land which she had on January 23, 1913 \u2014 the date when it was attached on mesne process \u2014 to Thomas Boulle; the deed was duly recorded on May 2, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">On April 25, 1913, in an action brought by George A. Sprague against Helen E. Duquette, a special attachment was made of the land in question, the officer\u2019s return setting forth that the attachment was of all the right, title and interest which the defendant had therein and that the record title stood in the name of David Duquette; an execution issued on the judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and thereunder, all the interest of the defendant in the land was sold and conveyed to Sprague on September 17, 1913, the deed being duly recorded on October 10, 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">On September 18, 1915, Thomas Boulle \u201cby order of court released to said Sprague all the right, title and interest which he acquired by virtue of the first sheriff\u2019s deed above referred to. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">On September 17, 1914, Sprague brought a writ of entry against David Duquette to obtain possession of the land, and recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>judgment thereunder on September 7, 1915; an execution was issued on the judgment and the plaintiff was put in possession of the premises and on January 12, 1916, Sprague conveyed the land to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The respondent claims that the land was conveyed to her by David Duquette by mortgage deed dated May 6, 1913, and recorded May 21, 1913; and that on May 6, 1915, for breach of condition thereof, she entered and took possession for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage, and is now the owner of the land in fee simple. The associate judge of the Land Court found that, before the mortgage was given to the respondent, there were two prior mortgages on the locus, which were discharged April 18, 1913; that the discharges thereof were duly recorded May 21, 1913; and that the only outstanding mortgage on the last named date was that held by the respondent. It appears from the record that the attachments in the two actions against Helen E. Duquette above referred to were both made before May 21 (the date when the respondent\u2019s mortgage, was recorded), namely, on January 23, 1913, and on April 25,1913, respectively. The judge found that on the record it is shown that the plaintiffs in the actions above referred to recovered judgments against the defendant, that executions issued, levies were made thereunder, and the defendant\u2019s interest in the land was sold; that the attachments continued in force until the levies were made; that all the requisites of the statutes were complied with and that the record title is in the petitioner. We cannot revise the findings of fact made in the Land Court. Under the sheriff\u2019s deed first above referred to, the purchaser acquired title to the life estate held and owned by Helen E. Duquette; under the second sheriff\u2019s deed he acquired not only her right to redeem from the first sheriff\u2019s deed but also her interest in the land standing in the name of David Duquette, and seasonably brought a writ of entry for possession. R. L. c. 178, \u00a7 47. It is plain upon the findings recited in the record that, at the time of the conveyance from George A. Sprague to the petitioner, the grantor\u2019s title to the land was complete and absolute. The respondent\u2019s requests for rulings were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The officer\u2019s return on the second execution was in correct form and in substantial compliance with the statute. R. L. c. 178, \u00a7 49. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>210 Mass. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The respondent\u2019s objection that the notice to the defendant as shown by the officer\u2019s return upon the second execution was not in compliance with R. L. c. 178, \u00a7 44, cannot be sustained. The return as amended recites that the defendant at the time of the service thereof was living to the knowledge of the officer within his precinct. This recital must be taken as true. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>210 Mass. 588, 594. The service was in compliance with the' statute R. L. c. 178, \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">As none of the rulings requested by the respondent, properly could have been made, the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
