His employment compelled him \u201cto make use of the public streets and to ride in street cars to call on prospective purchasers of new insurance\u201d and to make collections on his route. Upon the facts the insurer contends that the hazards of the street in their relation to the employment of the decedent are hazards common to persons engaged in any employment who have occasion to travel along the streets and are not a causative danger peculiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>to Moran\u2019s employment, and cites as authorities for his position <em>Hewitt\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 1, and <em>Donohue\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 595. These were cases \"where the causative relation between injury and employment was too remote to charge the employment with the risk-of the particular injury received.\u201d <em>Keaney\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 532, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In the case at bar, the workman, to do the work of his employment, must continually stand in danger of receiving an injury from accidents resulting from exposure to whatever risks and hazards are commonly attendant on the use of public streets and conveyances, which risks to him are greater because more constant than those that are incidental to the occasional and casual use of such streets by persons who use them in the ordinary way. We are of opinion that the risk and hazard of the decedent\u2019s employment were not too remote in their causative relation to the employment; and that the case is governed by <em>Keaney\u2019s Case, supra, </em>and similar cases, and is distinguishable from <em>Hewitt\u2019s Case, sufra, </em>and from <em>Donohue\u2019s Case, sufra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
