The plaintiff requested the judge to rule in substance that, if the jury believed that the defendant violated the provisions of St. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 127, in failing to maintain the stairs in such repair as not to be dangerous, such failure was negligence on the part of the defendant, and that, if they believed the injury to the plaintiff was caused by such failure, their verdict should be for the plaintiff. The requests were refused. <em>Held, </em>that the requests were refused rightly.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-11\">In view of the negative answer of the jury to the special question in the action described above, it was <em>said </em>to be unnecessary to decide as to the correctness of certain instructions asked for by the plaintiff, which were based upon the hypothesis that the agreement, referred to in the question submitted to the jury, had been made.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-12\">Tort, against the owners of a building numbered 16H Bremen Street in that part of Boston called East Boston, for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff on January 23, 1917, in falling down\u2019 a stairway in that portion of the building let to her husband for a tenement under a tenancy at will. Writ dated March 9, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-13\">In the Superior Court the action was tried before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. Material facts are described in the opinion. The plaintiff asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-14\">\u201cIf you believe that the defendants violated the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>St. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 127, in failing to maintain these steps in such repair .as not to be dangerous, that is evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">\u201cSt. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 127, provides that owners of structures shall maintain their premises in such repair as not to be dangerous. If you believe that the owners of this building failed to maintain these steps in such repair, that they were dangerous, and the injury to the plaintiff was caused by such failure, your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\">The judge refused to make the rulings requested but, on the question raised by these requests, gave supplemental instructions to the jury in substance that St. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 127, would not apply to this action, if they should find that there was no duty devolving on the defendants to keep the premises safe, because, if there was no duty, there was no negligence. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-7\"><em>E. H. Savary, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-8\"><em>H. E.

But, the jury having answered in the negative the following question, \u201cDid the defendants agree with the plaintiff\u2019s husband, as a part of the renting of the premises by him, to keep the cellar stairway therein safe at all times during the tenancy, for the use of the tenant and those claiming under him?\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are limited to the refusal of the presiding judge to instruct the jury that, \u201cIf you believe that the defendants violated the provisions of St. 1907, c. 550, \u00a7 127, in failing to maintain these steps in such repair as not to be dangerous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>that is evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants. . . . Section 127 . . . provides that owners of structures shall maintain their premises in such repair as not to be dangerous. If you believe that the owners of this building failed to maintain these steps in such repair, that they were dangerous, and the injury to the plaintiff was caused by such failure, your verdict should be for the plaintiff,\u201d and to the instructions which were given on the questions raised by the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The statute which consists of one hundred and thirty-four sections is entitled an act relative to the construction and maintenance of buildings in the city of Boston, after creating a department to be called the building department to be under the charge of the street commissioner, prescribes certain requirements for the construction and maintenance, and proper lighting, plumbing and ventilation of all kinds of buildings, both public and private, whether constructed after, or existing at the time of enactment, and imposes a fine \u201cnot exceeding five hundred dollars\u201d for any violation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The section in question reads as follows: \u201cEvery structure and part thereof and appurtenant thereto shall be maintained in such repair as not to be dangerous. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all buildings and structures. The lessee under a recorded lease shall be deemed the owner under the provisions of this act.\u201d It is plain that there is no express repeal of the rule at common law relating to contracts creating a tenancy at will, under which no liability is imposed on the landowner for obvious defects, or for want of repair, unless he contracts to keep the premises in a safe condition, and to make suitable repairs during the tenancy. <em>Fiorntino </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>233 Mass. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The statute not having attempted to regulate or modify the contractual relations of the parties it should not be broadened, or a construction adopted by implication which would materially limit the rights of parties to enter into such lawful contracts as they please. It would be going far to say that the Legislature intended to do away with fundamental law. <em>Hyatts </em>v. <em>Mechanics\u2019 Mitts, </em>150 Mass. 190. <em>Barriere </em>v. <em>Depatie, </em>219 Mass. 33, 35, 36. The requests were denied rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">It is unnecessary to decide whether under <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Winslow Skate Manuf. Co. </em>189 Mass. 580, <em>Berdos </em>v. <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mitts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>209 Mass. 489, <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>231 Mass. 51, 61, 62, and <em>Cussen </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>232 Mass. 563, the instructions, that if the jury-found that a special agreement had been established, then \u201cthe fact (if it be a fact) that he was violating this statute, that would be evidence as bearing upon the question of negligence and might be considered ... as such evidence\u201d were correct. The question in view of the answer of the jury has ceased to be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
