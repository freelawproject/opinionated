Kelly, Jr., Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b831-9\" pgmap=\"831\">David G. Pflum, proceeding pro se <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the judgment entered against him after a jury convicted him of tax evasion and attempting to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws. See' 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7201 &amp; 7212(a). He was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment and to pay more than $8 million in restitution. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p> <p id=\"b831-10\" pgmap=\"831\">Mr. Pflum contends he is not obligated to pay taxes to the federal government. In his brief to this court, he states:</p> <blockquote id=\"b831-11\" pgmap=\"831\">The essence of this case is this Court\u2019s (1) dereliction of its duty to know, understand, and declare the law with respect to the controlling definition of the meaning of the word \u201cUnited States,\u201d as legislated by Congress 26 U.S.C 7701(a)(9) and 28 U.S.C. 3002(15), and the United States Constitution. Article III Sect. 2, (2) denigration of Pflum for exclusive reliance on and usage of said controlling definition and meanings of all of Pflum\u2019s filings, (3) insistence that the Court, a court of general jurisdiction has authority to hear and decide cases in geographic area fixed by the Constitution exclusively for courts of special jurisdiction; specifically Pottawatomie County, Kansas.</blockquote> <p id=\"b831-14\" pgmap=\"831\">Aplt. Br. 9-10 [sic throughout].</p> <p id=\"b831-15\" pgmap=\"831\">We have reviewed Mr. Pflum\u2019s brief and found no reasoned support for these arguments, which we conclude are utterly mer-itless. See Ford v. Pryor, 552 F.3d 1174, 1177 n.2 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cSuch tax-protestor arguments have long been held to be lacking in legal merit and frivolous.\u201d); Lonsdale v. United States, 919 F.2d 1440, 1448 (10th Cir. 1990) (listing tax-protestor arguments that courts have found \u201ccompletely lacking in legal merit and patently frivolous\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b831-16\" pgmap=\"831\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed, and all pending motions, including Mr. Pflum\u2019s motions to dismiss and to release, are denied as moot.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b831-12\" pgmap=\"831\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b831-28\" pgmap=\"831\">. We liberally construe Mr. Pflum\u2019s pro se pleadings. See Childs v. Miller, 713 F.3d 1262, 1264 (10th Cir. 2013).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
