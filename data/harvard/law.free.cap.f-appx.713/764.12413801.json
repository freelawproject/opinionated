No trial date has been set. Robinson has been detained pending trial for over five months based on a detention order issued under the Bail Reform Act. Although most of his eodefendants have been released on bond, Robinson faces prolonged detention because the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for an ends-of-justice continuance, with a corresponding 180-day exclusion for speedy trial purposes under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A).</p> <p id=\"b793-5\" pgmap=\"793\">Robinson seeks pretrial release through two separate filings: (1) an appeal of the district court\u2019s September 5, 2017, order denying his motion for a speedy trial and for severance of defendants or, in the alternative, for release from detention under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164(c) (\u201cSeptember 5th order\u201d); and (2) a petition for writ of mandamus. The appeal is authorized by Fed. R. Crim. P. 9(a), and we have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, We remand for the district court to conduct further proceedings in accordance with this order. We deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant Robinson\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief.</p> <p id=\"b793-6\" pgmap=\"793\">I. Background</p> <p id=\"b793-7\" pgmap=\"793\">After Robinson was indicted, the magistrate judge conducted a detention hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f). Robinson did not contest detention because his newly retained counsel \u201cwas not in a position to present evidence to rebut the statutory presumption of detention.\u201d Aplt. App. at 16. The magistrate judge considered and weighed the statutory factors listed in \u00a7 3142(g) as required. He concluded that no release conditions would reasonably assure Robinson\u2019s appearance and the safety of others and the community and therefore ordered pretrial detention. See Aplt. App. at 14-15 (citing Robinson\u2019s \u201cpast failures to comply with court orders and conditions of probation, his decision not to contest pretrial detention, [his] admitted drug use, his prior convictions for drug and weapons offenses, and the substantial penalties\u201d facing him, i.e., a minimum mandatory of ten years and a maximum of life imprisonment). Days later, Robinson moved to reopen his detention hearing, but his motion was denied.</p> <p id=\"b793-10\" pgmap=\"793\">Shortly thereafter, the government moved for a 180-day ends-of-justice continuance and a corresponding exclusion of the continuance time for speedy trial purposes under \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B)(ii), Robinson opposed the motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and demanded a trial or release by August 3, 2017\u2014the 90-day deadline in \u00a7 3164. The district court granted the motion and extended the speedy trial clock for all defendants to January 30,2018.</p> <p id=\"b793-11\" pgmap=\"793(120) 794(9)\">Robinson next moved for a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and for severance of defendants under Fed. R. Crim. P, 14(a) or, in the alternative, for release from detention under \u00a7 3164(e). In the September 5th order, the district court construed the motion as a request to reverse the 180-day exclusion from Robinson\u2019s speedy trial clock, denied the motion, and reaffirmed the continuance and the exclusion of time. It then found that the length of Robinson\u2019s pretrial detention did not violate \u00a7 3164, implicate due process concerns, or necessitate release under United States v. Theron, 782 F.2d 1510 (10th Cir. 1986). In addition, the court deemed severance unnecessary because Robinson did not establish that joinder of the defendants would compromise or prejudice his trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b794-4\" pgmap=\"794\">II. Analysis</p> <p id=\"A-mc\" pgmap=\"794\">A. The Speedy Trial Act</p> <p id=\"b794-5\" pgmap=\"794\">Under the Speedy Trial Act, a defendant must be tried within 70 days from the filing date of the information or indictment or the date of the defendant\u2019s first appearance, whichever is later. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). There is a separate clock for pretrial detention\u201490 days\u2014that applies in this case. Id. \u00a7 3164(b). The Act prioritizes the trial of \u201ca detained person who is being held in detention solely because he is awaiting trial.\u201d Id \u00a7 3164(a)(1). \u201cFailure to commence trial of a detainee as [required], through no fault of the accused or his counsel ,.. shall result in the automatic review by the court of the conditions of release. No detainee, as defined in [\u00a7 3161(a) ], shall be held in custody pending trial after the expiration of such [903-day period required for the commencement of-his trial.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3164(c). See, e.g., Theron, 782 F.2d at 1616-17 (finding a violation of \u00a7 3164 and ordering that the defendant be released on bond with appropriate restrictions or tried within 30 days).</p> <p id=\"b794-6\" pgmap=\"794\">Section 3161(h) enumerates periods of delay that shall be excluded in computing the statutory deadline for trial. Under \u00a7 3164(b), time that is excludable for purposes of a defendant\u2019s 70-day speedy trial clock is also excludable against the 90-day pretrial detention clock. Relevant here, there is an exclusion for \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from a continuance ... if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(7). There is also an exclusion for \u201c[a] reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefen-dant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3161(h)(6).</p> <p id=\"b794-10\" pgmap=\"794\">On appeal, Robinson argues that the district court\u2019s refusal to release him-from custody pending trial violates \u00a7 3164 and his constitutional due process rights. \u201c[C]ompliance with the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s legal requirements is subject to de novo review.\u201d United States v. Zar, 790 F.3d 1036, 1043 (10th Cir. 2015); accord United States v. Spring, 80 F.3d 1450, 1456 (10th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWe review de novo the trial court\u2019s application of the legal standards of the Speedy Trial Act ... and we review for clear error its factual findings.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b794-11\" pgmap=\"794(97) 795(15)\">To evaluate Robinson\u2019s claim, we need to ascertain whether an exclusion of time is appropriate under \u00a7 3161(h) and, if so, how much time should be excluded. We are unable to make that determination based on the record before us for two reasons. First, the district court extended Robinson\u2019s speedy trial clock under \u00a7 3161(h)(7) without considering his individual interest in a speedy trial, as required by the language of the statute and Theron.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the district court did not determine what constitutes \u201c[a] reasonable period of delay\u201d under \u00a7 3161(h)(6), even though that provision clearly applies here. We address each deficiency in turn and remand for appropriate findings.</p> <p id=\"b795-5\" pgmap=\"795\">B. Exclusion of Time Based on \u00a7 3161(h)(7)</p> <p id=\"b795-6\" pgmap=\"795\"> The district court granted a 180-day ends-of-justice continuance under \u00a7 3161(h)(7) and extended the speedy trial clock accordingly for all defendants, despite Robinson\u2019s objection; it then reaffirmed that ruling in the order under review here. The basis for the ruling is set forth in the transcript for the May 26, 2017, status conference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court considered the complexity of the case, the existence of many codefendants and their interests as a whole, the vast amount of discovery, and other factors listed in \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii), without taking into account Robinson\u2019s individual interest in a speedy trial.</p> <p id=\"b795-7\" pgmap=\"795\">\u201c[I]t must be clear from the record that the trial court struck the proper balance when it granted the continuance\u201d under \u00a7 3161(h)(7). Spring, 80 F.3d at 1456 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, 'it is not. The district court\u2019s analysis is flawed for the same reasons we identified in Therm, where the district court granted an ends-of-justice continuance based on \u201c(1) the codefendants\u2019 need for preparation time; (2) the complexity of the case; and (3) the desirability of trying all defendants at once.\u201d Theron, 782 F.2d at 1512.</p> <p id=\"b795-8\" pgmap=\"795\">For the first factor, we emphasized that the district court should have considered Theron\u2019s interests, not merely those of his codefendants. A continuance is appropriate under \u00a7 3161(h)(7) only where the ends of justice \u201coutweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d Id. at 1513 (internal quotation marks omitted). The provision \u201cdoes not say that the court may weigh the interests of codefen-dants,\u201d as does \u00a7 3161(h)(6). Id. If a defendant \u201cused all means available to him to secure an immediate trial[,] his desire and his position as a defendant who is not out on bail must weigh strongly in favor of applying\u201d the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s limitation. Id.</p> <p id=\"b795-12\" pgmap=\"795\">For the second factor, we emphasized that \u201cthe complexity of a case does not automatically justify an ends-of-justice continuance.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b795-13\" pgmap=\"795\">For the third factor, we stated that \u201cthe coincidence of a complex case and multiple defendants, without more,\u201d does not outweigh a particular defendant\u2019s interest in a prompt trial. Id. Stated otherwise, an ends-of-justice continuance is not appropriate where an \u201cincarcerated defendant\u2019s only contribution to the need for delay is his alleged participation with the codefen-dants in a complex scheme alleged to be illegal.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b795-14\" pgmap=\"795\">We then unequivocally stated that these factors were \u201ceither improper or insufficient ... to justify an ends-of-justice continuance,\u201d where there was no consideration given to the individual defendant\u2019s interest in a speedy trial. Id. at 1512-13.</p> <p id=\"b795-15\" pgmap=\"795(35) 796(31)\">We remand for the district court to consider Robinson\u2019s interests as an individual defendant for purposes of \u00a7 3161(h)(7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though our case law does not require a remand (in Theron, for instance, we simply found that the district court committed an error and that no tolling had occurred), a remand is necessary and appropriate here because of a second gap in the district court\u2019s analysis.</p> <p id=\"b796-4\" pgmap=\"796\">C. Exclusion of Time Based on \u00a7 3161(h)(6)</p> <p id=\"b796-5\" pgmap=\"796\"> The government did not invoke\u2014 nor did the district court consider\u2014 \u00a7 3161(h)(6), even though it clearly applies. See id. \u00a7 3161(h)(6) (\u201cThe following periods of delay shall be excluded ... in computing the time within which the trial ... must commence: ... A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.\u201d (emphasis added)). \u201cAn exclusion for delay attributable to one defendant is applicable to all co-defendants.\u201d United States v. Vogl, 374 F.3d 976, 983 (10th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b796-6\" pgmap=\"796\">The \u201cobvious purpose\u201d of \u00a7 3161(h)(6) is \u201cto accommodate the efficient use of prose-cutorial and judicial resources in trying multiple defendants in a single trial.\u201d Theron, 782 F.2d at 1614. To effectuate this purpose, our case law recognizes a \u201cstrong presumption favoring trying properly joined defendants together.\u201d Zar, 790 F.3d at 1043. For example, \u201cwhere ... a conspiracy is charged, individual conspirators should be tried together.\u201d United States v. Wright, 826 F.2d 938, 945 (10th Cir. 1987). Likewise, \u201c[wjhere the government will recite a single factual history, put on a single array of evidence, and call a single group of witnesses, a single trial is preferred.\u201d Vogl, 374 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying these principles, this court has found that \u201ca delay in the prosecution of [a single defendant]\u201d may be appropriate. United States v. Mobile Materials, Inc., 871 F.2d 902, 917 (10th Cir. 1989), abrogated on other grounds by Bloate v. United States, 559 U.S. 196, 130 S-Ct. 1345, 176 L.Ed.2d 54 (2010).</p> <p id=\"b796-8\" pgmap=\"796\">Robinson has multiple codefendants, no severance has been granted, and the time for trial has not run because the district court granted a 180-day ends-of-justice continuance based in part on the existence of those codefendants. Therefore, \u00a7 3161(h)(6) extends Robinson\u2019s 90-day deadline under \u00a7 3164 by some amount of time. But for how long?</p> <p id=\"b796-9\" pgmap=\"796\">In Therm, we did not need to determine what constitutes a reasonable delay under \u00a7 3161(h)(6) because we found that \u00a7 3164 required bail or immediate trial. 782 F.2d at 1514. And while we declined to establish a \u201cbright line\u201d as to what constitutes a reasonable delay for purposes of \u00a7 3164, we had \u201cno hesitancy\u201d in saying that four months additional incarceration before trial was \u201ctoo long\u201d under the circumstances present in that case. Id, at 1516.</p> <p id=\"b796-10\" pgmap=\"796(155) 797(13)\">We have since provided more guidance on \u201creasonableness\u201d under \u00a7 3161(h)(6). Based on the legislative history of the Speedy Trial Act, we have instru\u00e9ted: \u201c[I]n the application of the reasonableness standard under [\u00a7 3161(h)(6) ], judicial efficiency in the trial of multiple defendants is to be preferred to an inflexible adherence to the letter of the Speedy Trial Act.\u201d Vogl, 374 F.3d at 983 (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, we have identified three factors that are relevant to a reasonable determination: \u201c(1) whether the defendant is free on bond, (2) whether the defendant zealously pursued a speedy trial, and (3) whether the circumstances further the purpose behind the exclusion to accommodate the efficient use of prosecutorial and judicial resources in trying multiple defendants in a single trial.\u201d Id. at 984 (internal quotation marks omitted). This inquiry is \u201cheavily factual.\u201d Id. On remand, the district court should apply these standards and determine \u201ca reasonable period of delay\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3161(h)(6).</p> <p id=\"b797-5\" pgmap=\"797\">On remand, the district court should revisit whether the length of Robinson\u2019s pretrial detention violates \u00a7 3164 and implicates due process concerns under Theron. Even though the district court did not decide what constitutes \u201ca reasonable period of delay\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3161(h)(6) in the September 5th order, it briefly assessed Robinson\u2019s pretrial detention with respect to \u00a7 3164 and due process and concluded that \u201cneither [\u00a7 3164] nor Theron mandates [Robinson\u2019s] release.\u201d Aplt. App. at 68. In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied heavily on an unpublished opinion, United States v. Taylor, 602 Fed.Appx. 713, 716 (10th Cir. 2015), and a district court order, United States v. Lacallo, No. 09-CR-00055-PAB-2, 2010 WL 4511079, at *1 (D. Colo. Nov. 1, 2010). Both are distinguishable because in each case the defendants\u2019 behavior contributed to trial delays and prolonged their pretrial detention. In contrast, Robinson has consistently asserted his right to a speedy trial and has not contributed to any delays.</p> <p id=\"b797-6\" pgmap=\"797\">III. Conclusion</p> <p id=\"b797-7\" pgmap=\"797\">We remand for the district court to conduct further proceedings in accordance with this order. We deny the mandamus petition as moot.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b792-17\" pgmap=\"792(58) 793(32)\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R, App. P; 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b793-12\" pgmap=\"793\">.

Likewise, former \u00a7 3167(h)(7) is now codified at \u00a7 3161(h)(6).
