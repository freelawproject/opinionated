Cano-Bahena then unsuccessfully moved to withdraw his plea. Thereafter, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 108 months, to be followed by a four-year term of supervised release. Cano-Bahena now appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his plea, as well as two aspects of his sentence. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p> <p id=\"b782-13\" pgmap=\"782\">I</p> <p id=\"b782-14\" pgmap=\"782\">Factual background</p> <p id=\"b782-15\" pgmap=\"782\">In June and July 2014, law enforcement agents from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations (DHS) used a confidential informant (Cl) to make two controlled purchases of methamphetamine from an individual named Emanuel Godinez-Perez in Kansas City, Kansas. Law enforcement agents subsequently arrested Godinez-Per-ez, along with Cano-Bahena and Jose Men-era-Alvarez, both of whom were involved with Godinez-Perez in the distribution of the methamphetamine. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement agents seized ten different quantities of methamphetamine, totaling approximately 1,505.26 grams. Laboratory testing revealed that these quantities of methamphetamine ranged in purity from 96.1% to 100% pure. Based upon these purity figures, the net weight of the methamphetamine was estimated to be 1,479.8 grams.</p> <p id=\"b782-16\" pgmap=\"782\">Procedural background</p> <p id=\"b782-17\" pgmap=\"782(97) 783(12)\">On July 25, 2014, a criminal complaint was filed against the three men. Of relevance here, Count One of the complaint charged all three with conspiring to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute more than 500 grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(viii), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and Count Four charged all three with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(viii), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p> <p id=\"b783-5\" pgmap=\"783\">On August 6, 2014, a federal grand jury returned an indictment that essentially mirrored the criminal complaint.</p> <p id=\"b783-6\" pgmap=\"783\">On May 27, 2015, Cano-Bahena entered a plea of guilty, pursuant to a two-page written plea agreement, to one count of aiding and abetting Menera-Alvarez in knowingly and intentionally possessing with the intent to distribute five grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(b), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b783-7\" pgmap=\"783\">A presentence investigation report (PSR) was prepared and submitted to the district court and the parties on July 1, 2015. The PSR imposed a base offense level of 36 because the \u201coffense involv[ed] at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of \u2018Ice.\u2019 \u201d ROA, Vol. Ill at 12. The PSR in turn applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 due to Cano-Bahe-na having eluded the police prior to his arrest, as well as a total three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 35. That total offense level, combined with Cano-Bahena\u2019s criminal history score of one and criminal history category of I, resulted in an advisory Guidelines imprisonment range of 168 to 210 months.</p> <p id=\"b783-8\" pgmap=\"783\">Cano-Bahena objected to the PSR\u2019s proposed obstruction-of-justice enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.2. He also objected to the PSR \u201cattribut[ing] the full 1505.39 grams of methamphetamine to him.\u201d Id. at 23. In support, Cano-Bahena argued that it was not him, but rather Godinez-Perez, who was involved in the controlled buys. Cano-Bahena further argued that only 453 grams of methamphetamine were actually connected to him as a result of the searches of his apartment and vehicle. The probation officer responded to this latter objection by noting that Cano-Bahena and \u201cGodinez-Perez were working together to sell methamphetamine\u201d and that \u201c[t]he trafficking of all the methamphetamine involved in this case was (i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, (ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity, and (iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity for\u201d Cano-Bahena. Id. at 26.</p> <p id=\"b783-11\" pgmap=\"783\">On March 22, 2016, Cano-Bahena filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In his motion, Cano-Bahena asserted that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because \u201cnone of the [relevant] documents were fully translated and explained to [him] before he signed the same and entered into his plea.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 90. Cano-Bahena further asserted that he had \u201c[o]riginally ... agreed with the government o[n] a 100 month sentence,\u201d and that under the final agreement \u201chis understanding [was] that his new sentence would be less than that which led to his accepting the same.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b783-12\" pgmap=\"783(55) 784(310)\">On April .13, 2016, the district court held a hearing on Cano-Bahena\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The government presented testimony from James Campbell, who was originally appointed to represent Cano-Bahena and who represented him at the time of his plea agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Campbell testified that Cano-Bahena was originally offered a 100-month Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea offer, but that Cano-Bahe-na rejected that offer on multiple occasions. ROA, Vol. II at 10-11. Campbell further testified that Cano-Bahena, \u201cafter extended discussions, indicated he would just like to enter a plea to [the proposed amended charge] without th[e] (c)(1)(C) constraint.\u201d Id at 12. Campbell indicated that Cano-Bahena did so because the \u201clesser charge\u201d contained in the \u201camended information ..'. would include a penalty-range from five to 40 years, as opposed to the 10 to life that he was looking at under the original conspiracy charge.\u201d Id. Campbell testified that he relayed this information to the prosecutor, who then offered a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea deal of 85 months. According to Campbell, Cano-Bahena \u201cdeclined that offer and wanted to go forward with the open plea.\u201d Id. at 13. Campbell testified that the prosecutor agreed to the open plea and the parties subsequently entered into that agreement. Campbell in turn testified that he and an interpreter met with Cano-Bahena on the morning before he entered his guilty plea and translated the plea agreement and the amended information to Cano-Bahena. According to Campbell, he specifically informed Cano-Bahena that \u201cwhether he was charged with a conspiracy with a sentencing range of 10 to life or he was charged in the ... lesser information, with five to 40, that the attribution could come out identically,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe application of the sentencing guideline might give him exactly the same sentence.\u201d Id. at 18. Campbell testified that, after doing so, he was satisfied that Cano-Bahena entered into the plea knowingly and voluntarily. Lastly, Campbell testified that Cano-Bahena \u201creally trusted the judge and he thought the judge would give him a better number than what [Campbell] and [the prosecutor] had agreed to\u201d in the original Rule 11(c)(1)(C) proposals. Id. at 21.</p> <p id=\"b784-4\" pgmap=\"784\">After hearing Campbell\u2019s testimony, the district court analyzed the factors that we have outlined for determining whether there is a fair and just reason for withdrawal of a plea. Id. at 37. To begin with, the district court noted that Cano-Bahena \u201cacknowledge^] that he [wa]s not claiming actual innocence to the charge that he pled guilty to.\u201d Id. Second, the district court noted \u201c[t]here really [wa]s no suggestion that ... Campbell rendered ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d to Cano-Bahena. Jd. at 38. Third, the district court noted that \u201c[t]he colloquy during the plea hearing itself ... illustrated] that ... Cano[-Bahena] did all of this knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Id. at 40. The district court also found that Cano-Bahena had \u201cclose assistance of counsel\u201d in entering into his plea. Id. at 46. Lastly, the district court stated that it did not place any weight on the factors of whether withdrawal would substantially inconvenience the court or waste judicial resources. Id. Ultimately, the district court concluded that there was no \u201cfair and just reason to allow the withdrawal of this plea\u201d and therefore denied Cano-Bahena\u2019s motion. Id.</p> <p id=\"b784-5\" pgmap=\"784(127) 785(17)\">On September 26, 2016, the district court held a sentencing hearing for Cano-Bahena. Defense counsel noted at the outset that the parties had \u201creached an agreement on the amount of drugs attributable to [Cano-Bahena] as far as relevant conduct,\u201d and that \u201cthe only issue left in [their] objections [wa]s the enhancement for the obstruction charge.\u201d Id. at 52. Defense counsel further explained that the parties agreed \u201cthat ... Cano-Bahena should be responsible for approximately 453 grams of methamphetamine,\u201d which included 436 grams seized from his vehicle and \u201c17 grams that were found at his apartment pursuant to a consensual search.\u201d Id. at 53. This amount, both defense counsel and the prosecution agreed, would result in a base offense level of 32, rather than the base offense level of 36 that was proposed in the PSR. Id. at 54.</p> <p id=\"b785-9\" pgmap=\"785\">As for the obstruction of justice enhancement, the government presented testimony from Benjamin Gatrost, a DHS special agent. Gatrost testified that he was involved in the arrest of Cano-Bahena on July 16,2014. Gatrost explained how Cano-Bahena led officers on a high-speed chase and attempted to elude them prior to his arrest. Based upon Gatrost\u2019s testimony, the district court found that Cano-Bahena knew that he was being followed by law enforcement officers and attempted to evade them by \u201cengaging] in very serious behavior that placed anyone along those residential streets at risk of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. at 76. Consequently, the distinct court overruled Cano-Bahena\u2019s objection to the PSR\u2019s proposed obstruction of justice enhancement.</p> <p id=\"b785-10\" pgmap=\"785\">After applying a base offense level of 32, imposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, and allowing a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, the district court arrived at a total offense level of 31. That total offense level, combined with Cano-Bahena\u2019s criminal history category of I, resulted in an advisory Guidelines sentencing range of 108 to 135 months. The government recommended that Cano-Bahena be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 108 months. The government based its recommendation on the fact that Godinez-Perez received a sentence of 108 months and Menera-AIvarez received a sentence of 100 months. Cano-Bahena\u2019s counsel asked for a below-Guidelines sentence, arguing that Cano-Bahena\u2019s \u201cparticipation in this particular matter was minimal\u201d and \u201che was not as culpable as the other two co-defendants.\u201d Id. at 83.</p> <p id=\"b785-11\" pgmap=\"785\">The district court ultimately imposed a sentence of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a four-year term of supervised release.</p> <p id=\"b785-7\" pgmap=\"785\">Judgment was entered m the case on September 26, 2016. Cano-Bahena now appeals.</p> <p id=\"pAVv\" pgmap=\"785\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b785-4\" pgmap=\"785\">Cano-Bahena raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Second, he argues that the district court erred in finding that he eluded the police and in turn imposing the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. Third, he argues that the 108-month sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable because his sentence is the same as or longer than his codefendants, both of whom had more substantial roles in the offense than he did. As discussed below, we conclude that all three of these issues lack merit.</p> <p id=\"b785-5\" pgmap=\"785\">Denial of motion to withdraw guilty plea</p> <p id=\"b785-6\" pgmap=\"785(168) 786(9)\"> Cano-Bahena argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. \u201cWhether to permit withdrawal \u2018always and ultimately lies within the sound discretion of the district court to determine on a case by case basis when the standard is and isn\u2019t met.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Sanchez-Leon, 764 F.3d 1248, 1259 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Soto, 660 F.3d 1264, 1267 (10th Cir. 2011)). \u201c \u2018Although a motion to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing should be freely allowed, we will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision unless the defendant can show that the court acted unjustly or unfairly.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Hamilton, 510 F.3d 1209, 1213-14 (10th Cir. 2007)). Thus, we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Id. In doing so, we \u201creview [any underlying] legal conclusions de novo, such as whether the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily,\u201d and we \u201creview factual findings for clear error.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b786-4\" pgmap=\"786\">\u201cA defendant may withdraw a guilty plea\u201d after it has been accepted by the district court and \u201cbefore sentencing if he \u2018can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1258 (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B)). A district court\u2019s decision whether to grant a motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be guided by the consideration of the following factors: \u201c\u2018(1) whether the defendant has asserted his innocence, (2) prejudice to the government, (3) delay in filing defendant\u2019s motion, (4) inconvenience to the court, (5) defendant\u2019s assistance of counsel, (6) whether the plea is knowing and voluntary, and (7) waste of judicial resources.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Hamilton, 510 F.3d at 1214). We have also suggested that a district court may consider one additional factor, i.e., the likelihood of conviction Id.</p> <p id=\"b786-5\" pgmap=\"786\">If a defendant \u201cfails to carry his or her burden on asserted innocence, validity of the plea (whether it was given knowingly and voluntarily), and ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d it is unnecessary for a district court to \u201caddress \u2018the remaining factors ... because these [remaining] factors speak to the potential burden on the government and the court, rather than the defendant\u2019s reason for withdrawal.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Hamilton, 510 F.3d at 1217 (emphasis omitted)). In other words, \u201ceven if these [remaining] factors weigh in a defendant\u2019s favor, they cannot establish a fair and just reason for withdrawal.\u201d Hamilton, 510 F.3d at 1217.</p> <p id=\"b786-6\" pgmap=\"786\">Focusing on these three key factors, we note that Cano-Bahena has never claimed that he is actually innocent. Instead, Cano-Bahena\u2019s primary argument is that his plea \u201cwas not knowing and therefore not voluntary.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 7. Although Cano-Bahena concedes \u201cthat the plea agreement he signed and the statements he gave at his plea hearing at first blush indicate he gave a plea that was both knowledgeable and voluntary,\u201d he asserts that \u201cthis \u2018new<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> plea was entered into on the morning of the plea acceptance and none of the documents were fully translated and explained to [him] before he signed the same and entered into his plea.\u201d Id. at 10. Cano-Bahena also argues, for the first time, that his counsel was ineffective during the brief period leading up to the entry of the plea because counsel failed to ensure that Cano-Bahena understood the terms of the plea.</p> <p id=\"b786-8\" pgmap=\"786(218) 787(179)\">We conclude that Cano-Bahena\u2019s arguments are refuted entirely by the record in this case. Cano-Bahena\u2019s counsel at the time of the plea agreement, James Campbell, testified that on the morning of the plea, he was \u201cgiven a copy of an amended information and a waiver of preliminary relative to. that information\u201d and he \u201chad those translated for [Cano-Bahena] and asked if there were any questions or anything he had about those.\u201d ROA, Vol. II at 14-15. Campbell testified that \u201cthere was [then] a very brief plea agreement provided\u201d and he \u201chad that plea agreement translated for [Cano-Bahena] and read to him, and then [they] went through each of the paragraphs of that plea agreement and discussed that before [they] came up to visit with the Court later that day.\u201d Id. at 15. Campbell emphasized that \u201c[a]ll of the documents were completely translated\u201d for Cano-Bahena. Id. at 16. Campbell testified that he was satisfied that Cano-Bahena \u201cwas entering into the plea ... knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Id. at 17. He explained that he and Cano-Bahena \u201chad spent extended time going over this case and additionally going through the United States Sentencing Guidelines and the impacts of those.\u201d Id. Campbell also testified that they \u201chad the added advantage of the co-defendant [Godinez-Perez]\u201d having \u201centered a plea well before\u201d Cano-Bahena,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that this gave them \u201ca pretty good idea of what the attribution potentially was going to be\u201d for Cano-Bahena. Id. Campbell testified that he \u201cspecifically remembered]\u201d explaining to Cano-Bahena that \u201cthe attribution could come out identically\u201d between .the original charges and the charge in the lesser information. Id. at 17-18. \u201cIn other words,\u201d Campbell testified, he explained to Cano-Bahena that \u201cthe application of the sentencing guideline might give him exactly the same sentence.\u201d Id. at 18. According to.Campbell, all of these communications occurred between approximately 8:15 a.m. and 10:34 a.m. on the morning of May 27, 2015, when Cano-Bahena entered his guilty plea. During that time, Campbell testified, he spent approximately thirty minutes going over the plea agreement, the amended information, and the factual basis with Cano-Bahe-na. Campbell explained that he and Cano-Bahena had, prior to that day, \u201cgone over [other] plea agreements,\u201d as well as \u201ca proposed factual basis which wound up being the same for both factual bases.\u201d Id. at 27.</p> <p id=\"b787-5\" pgmap=\"787\">After hearing Campbell\u2019s testimony, the district court \u201cf[ou]nd that ... Campbell ... rendered] effective assistance of counsel to [Cano-Bahena] in all respects.\u201d Id. at 38. In particular, the district court found that Campbell \u201cconveyed all plea negotiations to\u201d Cano-Bahena and in turn \u201cdiscussed [the] plea offers with him.\u201d Id. The district court further found that Campbell and Cano-Bahena discussed \u201cat length sentencing and how that would work and how it would be left up to the judge ultimately.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b787-8\" pgmap=\"787(279) 788(73)\">The district court also emphasized that \u201c[t]here really [wa]s no suggestion\u201d by Cano-Bahena that \u201cCampbell rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. \u201cRather,\u201d the district court stated, \u201cthe assertion I think is more along the lines that [Cano-Bahena\u2019s] decision to enter a plea on May 27th was not a knowing and voluntary decision and was the product of being rushed into making a decision on that day.\u201d Id. at 38-39. The district court rejected that assertion, however, noting \u201cthat for over an hour, probably closer to two hours,\u201d on the morning of May 27, 2015, \u201cCampbell spent time with [Cano-Bahena] discussing the latest plea offer, one that was framed around what [Cano-Bahena] had said he wanted.\u201d Id. at 39. In addition, the district court noted that \u201cit was a very short plea agreement\u201d (one page plus a signature line) that \u201cdid not include a waiver of appellate rights\u201d or \u201ca number of the provisions that the government often negotiates in plea agreements that are to the government\u2019s advantage and not the defendant\u2019s advantage.\u201d Id. The district court found \u201cthat spending an hour-and-a-half or so explaining these documents, having the interpreter read them and\u2014and translate them word-by-word was a sufficient amount of time, particularly in the context of the fact that ... Campbell had been discussing plea offers and plea negotiations with [Cano-Bahena] for sometime over the course of\u2014sometime before May 27th.\u201d Id. at 40. Lastly, the district court found that \u201c[t]he colloquy during the plea hearing itself ... illustrate[d] that [Cano-Bahena] did all of this knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Id. In particular, the district court noted that it had \u201cdiscussed the process [it] would use to determine an appropriate sentence\u201d and emphasized to Cano-Bahena that it \u201cdid not have to take anyone\u2019s recommendations ... about sentencing;\u201d Id. at 44-45. In sum, the district court found \u201cthere was a very full record and a very full discussion with [Cano-Bahena] that convinced [it] then and still convinced] [it] that [Cano-Bahena] entered his plea on a knowing and voluntary basis.\u201d Id. at 45.</p> <p id=\"b788-4\" pgmap=\"788\">Notably, Cano-Bahena makes no serious attempt in this appeal to challenge any of the district court\u2019s factual findings. And, by failing to do so, Cano-Bahena clearly cannot prevail on his claims that his counsel was ineffective or, in. turn, that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary. All of which means that Cano-Bahena has failed to establish that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p> <p id=\"b788-5\" pgmap=\"788\">Obstruction of justice enhancement</p> <p id=\"b788-6\" pgmap=\"788\"> In his second issue on appeal, Cano-Bahena argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 for obstruction of justice. We review challenges to the procedural reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Singer, 825 F.3d 1151, 1156 (10th Cir. 2016). In doing so, we also review for clear error any factual findings made by a district court that allegedly supported its application of a challenged enhancement. United States v. Simpson, 845 F.3d 1039, 1063 (10th Cir. 2017).</p> <p id=\"b788-7\" pgmap=\"788\">Section 3C1.2, entitled \u201cReckless Endangerment During Flight,\u201d states: \u201cIf the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2.</p> <p id=\"b788-8\" pgmap=\"788\">Cano-Bahena argues that \u00a7 3C1.2 must be construed to require \u201cthat a defendant ... know that the person pursuing him is a law enforcement officer.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 17. He in turn argues that \u201c[t]he evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing\u201d failed to establish that he was aware he was being followed by law enforcement officers or that he knowingly attempted to elude them. Id. at 16. Cano-Bahena concedes that he \u201cdrove thr[ough] a residential neighborhood in Kansas City, Kansas at a high rate of speed and rolling stop signs etc.\u201d with \u201cmethamphetamine in his vehicle.\u201d Id Cano-Bahena further concedes \u201cthat he was being followed by [law enforcement] agents in an unmarked vehicle and at some point a Kansas City Kansas patrol car\u201d that \u201cmade a u-turn and followed [him].\u201d Id. But he argues that the unmarked vehicle \u201chad no emergency lights or sirens to signify that it was law enforcement.\u201d Id. He further argues that the marked patrol car \u201cwas further back and at no time activated its emergency lights or sirens.\u201d Id at 16-17. And, he argues, \u201cthere was no evidence [the marked patrol car] was ever in [his] field of vision\u201d as he was driving. Id. at 16. Lastly, Cano-Bahena notes that \u201cat the end of his drive [he] parked his vehicle and went into an outdoor restaurant and ordered a beer.\u201d Id. at 17. It was there, Cano-Bahena notes, where law enforcement officers arrested him without incident.</p> <p id=\"b788-9\" pgmap=\"788(59) 789(152)\">Cano-Bahena fails, however, to mention evidence that was key to the district court\u2019s determination. At the sentencing hearing, the government presented testimony from Benjamin Gatrost, a special agent employed by DHS. Gatrost testified that he and another DHS agent, Joseph Stewart, surveilled Cano-Bahena for several hours using an unmarked vehicle. During that time period, Gatrost testified, Cano-Bahena \u201cfollow[ed] routine traffic patterns and speeds.\u201d ROA, Vol. II at 61. Gatrost testified that at some point the decision was made to stop Cano-Bahena \u201cbased on a traffic infraction that had been viewed.\u201d Id. at 57. Because the DHS agents lacked authority to conduct a traffic stop, the Kansas City, Kansas police department was contacted to assist with the stop. Gatrost testified he observed Cano-Bahena\u2019s vehicle traveling northbound on Central Avenue and that a marked Kansas City, Kansas police car passed by Cano-Bahena\u2019s vehicle headed southbound on Central Avenue, and then made a u-tum in order to follow and stop Cano-Bahena. Gatrost further testified that before the marked police car could completely turn around, Cano-Bahena\u2019s vehicle began driving recklessly and at a high rate of speed. According to Gatrost, his partner responded by stating \u201cover the radio, \u2018It looks like he\u2019s running.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 59.</p> <p id=\"b789-5\" pgmap=\"789\">The district court in turn made the following factual findings based upon Gat-rost\u2019s testimony:</p> <blockquote id=\"b789-6\" pgmap=\"789\">And the circumstantial evidence here is that for about two hours [Cano-Bahena] was under surveillance and was engaging in rather normal driving with some minor infractions, such as failing to maintain a lane, failing to use a turn signal. But that behavior changed dramatically right at the point that a Kansas City, Kansas police car did a U-turn in an intersection and attempted to follow him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b789-7\" pgmap=\"789\">So the behavior comparing is two hours of rather normal driving with minor traffic infractions versus a matter of a few minutes of much different driving behavior in a residential neighborhood, exceeding speeds of 60 miles an hour, running multiple stop signs. * * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Aup\" pgmap=\"789\">And I think it\u2019s notable that this dramatic behavior started at the time the Kansas City, Kansas police car did a U-turn. And obviously, you know, again, what [Cano-Bahena] saw at that point can only be proven by circumstantial evidence, not by direct evidence. But it\u2019s reasonable that that was what prompted his behavior change.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b789-9\" pgmap=\"789\">And when I consider that in conjunction with when the behavior stopped, when did he decide to stop the car? Well, it was at the point when the\u2014 Special Agent Gatrosts\u2019s [sic] vehicle had lost sight of him. That indicates to me that [Cano-Bahena] was aware that this other vehicle was following him, had been aware that the marked vehicle was attempting to follow him. And the fact that he didn\u2019t continue to go and drive fast and continue to engage in lots of turns and running through stop signs after Special Agent Gatrost\u2019s car was no longer in view I think is as significant as the fact that he began that behavior at the time the marked police car did a U-turn in the middle of an intersection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b789-10\" pgmap=\"789\">So I think by a preponderance of the evidence, the government has established circumstantial evidence of [Cano-Bahena\u2019s] knowledge that he was being followed by law .enforcement. And in the course of fleeing from law enforcement and attempting to evade law enforcement, he did engage in very serious behavior that placed anyone along those residential streets at risk of death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote> <p id=\"b789-11\" pgmap=\"789\">Id. at 74-76.</p> <p id=\"b789-12\" pgmap=\"789(62) 790(31)\">Cano-Bahena makes no attempt to challenge the district court\u2019s finding that his reckless driving was prompted by him observing the marked police vehicle pass him and immediately make a u-turn in order to follow him. And, in any event, the district court\u2019s finding is amply supported by Gat-rost\u2019s undisputed testimony. Thus, in sum, the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement were not clearly erroneous and, accordingly, we conclude it did not abuse its discretion in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.2.</p> <p id=\"b790-4\" pgmap=\"790\">Substantive reasonableness challenge to sentence</p> <p id=\"b790-5\" pgmap=\"790\"> In his third and final issue on appeal, Cano-Bahena argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of 108 months because the \u201csentence was as great or greater than his codefendants whose roles in the crime w[ere] greater than\u201d his. Aplt. Br. at 19. More specifically, Cano-Bahena argues that his sentence is \u201cin contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a)(6) which states that [\u2018] The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 20.</p> <p id=\"b790-6\" pgmap=\"790\">\u201c \u2018Substantive reasonableness involves whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u2019 \u201d United States v. Craig, 808 F.3d 1249, 1261 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Conlan, 500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir. 2007)). \u201c[W]e review a sentence for substantive reasonableness \u2018under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d Id (quoting United States v.

(quoting Alapizco-Valenzuela, 546 F.3d at 1215). Further, \u201cwe will find an abuse of discretion only if the district court was arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable when it weighed the permissible \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b790-13\" pgmap=\"790\">Section 3553(a) requires a district court to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These purposes include \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d; \u201c(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d; \u201c(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d; and \u201c(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). \u201c[I]n determining the particular sentence to be imposed,\u201d a district court \u201cshall consider\u201d a number of factors, including, as relevant here, \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p> <p id=\"b790-14\" pgmap=\"790(79) 791(52)\">In this case, Cano-Bahena\u2019s counsel argued at the time of sentencing that the district court should vary downward from \u201cthe low end of the guideline range\u201d because of what he characterized as Cano-Bahena\u2019s \u201cminimal\u201d participation in the offense compared to that of his two codefen-dants. ROA, Vol. II at 82-83. In support, Cano-Bahena\u2019s counsel argued that code-fendant Godinez-Perez was the main focus of the government\u2019s investigation and received a 108-month sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cano-Bahe-na\u2019s counsel also noted that codefendant Menera-Alvarez \u201cwas a supplier\u201d and received a 100-month sentence. Id. at 83. Lastly, Cano-Bahena\u2019s counsel argued that Cano-Bahena \u201cdidn\u2019t really understand what the scope of this conspiracy was\u201d and was simply \u201ca courier on this one afternoon,\u201d i.e., the afternoon of his arrest. Id.</p> <p id=\"b791-5\" pgmap=\"791\">The district court largely rejected these arguments. In particular, the district court rejected the argument that Cano-Bahena\u2019s \u201csentence should be less than\u201d his two codefendants. Id. at 86. The district court explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b791-6\" pgmap=\"791\">[I]t\u2019s clear to me that this wasn\u2019t just a one-time occasion when [Cano-Bahena] was in possession of a pound of methamphetamine to deliver. First of all, it\u2019s highly unlikely that someone that had no involvement otherwise or no knowledge as to what was going on would be entrusted their very first time with a pound of methamphetamine to deliver.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b791-7\" pgmap=\"791\">But more importantly, [Cano-Bahena] was driving [Godinez-Perez\u2019s] Trailblazer which had been under surveillance in other transactions, that car had been used. Not that it was [Cano-Bahena] driving it, but that car was being used for other drug transactions. And there were 454 grams of methamphetamine found in the vehicle on that day that [Cano-Bahena] was driving it, along with three cell phones, which is some indication of involvement with others in drug trafficking. Also, the apartment where [Cano-Bahena] lived, there were 17 grams of methamphetamine, six more cellular phones, and digital scales and drug paraphernalia, which is indicative of a longer involvement than just a onetime incident on that day.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b791-8\" pgmap=\"791\">Also, one of the $100 bills that was used as buy money was found in [Cano-Bahena\u2019s] possession. And while the pre-sentence report doesn\u2019t say how much, [Cano-Bahena] was found to be in possession of a large amount of U.S. currency when he was being booked. So all of this points to, in my mind, [Cano-Bahe-na\u2019s] culpability being average, just as [Godinez-Perez\u2019s] was. And an equivalent sentence, I think, all things considered, is fair.</blockquote> <p id=\"b791-11\" pgmap=\"791\">Id. at 86-87.</p> <p id=\"b791-12\" pgmap=\"791\">Cano-Bahena does not seriously dispute the district court\u2019s findings on this point and, in any event, we conclude that the record on appeal amply supports the district court\u2019s findings, including the reasonable inferences that it drew from the circumstantial evidence. In particular, we conclude that Cano-Bahena\u2019s possession of a pound of methamphetamine reasonably permitted the district court to infer that Cano-Bahena\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy extended beyond simply performing a one-time delivery. Consequently, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Cano-Bahena to a term of imprisonment of 108 months, and we reject Cano-Bahena\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p> <p id=\"b791-13\" pgmap=\"791\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b791-14\" pgmap=\"791\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b782-11\" pgmap=\"782\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

At best, Cano-Bahena asserted in his motion to withdraw that his \"prior counsel ... may have not relayed all information to [Cano-Bahena] that was needed to effectuate a plea that was knowing and voluntary.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 91. He failed, however, to support that allegation with any evidence.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"5\"> <p id=\"b790-11\" pgmap=\"790(66) 791(26)\">. Approximately three months after Cano-Bahena was sentenced, we concluded that the district court erred in calculating the amount of methamphetamine that was attributable to Godinez-Perez and, consequently, we remanded his case to the district court with directions to vacate his sentence and resen-tence him. United States v. Godinez-Perez, 864 F.3d 1060, 1071 (10th Cir. 2016). On remand, the district court resentenced Godi-nez-Perez to a term of imprisonment of 87 months. These circumstances do not alter our analysis of Cano-Bahena\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
