Matheson, Jr. Circuit Judge</author> <p id=\"b777-6\" pgmap=\"777\">Richard Ballard appeals an order requiring payment of restitution to victims of his wire fraud offense. Exercising jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291, we hold that his plea agreement contains an enforceable waiver of appellate rights. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b777-7\" pgmap=\"777\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b777-8\" pgmap=\"777\">Mr. Ballard pled guilty to committing wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 by diverting investor funds to his personal use. In his plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal his sentence, including any order of restitution imposed by the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced him to 27 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution of $415,477.11 to 11 victims who had submitted victim impact statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite his appeal waiver, Mr. Ballard filed this appeal challenging his restitution order as excessive. He argues the district court erred by including in the restitution calculation (1) losses suffered by three individuals he claims were not victims of the offense, and (2) salary payments to his son he claims were not losses.</p> <p id=\"b777-13\" pgmap=\"777\">II. DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"AOK\" pgmap=\"777\">A. Jurisdiction</p> <p id=\"b777-14\" pgmap=\"777\">The Government argues we lack subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal due to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), which provides that a defendant may appeal an otherwise final sentence if the sentence: (1) \u201cwas imposed in violation of law,\u201d (2) \u201cwas imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines,\u201d (3) is greater than the term of imprisonment under the applicable guidelines range, or (4) \u201cwas imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). But we need not rely on \u00a7 3742(a) to establish jurisdiction here. The district court\u2019s entry of a sentence constitutes a final order, thereby establishing subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. United States v. Hahn, 359 F.3d 1315, 1320 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (providing that courts of appeals have subject matter jurisdiction over final orders of district courts).</p> <p id=\"b777-15\" pgmap=\"777(31) 778(51)\"> The Government also suggests we lack jurisdiction due to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(c), which limits when a defendant who entered a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that included a \u201cspecific sentence\u201d may appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the plea agreement here only included \u201crestitution as determined by the court\u201d rather than a specific amount of restitution. ROA, Vbl. 1 at 28. Section 3742(c) is thus inapplicable. In any event, as explained above, we derive our jurisdiction from \u00a7 1291. See Hahn, 359 F.3d at 1320.</p> <p id=\"b778-4\" pgmap=\"778\">B. Appellate Waiver</p> <p id=\"b778-5\" pgmap=\"778\">The primary question is whether to enforce Mr. Ballard\u2019s appeal waiver and dismiss his challenge to the restitution order. In this section, we provide legal background on the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) and this court\u2019s Hahn framework for determining when to enforce appellate waivers. We then apply Hahn and conclude that Mr. Ballard\u2019s waiver bars this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b778-6\" pgmap=\"778\">1. Legal Background</p> <p id=\"b778-7\" pgmap=\"778\">a. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act</p> <p id=\"b778-8\" pgmap=\"778\">Federal courts lack inherent authority to order restitution and may do so only when authorized by statute, such as the MVRA. United States v. Gordon, 480 F.3d 1205, 1210 (10th Cir. 2007). The MVRA requires courts to order restitution if the offense of conviction \u201cinvolves as an element a scheme, conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Wire fraud includes as an element a scheme to defraud. United States v. Daniel, 749 F.3d 608, 613 (7th Cir. 2014); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p> <p id=\"b778-9\" pgmap=\"778\">The maximum amount of restitution permitted under the MVRA is \u201cthe full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A); see also Gordon, 480 F.3d at 1211 (providing that the MVRA authorizes restitution to cover victims\u2019 \u201closs[es] resulting from the count to which [the defendant] pled guilty\u201d) (citing Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 420, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990)); United States v. James, 564 F.3d 1237, 1246 (10th Cir. 2009) (stating that courts determine restitution based on victims\u2019 \u201cactual loss\u201d). \u201cRestitution must not unjustly enrich crime victims or provide them a windfall.\u201d United States v. Ferdman, 779 F.3d 1129, 1132 (10th Cir. 2015).</p> <p id=\"b778-13\" pgmap=\"778\">In calculating loss under the MVRA, the court is not required to use absolute precision. United States v. Gallant, 537 F.3d 1202, 1252 (10th Cir. 2008). \u201cA sentencing court may resolve restitution uncertainties with a view towards achieving fairness to the victim, so long as it still makes a reasonable determination of appropriate restitution rooted in a calculation of actual loss.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted). Although the statute permits some imprecision, a restitution order that exceeds the maximum amount\u2014i.e., the victims\u2019 actual loss\u2014is unlawful under the MVRA. See Gordon, 480 F.3d at 1210.</p> <p id=\"b778-14\" pgmap=\"778\">.b. Hahn\u2019s three-part framework</p> <p id=\"b778-15\" pgmap=\"778(87) 779(14)\">Under Hahn, we will enforce an appeal waiver if (1) \u201cthe disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights,\u201d (2) \u201cthe defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights,\u201d and (3) \u201cenforcing the waiver would [not] result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d 359 F.3d at 1325. One of the situations we identified as a miscarriage of justice is \u201cwhere the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum.\u201d Id. at 1327 (quotations omitted). Enforcing an unlawful restitution order \u201cconstitute^] a miscarriage of justice because [the order] is beyond the remedy authorized by the statute.\u201d Gordon, 480 F.3d at 1212.,</p> <p id=\"b779-5\" pgmap=\"779\">2. Analysis</p> <p id=\"b779-6\" pgmap=\"779\">Mr. Ballard does not dispute that he waived his appellate rights knowingly and voluntarily; the only questions here relate to (a) the scope of the waiver and (b) whether enforcement would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p id=\"b779-7\" pgmap=\"779\">a. Scope of the waiver</p> <p id=\"b779-8\" pgmap=\"779\"> Mr. Ballard\u2019s challenge to the restitution award falls within the scope of his appeal waiver. In paragraph 11 of the plea agreement, Mr. Ballard \u201cwaive[d] any right to appeal ... the components of the sentence to be imposed herein....\u201d ROA, Vol. 1 at 32. In paragraph 3, the components of the proposed sentence included \u201crestitution as determined by the court.\u201d Id. at'28. The plea agreement also stated that \u201cthe defendant waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case, except to the extent, if any, the Court imposes a sentence in excess of the sentence recommended by the parties under Rule 11(c)(1)(C).\u201d Id. at 32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the parties did not recommend a specific restitution order amount, so this exception does not apply. Because restitution, \u201cas determined by the [district] court,\u201d was a component of the sentence, Mr. Ballard\u2019s appeal is within the scope of his waiver. Id. at 28.</p> <p id=\"b779-9\" pgmap=\"779\">b. Miscarriage of Justice</p> <p id=\"b779-10\" pgmap=\"779\"> Mr. Ballard contends that the restitution order exceeds the MVRA\u2019s statutory maximum because it requires payments to individuals who were not victims and includes amounts of money that were not losses under the MVRA. The restitution order, he concludes, is thus unlawful and unenforceable. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b779-14\" pgmap=\"779\">The district court\u2019s restitution order does not exceed the victims\u2019 actual loss and thus does not exceed the MVRA\u2019s statutory maximum. The court imposed a restitution award of $415,477.11\u2014the amount of investors\u2019 money the FBI determined Mr. Ballard embezzled for personal use. But the record supports that the victims\u2019 actual loss\u2014the proper basis of a restitution calculation\u2014is actually much higher. Mr. Ballard\u2019s top two investors invested a total of $500,000 into his companies, which \u201cbecause of [Mr. Ballard\u2019s] fraud ... were basically worth nothing to the investors\u201d in the end. ROA, Vol. 2 at 93. Even without taking into account the losses of the additional nine victims receiving restitution, the losses attributable to these two investors alone provide ample support for the restitution order. Nor does the restitution result in a windfall for the victims, as the amount each was awarded is still significantly less than what the U.S. Probation Office determined they were due\u2014a fact Mr. Ballard does not contest.</p> <p id=\"b779-15\" pgmap=\"779(75) 780(63)\">Mr. Ballard contends that losses attributed to three individuals should have been subtracted from the award because they were not victims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although these individuals were never slated to receive restitution, their losses were included in the total amount of restitution to be divided among the 11 victims who submitted victim impact statements. Mr. Ballard has a point. If someone is not a victim deserving restitution under the MVRA, then the restitution award\u2014which must reflect the actual loss suffered by the victims\u2022\u2014should not include losses attributable to that person. But any such error here is harmless because, as explained above, ample record evidence supports the restitution award even without these contested amounts, and thus there is no need to remand. See United States v. Seignious, 757 F.3d 155, 164 (4th Cir. 2014).</p> <p id=\"b780-4\" pgmap=\"780\">The same point applies to Mr. Ballard\u2019s argument that the restitution award erroneously includes salary payments to his son, which he contends were legitimate business expenses. Again, restitution is calculated based on the victims\u2019 actual loss. Even if the payments to his son were legitimate, the total amount of the investors\u2019 losses caused by his fraud far exceeded the actual restitution award of $415,477.11.</p> <p id=\"b780-5\" pgmap=\"780\">Finally, Mr. Ballard argues that our decisions in Gordon<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and United States v. Hudson, 483 F.3d 707 (10th Cir. 2007),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> permit him to appeal the legality of the restitution order. To the extent he argues his appellate waiver does not preclude us from engaging in the Hahn analysis above, he is correct. Under Hahn, we have jurisdiction over this appeal and a framework for deciding whether an appellate waiver applies. 359 F.3d at 1320, 1325. We have determined that Mr. Ballard has failed to demonstrate that any of the three Hahn factors preclude enforcement of the appellate waiver.</p> <p id=\"b780-8\" pgmap=\"780\">To the extent Mr. Ballard contends Gordon and Hudson allow him to circumvent our en banc decision in Hahn, we disagree. Taken together, these two cases support the proposition that we cannot enforce an appeal waiver when the sentence includes an unlawful restitution order\u2014essentially a reiteration of Hahn\u2019s third prong, which provides that a \u201csentence [that] exceeds the statutory maximum,\u201d such as an unlawful restitution order, would be a miscarriage of justice. Id. at 1327. Mr. Ballard\u2019s restitution order, however, was not unlawful, and thus these cases are inapt.</p> <p id=\"b780-9\" pgmap=\"780\">\u215c $ \u215d \u215c</p> <p id=\"b780-10\" pgmap=\"780(75) 781(44)\">In sum, Mr. Ballard signed a plea agreement waiving his right to appeal any component of his sentence, including restitution. He appealed the restitution order, challenging its legality. Applying Hahn\u2019s framework, we conclude that Mr. Ballard failed to demonstrate any of the three circumstances that would preclude application of the appellate waiver. First, his appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. Second, he does not contest that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. Third, the restitution order is within the MVRA\u2019s statutory maximum so enforcing the appellate waiver, regardless of whether the district court committed any errors in calculating the award, would not result in a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p id=\"b781-5\" pgmap=\"781\">Accordingly, we hold Mr. Ballard\u2019s waiver of appellate rights enforceable and dismiss this appeal.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b777-9\" pgmap=\"777\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b777-10\" pgmap=\"777\">.

According to the FBI\u2019s forensic report, the restitution award included losses of $18,500, $6,600, and $8,000 attributable to three individuals\u2014two of whom the Government conceded were not victims.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"6\"> <p id=\"b780-6\" pgmap=\"780\">. In Gordon, we held that the defendant\u2019s appellate waiver preserved her right to appeal an unlawful restitution order. 480 F.3d at 1208-09. The restitution order in question was unlawful because it included losses not associated with the sole count of conviction and thus exceeded the MVRA. Id. at 1207. Applying Hahn, we declined to enforce the appellate waiver because an appeal of an unlawful restitution order \u201c[wa]s beyond the scope of the waiver,\u201d id. at 1210, and enforcing an unlawful restitution order would \"constitute a miscarriage of justice,\u201d id. at 1212 (citing Hahn, 359 F.3d at 1327).

Id. at 711. Enforcing an unlawful restitution order constitutes a miscarriage of justice under Hahn, and we declined to do so. Id. Again, the restitution order here is not unlawful,</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
