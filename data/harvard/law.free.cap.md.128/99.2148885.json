On that day the counsel for the respective parties appeared and the plaintiffs offered four, and the defendants nine, prayers. Three of the defendant\u2019s prayers in effect asked that the case be withdrawn from the consideration of the Court, sitting as a jury, because of the want of legally sufficient evidence to entitle the plaintiffs to recover, and it was suggested by counsel for the plaintiffs that \u201cas the prayers made it necessary in arguing them to argue all the facts of the case, argument on prayers and facts be made jointly, and, the Court consenting, it was so agreed, without any reference to said Avritten agreement by anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The case was then fully argued by all the counsel in the case on the facts as Avell as upon the prayers offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the argument * * * the Court asked if there was. any exception to the testimony, to which question counsel for both sides replied 'Kb.\u2019 Thereupon the Court asked counsel for the plaintiffs to supply the Court with the references to- the testimony in the record as to the west side of Lange\u2019s lane,\u201d and the case was then submitted to the Court by both plaintiffs and defendant for final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Thereafter on June 8th, 1915, counsel for the plaintiffs wrote to Judge McLane saying: \u201cIn compliance with the request of the Court, we enclose a copy of sor much of the testimony in the case of <em>Easter </em>v. <em>Overlea Land Company </em>as relates to the width, etc., of Lange\u2019s lane with special reference to the west side and we have sent a copy to counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u201cAre we right in assuming that the Court will give us notice of its intention to pass upon the prayers and to decide the case, in order that we may taire such action as may appear to us to be proper ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">On the 12th of June, 1915, without notice to the plaintiffs or their counsel, the Court delivered to the Clerk of the Court \u201cthe prayers, granted and refused, and a paper on which was written, \u2018Verdict for the defendant,\u2019 signed by Judges Dun-caw and McLahe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">To the action of the Court in passing upon the prayers, and at the same time rendering a verdict for the defendant upon the facts of the case, \u201cin the absence of and without notice to the plaintiffs or their counsel, thereby depriving the plaintiffs of the opportunity to suffer a judgment of <em>non pros\u2019\u2019 </em>the plaintiffs excepted. This as we have said is the only exception before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">It is upon the Act of 1914, Chapter 432\u2014section 173 of Article 75 of Bagby\u2019s-Code\u2014that the question here presented is to be determined. This statute provides that \u201cIn all trials of actions at law in the Courts of this State, it shall not be necessary to* call the plaintiff before the verdict is rendered; nor shall the plaintiff be entitled to dismiss his suit or submit to a voluntary judgment of <em>non pros </em>after argument upon the facts has begun in cases tried before a jury or before the Court-sitting as a jury; but the plaintiff shall have the same right to dismiss such case or submit to a voluntary judgment of <em>non pros </em>.thereon, up to the time when such argument on the facts has begun, as before the enactment of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Prior to the passage of this Act it was the established practice in the trial of jury cases to call the plaintiff when the jury had agreed upon its verdict, and before the verdict was taken. This was done to give him an opportunity to determine whether he would take ao <em>non suit </em>or hear the verdict, and it was at such time that he was required to make his election. If he failed to answer in person or by counsel, the verdict was not taken, the jury was discharged, and a judgment of <em>non suit </em>entered against him; hut if he answered and the verdict was taken, his right tO' suffer a <em>non suit </em>ceased with such answer and verdict; and it was held by this Court in <em>Hall </em>v. Schuchardt, 34 Md. 19, that \u201cThe submission of a cause to the Court for trial where the Judge acts both as Court and jury does not deprive tbe plaintiff of Ms right to a <em>non suit, </em>and care should be taken to so conduct the trial as to afford him the same opportunity of exercising it as if a jury were sworn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The practice has been materially changed by tbe aforegoing statute. The plaintiff is no longer called, and his right to submit to a voluntary judgment of <em>non pros </em>must now he exercised before the argument upon the facts is begun. The statute expressly states that the plaintiff shall not \u201cbe entitled to dismiss his suit or submit it to a voluntary judgment of <em>non pros </em>\u201cafter argument upon the facts has begun in a case tried before a jury or before the Court sitting as a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">It was agreed in writing by the counsel of the respective parties that certain testimony taken in a designated chancery proceeding between said parties should constitute the whole evidence in the case before it, and that upon such evidence the case should be \u201ctried and argued before the Court, sitting as Judge and jury,\u201d and that on the day of the argument the counsel for their respective clients should he permitted to offer prayers or instructions, and with the Court\u2019s permiso sion the \u201cargument on said prayers or instructions, and on the facts as gathered from said evidence, should he made j ointly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Pursuant to this agreement the Court named a day for the argument, and on that day it was asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to hear argument not only upon the prayers, but also' upon the facts of the case. The Court consented thereto, and the argument was made upon both the prayers and facts of the case, and at its conclusion, the case was submitted to the Court by both plaintiffs and defendant for final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">If the plaintiffs had wished to reserve their right to submit to a judgment of <em>non </em>pros, until the Court had ruled upon the prayers, they should not have ai\u2019gued the case upon the facts when they did, for by so doing such right was lost to them under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The plaintiffs, as disclosed by the exception, never asked for an opportunity to suffer a <em>non suit </em>in the event that the rulings of the 'Court upon the prayers were against them, but it was at their express request that the Court heard argument both upon the prayers and the facts of the case, and they should not now be heard to complain of the Court\u2019s refusal to allow them to submit to a judgment of <em>non </em>pros., when the loss of such right was the result of their own voluntary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The letter of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to Judge McLaiug, written on June 8th, after the case had been argued upon the facts, and after it had been submitted to the Court for its final determination had no effect upon the question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The judgment of the Court will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs to the appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
