He further testified, that it was not the intention of the owners to put in a heating plant, under the original contract, but the building was to he heated by stoves and chimneys were put in by the contractor for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The undisputed testimony upon the part of the defendants, is to the effect that the heating plant, was not determined upon, until two months after the completion of the building, and then, the owners, decided they could get a better class of tenants by putting in a heating plant instead of the stoves then in the building. It was never intended to be a part of the original improvement to the building and was not included, in that contract. The building had been completed, the stoves put in, and the apartments partly occupied by tenants, when the contract for the heating plant, was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">It is, therefore, difficult to see upon what theory, it can he held, that the plaintiffs can enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien, under section 2 of Article 63 of the Code, when the building had been finished and completed two months prior to the contract for the installation of the boating plant, under which the lien claim is sought to be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Hor is it satisfactorily shown from the proof, that a lien can he sustained, under section 1 of Article 63 of the Code. It is not alleged by the bill, nor is it stated in the lien claim that the repairs or improvement to the- building was to the extent of one-fourth of its value. The answer avers that the heating plant was not one-fourth of the value of the finished building. The proof shows that, it was an old building repaired, remodeled and improved to the extent of $5,000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The contract price for the heating plant was $1,182.00, but it does not appear that the improvement made by the installing of the heating plant was more or to the extent, of onefoui\u2019th of the value of the building, in which it was placed, so as to bring the claim within the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Culbreth, </em>86 Md. 656, it was said, that the plaintiff was not entitled to a lien under section 1 of Article 63 of the Code, because the proof shows that the repairs or improvements upon the hotel (the same being the repair of the steam-heating apparatus erected in the hotel) did not amount to one-fourth of its entire value. It was further held in that case that a steam-heating apparatus consisting of a boiler and furnace built in the cellar of a hotel with pipes and radiators, is not a machine within section 22 of Article 63 of the Code, which provides that every machine shall be subject to a mechanics\u2019 lien in like manner as buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The case of <em>Schaper </em>v. <em>Bibb, </em>71 Md. 144, relied upon by the appellee, is unlike this. In <em>Bibb\u2019s case, </em>the contract was an entire and continuous one, and the ranges and fire-place heaters, with their attachments were put and fitted in the houses, while in course of erection and construction and the Court held, that they were materials furnished for or about the finish of the house. According to the intention of the parties, they were permanent fixtures and as part and parcel of the finish of the house, and the lien was allowed. And to the same effect, is the case of <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Weatherby, </em>34 Md. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the Court below, committed an error in allowing the lien claim in this case, and its decree must be reversed. As there can be no recovery under the mechanics\u2019 law, the bill will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed, and bill dismissed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
