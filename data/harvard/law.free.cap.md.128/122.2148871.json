Frick, a. policeman for the Baltimore and Ohio Eailroad was indicted for the murder in the City of Baltimore of Evers Chaney, a white youth. Tie plead not guilty, and elected to be tried before tbe Court iu preference to a jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter, and sentence was duly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Fourteen hills of exception were reserved in the course of the trial, all upon questions of the admissibility of evidence. At the hearing of this appeal all the exceptions, were abandoned by the appellant except the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th and 9th.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The State insists, that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 14th exceptions, were not in such form as properly to be considered, for the reason that in each of these exceptions a number of questions have been included in a single exception. This method of taking exceptions has been frequently condemned by this Court. <em>Ellicott </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>6 Md. 517; <em>Tall </em>v. <em>Steam Packet Co., </em>90 Md. 250; <em>Acker M. &amp; C. Co. </em>v. <em>McGaw, </em>106 Md. 560; and in <em>Junkins </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>110 Md. 539<em>; B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rueter, </em>114 Md. 700; <em>Cit. Mut. F. I. Co. </em>v. <em>Conowingo Br. Co., </em>116 Md. 439 and <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Hipsley, </em>122 Md. 435, and <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>State, </em>126 Md. 223. This Court, refused to consider exceptions which contained this vice. In most of these cases under one excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tion was sought to be included essentially distinct propositions, and thus differed from the exceptions criticized by the State in this case. Without the slightest disposition to* relax in any degree this salutary rule, but because in part of the slight difference in which it comes before the Court in this record, and in part because of the seriousness of the case, and in part because the precise question now presented has not been adjudicated by this Court, it seems better to deal directly with the question which the appellant now raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Each of the exceptions upon which there is any contention present one and practically the same point, namely, the admissibility of threats made by the defendant at various- times before he shot the deceased. A witness- 'Davis testified that on the day before the shooting the accused had said in a bar-room not far distant from where -the homicide- took place, that \u201che was going to kill some of them G\u2014d d\u2014n niggers,\u201d and two days earlier had heard the accused make use of the same expression. Another witness for the State, Mrs. Laig, testified that two weeks before Chaney was shot she heard the accused say: \u201cHe don\u2019t get justice at the Station Houses when he brought anybody up there; that the next one he caught on -the car, he was going to shoot and take them either crippled or their bodies to the Station House as evidence.\u201d Charles W. Laig, a State\u2019s witness-, and the husband of the preceding witness, testified to having the same conversation with the accused to which his wife had testified, and gave substantially the same expression as having been uttered by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Miss Kellie Gibney, a State\u2019s witness, without fixing the date, testified to having heard the conversation in Mrs. Laig\u2019s house, and gave as the language of the accused substantially the same expression as that testified to by Mr. and Mrs. Laig; it was to the admissibility of these threats that the exceptions reserved by the appellant, and now insisted on, apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The rule governing the admissibility of such evidence is stated in 21 <em>Cyc. </em>922, as follows: \u201cA threat to kill or injure some one not definitely designated is admissible in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>where oilier facts, adduced give individuation to it: hut general threats not shown to have reference to the deceased can not he proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">For this statement the following cases are cited: <em>Redd </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Ala. 492; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>111 Mo. 136; <em>Melton </em>v. <em>State </em>(Texas Crim. Apps.), 83 S. W. 822. The author of the article in <em>Cyc. </em>then continues, \u201cSo also words uttered under such circumstances as <em>prima facie </em>to import a threat are admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In this. ease, the threat, was a general one; it was not. directed against a particular individual, nor unless the use of the term \u201cniggers\u201d can he so construed, was. it. a threat against a class; and even if regarded as a threat against a class, it was not a class to which the defendant belonged. It must, therefore; he regarded in the light merely of a general threat, without any individualization.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The cases, in this country are not entirely harmonious as to the proper rule'to he applied in such cases. The Courts of Texas, Missouri and Alabama have in a number of instances. held such general threats to be inadmissible; but hold them as admissible if directed against an individual or a class. In the case of <em>Redd </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, while the threats attempted to be offered in evidence were excluded by the Court, because too general, the Court, nevertheless, uses this language: \u201cThe force of the threat may affect its weight as evidence, while not rendering it inadmissible. Whatever may be its force, whether absolute or conditional, whether it indicates a purpose only contemplated or fully matured, it is admissible in evidence because indicating the state of mind of the accused and of tho feelings he entertained or cherished towards the deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In the <em>State </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>before cited, it appeared that the accused and the deceased had been on friendly terms up until the day of the homicide, and it was held error to have admitted general threats made by the defendant a considerable period before that time. A large number1 of cases, upon this rubject are collected in an extended note in <em>Wilson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Florida, </em>17 L. R. A. 651, and among the cases there cited' is the case of the <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkins, </em>47 Pac. 945; in that case it appeared that: \u201cThree hours before the homicide the defendant said to a third party, <em>\u2018I </em>would like to take you with me, but I have a. dirty piece of business to do tonight.\u2019 An hour after saying- this the defendant went to the house of the deceased.\u201d We think that this evidence was admissible. Being connected as it was with the declaration and acts of the accused at the house of the deceased so soon afterwards it tended to show animus on the part of the accused towards the deceased, and further the declaration of the accused tended to show an abandoned, reckless and malicious spirit on the part of the accused. This conclusion is supported by <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>State, </em>79 Ala. 9; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>State, </em>79 Ala. 5; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>State, </em>79 Ala. 29; <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>State, </em>13 Fla. 636; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>79 Mo. 113; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hymer, </em>15 Nev. 49; <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Wis. 423. Vague threats, not against, any particular person have often been admitted and are competent evidence. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Barbot, </em>18 Howell\u2019s State Trials, 1251; <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Wis. 423.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In line with this case are the following cases: <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>47 Conn. 539. In which the language used by the accused was: \u201cI don\u2019t know but I shall be in Canada in a little less than a week; don\u2019t know but I shall kill some one in a week.\u201d This was used in a conversation relating to the defendant\u2019s father. The-testimony was admissible. It rises to the character of a threat, which from the conversation about the father and his estate the jury would have had the right to construe as aimed at the father. It showed most clearly the revengful and murderous passions which were taking possession of the mind of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>50 Pa. 9, it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">\u201cThreats made by a prisoner within an hour before the commission of the murder that he would kill somebody before 21 hours were evidence of malice prepense though they did not expressly refer to the deceased, and that if he killed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>anybody in pursuance of such malice it was murder in the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In the case of <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 Wis. 423, the defend\u2022ant had made use of the following expression: \u201cI will take some man\u2019s life before next Sunday, and speaking of a knife, it 'would probably be the death of some one before the week was out\u2019; that he \u2018had made up his mind to kill a man,\u2019 and that if the witness 'should hear of the death of any person before the week was out they need not he alarmed.\u2019 \u201d These were all admitted over objection, and the ruling was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">And to the same general effect as the cases already referred to, are the following: <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Ky. Law Rep. 504; <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>9 Mont. 445; <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>State, </em>26 Fla. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In this State the case most nearly in point is <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 Md. 253, in which on the subject of general threats Judge Irving uses the following language: \u201cIt can not have been offered to show his character for turbulence and was not admitted for such purpose. A simple act of that kind would not prove that he had that character. But such .an act so soon followed by the killing of a man did show a reckless and mischievous frame of inind at a period so near the killing as to be admissible though the thing itself may not, possibly, be legitimately part of the <em>res gestae. </em>We think it was evidence to show that he was armed and prepared to kill though it did not of itself show intention to kill the deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">And the principle upon which all of these cases rests is that laid down in <em>Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, </em>page 62, where the writer says: \u201cIt is not uncommon with per\u2022sons about to engage in crime to utter menaces, or to make obscure and mysterious allusions to purposes and intentions \u25a0of revenge, or to boast to others, whose standard of moral \u2022conduct is the same as their own, of what they will do or to give vent to expressions of revengful purposes or of malignant satisfaction at the anticipated occurrence of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>serious mischief. Such declarations or allusions are of great moment when clearly connected by independent evidence with some subsequent criminal action. The just effect of such language is to show the existence of the disposition from which criminal actions proceed, to render it less improbable that a person proved to have used it would commit the offense charged, and to explain the real motive and character of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Additional objections were urged against the admissions of the threats testified to by Mr. and Mrs. Laig and Miss Gfibney, but the remoteness or nearness of time as to threats- and declarations, pertaining to an act subsequently committed, makes no difference as to the competency of the evidence, it goes only to the amount of weight to be attached to it; <em>Keener </em>v. <em>State, </em>18 Ga. 194; <em>Cribbs </em>v. <em>State, </em>86 Ala. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In <em>Pate </em>v. <em>State, </em>94 Ala. 14; the threats testified to had been made four months before the homicide was committed;. in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>64 Vt. 466; the lapse of time had been from six to eight months; and in <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Toner, </em>80 Mich. 350; <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>9 Mont. 12, and <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>The People, </em>13 Col. 515, the threats had been made three-years before the assault out of which these eases arose, took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In accordance with expressions of Judge Irving already given, and the preponderance of opinion of the Courts of this country, the threats in the present case were admissible, and the trial Court committed no error in its rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\n<em>Judgment- affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
