J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-1\">In case No. CM021394, defendant Marcus Aurelius Buser pled no contest to receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496, subd. (a); undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code) and unlawfully driving a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851). The court revoked defendant\u2019s probation in case No. CM020368, in which defendant had pled no contest to possessing a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a)) and admitted serving two prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">For both cases the court sentenced defendant to state prison for an aggregate term of four years eight months, calculated as follows: the upper term of three years for receiving stolen property, a concurrent upper term of three years for unlawfully driving a vehicle, a consecutive eight months for possessing a controlled substance, and a consecutive one year for the prior prison term. The court selected the upper term because defendant was on parole and probation when he committed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by imposing an upper term sentence based on facts not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We shall affirm the judgment but direct the trial court to correct two clerical errors in the abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531] and <em>Shepard v. United States </em>(2005) 544 U.S. 13, [161 L.Ed.2d 205, 125 S.Ct. 1254] <em>(Shepard), </em>defendant contends the court\u2019s selection of the upper term for his convictions of receiving stolen property and unlawfully driving a vehicle violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>trial. However, our Supreme Court has recently held \u201cthat the judicial factfinding that occurs when a judge exercises discretion to impose an upper term sentence or consecutive terms under California law does not implicate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Black </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1238, 1244 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 740, 113 P.3d 534] <em>(Black).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\"><em>Shepard, supra, </em>544 U.S. 13 [161 L.Ed.2d 205] also does not support defendant\u2019s argument. <em>Shepard </em>involved the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)), which imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on any person who, after having been previously convicted of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d on three separate occasions, is found guilty of the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>(Shepard, supra, </em>at pp. 15-16 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 211].) After the defendant pled guilty to possession of a firearm, the government introduced evidence of his prior burglary conviction from Massachusetts for the purpose of enhancing his sentence under the ACCA. <em>(Shepard, supra, </em>at p. 15 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 211].) The Massachusetts burglary statute included in the definition of burglary the unlawful entry into a boat or car. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 17 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 212].) However, in <em>Taylor v. United States </em>(1990) 495 U.S. 575 [109 L.Ed.2d 607, 110 S.Ct. 2143], the Supreme Court held that only \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d\u2014that is, an \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or [other] structure, with intent to commit a crime\u201d\u2014qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>at pp. 599, 602 [109 L.Ed.2d at pp. 627, 629].) The government in <em>Shepard </em>argued that the trial court could look beyond the facts alleged in the charging document or admitted by the defendant for the purpose of establishing that the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction would have supported a conviction under a \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d statute. <em>(Shepard, supra, </em>544 U.S. at p. 15 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 211].) The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the trial court was \u201climited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 26 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 218].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Based upon this holding, Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, stated that \u201cin an appropriate case, this Court should consider <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>continuing viability.\u201d <em>(Shepard, supra, </em>544 U.S. at p. 28 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 219] (cone. opn. of Thomas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Using Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion as support for his position, defendant argues \u201cthe continuing viability of the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>\u2018fact of a prior conviction\u2019 exception is highly suspect at this point.\u201d However, the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>holding that a prior conviction is a matter for a judge to determine at sentencing rather than a factual issue for the jury was specifically reaffirmed in <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005) 543 U.S. 220, 244 [160 L.Ed.2d 621, 650, 125 S.Ct. 738].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Moreover, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial as discussed in <em>Shepard </em>applies only to \u201cany disputed fact <em>essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence,\u201d (Shepard, supra, </em>544 U.S. at p. 25 [161 L.Ed.2d at p. 217], italics added.) <em>Black </em>specifically found the ceiling of a potential sentence in California to be the upper term, and not the middle term, for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis. <em>(Black, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention is not meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">The judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to correct the abstract of judgment as stated in the opinion and to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of judgment to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">Davis, J., and Morrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 30, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1084-13\"> The court stated that if defendant was later sentenced to prison, only one of the prior prison terms would be used for sentencing purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1085-8\"> <em>Almendarez-Torres v.
