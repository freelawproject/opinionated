J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYg\">Frank Albert Florez was charged with the murder of Melissa Torre and the felony offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 246, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4) (hereafter section 186.22(b)(4)). He was also charged with possessing a firearm as an ex-felon, in violation of section 12021, subdivision (a)(1) (hereafter section 12021 (a)(1)), with a criminal street gang enhancement under section 186.22, subdivision (b), paragraph (1), subparagraph (A) (hereafter section 186.22(b)(1)(A)). After a jury trial, Florez was convicted of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, and possessing a firearm as an ex-felon. The jury also found true the gang enhancement allegation relating to the latter offense. The jury did not reach a verdict on the murder count, and the court dismissed that count on the prosecutor\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude that Florez\u2019s conviction for the felony offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of section 246, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22(b)(4), qualifies as a \u201cfelony offense listed in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5,\u201d thereby limiting Florez\u2019s presentence conduct credit to 15 percent under section 2933.1. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude that Florez\u2019s various challenges to his convictions do not warrant reversal. However, we agree with the parties that the sentence imposed upon the conviction for discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang should be modified to reflect that the sentence was imposed under section 186.22(b)(4) and is not subject to the 15-year minimum parole eligibility period under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5) (hereafter section 186.22 (b)(5)), and that the amended abstracts of judgments issued on remittitur should reflect case No. H33067, the total credit for presentence time served of 552 days, and that the court used section 2933.1 in computing presentence conduct credit. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">I.-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">V. <em>Sentencing Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">A. <em>Calculation of Presentence Conduct Credit Under Section 2933.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Florez was convicted of the felony offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of section 246, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22(b)(4), and of possessing a firearm as an ex-felon in violation of section 12021(a)(1), with a criminal street gang enhancement under section 186.22(b)(1)(A). Without objection, the trial court calculated Florez\u2019s presentence conduct credits under section 2933.1, awarding him only 15 percent of the actual days he spent in presentence custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Section 2933.1 provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) . . . [A]ny person who is convicted of a felony offense listed in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 shall accrue no more than 15 percent of worktime credit. ...[][]... [][] (c) Notwithstanding Section 4019 [which authorizes presentence conduct credit] or any other provision of law, the maximum credit that may be earned against a period of confinement in ... a county jail, . . . following arrest and prior to placement in the custody of the Director of Corrections, shall not exceed 15 percent of the actual period of confinement for any person specified in subdivision (a).\u201d Florez argues that none of his convictions qualifies as a felony offense listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c) (hereafter section 667.5(c)), and therefore, the court erred in limiting the award of presentence conduct credit under section 2933.1.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree, concluding that the felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>conviction for discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house in violation of section 246, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22(b)(4) qualifies as <em>\u201ca </em>felony offense listed in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5,\u201d thereby limiting Florez\u2019s presentence conduct credit to 15 percent. (\u00a7 2933.1.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">By voting for Proposition 21 (Gang Violence and Juvenile Crime Prevention Act of 1998, eff. Mar. 8, 2000), the electorate created six new life-term gang-related felony offenses. Paragraph (4) of Section 186.22(b) \u201cis an alternate penalty provision that provides for an indeterminate life sentence for certain underlying felony offenses that are gang related.\u201d <em>(People v. Briceno </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 451, 460, fn.7 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 418, 99 P.3d 1007], citing <em>Robert L. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 900, fn. 6 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 69 P.3d 951]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1002, 1004 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 869, 103 P.3d 270].) The paragraph provides that when certain enumerated felonies are committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, the defendant shall be punished for the enumerated felony by \u201can indeterminate term of life imprisonment\u201d with a specified minimum term. (\u00a7 186.22(b)(4).)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One of the numerated felonies includes the offense at issue in this case, the felony offense of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of section 246. (\u00a7 186.22(b)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Section 667.5(c) includes \u201cboth specific, enumerated crimes and descriptions of criminal conduct,\u201d which are deemed \u201cviolent\u201d felonies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1089 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 139].) At issue here is section 667.5(c), paragraph (7), which states, \u201cAny felony punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison for life.\u201d  The life term punishment under section 186.22(b)(4) is imposed \u201c <em>\u2018for the underlying felony itself, </em>when the jury has determined that the defendant has satisfied the conditions specified in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Robert L. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 900, fn. 6, quoting <em>People v. Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 101 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441], italics added.) Thus, a felony conviction under section 186.22(b)(4), punishable by life imprisonment, qualifies as \u201c[a] felony punishable by . . . imprisonment in the state prison for life,\u201d within the plain meaning of paragraph (7) of section 667.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Florez\u2019s reliance upon <em>People v. Thomas </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1122 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 642, 988 P.2d 563] is misplaced. In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant was convicted of first degree residential burglary, making a terrorist threat, possession of a firearm by a felon, and false imprisonment of a hostage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1124.) None of the offenses were listed as a violent offense in section 667.5(c) nor were any of the offenses punishable by a life term. (21 Cal.4th at p. 1127, 1130.) The basis for the trial court\u2019s imposition of life sentences was that the convictions qualified as the defendant\u2019s \u201cthird strike\u201d under the three strikes law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1127.) The Supreme Court held that under those circumstances, the defendant was entitled to presentence conduct credit under section 4019 for the convictions, and not the lesser maximum amount of 15 percent under section 2933.1. (21 Cal.4th at p. 1127.) In so ruling, the court concluded that \u201csections 2933.1 and 667.5(c)(7) limit a defendant\u2019s presentence conduct credit to a maximum of 15 percent only when the defendant\u2019s current conviction is itself punishable by life imprisonment, not when it is so punishable solely due to his status as a recidivist\u201d under the three strikes law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Unlike the recidivist situation in <em>Thomas, </em>section 186.22(b)(4)\u2019s inquiry \u201cfocuses on \u2018an element of the commission of the crime\u2019 (the intent to assist a criminal street gang) that justifies particularly severe punishment.\u201d <em>(People v. Jefferson, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 101.) As noted, paragraph (4) of section 186.22(b) \u201c \u2018sets forth an <em>alternate </em>penalty for the underlying felony itself, when the jury has determined that the defendant has satisfied the conditions specified in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Robert L. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 900, fn. 6, quoting <em>People v. Jefferson, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 101.) Because the underlying felony conviction, discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of section 246, committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22(b)(4) \u201cis itself punishable by life imprisonment\u201d <em>(People v. Thomas, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1130), it is a felony offense within the meaning of paragraph (7) of section 667.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201c \u2018In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, [1] \u201cwe turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u201d [Citation]. [2] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate\u2019s intent]. [Citation.] [3] When the language is ambiguous, \u201cwe refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] [f] In other words, our \u2018task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative\u2019s language so as to effectuate the electorate\u2019s intent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Robert L. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 900-901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We are not persuaded by Florez\u2019s argument that because section 667.5(c) specifically includes certain felonies for which a life term could be imposed under section 186.22(b)(4),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the electorate intended to exclude as violent felonies the other life-term felony offenses enumerated in section 186.22(b)(4). It is not uncommon for section 667.5(c) to list violations of Penal Code sections even though such a violation obviously would be covered by the general category of \u201cany felony\u201d subject to life term imprisonment under paragraph (7) of section 667.5(c). For example, by Proposition 21, the electorate added to section 667.5(c)\u2019s list a violation of section 12310 (\u00a7 667.5(c)(13)), even though a violation of section 12310 already met the definition of a violent felony under paragraph (7) of section 667.5(c) because it was a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life. (\u00a7 12310.) Thus, that two of the enumerated felonies in section 186.22(b)(4) are expressly listed in section 667.5(c) does not require us to conclude that the electorate meant to exclude the other life-term enumerated felonies under section 186.22(b)(4) from being deemed violent felonies under paragraph (7) of section 667.5(c). (7) (See <em>People v. Athar </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 396, 405 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 570, 114 P.3d 806] [\u201cgeneral plain meaning expressed\u201d in statute \u201cdoes not require additional. . . clarity\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Florez does not argue that the electorate did not intend to create new life-term gang-related felony offenses under section 186.22(b)(4). He further concedes that under his interpretation, a gang-related violation of section 246 would be the only new life-term gang-related felony not subject to the section 2933.1 limitation otherwise applicable <em>to the </em>other new life-term gang-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>felonies under section 186.22(b)(4).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> According to Florez, the voters could easily have determined that a violation of section 246 under certain circumstances might be less serious than the other enumerated felonies, and therefore, presentence conduct credit restrictions placed on violent felons under section 2933.1 should not apply to defendants who commit a gang-related violation of section 246. However, we see no reason for the electorate to treat differently the new life-term gang-related felony offenses under section 187.22(b)(4). It is not likely that the electorate contemplated the various ways in which a defendant could violate the life-term gang-related felonies in determining whether those offenses should be deemed violent offenses under section 667.5(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In any event, \u201cit matters not whether the . . . voters . . . consciously considered all the effects and interrelationships of the provisions they . . . enacted. We must take the language ... as it was passed into law, . . . without doing violence to the language and spirit of the law, interpret it so as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 14 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829], fn. omitted.) Our reading of the statutes\u2014that the section 186.22(b)(4) life-term gang-related felony offenses, including the felony violation of section 246, qualify as felony offenses under section 667.5(c)(7)\u2014is consistent with the rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Because Florez\u2019s felony conviction for discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling in violation of section 246 committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22(b)(4) is a felony offense within the meaning of section 667.5(c)(7), the trial court properly limited Florez\u2019s presentence conduct credit to 15 percent under section 2933.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">B\u201e C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The matter is remanded to the trial court to modify the sentence imposed upon the conviction for discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, to reflect that the sentence was imposed under Penal Code section 186.22(b)(4), and the 15-year minimum parole eligibility period under Penal Code section 186.22(b)(5) is not applicable. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to issue amended abstracts of judgments for the indeterminate and determinate terms of imprisonment, reflecting the modified sentence, case No. H33067, the total number of days to be credited for presentence time served of 552 days, and that presentence conduct credit was computed under Penal Code section 2933.1.

Although Florez moved ex parte for a correction, he has not notified us whether the request has been ruled upon by the trial court. In any event, when other issues are litigated on appeal, as in this case, section 1237.1 \u201cdoes not require defense counsel to file [a] motion to correct a presentence award of credits in order to raise that question on appeal.\u201d <em>(People v.
