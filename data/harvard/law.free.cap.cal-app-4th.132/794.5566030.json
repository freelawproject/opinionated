J.</author>\n<p id=\"At1\">In <em>Dwayne P. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 247, 251 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 639] <em>(Dwayne </em>P.), this court held in a <em>first </em>review pertaining to notice under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) that the parents\u2019 failure to object at the juvenile court did not constitute waiver or otherwise preclude appellate review. We relied on the court\u2019s continuing sua sponte duty throughout dependency proceedings to ensure that the requisite notice is given and the protections of the ICWA are afforded to Indian tribes and Indian children. In a previous appeal in this case, in accordance with <em>Dwayne P, </em>we conditionally reversed a judgment terminating the parental rights of Anthony V. and Nancy D. to their daughter, X.V., and remanded the matter to the juvenile court for the limited purpose of complying with ICWA notice requirements. <em>(In re X.V. </em>(Sept. 30, 2004, D044169) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The principal question here is whether the parents\u2014despite their failure to raise any objection at the special hearing on remand devoted to the adequacy of ICWA notices to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and numerous Indian tribes\u2014may raise the issue again on appeal. We hold as an apparent matter of first impression that forfeiture principles preclude a <em>second </em>appellate review in such a case, as further delay harms the paramount interests of dependent children in permanence and stability. The purposes of the ICWA are indeed commendable, but we do not believe Congress envisioned or intended <em>successive </em>or <em>serial </em>appeals on ICWA notice issues when, given a proper objection, they could easily be resolved during proceedings on remand for the specific purpose of determining whether proper notice was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">On the parents\u2019 appeals, we affirm the judgment of termination of their parental rights to X.V. To the extent Anthony purports in his appeal to challenge the judgment terminating parental rights to his son, A.V., we dismiss the appeal for untimeliness. We also deny the parents\u2019 petition for habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In April 2002 the Agency took X.V., then five months old, into protective custody and filed a petition on her behalf under Welfare and Institutions Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 300, subdivisions (a) and (b). The petition alleged X.V. was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>risk because she witnessed domestic violence between the parents and they have a history of drug abuse. Anthony advised the Agency he had Sioux and Blackfeet heritage but was not a registered member of a tribe. The Agency did not notify the BIA or any Indian tribe of the proceedings, but at the detention hearing the court nonetheless found the ICWA inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In May 2002 the court made a true finding on the petition, removed X.V. from parental custody and ordered family reunification services. In August 2002 Nancy gave birth to a boy, A.V. She was incarcerated at the time for spousal abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. The following month, the court declared A.V. a dependent child and placed him in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In X.V.\u2019s case, the court terminated reunification services at the 18-month date in October 2003 and scheduled a permanency planning hearing under section 366.26. Anthony had tested positive for drugs, but denied substance abuse, and Nancy was unwilling to live separately from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In April 2004 the court terminated the parents\u2019 rights to X.V. and selected adoption as the preferred permanent plan. Nancy appealed the judgment, and she, X.V. and the Agency stipulated to reversal because the Agency did not comply with ICWA notice requirements. We conditionally reversed the judgment and instructed the court to direct the Agency to provide proper ICWA notice to the BIA and any appropriate tribes. We also ordered the court to reinstate the judgment if, after receiving notice, no tribe intervened. <em>(In re X.V., supra, </em>D044169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">At a hearing in October 2004 the court ordered the Agency to provide proper ICWA notice. An Agency social worker interviewed the paternal grandmother, and she reported possible Cherokee, Sioux and Blackfeet heritage. The Agency sent separate notices for each child to the BIA, 15 Sioux tribes, three Cherokee tribes, the Prairie Island Community and the Blackfeet tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">On November 4, 2004, the court held A.V.\u2019s permanency planning hearing. The court found ICWA notice was given as required by law, A.V. is not an Indian child and ICWA is inapplicable. The court terminated parental rights to A.V. The parents did not attend the hearing or raise any objection through their counsel to the ICWA findings. Further, they did not appeal the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">On December 15, 2004, the court held a special hearing on the ICWA issue in X.V.\u2019s case. The parents did not attend, but they were each represented by counsel. The paternal grandmother, maternal grandparents and other relatives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>attended. Four tribes had responded that X.V. was not eligible for enrollment, and the BIA stated it could not determine on the information provided that X.V. is an Indian child within the meaning of the ICWA. The court found notice was given in accordance with the ICWA, X.V. is not an Indian child and the ICWA is inapplicable. The court asked whether there was any objection to the findings, and X.V.\u2019s counsel and Nancy\u2019s counsel stated they had no objection. Anthony\u2019s counsel said nothing at the hearing. The court reinstated the previous judgment terminating parental rights to X.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>Jurisdictional Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Preliminarily, we note that in his appeal Anthony purports to challenge the termination of his parental rights to both X.V. and A.V.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Anthony, however, did not timely appeal the November 4, 2004, judgment terminating his rights to A.V. He appealed the December 15, 2004, judgment, naming both X.V. and A.V., but it pertains only to the termination of parental rights to X.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">A judgment terminating parental rights is appealable under section 395, and our jurisdiction to review such a judgment is contingent on a timely notice of appeal. <em>(In re Jonathon S. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 334, 340 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 495].) Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s judgment terminating parental rights to A.V. and we dismiss Anthony\u2019s appeal as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">\n<em>ICWA Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJA\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Anthony and Nancy contend in their appeals that the termination of their parental rights to X.V. must be reversed because of irregularities in the ICWA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>notices. The record on appeal does not reveal the problems, and thus the parents also petition for a writ of habeas corpus pertaining to both X.V. and A.V. and submit supporting evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Anthony submitted a declaration by the paternal grandmother, which stated she told the social worker in September 2004 that her mother, Velia S., told her she had Blackfeet, Sioux and Cherokee Indian heritage from her father, Jesus Mendoza. The paternal grandmother further stated she told the social worker that her paternal great-great-grandmother, Trudy Little, was half Cherokee. The Agency\u2019s ICWA notices, however, referred to Velia as \u201cDelia\u201d and to Jesus Mendoza as \u201cJesse\u201d Mendoza, and as to Little stated the \u201cfamily believes she was 3% Cherokee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The printed form the Agency used to send notice to the Indian tribes stated that if Cherokee ancestry from Oklahoma was alleged, \u201cthe name of a relative must be provided who might have been enrolled in the final roll prepared in 1906 by the Dawes Commission (referred to as the \u20181906 Final Roll\u2019),\u201d and if Cherokee ancestry from another state was alleged, to prove descendency \u201cone must be related to a person listed on the Roll of 1924 for the Eastern Band of Cherokees.\u201d The form asked, \u201cDo you know the name of any Indian relative that was alive in 1906 or 1924 and might have been listed on either the 1906 Final Roll or the Roll of 1924?,\u201d to which the Agency checked the box marked \u201cUnknown.\u201d The paternal grandmother\u2019s declaration stated the social worker did not ask her whether any of the relatives she mentioned were alive in 1906 or 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The Agency contends \u201cCalifornia courts should draw the line someplace,\u201d and thus the parents may not challenge the adequacy of ICWA notice a second time when they failed to raise any objection at the special hearing on remand. Whether the parents may raise the issue again at this stage of the proceedings is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">\u201cIn 1978 Congress enacted the ICWA to \u2018protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families.\u2019 (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.) The ICWA recognizes that \u2018 \u201cthe tribe has an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The ICWA presumes it is in the best interests of the child to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations, a most important resource. [Citation.] Congress has concluded the state courts have not protected these interests and drafted a statutory scheme intended to afford needed protection.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dwayne P, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The notice requirements of the ICWA are intended to ensure the tribe will have the opportunity to assert its rights to intervene in juvenile dependency proceedings irrespective of the position of the parents or state agency. <em>(In re Kahlen W. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1421 [285 Cal.Rptr. 507].) The ICWA provides that when the court knows or has reason to know an Indian child is involved, the agency must notify the child\u2019s tribe, or if the tribe is unknown, the BIA, as agent for the Secretary of the Interior. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.2 (2005).) The notice must include all known names of the child\u2019s biological parents, maternal and paternal grandparents and great-grandparents. (25 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.11(d) (2005).) In <em>In re Louis S. </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 622, 631 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 110], the court held that notices containing misspelled and incomplete names, among other problems, were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">As this court held in <em>In re Karla C. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 166, 178 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 205], the ICWA notices, return receipts and responses of the BIA and tribes must be filed in the juvenile court. \u201cNo foster care placement of termination or parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the . . . tribe or the [Bureau].\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">In <em>Dwayne P, </em>this court held in a writ proceeding challenging the scheduling of a selection and implementation hearing under section 366.26 that the parents could raise ICWA notice issues even though they did not appeal the jurisdictional and dispositional order in which the juvenile court addressed the ICWA issue, and they never raised the issue at the juvenile court. <em>(Dwayne P, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at pp. 253, 260, citing <em>In re Marinna J. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 731, 739 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 267].) We explained that \u201c[w]hen the court has reason to know Indian children are involved in dependency proceedings ... it has the duty to give the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>notice itself or ensure the social services agency\u2019s compliance with the notice requirement. [Citations.] In our view, the court\u2019s duty is sua sponte, since notice is intended to protect the interests of Indian children and tribes despite the parents\u2019 inaction.\u201d <em>(Dwayne P, supra, </em>at p. 261,-citing <em>In re Kahlen W, supra, 233 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1425.) We included broad language in <em>Dwayne P, </em>such as \u201c[b]ecause the court\u2019s duty continues until proper notice is given, an error in not giving notice is also of a continuing nature and may be challenged at any time during the dependency proceedings,\u201d and \u201c[t]hough delay harms the interests of dependent children in expediency and finality, the parents\u2019 inaction should not be allowed to defeat the laudable purposes of the ICWA.\u201d <em>(Dwayne P., supra, </em>at p. 261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><em>Dwayne P, </em>however, concerned the parents\u2019 <em>first </em>appellate challenge to the adequacy of ICWA notice, whereas this case concerns the parents\u2019 <em>second </em>challenge after they ignored the ICWA issue at the special hearing on remand for the specific purpose of assessing the adequacy of notice. <em>\u201cA </em>decision is authority only for the point actually passed on by the court and directly involved in the case. General expressions in opinions that go beyond the facts of the case will not necessarily control the outcome in a subsequent suit involving different facts.\u201d <em>(Gomes v. County of Mendocino </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 977, 985 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 93]; see <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1195 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 969 P.2d 613].)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">It is undisputed that on the first appeal we remanded this case for the specific and sole purpose of affording proper notice under the ICWA; on remand the juvenile court ordered the Agency to give proper notice; the Agency obtained information on Indian heritage from the paternal grandmother and sent ICWA notices to the BIA and numerous tribes, and the ICWA notices, return receipts and responses were filed with the court; the parents did not appear at either the November 4, 2004, hearing in which their rights to A.V. were terminated or the December 15, 2004, hearing in which their rights to X.V. were terminated, but each was represented by counsel; and, neither parent raised any objection to the adequacy of the ICWA notices. At the December 15 hearing Nancy\u2019s attorney expressly consented to the court\u2019s ICWA findings. Further, a number of relatives appeared at the December 15 hearing, including the paternal grandmother, and none of them raised any ICWA issue. Surely the parents\u2019 counsel, had they any interest in the matter, could have shown the ICWA notices to the paternal grandmother to see if the information she gave the Agency was accurately stated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>A \u201creviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court. [Citation.] The purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court, so that they may be corrected. [Citation.] [f] Dependency matters are not exempt from this rule.\u201d <em>(In re S.B. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1287, 1293 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 786, 90 P.3d 746], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The appellate court has discretion to excuse forfeiture, but it should be exercised rarely and with special care. <em>{In re S.B., </em>at p. 1293.) Because juvenile dependency proceedings \u201cinvolve the well-being of children, considerations such as permanency and stability are of paramount importance. (\u00a7 366.26.)\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In balancing the interests of Indian children and tribes under the ICWA, and the interests of dependent children to permanency and stability, we conclude the parents have forfeited a <em>second </em>appeal of ICWA notice issues. At this point, X.V. has been in the dependency system for nearly three and a half years, during which she has had several placements. In April 2004 the court found X.V. was adoptable, but because of the earlier appeal and remand for proper ICWA notice, her permanent placement has been substantially delayed. A.V. has been in the dependency system his entire life, and he has had four caretakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We are mindful that the ICWA is to be construed broadly <em>{Dwayne P, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 257), but we are unwilling to further prolong the proceedings for another round of ICWA notices, to which the parents may again object on appeal. As a matter of respect for the children involved and the judicial system, as well as common sense, it is incumbent on parents on remand to assist the Agency in ensuring proper notice is given. Here, for instance, the inadequacies in the notices, a misspelling and the apparent use of a nickname, could easily have been rectified at the juvenile court given a timely objection. Moreover, Congress\u2019s intent to not cause unnecessary delay in dependency proceedings is evidenced by the provision allowing a hearing on the termination of parental rights within a relatively short time, 10 days, after the BIA or tribe receives ICWA notice. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a).) We do not believe Congress anticipated or intended to require successive or serial appeals challenging ICWA notices for the first time on appeal. As the Agency notes, \u201c[a]t some point, the rules of error preservation must apply or parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>will be able to repeatedly delay permanence for children through numerous belated ICWA notice appeals and writs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In their petition for writ relief, Anthony and Nancy also contend reversal of the judgment terminating their parental rights is required because they presented evidence that in early December 2004, weeks after the Agency sent ICWA notices on remand, \u201cinformation came\u201d to his mother that her great-great-grandfather was Choctaw Indian. She did not share that information with the Agency, however, and thus it was not required to notify the Choctaw tribes before terminating parental rights. <em>(In re Antoinette S. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1409 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">\n<em>Section 387 Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">In July 2004 the Agency placed X.V. and A.V. with the maternal grandparents, who planned to adopt both children. In December 2004 the maternal grandparents reported that Anthony and Nancy took the children on an unauthorized visit and the Agency learned Anthony was staying at their home. A relative reported that when Anthony returned with the children he smelled of alcohol and appeared intoxicated. The Agency removed the children and placed them with a nonrelative prospective adoptive family. The paternal grandmother had previously cared for X.V. for more than two years during the dependency, and she told the Agency she could be considered a backup adoptive parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Anthony and Nancy complain that removal of the children<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> without a section 387 petition is reversible error, as the removal occurred during the time their parental rights to X.V. were reinstated after the first appeal. Section 387, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cAn order changing or modifying a previous order by removing a child from the physical custody of a parent, guardian, relative, or Mend and directing placement in a foster home . . . shall be made only after noticed hearing upon a supplemental petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Relatives attended the December 15, 2004, hearing regarding ICWA notice, including the maternal grandparents and the paternal grandmother. Counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>for X.V. advised the court, \u201cI believe most of the family members are more interested in what happened in the case recently regarding [X.V.] and [A.V.] That will probably be the subject of a detention hearing soon. They were removed from maternal grandparents.\u201d The court asked counsel whether \u201c[w]e\u2019ll be getting a petition pursuant to section 387,\u201d and she responded, \u201cyes, you will be getting a 387 probably due tomorrow.\u201d The court advised the relatives the only matter then before it was ICWA notice, and it was previously unaware of the removal and expected a petition under section 387 to \u201celevate the level of placement.\u201d The paternal grandmother addressed the court, asserting X.V. should be placed with her pending a hearing on a petition. X.V.\u2019s counsel suggested that the social worker notify the grandparents of a hearing, and the court found that a sensible solution as it wanted to \u201cmake sure they have the opportunity to be present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">County counsel, however, advised the court the Agency did not plan to file a section 387 petition, and a petition was unnecessary \u201cbecause we were removing from an adoptive relative.\u201d County counsel said he advised one of the grandmothers there would be no such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">After the hearing, the Agency submitted to the court a form entitled \u201cChange of Placement Same Level of Care/PCC Entry.\u201d The court signed it on December 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The Agency contends the parents lack standing to object to the lack of a section 387 petition because their parental rights had been terminated and remand was for the sole issue of ICWA notice. We do not reach that and other procedural challenges, however, because Anthony and Nancy forfeited appellate review by not objecting at the juvenile court to the lack of a section 387 petition. At the December 15, 2004, hearing the parents\u2019 attorneys said nothing regarding the matter, even when County Counsel said the Agency did not plan to file a petition. Further, there is no suggestion that the parents\u2019 counsel later sought a special hearing to address the matter when the Agency did not file a petition. The parents may not stand idly by and raise the issue for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The appeal is dismissed insofar as it concerns A.V.

The paternal grandmother and other relatives have no standing here, and they have not asserted any such right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
