The question presented here is whether the term \u201cadjusted basis,\u201d as used in \u00a7 57(a)(8), includes certain depreciable drilling and development costs identified in \u00a7 1.612-4(c)(1) of the Treasury Department regulations. We hold that the term does not cover such costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">In 1981 and 1982, respondents William F. and Lola E. Hill were in the oil and gas exploration and production business, and, on their federal income tax returns for those respective years, they deducted $439,884 and $371,636 for depletion with respect to their interests in oil and gas deposits. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 57(a)(8) (1976 ed.), the excess of the allowable depletion deduction for each of the deposit interests over the interest\u2019s \u201cadjusted basis\u201d is an \u201cite[m] of tax preference\u201d on which a taxpayer must pay a \u201cminimum tax\u201d for the tax year in question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See \u00a7 56(a). In determining the adjusted bases of their deposit interests, the Hills included not only the unrecovered portions of the amounts they originally paid to purchase the interests, but the unrecovered costs of depreciable tangible items (machinery, tools, pipes, and so forth) used to exploit the deposits. Having thus reduced the amount of each item of tax preference under \u00a7 57(a)(8), they calculated and paid minimum taxes on those items of $29,812 for 1981 and $26,736 for 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disputed the inclusion of the tangible costs in the deposits\u2019 adjusted bases, and assessed a larger minimum tax based on their exclusion. The Hills paid the resulting respective deficiencies of $30,963 and $18,-733, and filed a refund claim, which the Commissioner denied. The taxpayers then sued the United States, petitioner here, for a refund in the Claims Court, which granted summary judgment in their favor. 21 Cl.Ct. 713 (1990). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed. 945 F.2d 1529 (1991). Because of the importance of the issue to the federal fisc, we granted certiorari, 503 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1758, 118 L.Ed.2d 422 (1992). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b948-17\">An oil and gas producer cannot ordinarily depreciate or otherwise recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>(before disposition) his investment in land on which he drills wells because the process of producing his taxable income does not wear out or use up the land. See, <em>e.g., </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-2 (disallowing a depreciation deduction for \u201cland apart from the improvements or physical development added to it\u201d). Part of the purchase price of a fee simple interest in the land, however, represents investment in the right to extract any oil and gas from subsurface deposits, which (unlike the land) are \u201cwasting assets,\u201d gradually depleted as the minerals are removed. An owner of such wasting assets, according to basic income tax theory, should accordingly be allowed a \u201creasonable allowance for depletion,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(a) (1976 ed.), \u201cto compensate [him] for the part exhausted in production, so that when the minerals are gone, the owner\u2019s capital and his capital assets remain unimpaired.\u201d <em>Paragon Jewel Coal Co. v. Commissioner, </em>380 U.S. 624, 631, 85 S.Ct. 1207, 1211, 14 L.Ed.2d 116 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">To a degree, however, practice and theory have drifted apart. The Code and associated Treasury Department regulations require taxpayers to calculate depletion allowances by whichever of two methods produces the larger deduction for the current taxable year. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-1(a)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613(a) (1976 ed.) (\u201cIn no case shall the allowance for depletion under section 611 be less than it would be if computed without reference to this section [concerning percentage depletion]\u201d). The first method, \u201ccost depletion,\u201d remains firmly moored to the rationale articulated in <em>Paragon Jewel. </em>Under that method, the taxpayer estimates the number of recoverable units in his mineral deposit, and deducts an appropriate portion of the deposit\u2019s adjusted basis for each unit extracted and sold. See Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-2; Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.612-1. When the sum of prior deductions equals the cost or other basis of the deposit, plus allowable capital additions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[n]o further deductions for cost depletion shall be allowed.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-2(b)(2). The second method, \u201cpercentage depletion,\u201d has no such ties. It generously allows the taxpayer extracting minerals from a deposit to deduct a specified percentage of his gross income, even when his prior depletion deductions have exceeded his investment in the deposit. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613 (1976 ed. and Supp. V); Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.613-1. For the tax years at issue, percentage depletion produced the larger deduction for the Hills, and they accordingly calculated their depletion allowance according to that method.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">For those tax years, however, percentage depletion\u2019s gleam is dimmed by the minimum tax.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 57(a)(8) of the Code requires a taxpayer to calculate as a \u201ctax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>preference\u201d \u201c[w]ith respect to each [interest in a mineral deposit],<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the excess of the deduction for depletion allowable under section 611 for the taxable year over the adjusted basis of the [mineral deposit interest] at the end of the taxable year (determined without regard to the depletion deduction for the taxable year).\u201d In turn, \u00a7 56 of the Code requires a taxpayer to pay an extra minimum tax of 15% on the amount by which the sum of the enumerated tax-preference items in \u00a7 57(a) exceeds the specific deductions permitted by \u00a7 56. Because the amount subject to the extra tax is reduced dollar-for-dollar by every outlay that can be added to the adjusted basis of the mineral deposit interest, a taxpayer would like as long a list of eligible outlays as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">In this case the dispute is about the inclusion in adjusted basis of certain tangible drilling and development costs, as defined by the Treasury Regulations implementing \u00a7\u00a7 263(c) and 612 of the Code. Section 263(c) grants taxpayers an option to deduct against current income certain \u201cintangible drilling and development costs.\u201d The regulations limit the costs recoverable under that option by distinguishing \u201cintangible costs\u201d from costs for \u201ccapital items,\u201d which the parties refer to as \u201ctangible costs\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-6\">\u201cThe option with respect to intangible drilling and development costs does not apply to expenditures by which the taxpayer acquires tangible property ordinarily considered as having a salvage value. Examples of such items are the costs of the actual materials in those structures which are constructed in the wells and on the property, and the cost of drilling tools, pipe, casing, tubing, tanks, engines, boilers, machines, etc____ These are capital items and are returnable through depreciation.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.612-4(c)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">It is the cost of such capital items as these, to the extent that they have not already been recovered through depreciation, that the Hills would like to add to the bases of their mineral deposit interests for purposes of calculating the amount of their percentage depletion deductions subject to the minimum tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">The taxpayers enter the race with a handicap. As we have noted, see n. 4, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 57(a)(8) defines the \u201cproperty\u201d with which it is concerned by reference to \u00a7 614, which speaks in terms of the adjusted basis of \u201ceach separate interest owned by the taxpayer in each mineral deposit.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 614(a) (1976 ed). A regulation defines \u201cmineral deposit\u201d as \u201cminerals in place,\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-1(d)(4), while a neighboring regulation defines another term, \u201cmineral enterprise,\u201d to include \u201cthe mineral deposit or deposits <em>and improvements, if any, used in mining or in the production of oil and gas. \u201d </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-1(d)(3) (emphasis added). Because these regulatory definitions were well-established at the time Congress passed \u00a7 57(a)(8), see 25 Fed.Reg. 11796 (1960); Pub.L. 91-172 \u00a7 301, 83 Stat. 580, 582, we think it reasonable to assume that Congress relied on the accepted distinction between them in its reference to \u201cmineral deposit\u201d as contained in \u00a7 614. Thus the definitional scheme suggests strongly that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the \u201cproperty\u201d we are concerned with in \u00a7 57(a)(8) excludes just those improvements that the Hills wish to treat as part of the property\u2019s adjusted basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">They assert, however, (and petitioner does not dispute) that the term \u201cmineral enterprise\u201d occurs in only that one operative provision in the regulations, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.611-1(d)(4), which concerns the allocation of a portion of the cost of a mineral enterprise to a mineral deposit or deposits. On that basis, the Hills argue that the term has the limited function of \u201cassistpng] in identifying depletable and depreciable costs when an operating mineral property is acquired as a unit.\u201d Brief for Respondents 18, n. 21. Consistently with that view, they note, a regulation implementing \u00a7 57(a)(8) directs us to \u201csee section 1016 and the regulations thereunder ... [fjor the determination of the adjusted basis of the property.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.57-1(h)(3). The computation of adjusted basis under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1016 (1976 ed. and Supp. V), they argue, is independent of the definition and function of \u201cmineral enterprise\u201d in the \u00a7 611 regulations; thus, the implications of this term\u2019s definition do not extend to the calculation at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We agree that \u00a7 1016 is the proper place to look for the rules concerning adjustment of basis; but we conclude that the computation of adjusted basis under \u00a7 1016 is wholly predicated on, rather than independent of, an understanding of \u201cmineral deposit\u201d as distinct from \u201cimprovements\u201d within the meaning of the regulations under \u00a7 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Section 1016 is one of a number of general provisions that together determine the amount of gain or loss a taxpayer must recognize when he sells or otherwise disposes of any type of property. Section 1001(a) provides the basic rule: gain or loss is determined by subtracting \u201cadjusted basis\u201d from \u201camount realized.\u201d Section 1011(a) defines \u201cadjusted basis\u201d as \u201cbasis (determined under section 1012 [or other parts of the Code]), adjusted as provided in section 1016.\u201d Section 1016 provides the rules for making \u201c[adjustments to basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">The taxpayers, acknowledging the centrality of \u00a7 1016, seize on the last phrase of a regulation addressing that section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-10\">\u201cThe cost or other basis shall be properly adjusted for any expenditure ... or other item, properly chargeable to capital account, including the cost of improvements and betterments made to the property.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1016-2(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">The ordinary meanings of the terms \u201cimprovements\u201d and \u201cbetterments,\u201d the Hills say, include all valuable additions to property that are more than mere repairs; the tangible costs that they have incurred to exploit their mineral deposits increase the value of those deposits, and in any case are specifically referred to in the regulations implementing \u00a7 611 as \u201cimprovements,\u201d see Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-5; therefore, those costs should be included in the adjusted basis of the mineral deposit for purposes of \u00a7 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">The Hills\u2019 chosen passage, however, cannot carry the weight they ask it to bear. The purpose of the phrase \u201cincluding the cost of improvements and betterments made to the property\u201d in Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1016-2(a) is not to provide guidance in particular cases as to whether, for tax accounting purposes, an expense should be added to the basis of an existing \u201cproperty,\u201d or treated as a separate \u201cproperty\u201d of its own. Rather, it is to ensure coordination of \u00a7 1016 with \u00a7 263, the Code section from which the term \u201cimprovements and betterments\u201d (which should probably be read as a unit) is borrowed. Section 263(a)(1) provides that an expenditure may not currently be deducted from income if it is \u201cpaid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 263(a)(1) (1976 ed. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Supp. V). We have said that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 263 is to reflect the basic principle that a capital expenditure may not be deducted from current income. It serves to prevent a taxpayer from utilizing currently a deduction properly attributable, through amortization, to later tax years when the capital asset becomes income producing.\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., </em>418 U.S. 1, 16, 94 S.Ct. 2757, 2766, 41 L.Ed.2d 535 (1974). In turn, inclusion of the term \u201cimprovements and betterments\u201d in Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1016-2(a) ensures the fulfillment of \u00a7 263\u2019s implicit promise: If a taxpayer cannot deduct an expenditure from current income because it has been deemed an \u201cimprovement or betterment\u201d to property, he will be able to recover it later, either through a form of cost recovery such as depreciation or depletion, or upon sale as a deduction from the amount realized.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Thus it is not by deciphering particular terms in the regulations accompanying \u00a7 1016 that the question in this case is answered, but by relying on the basic principles embodied in \u00a7 1016\u2019s directives. For our purposes, the most important mandate is found in \u00a7 1016(a)(2), which requires a taxpayer to subtract from his original basis in the property sold or exchanged \u201cnot less than the amount allowable [for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion] under this subtitle or prior income tax laws.\u201d In other words, whether or not the taxpayer ever took a depreciation, amortization, or depletion deduction with respect to the item he is selling, he must, for purposes of \u00a7 1016, determine whether such deductions were allowable with respect to that item, and reduce his basis by at least that allowable amount.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">To follow this directive, the taxpayer must determine whether parts of the item sold are subject to different tax treatments, and must treat those parts as different properties for purposes of \u00a7 1016. Thus, a taxpayer who bought an apartment building and the land it sits on for a single price must determine how much of that price went to pay for each, and must treat each cost as a separate asset for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>of \u00a7 1016. This is so because the depreciation deduction allowable for the building (if the building is used to produce income) must, upon the sale or exchange of the property, be subtracted from the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the building whether the deduction was taken or not; but there is no subtraction from the land\u2019s basis since no such deduction is allowable for the land. See, <em>e.g., </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-5 (requiring an apportionment of basis when a taxpayer has acquired <em>\u201ca </em>combination of depreciable and nondepreciable property for a lump sum, as for example, buildings and land\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Although the Code and regulations allow some flexibility within such major categories of tax treatment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the boundaries between the major categories are almost completely impassable. When a taxpayer is dealing with associated items falling into two different major categories, he cannot, as a general matter, choose to treat those items as a single property falling into one category or the other; a taxpayer may not, for example, decide to treat some or all of his apartment building as more land. Nor may a taxpayer choose to add \u201cimprovement\u201d costs to the basis of whichever item he pleases: some costs, say of a new roof, must be treated as adding to the value of the depreciable building (or as separate depreciable assets), whereas other costs, like that of grading a building site, must be treated as additions to the value of the nondepreciable land. See, <em>e.g., </em>Rev.Rul. 74-265, 1974-1 Cum.Bull. 56 (distinguishing between depreciable and nondepreciable improvements to land).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Depletion and depreciation are two of these major categories of tax treatment. As this Court said almost a half-century ago, \u201c[t]h[e] distinction between depletion and depreciation runs through the basis provisions of the [Internal Revenue Code].\u201d <em>Choate v. Commissioner, </em>324 U.S. 1, 3, 65 S.Ct. 469, 470, 89 L.Ed. 653 (1945). Thus, the Code\u2019s depreciation allowance \u201cdoes not apply to natural resources which are subject to the allowance for depletion provided in section 611.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-2. Accordingly, \u00a7 611 itself carefully appends, to its provision for \u201ca reasonable allowance for depletion\u201d in the case of natural deposits and timber, the qualification \u201cand for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(a) (1976 ed.); see Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-5(a). To implement this distinction, the regulations under \u00a7 611, mentioned above, separately define \u201cmineral deposit\u201d as \u201cminerals in place,\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-1(d)(4), and \u201cmineral enterprise\u201d as including \u201cthe mineral deposit or deposits and improvements.\u201d Treas.Reg. 1.611-1(d)(3). The section defining \u201cmineral deposit\u201d then further provides that \u201c[w]hen a mineral enterprise is acquired as a unit, the cost of any interest in the mineral deposit or deposits is that proportion of the total cost of the mineral enterprise which the value of the interest in the deposit or deposits bears to the value of the entire enterprise at the time of its acquisition.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.611-1(d)(4); see also \u00a7 1.611-2(g)(2)(vii) (requiring a statement to be attached to the taxpayer\u2019s return showing \u201c[a]n allocation of the cost or value among the mineral property, improvements and the surface of the land for purposes other than mineral production\u201d). These provisions are designed to isolate those portions of the cost of a \u201cmineral enterprise\u201d that are subject to recovery through depletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Thus, just as one generally cannot calculate an adjusted basis under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>\u00a7 1016 by treating an apartment building as \u201cmore land,\u201d one generally cannot treat tangible tools and equipment as \u201cmore mineral deposit.\u201d If a mineral deposit and associated equipment are sold together, \u00a7 1016 requires the seller to separate them for the purpose of determining his gain or loss on the sale, just as \u00a7\u00a7 167 and 611 required him to keep them separate for the purpose of calculating his depreciation and depletion deductions. Since, as the Hills point out, a regulation incorporates the \u00a7 1016 rule into \u00a7 57(a)(8), and since the Hills have identified no exception to this rule, we infer that the Hills\u2019 tangible costs may not be included in the basis of depletable mineral deposits for purposes of calculating the amount of percentage depletion subject to the minimum tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Our conclusion is confirmed by the astonishing, circuitously achieved results of reading \u00a7 57(a)(8) as the taxpayers urge. A regulation that the Hills do not challenge provides that \u201c[i]n no event shall percentage depletion in excess of cost or other basis of the property be credited to the improvements account or the depreciation reserve account.\u201d Treas.Keg. \u00a7 1.611-2(b)(2). The tangible costs at issue here are recorded in these accounts. Thus, under this regulation, a tangible cost is not itself adjusted for the amount of percentage depletion that on the Hills\u2019 theory it would shelter from the minimum tax each year. As a result, the tangible cost would shelter, over the years the taxpayer owned the capital item it represented, an amount of percentage depletion many times that of the cost itself. For example, a $21,000 capital item, subject to straight-line depreciation over 20 years with a salvage value of $1000, would add $20,000 to the basis of the mineral deposit the first year,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> $19,000 the second year, and so on for 20 years. At the end of the 20th year, the item would be fully depreciated, and the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the item would then remain at $1000, the salvage value, for as many more years as he continued to own it. Thus, over the first 20 years, the capital item would shelter $210,000, or 10 times its cost, from the minimum tax; beginning in the 21st year, it would shelter $1000 per year for as long as it remained in the taxpayer\u2019s hands. At a minimum tax rate of 15%, a taxpayer would realize a tax benefit, from his $21,000 investment, of $31,500 over the first 20 years from \u00a7 57(a)(8) alone, without regard to the additional tax benefit from ordinary depreciation of the item. It is hard to believe that Congress would enact a minimum tax to limit the benefit that taxpayers could realize from \u201citems of tax preference,\u201d only to define one of those items in a way that would create an even greater proportional tax benefit from investing in tangible items, and to do so in an oblique fashion that, as far as we know, has no precedent in the history of the federal income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">The Hills contend that two Treasury Department regulations we have not yet discussed foreclose our conclusion. They point first to one of the cost depletion regulations under \u00a7 612, which, but for its title and one adjective, would independently reinforce our conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-12\">\u201cThe basis for cost depletion of mineral or timber property does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-13\">\u201c(i) Amounts recoverable through depreciation deductions, through deferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>expenses, and through deductions other than depletion, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANe\">\u201c(ii) The residual value of land and improvements at the end of operations.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.612-1(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">This, of course, is exactly the conclusion in the case of percentage depletion that we have reached after a long detour through \u00a7 1016. Section 1.612-l(b)(l) applies by its terms, however, only to the determination of mineral deposit basis for the purpose of calculating <em>cost </em>depletion; and the title of \u00a7 1.612-l(b) is <em>\u201cSpecial rules.\u201d </em>Therefore, reason the Hills, the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d for determining mineral deposit basis under \u00a7 1016 must include the items, such as \u201c[ajmounts recoverable through depreciation deductions,\u201d excluded in the \u201cspecial rule.\u201d But this argument proves too much. If the Hills stuck to their logic, they would have to claim that they could also add \u201c[t]he residual value of land and improvements at the end of operations\u201d to their bases in their mineral deposit interests, an absurdity that they cannot, and do not try to, support. The simple answer is that when an arguable suggestion of the title of one subsection of a regulation is pitted against the entire Code framework for determining basis, the Code wins, and the title is at most an infelicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The infelicity is understandable here. The calculation of percentage depletion is unconnected to the concept of basis; the annual percentage depletion deduction is not measured in relation to basis, nor are the cumulative deductions limited by basis. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 613 (1976 ed. and Supp. V). The concepts of basis and percentage depletion meet only in the minimum tax provisions, for the purpose of calculating the item of tax preference in \u00a7 57(a)(8). Since \u00a7 1.612-1(b)(1) was issued long before the minimum tax was enacted, see 25 Fed.Reg. 11801 (1960); Pub.L. 91-172, \u00a7 301, 83 Stat. 580, that regulation\u2019s reference to a \u201cspecial rule\u201d for \u201ccost\u201d depletion cannot have been intended to indicate that some other rule applied to the calculation of basis for percentage depletion. After the minimum tax was enacted, the Treasury Department inserted a regulation about basis for percentage depletion where one would expect it: among the regulations implementing the minimum tax. That regulation, \u00a7 1.57-l(h)(3), directs us to \u00a7 1016, but unfortunately contains no correlative reference to the regulations under \u00a7 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Second, the Hills argue that excluding tangible costs from the adjusted basis of their mineral deposit interests would run counter to regulations specifying the inclusion of certain intangible costs. As we have already noted, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 263(c) (1976 ed., Supp. V) grants taxpayers an option to deduct as expenses certain \u201cintangible drilling and development costs.\u201d If a taxpayer chooses instead to capitalize those costs, the regulations require the taxpayer to sort the costs into two bins. Costs \u201crepresented by physical property\u201d are recoverable through depreciation, either through adjustments to the bases of pre-existing items to which the costs relate, or through an initial entry in a new depreciation account. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.612-4(b)(2). Costs \u201cnot represented by physical property\u201d are recoverable through depletion, as adjustments to the bases of the mineral deposit interests to which they relate. \u00a7 1.612-4(b)(l); see \u00a7 1.612-4(d) (if a taxpayer fails to elect to expense intangible costs correctly, \u201che shall be deemed to have elected to recover such costs through depletion to the extent that they are not represented by physical property, and through depreciation to the extent that they are represented by physical property\u201d). Since these latter costs are added to depletable basis, the taxpayers argue, so should the tangible costs that are excluded altogether from the \u00a7 263(c) option. We fail to see the logic of this argument. To the extent that the regulation allowing intangible costs \u201cnot represented by physical property\u201d to be added to a mineral deposit\u2019s basis deviates from general principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>of basis allocation, we see no reason why one deviation should force the Government, or this Court, to create another. Nor have the Hills explained why this regulation in fact represents a deviation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">. All references to the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury Regulations are to those that applied during the tax years at issue. The Treasury Regulations are cited as codified in the 1981 and 1982 editions of the Code of Federal Regulations. In the course of enacting the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Congress redesignated \u00a7 57(a)(8) as \u00a7 57(a)(1) for taxable years beginning after 1986. See Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-514, \u00a7\u00a7 701(a) and 701(f)(1), 100 Stat. 2333, 2343. In October 1992, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub.L. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776. Section 1915(a) of that Act amends \u00a7 57(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and provides that, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992, the depletion allowance permitted under \u00a7 613A(c) of the Code will not be treated as an item of tax preference subject to taxation as alternative minimum taxable income. See n. 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-5\">. Allowable capital additions include intangible drilling and development costs that are \"not represented by physical property,\" such as expenditures for clearing ground, draining, road making, surveying, geological work, grading, and the drilling, shooting, and cleaning of wells, to the extent that the taxpayer opts to capitalize these costs rather than deducting them as expenses. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.612-4(b)(1). For further discussion of these costs, see <em>infra, </em>at 952-953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-6\">. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-248, \u00a7 201, 96 Stat. 411, repealed the \"minimum tax\" for noncorporate taxpayers for tax years beginning after December 31, 1982. See \u00a7\u00a7 201(c)(1), 201(e)(1). At the same time, however, the Act also included items of tax preference, such as excess percentage depletion under \u00a7 57(a)(8), in the calculation of a taxpayer\u2019s \"alternative minimum taxable income.\u201d \u00a7 201(a). While the \"minimum tax\u201d was simply added to the amount of income tax due under the normal provisions, the \"alternative minimum tax\u201d provision, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 55 (1982 ed.), requires the recalculation of a taxpayer\u2019s income under a different set of rules. A tax is then imposed at a graduated rate on the taxpayer\u2019s \u201calternative minimum taxable income\"; if the amount of alternative minimum tax so calculated is greater than the income tax calculated under the ordinary provisions, the taxpayer must pay both the normal tax and the amount by which his alternative minimum tax liability exceeds his ordinary tax liability. Because items of tax preference were added to \"alternative minimum taxable income,\" the issue in this case continued to be relevant for tax years beginning after December 31, 1982. For the subsequent history of \u00a7 57(a)(8), see n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. Section 57(a)(8) applies to \"each property (as defined in section 614).\" Section 614(a) defines \u201cproperty,\u201d \"[f]or the purpose of computing the depletion allowance in the case of mines, wells, and other natural deposits,\u201d as \u201ceach separate interest owned by the taxpayer in each mineral deposit in each separate tract or parcel of land.\u201d (The remainder of \u00a7 614 provides detailed rules about when a taxpayer may, and sometimes must, combine separate interests and treat them as one \"property\u201d.) Section 1.614-l(a) of the Treasury Department regulations makes the definition in \u00a7 614 applicable \u201c[f]or purposes of subtitle A of the [Internal Revenue] Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b950-16\">. The regulations also foreclose the option with respect to the cost of \"labor, fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies, etc., in connection with the operation of the wells and of other facilities on the property for the production of oil or gas.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.612-4(c)(2). These costs must be \u201ccharged off as expense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. Section 263(a)(1) has one of the longest lineages of any provision in the Internal Revenue Code. The Revenue Act of 1864 included a provision specifying that \"no deduction shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>made for any amount paid out for new buildings, permanent improvements, or betterments, made to increase the value of any property or estate.\u201d \u00a7 117 of the Revenue Act of 1864, 13 Stat. 282. The wording of this provision remained the same in \u00a7 28 of the Revenue Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 553, and in \u00a7 2(B) of the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 167. The current wording of the provision was adopted in the Revenue Act of 1918. See \u00a7 215(b) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1069. The language of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1016-2(a) apparently originated in a passage in a House Committee Report on the Revenue Act of 1924, discussing the progenitor of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1016. See H.R.Rep. No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 50 (1924) (\u201cUnder this provision capital charges, such as improvements and betterments ... are to be added to the cost of the property in determining the gain or loss from its subsequent sale\u201d). The forerunner to Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1016-2(a) was issued that same year. See Treas.Regs. 65, Art. 581 (1924).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\">. After tracing the word \"improvement\u201d from the regulations implementing \u00a7 611 through the regulations implementing \u00a7 1016 to the text of \u00a7 263, one might hope that \u00a7 263 itself would provide some insight into whether tangible development costs should be treated as an \"improvement\u201d to the mineral deposit, or as a separate property. Two circumstances dash this hope. First, as we said above, the phrase \"improvements and betterments,\u201d as used in the \u00a7 1016 regulations and in \u00a7 263, should probably be read as a single term unrelated to the term \"improvements\" in \u00a7 611 and the regulations thereunder. Second, \u00a7 263 is concerned only with identifying those payments that \"serv[e] to create or enhance ... what is essentially a separate and distinct additional asset.\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Lincoln Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>403 U.S. 345, 354, 91 S.Ct. 1893, 1899, 29 L.Ed.2d 519 (1971). So long as one can say that a payment must either be \"creating\u201d a separate asset or \"enhancing\u201d one that already exists, one need not, for purposes of \u00a7 263, identify which of these is the case. Here, we are presented with precisely that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b952-11\">. The directive is phrased \u201cnot less than the amount allowable\u201d to account for the case in which a taxpayer has erroneously deducted <em>more </em>than that amount in a prior year. In that case, the taxpayer must reduce the basis by the greater amount actually deducted, to the extent that it resulted \u201c(by reason of the deductions so allowed) in a reduction for any taxable year of [his] taxes.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1016(a)(2)(B) (1976 ed.); see \u00a7 1016(a)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b953-6\">. For example, a taxpayer may set up a depreciation account for a new furnace separate from that of the account of the building in which it is installed; he may also, under some circumstances, set up a \"composite\" account which combines the cost of the building with the cost of \u201cimprovements,\" such as the furnace. See generally Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-7 (describing \u201cgroup,\u201d \u201cclassified,\u201d \"composite,\u201d and component accounts for depreciable property).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b953-10\">. As we have noted, see n. 7, <em>supra </em>the word \u201cimprovements\u201d carries a different meaning here than it does within the term \u201cimprovements or betterments\u201d as used in \u00a7 263(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">. Under \u00a7 57(a)(8), percentage depletion is offset by \"the adjusted basis of the [mineral deposit interest] <em>at the end of the taxable year. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Assuming that the capital item was placed in service at the beginning of a taxable year, by the end of the year the taxpayer\u2019s basis in it would be reduced by the first year\u2019s depreciation. Thus, in our example, the $21,000 capital item would add $20,000 to the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the mineral deposit, for purposes of \u00a7 57(a)(8), the first year it was placed in service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b956-5\">. The taxpayers also cite Internal Revenue Service Technical Advice Memorandum 8314011 (Dec. 22, 1982), which holds that unamortized deferred development expenditures under \u00a7 616 of the Code are included in the basis of a mineral deposit for purposes of \u00a7 57(a)(8). As respondents acknowledge, the Code specifically provides that such memoranda \"may not be used or cited as precedent.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6110(j)(3) (1976 ed). In any case, \u00a7 616 sets up a system for the treatment of development expenditures entirely different from the system at issue here; in particular, \u00a7 616(c) specifically mandates that expenses deferred under \u00a7 616(b) \u201cshall be taken into account in computing the adjusted basis of the mine or deposit.\u201d Thus, Technical Advice Memorandum 8314011 simply is not relevant to the question presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
