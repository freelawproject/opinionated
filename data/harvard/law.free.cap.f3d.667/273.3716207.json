A panel of our Court held that the District Court\u2019s ruling was inconsistent with the predominance inquiry mandated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and remanded the matter for further proceedings. <em>See Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>613 F.3d 134 (3d Cir.2010), <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted and vacated by Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>619 F.3d 287 (3d Cir.2010). We then granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the prior order. Accordingly, we address anew the propriety of the District Court\u2019s certification of the direct and indirect purchaser classes pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), and also consider for the first time the objections raised to the fairness of the class settlement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">We believe that the predominance inquiry should be easily resolved here based on De Beers\u2019s conduct and the injury it caused to each and every class member, and that the straightforward application of Rule 23 and our precedent should result in affirming the District Court\u2019s order certifying the class. But the objectors to the class certification and our dissenting colleagues insist that, when deciding whether to certify a class, a district court must ensure that each class member possesses a viable claim or \u201csome colorable legal claim,\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 344). We disagree, and accordingly, we will reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>through our analysis in a more deliberate manner in order to explain why the addition of this new requirement into the Rule 23 certification process is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>I. Factual &amp; Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>A. Present Litigation &amp; Settlement Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The allegations in the present case arose from De Beers\u2019s undisputed position as the dominant participant in the wholesale market for gem-quality diamonds throughout much of the twentieth century.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is alleged that, beginning in 1890 and continuing through the filing of the Complaints at issue in this appeal, De Beers coordinated the worldwide sales of diamonds by, <em>inter alia, </em>executing output-purchase agreements with competitors, synchronizing and setting production limits, restricting the resale of diamonds within certain geographic regions, and directing marketing and advertising. Through its coordinated network of diamond producers, De Beers was able to value diamonds according to certain physical characteristics and to then control the quantity and prices of diamonds in the marketplace by strictly regimenting sales to preferred wholesalers, known as \u201csightholders.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sightholders resold these diamonds to jewelry manufacturers and retailers \u2014 either as rough diamonds or as cut, polished, and finished stones \u2014 and constituted De Beers\u2019s primary channel for distribution of its diamonds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Between 2001 and 2002, plaintiffs brought suit complaining that De Beers\u2019s aforementioned business practices contravened state and federal antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment laws, and constituted unfair business practices and false advertising under common law and relevant state statutes. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that De Beers exploited its market dominance to artificially inflate the prices of rough diamonds; this, in turn, caused reseller and consumer purchasers of diamonds and diamond-infused products to pay an unwarranted premium for such products. The initial two price-fixing lawsuits were filed in the United States District Courts for the District of New Jersey and the Southern District of New York in 2001, and five subsequent lawsuits were initiated in federal and state courts in other parts of the country.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Three of the lawsuits were filed in state court in Arizona, California, and Illinois, respectively; the last was then removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The five suits in federal court were subsequently all transferred to and consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and are presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The plaintiffs in the seven cases are best characterized as falling within one of two types of purchaser classes. The first category includes direct purchasers of gem diamonds, who purchased directly from De Beers or one of its competitors (\u201cDirect Purchaser Class\u201d or \u201cDirect Purchasers\u201d). These plaintiffs advanced claims of price-fixing and monopolization pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and sought monetary and injunctive relief under \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act. The second category of plaintiffs consists of indirect purchasers of rough or cut-and-polished diamonds; this category of consumers, jewelry retailers and other middlemen acquired diamonds from sightholders or other direct purchasers, rather than directly from De Beers or its competitors (\u201cIndirect Purchaser Class\u201d or \u201cIndirect Purchasers\u201d). While both categories of purchasers alleged the same antitrust injury and sought injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act, the Indirect Purchasers sought damages pursuant only to state antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment statutes and common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">As it had for well over a half-century, De Beers initially rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that courts in the United States possessed personal jurisdiction over it and its associated entities, arguing that it never transacted business directly in the United States. De Beers refused to appear in the lawsuits, resulting in defaults or default judgments being entered against it in each of the filed cases with the exception of <em>Cornwell. </em>While continuing to insist that these default judgments were unenforceable, counsel for De Beers ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>proached plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in May 2005 to discuss settlement of the Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claims. These discussions yielded an agreement to settle <em>Sullivan, Hopkins, Null, </em>and <em>Cornwell </em>(the \u201cIndirect Purchaser Settlement\u201d), with De Beers agreeing to establish a settlement fund of $250 million to be distributed to class members, and further agreeing not to contest certification of a settlement class of indirect purchasers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The settlement also provided for a stipulated injunction, enjoining De Beers from engaging in certain conduct violative of United States antitrust laws. Pursuant to the settlement, De Beers would consent to the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction for the limited purpose of fulfilling the terms of the settlement and enforcement of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The District Court entered an order on November 30, 2005, preliminarily approving the Indirect Purchaser Settlement and conditionally certifying a settlement class of Indirect Purchasers pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \u2014 for purposes of entering the stipulated injunction \u2014 and 23(b)(3) \u2014 in order to distribute the settlement fund to class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">De Beers then entered into settlement discussions with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for the Direct Purchasers in <em>Anco </em>and <em>British Diamond, </em>ultimately reaching an agreement in March 2006. The latter agreement paralleled the Indirect Purchaser Settlement in that De Beers agreed to not contest certification of a Direct Purchaser settlement class, to abide by substantively identical injunctive relief as imposed under the Indirect Purchaser Settlement, and to establish a $22.5 million fund to satisfy the Direct Purchasers\u2019 claims. As part of this settlement, De Beers also agreed to increase the Indirect Purchaser Settlement fund by $22.5 million to accommodate those putative class members characterized as Indirect Purchasers in the lawsuits filed by the Direct Purchasers who had not participated in the Indirect Purchaser Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">On March 31, 2006, the District Court modified its November 30, 2005 Order to conditionally certify both the Direct and Indirect Purchaser settlement classes under Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), and to preliminarily approve a combined settlement fund for both classes totaling $295 million, of which $22.5 million was allotted to Direct Purchasers and $272.5 million was allocated to the Indirect Purchaser claims. The combined settlement also provided for entry of a stipulated injunction, which required De Beers to, <em>inter alia, </em>comply with and abide by federal and state antitrust laws, to limit its purchases of diamonds from third-party producers, to abstain from setting or fixing the prices of diamonds sold by third-party producers, to desist from restricting the geographic regions within which sightholders could resell De Beers diamonds, and barred De Beers from purchasing diamonds in the United States for the principal purpose of restraining supply. Notably, De Beers agreed to subject itself to personal jurisdiction in the United States for purposes of enforcing the combined settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\n<em>B. Special Master &amp; Objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">After granting preliminary approval to the combined settlement agreement, the District Court referred the case to a Special Master pursuant to Rules 23, 53, and 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to consider and recommend a plan for dissemination of the Notice of Settlement, a distribution plan for members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Indirect and Direct Purchaser settlement classes, division of the fund between the Indirect Purchaser reseller and consumer subclasses, the amount of incentive awards for named plaintiffs, and the fee requests filed by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. After two years of proceedings, the Special Master authored several lengthy Report and Recommendations finding the settlement fair, reasonable, and adequate based upon the parties\u2019 agreement to seek the certification of the following two nationwide Settlement Classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">(i) <em>The \u201cDirect Purchaser Class.\u201d </em>All natural persons and legal entities located in the United States who purchased any Gem Diamond directly from a Defendant or Defendants\u2019 Competitors (including any entity controlled by or affiliated with any such party) from September 20, 1997 to the date of settlement class certification. The class shall exclude Defendants, the officers, directors or employees of any Defendant, any entity in which any Defendant has a controlling interest, any affiliate of any Defendant, Defendants\u2019 Competitors, any person or entity which is or was a Sightholder for the time period(s) during which such person or entity had Sightholder status, any federal, state or local governmental entity, and any judicial officer presiding over this Settlement, and any member of the judicial officer\u2019s family and court staff; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">(ii) <em>The \u201cIndirect Purchaser Class. </em>\u201d All natural persons and legal entities located in the United States who purchased any Diamond Product from January 1, 1994 to the date of settlement class certification, provided that any purchases of any Gem Diamond made directly from a Defendant (including any entity in which any Defendant has a controlling interest and any affiliate of any Defendant) or Defendants\u2019 competitors (including any entity controlled by or affiliated with any such party) shall be excluded. The class shall also exclude Defendants, the officers, directors or employees of any Defendant, any entity in which any Defendant has a controlling interest, any affiliate of any Defendant, any federal, state or local governmental entity, and any judicial officer presiding over this Settlement, and any member of the judicial officer\u2019s family and court staff</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEb\">(App\u2019x 270 (quoting September 4, 2007 Report and Recommendation of Special Master Alfred M. Wolin (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d) at 21, App\u2019x 1433-34).) The Indirect Purchaser Class was further subdivided into two subclasses for purposes of effectuating the Settlement Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">(1) The \u201cIndirect Purchaser Reseller Subclass,\u201d consisting of all members of the Indirect Purchaser Class who purchased any diamond product for resale; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">(2) The \u201cIndirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass,\u201d consisting of all members of the Indirect Purchaser Class who purchased any diamond product for use and not for resale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-12\"><em>(Id. </em>270-71.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">After reviewing the record, the competing econometric reports furnished by several experts, and other reliable data, the Special Master recommended that, apart from the $22.5 million allocated to the Direct Purchaser Class,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Indirect Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>chaser Settlement Fund of $272.5 million should be allocated 50.3%, approximately $137.1 million, to the Resellers Subclass, and 49.7%, approximately $135.4 million, to the Consumers Subclass.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (App\u2019x 1508.) Unlike Direct Purchasers, who purchased diamonds only, Indirect Purchasers generally purchased jewelry and other products containing diamonds; given this, the Special Master attempted to ascertain the cost of the diamonds in the final purchased product separate and apart from the cost of other components. The Special Master further recommended that claims that would result in <em>de minimis </em>recoveries from the settlement fund \u2014 equating to less than ten dollars<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 not be paid in light of high administrative costs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses, the Special Master recommended a percentage of recovery approach with a lodestar crosscheck, and concluded that the request for 25% of the settlement fund in fees, and for under 1% of the fund in expenses, was fair, reasonable, and adequate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Special Master further decided that the $220,000 in incentive awards sought on behalf of class representatives was appropriate in light of the benefits conferred upon the class and the risks incurred in engaging in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In response to the preliminary certification of the Settlement Agreement and the Special Master\u2019s recommendations, the District Court received twenty separate objections on behalf of thirty-seven objectors. All of the objectors were members of the Indirect Purchaser Class; none of the Direct Purchasers objected to the Set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tlement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Fifteen of the twenty objections opposed class certification of the settlement, four objected to the stipulated provision for injunctive relief, six opposed the allocation and distribution of the Settlement Funds, and nine objected to the provisions for attorneys\u2019 fees. As required by the Federal Rules, the District Court conducted a Fairness Hearing in the matter on April 14, 2008. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The objectors challenging the propriety of certifying the two settlement classes raised two primary arguments. First, the objectors contended that a nationwide class of Indirect Purchasers should not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) for purposes of administering a monetary settlement of state law claims because significant differences existed among the various antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment laws of the relevant state jurisdictions. Specifically, the objectors argued that the substantive law of many states prohibits indirect purchasers from recovering damages for antitrust injuries, exposing the class to particularized legal variations and precluding a finding that common questions of law or fact predominated over individual issues.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, the objectors challenged the certification of both Direct and Indirect Purchaser classes for purposes of implementing injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). The objectors asserted that the market for rough gem diamonds had become competitive during the course of the instant litigation, rendering an injunction to enforce compliance with antitrust laws superfluous, and divesting the Indirect Purchasers of antitrust standing to seek relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Other objections challenged the fairness and adequacy of the Settlement and the plan of allocation for the Indirect Purchaser Settlement Fund as between the Reseller and Consumer Subclasses, averring that each class member would collect only $1-2 in exchange for their full release of claims against De Beers if every single putative class member requested compensation; also, they might receive nothing under the <em>de minimis </em>provision in the Settlement. Objectors also urged that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was excessive and unreasonable in a default judgment case with minimal litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\n<em>C. Acceptance and Certification of Class Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In its May 22, 2008 Opinion, the District Court considered and rejected each of the objections. Responding to the Rule 23(b)(3) objections, the Court concluded that differences in state antitrust and consumer protection statutes did not override class commonalities. Observing that \u201c \u2018predominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or securities fraud or violations of the antitrust laws,\u2019 \u201d (App\u2019x 276 (quoting <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 625, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997))), the District Court noted that \u201cat the class certification stage, the Court need not concern itself with whether Plaintiffs can prove their allegations\u201d so long as they \u201c \u2018make a threshold showing that the elements of impact will predominantly involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>generalized issues of proof, rather than questions which are particular to each member of the plaintiff class,\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>277 (quoting <em>In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., </em>305 F.3d 145, 152 (3d Cir.2002)).) In this regard, the District Court presented the following operative factual and legal inquiries that, in its view, constituted common questions that predominated over individual issues in the litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">(a) Whether Defendants combined or conspired with others to fix, raise, stabilize and maintain the prices of polished diamonds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">(b) Whether Defendants monopolized or combined or conspired with others to monopolize the supply of polished diamonds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">(c) Whether Defendants\u2019 conduct caused the prices of polished diamonds to be maintained at higher levels than would exist in a competitive market;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">(d) Whether Plaintiffs and the Classes are entitled to injunctive relief; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">(e) Whether Defendants\u2019 conduct caused injury to the business or property of Plaintiffs and the other Class and Subclass Members and, if so, the appropriate class-wide measure of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">(App\u2019x 276 (alterations omitted).) The District Court also stressed that all class members shared a common jurisdictional question pertaining to De Beers\u2019s refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of United States courts and the potential burden of confirming domestic contacts for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction. <em>(Id. </em>279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Considering the nature of De Beers\u2019s central role in the alleged diamond conspiracy, the Court determined that each class member shared \u201ca similar legal question arising from whether De Beers engaged in a broad conspiracy\u201d aimed at affecting diamond prices in the United States; concurrently, all class members shared common factual issues pertaining to the form, duration, and extent of the conspiracy. (App\u2019x 278-79.) The Court concluded that the totality of common issues predominated over individual questions, and, as a result, the objectors\u2019 assertion that disparities in state law precluded a nationwide class settlement was unavailing. In its analysis, the Court emphasized the expense, complexity, and imprecision of weighing the relative strengths of different state law claims, the policy interest in securing an expedient resolution to the disparate claims of the Direct and Indirect Purchasers, and De Beers\u2019s insistence upon a release of all potential damage claims in all fifty states.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">With respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) analysis for injunctive relief, the District Court rejected the objectors\u2019 assertion that both of the purchaser classes faced no risk of future harm. The Court observed that De Beers had stipulated to the injunction and \u201cwaived the right to demand proof of substantive elements of the claims\u201d advanced by plaintiffs, namely, that De Beers\u2019s ongoing conduct would continue to anti-competitively increase the price of all diamonds on the market. (App\u2019x 285.) Accordingly, the Court determined that injunctive relief was appropriate and would benefit all classes and subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Having ruled that the Rule 23(b) elements were satisfied, the District Court then responded to the other objections relating to the fairness and adequacy of the Settlement and the plan of allocation and distribution, as well as to objections pertaining to attorneys\u2019 fees. The District Court conducted a fairness evaluation of the final settlement by applying and weighing the fairness factors set forth in <em>Girsh v. Jepson, </em>521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir.1975), \u201cbeing mindful of the heightened standard of review in place for a settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ment-only class that has not yet been entirely certified.\u201d (App\u2019x 288-89.) The Court concluded that the final settlement agreement and the plan of allocation were fair, reasonable, and adequate. The District Court also reviewed the attorneys\u2019 fees application pursuant to <em>Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., </em>223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir.2000), similarly finding the Special Master\u2019s recommendation for 25% of the settlement fund in fees to be fair, reasonable, and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Accordingly, the District Court entered a final order on May 22, 2008, certifying the Direct and Indirect Purchaser Classes under Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3). The Direct Purchaser Class consists of all sightholders who purchased rough gem diamonds directly from De Beers between September 20, 1997 and March 31, 2006. The Indirect Purchaser Class includes all Indirect Purchasers who acquired gem diamonds between January 1, 1994 and March 31, 2006, regardless of whether De Beers or one of its competitors supplied the diamonds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s order further included the previously agreed-upon injunction, which is to remain in effect for five years from the date of its issuance. The objectors then filed the appeals presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\n<em>D. Proceedings On Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">On appeal, a divided panel of this Court initially determined that the District Court abused its discretion in certifying the nationwide class of litigants. We vacated this Opinion and granted rehearing en banc. While we do not usually discuss the analysis contained in a vacated opinion, we do so here because the Panel\u2019s decision reflected, accepted, and elaborated upon one or more of the views advanced by the objectors, with which we take issue. Our dissenting colleagues also embrace certain of these views.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Addressing the objectors\u2019 challenge to the District Court\u2019s finding of predominance under Rule 23(b)(3), the Panel undertook a wide-ranging fact-finding review of state antitrust statutes, noting that the variance among states \u201cis mainly a function of whether a state has chosen to follow the Sherman Act principles regarding standing laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977).\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 146. There, the Supreme Court decided that only direct purchasers possessed standing under the federal Sherman Act to sue for monetary damages incurred from an antitrust injury. The Panel observed that some states follow this framework and prohibit monetary recovery for indirect purchasers, while other states have enacted statutes known as <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>repealers,\u201d which extend antitrust standing to indirect purchasers and consumers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>As a result, the Panel found that \u201conly some of th[e] jurisdictions recognize the claims for which recovery is sought,\u201d and that such distinctions reflected \u201cfundamental policy differences among the several states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 149. Based on its belief that many members of the Indirect Purchaser Class lacked a substantive right to recover damages, the Panel decided that \u201cno question of law or fact regarding their legal rights is uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>throughout the class,\u201d thereby defeating a finding of predominance. <em>Id. </em>at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The Panel then considered the various state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims implicated by the District Court\u2019s certification, again noting several variations among jurisdictions: differences in whether indirect purchasers may invoke consumer protection and unjust enrichment statutes to gain antitrust relief; variations in the extent of elements of proof necessary to establish unjust enrichment or consumer fraud; and dissimilarities in whether a plaintiff must lack an adequate remedy at law to bring an equitable claim. <em>Id. </em>at 150-51. Based upon these discrepancies, the Panel decided that \u201cevidence of price-fixing and monopolization does not give rise in every state to an unjust enrichment or consumer protection claim for indirect purchasers,\u201d defeating predominance and rendering the District Court\u2019s certification of a nationwide class an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The Panel further observed that the District Court\u2019s certification order contravened the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b), by extending antitrust remedies not rooted in state substantive law to putative class members. <em>Id. </em>The Panel expressly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that De Beers\u2019s willingness to stipulate to liability in all fifty states should suffice for the District Court\u2019s predominance inquiry, holding instead that such an approach would invite collusive settlements. <em>Id. </em>In the same vein, the Panel expressed concern that the District Court sacrificed principles of federalism in favor of obtaining an expedient settlement by certifying the nationwide class \u201cdespite the fact that only some of those jurisdictions recognize the claims for which recovery is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152. Finding that certain states categorically deny to indirect purchasers a right to antitrust recovery as a matter of substantive law, the Panel concluded that the instant certification \u201cwrongly allowed the sovereignty of the states to be subordinated to De Beers\u2019s desire to resolve all indirect purchaser claims simultaneously.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Finally, the Panel rejected the District Court\u2019s certification of the Indirect Purchaser Class under Rule 23(b)(2) for the purpose of awarding injunctive relief under \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26. Relying upon expert reports written to identify a methodology for calculating damages, the Panel concluded that De Beers\u2019s market share fell from approximately 65% in 2000 to 45% in 2006, and determined that, as a result, plaintiffs face \u201cno significant threat of future antitrust harm in the absence of the injunction because ... the market has become increasingly competitive from 2006 onward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157-58. Accordingly, the Panel found that plaintiffs lacked antitrust standing under \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act and vacated the District Court\u2019s order certifying the injunctive class.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The Panel Opinion remanded the matter to the District Court to consider whether \u201ca more limited class of indirect purchasers is appropriate under Rule 23,\u201d and instructed the District Court to more precisely identify \u201ca readily discernible, clear, and complete list of the claims, issues or defenses to be treated on a class basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(2)). The Panel noted that the Court failed to clearly delineate the precise state law claims subject to class treatment and did not explicitly state whether the claims advanced apply to the Indirect Purchasers\u2019 antitrust, consumer protection, or unjust enrichment claims, or to some combination of the three. Accordingly, the Panel directed the District Court to \u201cidentify with particularity both the prerequisites for membership in the class and the issues or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>claims that will be resolved on a class-wide basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In response, Appellees Shawn Sullivan, Arrigotti Fine Jewelry, and James Walnum petitioned for rehearing, urging that the Panel Opinion was inconsistent with our precedent governing class action settlements. In support, they raised several arguments. First, they contended that the Panel\u2019s demand that all class members assert at least one \u201cuniform\u201d claim in order for disparate state claims to be settled at once contravened our clear holdings in <em>Warfarin </em>and <em>Prudential. (See </em>Pet. of Appellees for Reh\u2019g or Reh\u2019g En Banc 2.) Next, they urged that the Panel\u2019s extensive inquiry into the legal viability of plaintiffs claims at the class certification stage improperly adjudicated the merits of the asserted claims and undermined the \u201cstrong judicial policy in favor of class action settlement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citation omitted).) Finally, the Appellees observed that the Panel\u2019s methodology supplanted the District Court as primary fact-finder and unilaterally reached factual conclusions based upon evidence unrelated to the subject at issue. <em>(Id. </em>3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We granted the petition for the entire Court to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>II. Jurisdiction And Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The District Court exercised federal question jurisdiction over the Direct Purchasers\u2019 Sherman Act antitrust claim for damages pursuant to \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, and over both the Direct and Indirect Purchasers\u2019 claims for injunctive relief under \u00a7 16 of the same Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26. Original jurisdiction over the federal claims also arose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337(a). The District Court possessed supplemental jurisdiction over the Indirect Purchasers\u2019 state-law antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We review final orders of the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">\u201cOur role as an appellate court is to ascertain whether or not the trial judge clearly abused his or her discretion in approving or rejecting a settlement agreement.\u201d <em>Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, </em>609 F.3d 590, 593 (3d Cir.2010). A district court abuses its discretion if its \u201c \u2018decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., </em>552 F.3d 305, 312 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>In re Gen. Motors Corp. Piclc-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>55 F.3d 768, 783 (3d Cir.1995) <em>(\u201cGM Truck\u201d)). </em>\u201cIf the court\u2019s analysis on these points is correct, [however,] then \u2018it is fair to say that we will ordinarily defer to its exercise of discretion\u2019 embodied in the findings on predominance and superiority.\u201d <em>Linerboard, </em>305 F.3d at 149-50 (quoting <em>Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>561 F.2d 434, 448 (3d Cir.1977)); <em>see also United Steel, Paper &amp; Forestry, Rubber, Mfg. Energy, Allied Indus. &amp; Serv. Workers Int\u2019l Union v. ConocoPhillips Co., </em>593 F.3d 802, 807 (9th Cir.2010) (\u2018We review ... the underlying determination whether the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) has been satisfied for abuse of discretion.\u201d) (citation omitted). \u201cWhether an incorrect legal standard has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The District Court\u2019s \u201cdetermination that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate\u201d is likewise reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Cendant Corp. Litig., </em>264 F.3d 201, 231 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">\n<em>III. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">At issue on appeal is the District Court\u2019s approval of the class settlement agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>and certification of the Indirect Purchaser Class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) and both the Direct and Indirect Purchaser Classes under Rule 23(b)(2). We begin by discussing the standards for certifying a settlement class and will address the pertinent objections in light of the District Court\u2019s\u2014 and the vacated Panel\u2019s \u2014 Opinions. We will then consider the objections pertaining to the fairness of the settlement, the plan of allocation, and the attorneys\u2019 fees award, which we have not previously addressed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\n<em>A. Certification Pursuant to Rule 23</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">As we have consistently observed, \u201cRule 23 is designed to assure that courts will identify the common interests of class members and evaluate the named plaintiffs\u2019 and counsel\u2019s ability to fairly and adequately protect class interests.\u201d <em>In re Comm. Bank of N. Va., </em>622 F.3d 275, 291 (3d Cir.2010) <em>(\u201cComm. Bank II </em>\u201d) (quoting <em>GM Truck, </em>55 F.3d at 799) (alterations omitted). In turn, before approving a class settlement agreement, \u201ca district court first must determine that the requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a) and (b) are met.\u201d <em>In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>629 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir.2010). Rule 23(a) contains four threshold requirements, which every putative class must satisfy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); <em>see also Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231. Upon finding each of these prerequisites satisfied, a district court must then determine that the proposed class fits within one of the categories of class actions enumerated in Rule 23(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">As mentioned, Rule 23(b)(2) authorizes class actions seeking injunctive relief in instances where the defendant \u201chas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief ... is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2); <em>see In re Comm. Bank of N. Va. (Comm. Bank I), </em>418 F.3d 277, 302 n. 14 (2005). Separately, certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) seeking monetary compensation is permitted where (1) \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,\u201d and (2) \u201ca class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3); <em>see Collins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>34 F.3d 172, 180 (3d Cir.1994). These twin requirements are commonly referred to as predominance and superiority. We address the certification of the damages class first before turning to the certification for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\n<em>1. Predominance of Common Legal or Factual Issues Under Rule 23(b)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">The objectors challenge the District Court\u2019s Rule 23(b)(3) analysis with regard to the state law claims asserted by the Indirect Purchasers against De Beers. The District Court concluded that differences in state law did not override predominantly common factual and legal is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>sues presented by De Beers\u2019s integral role in perpetuating the alleged conspiracy. Rejecting this view, the objectors argue that the existence of substantive variations in the state antitrust laws underlying the Indirect Purchaser damages claims should preclude a court from finding that common issues affecting the class as a whole predominate. They also urge that differences among state consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws would likewise preclude a finding of predominance. Our dissenting colleagues focus on this issue as well, and adopt a specific requirement that every class member has \u201csome colorable legal claim\u201d in order for a district court to certify a class. (Dissenting Op. at 344.) In our view, this requirement would result in a radical departure from what Rule 23 envisions and what our precedent demands, and it founders for many reasons.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>a. Legal Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The predominance inquiry \u201c \u2018tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Ins. Broker. Antitrust Litig., </em>579 F.3d 241, 266 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 624, 117 S.Ct. 2231), and assesses whether a class action \u201cwould achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1966 amendment. <em>See also </em>2 William Rubenstein, Alba Conte &amp; Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions, \u00a7 4:25 (4th ed. 2010) (\u201c[T]he predominance test asks whether a class suit for the unitary adjudication of common issues is economical and efficient in the context of all the issues in the suit.\u201d). Parallel with Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s commonality element, which provides that a proposed class must share a common question of law or fact, Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement imposes a more rigorous obligation upon a reviewing court to ensure that issues common to the class predominate over those affecting only individual class members. <em>Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 266. \u201cHence, we consider the Rule 23(a) commonality requirement to be incorporated into the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement, and therefore deem it appropriate to \u2018analyze the two factors together, with particular focus on the predominance requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>391 F.3d 516, 528 (3d Cir.2004)); <em>see also Danvers Motor Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>543 F.3d 141, 148 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he commonality requirement is subsumed by the predominance requirement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">From our case law, we can distill at least three guideposts that direct the predominance inquiry: first, that commonality is informed by the defendant\u2019s conduct as to all class members and any resulting injuries common to all class members; second, that variations in state law do not necessarily defeat predominance; and third, that concerns regarding variations in state law largely dissipate when a court is considering the certification of a settlement class. We address each of these guideposts in turn. Then, we turn to case law demonstrating that Rule 23(b)(3) does not, as urged by the objectors and the dissent, require individual class members to individually state a valid claim for relief. Next, we address the flaws inherent in the framework proposed by the dissent. Finally, we discuss why an important byproduct of the class action device \u2014 settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ment of all potential claims \u2014 supports the decision we reach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\n<em>i) Precedent Regarding Predominance: Defendant\u2019s Conduct and Class Members\u2019 Injuries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Our precedent provides that the focus of the predominance inquiry is on whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was common as to all of the class members, and whether all of the class members were harmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct. Our reasoning in <em>Warfarin </em>is instructive on this point. The claims asserted there were remarkably similar to the specific claims at issue here. There, we considered the propriety of the certification of a settlement class arising out of DuPont Pharmaceuticals\u2019 alleged dissemination of misleading information about a competitor\u2019s product. 391 F.3d at 522. The plaintiffs averred that DuPont engaged in anticompetitive conduct that allowed it to maintain a 67% market share and to charge supracompetitive prices, in violation of federal antitrust law, the antitrust statutes of <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer states,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the consumer protection and deceptive practices statutes of all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and the common law prohibitions on unjust enrichment and tortious interference of every jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 523-25. After reaching a class settlement with the defendant and receiving the district court\u2019s preliminary approval, objections were lodged contesting the certification of a single nationwide class of plaintiffs. The objectors argued that such certification was inappropriate due to inconsistencies in state antitrust and consumer fraud statutes\u2019 provision of statutory standing to assert antitrust claims and eligibility for treble or punitive damages recovery, and the relative weakness of certain consumer claims. <em>Id. </em>at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[predominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging eonsumer[] fraud or violations of the antitrust laws,\u201d we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">This case falls squarely into that category: plaintiffs have alleged that DuPont engaged in a broad-based campaign, in violation of federal and state consumer fraud and antitrust laws, to deceive consumers, TPPs, health care professionals, and regulatory bodies into believing that generic warfarin sodium was not an equivalent alternative to Coumadin. These allegations naturally raise several questions of law and fact common to the entire class and which predominate over any issues related to individual class members, including the unlawfulness of DuPont\u2019s conduct under federal antitrust laws as well as state law, the causal linkage between DuPont\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered by the class members, and the nature of the relief to which class members are entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 528. In light of DuPont\u2019s allegedly deceptive \u201cbroad-based, national campaign conducted by and directed from corporate headquarters,\u201d we emphasized that proof of liability of DuPont\u2019s conduct \u201cdepends on evidence which is common to the class members\u201d because \u201cliability depends on the conduct of DuPont, and whether it conducted a nationwide campaign of misrepresentation and deception, [and] does not depend on the conduct of individual class members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling that class members shared predominantly common issues as to the conduct of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>dants despite possessing claims arising under differing state laws. <em>Id. </em>at 530.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We applied a similar approach in <em>Insurance Brokerage, </em>where, in evaluating a challenge to certification of a settlement class on the basis of predominance, we determined that the elements of a Sherman Act violation for concerted anticompetitive activity focused upon \u201cthe conduct of the defendants.\u201d 579 F.3d at 268. Noting the presence of several shared questions of law and fact \u2014 including, among others, whether the defendants conspired to allocate a particular market, whether the conduct actually reduced competition in the market by consolidating the industry, and whether the conspiratorial conduct raised premiums for all members of the class \u2014 we concluded that \u201ccommon questions abound with respect to whether the defendants engaged in illegal, concerted action.\u201d 579 F.3d at 268. As a result, we held that \u201cindividual issues d[id] not overwhelm the common ones.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see also Linerboard, </em>305 F.3d at 162 (\u201c[C]ommon issues [] predominate here because the inquiry necessarily focuses on defendants\u2019 conduct, that is, what defendants did rather than what plaintiffs did.\u201d) (citation &amp; quotations omitted); <em>cf. In re LifeUSA Holding Inc., </em>242 F.3d 136, 145-46 (3d Cir.2001) (reversing certification of litigation class where plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose \u201cnot out of one single event or misrepresentation,\u201d but out of \u201cnon-standardized and individualized sales \u2018pitches\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In this regard, we note the dissent\u2019s misreading of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011) as supporting its thesis that an inquiry into the existence or validity of each class member\u2019s claim is required at the class certification stage. To the contrary, <em>Dukes </em>actually bolsters our position, making clear that the focus is on whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was common as to all of the class members, not on whether each plaintiff has a \u201ccolorable\u201d claim. In <em>Dukes, </em>the Court held that commonality and predominance are defeated when it cannot be said that there was a common course of conduct in which the defendant engaged with respect to each individual. But commonality is satisfied where common questions generate common answers \u201capt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2551. That is exactly what is presented here, for the answers to questions about De Beers\u2019s alleged misconduct and the harm it caused would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>common as to all of the class members, and would thus inform the resolution of the litigation if it were not being settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Specifically, here, plaintiffs allege that De Beers engaged in anticompetitive activity by exploiting its 65% share of the diamond market and control of the world\u2019s supply of rough diamonds to impose rigid constraints on the sale and resale of those diamonds. This conduct resulted in a common injury as to all class members \u2014 inflated diamond prices \u2014 in violation of federal antitrust law, and the antitrust, consumer protection, or unjust enrichment laws of every state and the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In this respect, as in <em>Warfarin </em>and <em>Insurance Brokerage, </em>De Beers\u2019s asserted price-fixing and monopolization conduct lies at the core of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, as do the common injuries which all class members suffered as a result. Based upon our case law, we can distill that \u201ceach class member shares a similar <em>legal </em>question arising from whether De Beers engaged in a broad conspiracy that was aimed to and did affect diamond prices in the United States.\u201d (App\u2019x 278-79 (emphasis added).) Evidence for this legal question would entail generalized common proof as to \u201cthe implementation of De Beers\u2019[s] conspiracy, the form of the conspiracy, and the duration and extent of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>278.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The plaintiffs likewise share common <em>factual </em>questions as to whether De Beers \u201cacted in concert to artificially fix, maintain, and stabilize prices and to monopolize trade and commerce in the market for polished diamonds,\u201d and whether said activity resulted \u201cin an inflation in the prices of diamonds sold to consumers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>278-79.) These allegations are unaffected by the particularized conduct of individual class members, as proof of liability and liability itself would depend entirely upon De Beers\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities. Indeed, the presence of these questions stemming solely from De Beers\u2019s asserted behavior and the fact that all class members purchased diamonds is an apt illustration of why the predominance test is \u201creadily met in certain cases alleging consumer [ ] fraud or violations of the antitrust laws.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Ins.

Considering this presentation of common issues, a finding that common inquiries predominated over individual questions particular to any putative class member appears reasonably within the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The dissent urges that according to our view, the class is \u201cpractically limitless.\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 344.) This is plainly incorrect: the limits are found in the conduct of the defendant and the injuries sustained by class members as a result of the conduct. These provide sufficient class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>contours. The instant class is not made up of \u201ceveryone on earth,\u201d \u201cregardless of diamond purchases.\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 343 n. 5.) Instead, each member is a Direct or Indirect Purchaser, harmed by what De Beers did. These class members, moreover, possess a legally cognizable injury acknowledged in hornbook law, as their injuries are real, and stem not from simply feeling \u201cwronged,\u201d as the dissent suggests (Dissenting Op. at 343), but from De Beers\u2019s alleged anti-competitive conduct, conduct which antitrust laws forbid.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>ii) Precedent Regarding Variations in State Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Furthermore, our precedent provides that \u201cvariations in the rights and remedies available to injured class members under the various laws of the fifty states [do] not defeat commonality and predominance.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 529 (quoting <em>In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, </em>148 F.3d 283, 315 (3d Cir.1998)). This is so because \u201c \u2018a finding of commonality does not require that all class members share identical claims,\u2019 \u201d and predominance is not considered deficient merely \u201cbecause claims were subject to the [varying] laws of fifty states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Predominance under Rule 23(b)(3) cannot be reduced to a mechanical, single-issue test\u2019 rather, \u201c \u2018[a]s long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together, variations in the sources and application\u2019 \u201d of applicable laws will not foreclose class certification. <em>Linerboard, </em>305 F.3d at 162-63 (quoting with approval <em>Waste Mgmt.

Thus, it is not surprising that we can find no support in our Court\u2019s jurisprudence for the proposition that commonality and predominance are defeated merely because available rights and remedies differ under the several laws that form the basis for the class claims.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">We have never required the presentation of identical or uniform issues or claims as a prerequisite to certification of a class. Rather, our jurisprudence evinces a pragmatic response to certifications of common claims arising under varying state laws. In <em>Prudential, </em>we addressed the certification of a settlement class arising under federal securities law and varying state law formulations of common law fraud, breach of contract, bad faith, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, unjust enrichment, and breach of state consumer fraud statutes. 148 F.3d at 315. We emphasized our willingness to certify nationwide classes where differences in state law fell \u201cinto a limited number of predictable patterns,\u201d and any deviations \u201ccould be overcome at trial by grouping similar state laws together and applying them as a unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to subsume the rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tively minor differences in state law within a single class. <em>Id,; see also Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 271 (noting that \u201csubclasses are appropriate \u2018where a class is found to include subclasses divergent in interest\u2019 \u201d) (citation <em>&amp; </em>alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Similarly, in <em>GM Truck, </em>we approved the certification of nationwide (b)(3) litigation classes where \u201cthe laws of the 50 states could be reduced to [several] general patterns, providing the framework for sub-classes if the nationwide action had proven unmanageable.\u201d 55 F.3d at 817-18 (discussing <em>In re School Asbestos Litig., </em>789 F.2d 996, 1010 (3d Cir.1986)). Observing that \u201cwe [could not] conceive that each of the forty-nine states [] represented here has a truly unique statutory scheme,\u201d we determined that a nationwide class \u201ccould have been properly certified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This alternative to outright rejection of certification of a nationwide class was deemed to be especially fitting because it could \u201csurmountn some of the individual issues while retaining some of the substantive advantages of the class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Echoing this approach, our fellow Courts of Appeals have agreed that, for purposes of litigation classes, \u201cif the applicable state laws can be sorted into a small number of groups, each containing materially identical legal standards,\u201d then certification of subgroups \u201cembracing each of the dominant legal standards can be appropriate.\u201d <em>Klay v. Humana, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1241, 1262 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Walsh v. Ford Motor Co., </em>807 F.2d 1000, 1017 (D.C.Cir.1986) (R.B. Ginsburg, J.) (holding that class certification is appropriate where state law variations can be grouped by similar legal doctrines).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Where \u201ca sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together,\u201d <em>Linerboard, </em>305 F.3d at 162-63, differences in state law treatment of indirect purchaser claims likely fall into a handful of clearly discernible statutory schemes. Nothing in our case law or the language of Rule 23 commands that everyone in a class must allege precisely identical or \u201cuniform\u201d causes of action, <em>see Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 149, and statutory variations do not defeat predominance in the presence of other exceedingly common issues.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Instead, as <em>Prudential </em>and <em>GM Truck </em>explain, where a defendant\u2019s singular conduct gives rise to one cause of action in one state, while providing for a different cause of action in another jurisdiction, the courts may group both claims in a single class action. This tactic in litigation advances the laudatory purposes of the class action device, \u201cpreserving] the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting issues affecting all class members to be litigated in an efficient, expedited, and manageable fashion.\u201d <em>Allison v.

The correct outcome is even clearer for certification of a settlement class because the concern for manageability that is a central tenet in the certification of a litigation class is removed from the equation. Indeed, the class set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tlement posture of this case largely marginalizes the objectors\u2019 concern that state law variations undermine a finding of predominance.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In <em>Warfarin, </em>we rejected an objection essentially indistinguishable from the one advanced here, namely, that \u201cvariations in and inconsistencies between the state consumer fraud and antitrust laws of the fifty states defeat the commonality and predominance requirements of Rule 28.\u201d 391 F.3d at 529. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance that a district court \u201c[cjonfronted with a request for settlement-only class certification\u201d need not inquire whether the case \u201cwould present intractable management problems,\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231, in <em>Warfarin, </em>we delineated a \u201ckey\u201d distinction between certification of a class for settlement versus certification for purposes of litigation, 391 F.3d at 529. Specifically, we observed that, in the settlement context, variations in state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws did not present \u201cthe types of insuperable obstacles\u201d that could render class litigation unmanageable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 315). We emphasized, as a result, that \u201cvariations [in state laws] are irrelevant to certification of a settlement class\u201d since a settlement would eliminate the principal burden of establishing the elements of liability under disparate laws. <em>Id.; see, e.g., Davis v. J.P Morgan Chase &amp; Co., </em>775 F.Supp.2d 601, 609 (W.D.N.Y.2011) (\u201c[S]tate-law distinctions impact trial manageability, which is relevant principally with respect to litigation at trial.\u201d) (citing <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 529-30); <em>In re Lupron Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig., </em>228 F.R.D. 75, 92 (D.Mass.2005) (finding that \u201cdifferences in the state consumer protection laws\u201d implicate manageability concerns and do not pose an obstacle to certification of a settlement class).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Hence, our consideration of varying laws in the context of predominance has primarily focused on manageability of a litigation class. This is a particularly important point, as the objectors seem to conflate the predicate predominance analysis for certification of a settlement class with that required for certification of a litigation class, relying exclusively upon cases implicating the manageability obstacles inherent in class litigation. <em>See, e.g., Sacred Heart Health Sys., Inc. v. Humana Mil. Healthcare Servs., Inc., </em>601 F.3d 1159, 1180 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Cole v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>484 F.3d 717, 724 (5th Cir.2007). The Panel likewise referenced authority that focused on the manageability issues pertinent to certification of litigation classes in rejecting the settlement class certification. <em>See Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 151 (quoting <em>Clay v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>188 F.R.D. 483, 501 (S.D.Ill.1999) (discussing \u201cunmanageable\u201d nature of varying state unjust enrichment laws)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Because we are presented with a settlement class certification, \u201cwe are not as concerned with formulating some prediction as to how [variances in state law] would play out at trial, for the proposal is that there be no trial.\u201d <em>Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 269 (internal citations &amp; quotations omitted). As such, we simply need not inquire whether the varying state treat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>merits of indirect purchaser damage claims at issue would present the type of \u201cinsuperable obstacles\u201d or \u201cintractable management problems\u201d pertinent to certification of a litigation class.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Comm.

Accordingly, while we are cognizant of our responsibility to \u201cprotect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions,\u201d <em>Comm. Bank II, </em>622 F.3d at 291, state law variations are largely \u201cirrelevant to certification of a settlement class,\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 529.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>iv) Rule 23(b)(3) and our Precedent do not Require that Individual Class Members State a Valid Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">At bottom, we can find no persuasive authority for deeming the certification of a class for settlement purposes improper based on differences in state law. The objectors and our dissenting colleagues nevertheless insist that, despite the prevalence of the shared issues of fact and law stemming from the defendant\u2019s conduct common as to all class members and each class member\u2019s resulting injury, states\u2019 inconsistent treatment of indirect purchaser damages claims overwhelms the commonalities. They advocate this because approximately twenty-five states have not extended antitrust standing to indirect purchasers through <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>statutes or judicial edict; likewise, some uncertain number of states do not permit an end-run around antitrust standing through claims based on consumer protection and/or unjust enrichment statutes. <em>(See </em>Quinn Supp. Br. on Reh\u2019g En Banc 21-22.) It follows then, they argue, that a large proportion of the Indirect Purchaser Class lacks any valid claims under applicable state substantive law, and, therefore, cannot \u201cpredominantly\u201d share common issues of law or fact with those Indirect Purchasers actually possessing valid claims.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In turn, they insist that a district court must undertake a thorough review of applicable substantive law to assure itself that each class member has \u201cat least some colorable legal claim\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 344) or \u201chas a valid claim\u201d (Quinn Supp. Br. at 16) before certifying a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">But this focus is misdirected. The question is not what valid claims can plaintiffs assert; rather, it is simply whether common issues of fact or law predominate. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). Contrary to what the dissent and objectors principally contend, there is no \u201cclaims\u201d or \u201cmerits\u201d litmus test incorporated into the predominance inquiry beyond what is necessary to determine preliminarily whether certain elements will necessitate individual or common proof. Such a view misreads Rule 23 and our jurisprudence as to the inquiry a district court must conduct at the class certification stage. An analysis into the legal viability of asserted claims is properly considered through a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) or summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, not as part of a Rule 23 certification process. <em>See Comm. Bank II, </em>622 F.3d at 303 (\u201c[T]he Rule 23 requirements \u2018differ in kind from legal rulings under Rule 12(b)(6).\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc., </em>249 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">To adopt the position of the dissent and the objectors is to introduce a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry as to every claim in the class before a class may be certified. But Rule 23 makes clear that a district court has limited authority to examine the merits when conducting the certification inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">Although an evaluation of the probable outcome on the merits is not properly part of the certification decision, discovery in aid of the certification decision often includes information required to identify the nature of the issues that actually will be presented at trial. In this sense it is appropriate to conduct controlled discovery into the \u201cmerits,\u201d <em>limited to those aspects relevant to making the certification decision on an informed basis.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">2003 Amendments to Rule 23 (emphasis added); <em>see also Hassine v. Jeffes, </em>846 F.2d 169, 178 (3d Cir.1988) (\u201cThe ability of a named plaintiff to succeed on his or her individual claims has never been a prerequisite to certification of the class.\u201d). A court may inquire whether the elements of asserted claims are capable of proof through common evidence, but lacks authority to adjudge the legal validity or soundness of the substantive elements of asserted claims. Put another way, a district court may inquire into the merits of the claims presented in order to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met, but not in order to determine whether the individual elements of each claim are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Citing our holdings in <em>Hydrogen Peroxide </em>and <em>Newton v. Merrill Lynch, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 259 </em>F.3d 154 (3d Cir.2001), the objectors argue that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to establish as part of the certification process that each class member possessed a valid claim under the applicable substantive laws.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Quinn Br. at 17.) But these cases do not stand for this proposition. We explained in <em>Hydrogen Peroxide </em>that an examination of the elements of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is sometimes necessary, not in order to determine whether each class member states a valid claim, but instead to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 \u2014 namely, that the elements of the claim can be proved \u201cthrough evidence common to the class rather than individual to its members\u201d \u2014 are met. 552 F.3d at 311-12. In <em>Newton, </em>we similarly stated that a court may \u201cdelve beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements for class certification are satisfied,\u201d and held that a court\u2019s rigorous certification analysis may include a \u201cpreliminary inquiry into the merits.\u201d 259 F.3d at 167 (citations <em>&amp; </em>quotations omitted). But we did not state that an inquiry into the merits was necessary in order to prove that each class member has state a valid claim as a prerequisite to class certification. Rather, the Rules and our case law have consistently made clear that plaintiffs need not actually establish the validity of claims at the certification stage.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Moreover, the merits inquiry is particularly unwarranted in the settlement context since a district court need not \u201cenvision the form that a trial\u201d would take, <em>Newton, </em>259 F.3d at 167, nor consider \u201cthe available evidence and the method or methods by which plaintiffs propose to use the evidence to prove\u201d the disputed element at trial, <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 312. In fact, the absence of evidentiary and trial manageability concerns that initially motivated our instruction to conduct a preliminary merits inquiry in the predominance context reinforces the \u201ckey\u201d distinction between certification of a litigation and settlement class. <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 529. As such, the objectors\u2019 focus on the legal strengths and weaknesses of class members\u2019 claims misconstrues the requirements of Rule 23.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See Newton, </em>259 F.3d at 167-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Even still, the objectors and the dissent urge that the absence of one particular element for some class members \u2014 statutory standing \u2014 means that these members cannot state a valid claim, and therefore, the class cannot be certified. While it may be correct that states abiding by <em>Illinois Brick </em>require a plaintiff to be a direct purchaser as one element of an antitrust or consumer protection claim, the possibility that some of the Indirect Purchasers in the instant class might be unable to establish this element at trial is beside the point. This element, often confusingly denoted as a statutory standing requirement, is not jurisdictional.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Statutory standing is distinct from jurisdictional standing in that \u201cArticle III standing is required to establish a justiciable case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,\u201d whereas \u201clack of antitrust standing affects a plaintiffs ability to recover, but does not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Gerlinger v. Amazon.com Inc., </em>526 F.3d 1253, 1256 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted); <em>see e.g., Lemer v.

Accordingly, statutory standing is simply another element of proof for an antitrust claim, rather than a predicate for asserting a claim in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Here, the supposed lack of one element necessary to prove a violation on the merits \u2014 statutory standing \u2014 does not establish a concomitant absence of other predominantly common issues. <em>See Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 315 (affirming a district court\u2019s certification of a settlement class despite the fact that some objectors challenged the settlement on the grounds that some plaintiffs could not establish reliance \u2014 a necessary element of their state-law fraud claims). This is especially true in the settlement context where no proof on the merits need be adduced. <em>See Linerboard, </em>305 F.3d at 162-63 (\u201c \u2018[T]he mere fact that such concerns [of individualized factual and legal determinations] may arise and may affect different class members differently does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Mowbray, </em>208 F.3d at 296). Common questions as to the nature of De Beers\u2019s \u201cconduct under federal antitrust laws as well as state law\u201d and \u201cthe causal linkage between [De Beers\u2019s] conduct and the injury suffered by the class members\u201d may still be found to predominate. <em>See Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 528; <em>see also Pet Food, </em>629 F.3d at 342 (\u201c[T]he predominance requirement was satisfied because the same set of core operative facts and theory of proximate cause apply to each member of the class.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\n<em>v) The Dissent\u2019s Proposed Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The dissent\u2019s proposed framework mistakenly places the cart before the horse by requiring the District Court to establish the validity of the disputed elements of the asserted claims \u2014 namely, the viability of indirect purchaser actions under state substantive laws \u2014 prior to certifying the class. Under this approach, the dissent seems to require that class members show that they can state a valid claim for relief. But the Rule 23 inquiry does not, and should not, involve a Rule (12)(b)(6) inquiry.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Were we to require district courts to ensure that \u201ceach member of a settlement class has a valid claim\u201d in order to establish predominance, (Quinn Supp. Br. at 16), or that each class member has a \u201ccolorable legal claim,\u201d district courts would be obligated at the class certification stage to, <em>sua sponte, </em>conduct a thorough Rule 12(b)(6) analysis of every statutory and common-law claim to ensure that each plaintiff \u2014 including absent class members \u2014 possesses a valid cause of action or a \u201ccolorable claim\u201d under the applicable federal or state substantive law. Such an inquiry into the merits goes beyond the requirements of Rule 23, for Rule 23 does not require a district court to determine whether class members individually have a colorable claim \u2014 one that \u201cappear[s] to be true, valid, or right.\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 344 n. 8.) In addition to exceeding the plain requirements of Rule 23, in nationwide class settlements, such as the one here, and even if limited to a statutory standing inquiry, this analysis would necessitate an intensive, fifty-state cataloguing of differences in state law at an early stage of the proceedings, and without the benefit of a developed record.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Despite the dissent\u2019s view, Rule 23 does not require such an intensive cataloguing of each class member\u2019s claim in order to establish predominance. Even more troublesome, this mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>its analysis might not actually answer the salient question of whether common issues of fact or law actually predominate over individual ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Moreover, district' courts undertaking the scrupulous review of state laws could not ensure the validity of each individual claim without first settling upon the precise state law governing each of the putative class members\u2019 claims. This choice-of-law analysis would be particularly difficult in a nationwide class action where an array of factors beyond the residence of the class members must be considered, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the location of the parties and the purchased items, and the place of contracting and performance. <em>See generally Berg Chilling Sys., Inc. v. Hull Corp., </em>435 F.3d 455, 467 (3d Cir.2006). The Seventh Circuit rightly noted that \u201cchoice-of-law issues in nationwide class actions are rarely so uncomplicated that one can delineate clear winning and losing arguments at an early stage in the litigation\u201d; \u201cthe legal uncertainty resulting from the complicated choice-of-law issues\u201d would unduly complicate the process for establishing predominance under Rule 23. <em>Mirfasihi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp., </em>450 F.3d 745, 750 (7th Cir.2006). As a result, many courts find it \u201cinappropriate to decide choice of law issues incident to a motion for class certification.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Kirschner Med,. Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>139 F.R.D. 74, 84 (D.Md.1991); <em>Singer v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>185 F.R.D. 681, 691 (SD.Fla. 1998) (\u201cIt is well-established that consideration of choice of law issues at the class certification stage is generally premature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Even were a district court to properly ascertain the applicable law after conducting the choice-of-law inquiry, it would likely encounter unsettled legal questions, further undermining its ability to assess the viability of some class members\u2019 claims and increasing the costs of administration. By way of example, in <em>Warfarin, </em>we remarked on the \u201cunsettled question of law as to whether Tennessee\u2019s antitrust statutes ... cover only violations occurring in intrastate commerce or extend to cover violations occurring in interstate commerce as well.\u201d 391 F.3d at 530 n. 12. Relegating the issue to a footnote, we did not think it necessary to pry into the legal merits of the Tennessee claims in approving the class settlement. In another instance, the Fifth Circuit confronted the unresolved question of whether Louisiana antitrust law granted standing to indirect purchasers of consumer products as part of the class certification process, and asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to accept certification of the question. <em>See Free v. Abbott Labs., Inc., </em>176 F.3d 298, 298-99 (5th Cir.1999). When the state court declined, the Fifth Circuit was \u201cle[ft] to fathom Louisiana\u2019s unsettled antitrust law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By requiring district courts to assess the validity of unsettled state law claims at the certification stage, we would needlessly introduce additional legal uncertainty into a certification process that does not demand it.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>We raise the following questions to further demonstrate the error of the proposed framework adopted by our dissenting colleagues. If the dissent\u2019s \u201ccolorable legal claim\u201d test is a threshold inquiry for commonality, why should the court not consider every potential disqualifier from one\u2019s having a \u201ccolorable legal claim?\u201d For example, in any class certification case, should the court consider whether all potential class members complied with applicable pre-notice requirements under the relevant substantive law? Should the court consider whether every potential class member exhausted her administrative remedies under the relevant substantive law? Should the court evaluate whether each class member\u2019s claim complies with the applicable statute of limitations? The answers to these questions most certainly implicate whether a litigant, in a class action or otherwise, has a \u201ccolor-able legal claim.\u201d These questions, moreover, show how flawed, from an administrative, logical, and practical standpoint, the dissent\u2019s and objectors\u2019 approach really is. No class would ever be certified because it would be impossible to demonstrate that every class member has a \u201ccolorable legal claim.\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 344.) More than this, it would gut commonality, for, most certainly, individual issues would then predominate. There would simply be no class that could meet this commonality and predominance test.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\n<em>vi) Settlements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Finally, were we to mandate that a class include only those alleging \u201ccolorable\u201d claims, we would effectively rule out the ability of a defendant to achieve \u201cglobal peace\u201d by obtaining releases from all those who might wish to assert claims, meritorious or not. We need not take judicial notice of the fact that plaintiffs with nonviable claims do nonetheless commence legal action. Here, in an effort to avoid protracted litigation and future relitigation of settled questions in federal and state courts across numerous jurisdictions, De Beers pursued a global settlement and demanded a release of potential damage claims in all fifty states. <em>See Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 326 n. 82 (noting that release of all claims \u201cserves the important policy interest of judicial economy by permitting parties to enter into comprehensive settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ments that prevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action\u201d) (citation &amp; quotations omitted). Specifically, De Beers sought \u201cglobal peace\u201d in a settlement covering plaintiffs in every federal and state case, as well as potential plaintiffs who had not yet filed cases in either federal or state court. <em>See generally Klein v. O\u2019Neal, Inc., </em>2009 WL 1174638, at *3 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 29, 2009) (\u201cIn a class action settlement setting, defendants seek and pay for global peace \u2014 i.e., the resolution of as many claims as possible.\u201d); <em>In re Vioxx Prods. Liability Litig., </em>574 F.Supp.2d 606, 613 (E.D.La.2008) (quoting <em>In re Guidant Corp. Implantable Defibrillators Prods.

The parties entered a mutual agreement and sought certification of a settlement class with the aim of avoiding countless individual suits in diverse jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Our dissenting colleagues disparage the concept of \u201cglobal peace\u201d as if it were an impermissible objective in using the class action device. From a practical standpoint, however, achieving global peace is a valid, and valuable, incentive to class action settlements. Settlements avoid future litigation with all potential plaintiffs \u2014 meritorious or not. If the dissent\u2019s position were adopted, there would be no settlements, collusive or otherwise. First of all, litigating whether a claim is \u201ccolorable\u201d and defending who is in and who is not in the class would be an endless process, preventing the parties from seriously getting to, and engaging in, settlement negotiations. And, as discussed above, the \u201cindividualized\u201d nature of the task would doom the class certification process from the outset. Second, since releases would necessarily be limited to the qualifying class members, those ultimately excluded would no doubt go right back into court to continue to assert their claims. No defendants would consider settling under this framework, for they could never be assured that they have extinguished every claim from every potential plaintiff.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">As applied here, the objectors\u2019 approach would subject De Beers to numerous individual suits brought by claimants excluded from the class, undermining \u201cthe strong presumption in favor of voluntary settlement agreements, which we have explicitly recognized with approval.\u201d <em>Ehrheart, </em>609 F.3d at 594 (citing <em>Pennwalt Corp. v. Plough, </em>676 F.2d 77, 79-80 (3d Cir.1982)). \u201cThis presumption is especially strong in class actions and other complex cases ... because they promote the amicable resolution of disputes and lighten the increasing load of litigation faced by the federal courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). By contrast, requiring a class to assert uniform or identical questions of law or fact and to preemptively demonstrate their legal viability \u201cwould seriously undermine the possibility for settling any large, multi district class action.\u201d <em>Pruden</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>tial II, </em>261 F.3d at 367. Apart from imposing immense administrative costs, the extraordinary requirement that class members individually possess a \u201ccolorable legal claim\u201d would make it increasingly difficult to approve nationwide class settlements entailing predominantly common issues but arising under varying state laws. The resulting framework would likely siphon the various state law claims from federal class actions, and defendants seeking to settle \u201cin such suits would always be concerned that a settlement of the federal class action would leave them exposed to countless suits in state court despite settlement of the federal claims.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Pet Food, </em>629 F.3d at 342 (\u201c[AJbsent class certification, the Court may be faced with litigating over 100 individual lawsuits all of which would arise out of the same set of operative facts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Rather than \u201cconcentrating the litigation of the claims\u201d in a superior single action, Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(C), this would serve to frustrate \u201c[t]he core purpose of Rule 23(b)(3),\u201d which \u201cis to vindicate the claims of consumers and other groups of people whose individual claims would be too small to warrant litigation,\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 617,117 S.Ct. 2231.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>b. Rules Enabling Act &amp; Federalism Concerns</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aab\">The objectors further contend that the District Court\u2019s certification of the settlement class was flawed because it \u201crecognized as valid, for purposes of Rule 23, claims that are not recognized as valid under applicable state law.\u201d (Quinn Supp. Br. at 28.) Accordingly, they argue, the order ran afoul of the Rules Enabling Act, which provides that the rules of procedure \u201cshall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In <em>Prudential, </em>we approved a district court\u2019s certification of a proposed settlement despite objections that the certification modified or abridged state law rights. 148 F.3d at 324 (discussing 962 F.Supp. 450, 461-62 (D.N.J.1997)). We agreed with the district court that \u201capproval of a settlement under Rule 23 merely recognizes the parties\u2019 voluntary compromise of their rights and does not itself affect their substantive state law rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation &amp; alterations omitted). As a result, we also agreed with the district court\u2019s assessment that the proposed settlement could not violate the Rules Enabling Act since a \u201ccourt\u2019s approval of a voluntary settlement, by nature a compromise of rights, does not affect substantive state rights.\u201d <em>Prudential, </em>962 F.Supp. at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">It is well established that \u201csettlement agreements are creatures of private contract law.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Bauer v. Trans. Sch. Dist. of City of St. Louis, </em>255 F.3d 478, 482 (8th Cir.2001). \u201cA district court is not a party to the settlement, nor may it modify the terms of a <em>voluntary </em>settlement agreement between parties.\u201d <em>Ehrheart, </em>609 F.3d at 593 (emphasis added). Thus, a district court\u2019s certification of a settlement simply recognizes the parties\u2019 deliberate decision to bind themselves according to mutually agreed-upon terms without engaging in any substantive adjudication of the underlying causes of action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In the absence of a finding that plaintiffs are actually entitled to relief under substantive state law, we reiterate that a court does not \u201cabridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right\u201d by approving a voluntarily-entered class settlement agreement. \u00a7 2072(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In the same vein, we disagree with the contention that the District Court violated principles of federalism by extending to the plaintiffs a substantive right that they could not have asserted in state court.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> As an initial matter, the District Court\u2019s approval of the parties\u2019 settlement should not be considered a recognition or expansion of substantive rights unavailable in a particular state.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>See supra. </em>In this regard, the disputed certification order did not subordinate the states\u2019 interests, as it did not in fact validate any asserted claims purportedly rejected by the states.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Moreover, consideration of the policy imperatives underlying <em>Illinois Brick </em>confirms that the District Court\u2019s certification of a settlement class here did not infringe upon federalism principles. <em>Illinois Brick\u2019s </em>restriction on indirect purchaser recovery was motivated by prudential concerns for manageability; it does not reflect a categorical policy judgment that indirect purchasers do not merit antitrust protection. As we previously highlighted, the <em>Illinois Brick </em>Court offered \u201cthree policy reasons for its holding\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">(1) a risk of duplicative liability for defendants and potentially inconsistent adjudications could arise if courts permitted both direct and indirect purchasers to sue defendants for the same overcharge; (2) the evidentiary complexities and uncertainties involved in ascertaining the portion of the overcharge that the direct purchasers had passed on to the various levels of indirect purchasers would place too great a burden on the courts; and (3) permitting direct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>indirect purchasers to sue only for the amount of the overcharge they themselves absorbed and did not pass on would cause inefficient enforcement of the antitrust laws by diluting the ultimate recovery and thus decreasing the direct purchasers\u2019 incentive to sue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYC\"><em>Howard Hess Dental Labs.

De Beers\u2019s agreement to a specified recovery payment \u2014 and the interrelated removal of a need to ascertain and prove the amount of passed-on overcharges \u2014 marginalizes the first two <em>Illinois Brick </em>concerns for duplicative liability and complexity in ascertaining the passed-on overcharges. The third prudential concern is similarly inapposite since the Direct Purchaser Class pursued and approved a separate settlement agreement and there is no indication that the Indirect Purchaser Settlement undermined \u201cthe direct purchasers\u2019 incentive to sue.\u201d <em>Dentsply, </em>424 F.3d at 370. Indeed, the immediate relief offered by the instant settlement appears to offer the most \u201c[ ]efficient enforcement of the antitrust laws,\u201d <em>id., </em>when compared to the highly uncertain result the plaintiffs would encounter by engaging in protracted litigation against a party with a long track record of avoiding the jurisdiction of courts in the United States. <em>See generally </em>Comment, The Diamond Cartel, 56 Yale L.J. 1404, 1411 (1947) (discussing De Beers\u2019s avoidance of effective antitrust prosecution in light of \u201cthe twin difficulties of obtaining jurisdiction over the foreign corporations and of retaining within the court\u2019s reach tangible assets sufficient to enforce a decree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Accordingly, we reject the assertion that the District Court inappropriately subordinated state sovereignty in certifying the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">c. <em>Identification of Class Claims Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Apart from our disagreement with the objectors\u2019 arguments regarding commonality and predominance, we similarly reject the view that the District Court\u2019s Order in this case failed to satisfy all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Rule 23(c)(l)(B)\u2019s substantive requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">As we have explicated, Rule 23(c) provides that a certification order \u201cmust include (1) a readily discernible, clear, and precise statement of the parameters defining the class or classes to be certified, and (2) a readily discernible, clear, and complete list of the claims, issues or defenses to be treated on a class basis.\u201d <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 320-21 (citation &amp; quotations omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(B) (\u201cAn order that certifies a class action must define the class and the class claims, issues, or defenses----\u201d). The District Court\u2019s Order \u201ceasily meets the requirements of Rule 23(c)(1)(B) with respect to the definition of the class itself.\u201d <em>Wachtel ex rel. Jesse v. Guardian Life Ins. Go. of Am., </em>453 F.3d 179,188 (3d Cir.2006). The Court properly delineated the parameters of the Indirect Purchaser Class, defining class members as any purchasers of any diamond product in the United States except for those who purchased directly from De Beers or its competitors. (App\u2019x 270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">As to the second prong of the above test, the contention is raised that the Court\u2019s Order did not \u201cexplicitly define which claims, issues, or defenses are to be treated on a class basis.\u201d <em>Wachtel, </em>453 F.3d at 189. We disagree with this characterization, as the settlement posture of this class action makes our decision on this front particularly simple. As we noted in <em>Wachtel, </em>a \u201ccritical\u201d purpose of Rule 23(e)(l)\u2019s requirement of a \u201cfull and clear articulation of the litigation\u2019s contours at the time of class certification\u201d was the \u201cneed [ ] to determine how the case will be tried\u201d through presentation of \u201ca \u2018trial plan\u2019 that describes the issues likely to be presented at trial and tests whether they are susceptible to class-wide proof.\u201d 453 F.3d at 186 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(A) advisory committee\u2019s note) (quotations omitted). In the settlement context, however, this concern evaporates, \u201cfor the proposal is that there be no trial.\u201d <em>Comm. Bank II, </em>622 F.3d at 291 (citing <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231).

Plaintiffs alleged that, in the absence of injunctive relief, De Beers\u2019s anticompetitive conduct would continue to cause the entire membership of all classes to pay artificially inflated prices. The objectors counter that class members lack antitrust standing to seek injunctive relief because they cannot demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an impending violation of the anti-trust laws. In support, they point to expert reports submitted in 2008 for the targeted purpose of identifying a common methodology benchmark for calculating damages; these reports suggested that the market for rough diamonds became more competitive in the interim between mid-2006 and 2008, in concert with De Beers\u2019s weakening position in the market.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In making this argument, the objectors reject the District Court\u2019s conclusion that De Beers\u2019s willful entry into the settlement removed the plaintiffs\u2019 burden to establish the likelihood of future injury. <em>{See </em>App\u2019x 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In contrast to the damages provision of \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, \u201c \u2018Section 16 has been applied more expansively, both because its language is less restrictive than that of \u00a7 4 ... and because the injunctive remedy is a more flexible and adaptable tool for enforcing the antitrust laws than the damage remedy....\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>McCarthy v.

Because actions seeking injunctive relief under \u00a7 16 do \u201cnot present the countervailing considerations \u2014 such as the risk of duplicative or ruinous recoveries and the spectre of a trial burdened with complex and conjectural economic analyses,\u201d plaintiffs need not \u201csatisfy the direct purchaser requirement as a condition of seeking injunctive relief.\u201d <em>In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>214 F.3d 395, 400 (3d Cir.2000) <em>('Warfarin </em>I) (quoting <em>Mid-West Paper Prods.

Instead, to establish the need for injunctive relief, plaintiffs must generally demonstrate three uncomplicated prerequisites: \u201ca threat of loss\u201d; that the injury in question \u201cis of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent\u201d; and \u201ca significant threat of injury from a violation of the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399 (citations &amp; quotations omitted; alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Despite this burden, it is well established that \u201cparties to a suit have the right to agree to anything they please in reference to the subject matter of their litigation, and the court, when applied to, will ordinarily give effect to their agreement, if it comes within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings.\u201d <em>Sansom Comm, by Cook v.

Indeed, much of our discussion of \u201cpredominance\u201d in the previous section of this Opinion specifically emphasized the common elements of the complained of conduct that are equally applicable to \u201cthe class as a whole.\u201d <em>See supra. </em>As the District Court discussed, the plaintiffs alleged that De Beers\u2019s anticompetitive behavior \u201ccaused the entire membership of all classes to pay artificially inflated prices,\u201d and that, in the absence of injunctive relief, all classes would continue to pay artificial premiums. (App\u2019x 285.) These claims demonstrate shared interests between the members of the putative class, and, these allegations, if proven, would support injunctive relief respecting the class as a whole. Likewise, the parties\u2019 mutual decision to settle claims \u201con grounds generally applicable to the class\u201d complies with the text of Rule 23(b)(2) and should be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In reaching this decision, we also reject the objectors\u2019 request that we engage in fact-finding as to whether all class members could show an imminent threat of prospective antitrust injury. Due to the settlement posture of this case, which controls, we need not concern ourselves with this issue. Moreover, the District Court never addressed the question of whether changes in the market negatively affected De Beers\u2019s ability to extract higher rents from diamond sightholders and subsequent purchasers.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Without the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>District Court\u2019s factual findings on the matter in any event, \u201c[w]e deem it inappropriate to treat this question without any evidence having been presented on [it] and without the benefit of the findings and opinion of the district judge.\u201d <em>Merola v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>515 F.2d 165, 173 (3d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">At bottom, we hold that the District Court acted within its discretion in accepting De Beers\u2019s stipulation to the injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>B. Fairness of the Class Action Settlement &amp; the Plan of Allocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Apart from contesting the certification of the settlement class, the objectors raise two other arguments as to the fairness and adequacy of the proposed settlement. First, they quarrel with the District Court\u2019s approval of the settlement as a whole under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)\u2019s requirement that the settlement be \u201cfair, reasonable, and adequate.\u201d <em>(See </em>Bagolie Br. at 18-28.) Second, the objectors dispute the fairness and adequacy of the settlement\u2019s plan of allocation for a portion of the settlement. Specifically, they urge that the proposed Indirect Purchaser Settlement distribution is \u201cpatently unfair\u201d and presents \u201can intra-class conflict of interest that renders Class Counsel, as well as the class representative, inadequate.\u201d <em>(See </em>Murray Consol. Br. at 13; Quinn Br. at 63-64; Petrus Br. at 12-13.) We address each objection in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\n<em>1. Approval of the Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aou\">Before approving a class settlement agreement, a district court must find that the requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a) and (b) are met, and must separately \u201cdetermine that the settlement is fair to the class under [Rule] 23(e).\u201d <em>Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 257. Rule 23(e) provides that a proposed settlement may only be approved \u201cafter a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)(2). In this process, \u201ctrial judges bear the important responsibility of protecting absent class members,\u201d and must be \u201cassur[ed] that the settlement represents adequate compensation for the release of the class claims.\u201d <em>Pet Food, </em>629 F.3d at 349 (citation <em>&amp; </em>quotations omitted); <em>see also Ehrheart, </em>609 F.3d at 593 (stressing that \u201c[t]he purpose of Rule 23(e) is to protect the unnamed members of the class,\u201d and that a \u201cdistrict court acts as a fiduciary\u201d for absent class members) (citing <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.8d at 534). \u201c[W]here settlement negotiations precede class certification, and approval for settlement and certification are sought simultaneously, district courts should be even \u2018more scrupulous than usual\u2019 when examining the fairness of the proposed settlement.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 534 (quoting <em>GM Truck, </em>55 F.3d at 805).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">In assessing the fairness of a proposed settlement, we have articulated nine well-established primary factors for a district court to consider in conducting its inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; [and] (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><em>Pet Food, </em>629 F.3d at 350 (quoting <em>Girsh v. Jepson, </em>521 F.2d 153, 157 (3d Cir.1975)). (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Furthermore, a district court may consider several other factors \u201cillustrative of additional inquiries that in many instances will be useful for a thoroughgoing analysis of a settlement\u2019s terms,\u201d <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amp\">[T]he maturity of the underlying substantive issues, as measured by experience in adjudicating individual actions, the development of scientific knowledge, the extent of discovery on the merits, and other factors that bear on the ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits of liability and individual damages; the existence and probable outcome of claims by other classes and subclasses; the comparison between the results achieved by the settlement for individual class or subclass members and the results achieved \u2014 or likely to be achieved \u2014 for other claimants; whether class or subclass members are accorded the right to opt out of the settlement; whether any provisions for attorneys\u2019 fees are reasonable; and whether the procedure for processing individual claims under the settlement is fair and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 323). The \u201csettling parties bear the burden of proving that the <em>Girsh </em>factors weigh in favor of approval of the settlement\u201d throughout this analysis.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cBecause of the district court\u2019s proximity to the parties and to the nuances of the litigation, we accord great weight to the court\u2019s factual findings\u201d in conducting the fairness inquiry. <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The District Court in this instance engaged in a thorough review of the <em>Girsh </em>factors, holding that the relevant considerations on balance weighed in favor of a finding of fairness under Rule 23(e). We conclude that the Court did not abuse its discretion in finding the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">\n<em>a. Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of the Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The first <em>Girsh </em>factor \u201ccaptures the probable costs, in both time and money, of continued litigation.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 536 (citation omitted). The District Court found that this litigation \u201cwould have been difficult, as multiple parties, multiple claims, extensive jurisdictional problems, and complicated discovery would be involved.\u201d (App\u2019x 289.) The Court further discussed the likelihood of extensive motion practice as to jurisdiction, the lifting of default judgments,, statute of limitations issues, and the concern for protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ing foreign litigants in United States courts. <em>(Id. </em>289-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that litigation of the numerous legal and factual issues discussed would have inevitably contributed to the expense and duration of the proceedings. Faced with the uncertainty arising from the existing defaults and De Beers\u2019s ongoing denial of personal jurisdiction, the settlement provided substantial and immediate relief to the class without further expense. Moreover, extended motion practice \u201cwould not only further prolong the litigation but also reduce the value of any recovery to the class.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 536. Accordingly, this first factor favors the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>b. The Reaction of the Class to the Settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The second <em>Girsh </em>factor \u201cattempts to gauge whether members of the class support the settlement,\u201d by considering the number of objectors and opt-outs and the substance of any objections. <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 318. The District Court determined that the reaction of the class was overwhelmingly positive,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and noted that all twenty of the objections pertained to the Indirect Purchaser Class, with all but four objections relating to the consumer subclass, which consists of between 67 and 117 million members. (App\u2019x 290-91.) We agree with the District Court\u2019s observation that the minimal number of objections and requests for exclusion are consistent with class settlements we have previously approved, and we are satisfied that the District Court acted within its discretion in finding this factor to favor settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">c. <em>The Stage of the Proceedings and the Amount of Discovery Completed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The third <em>Girsh </em>factor \u201ccaptures the degree of case development that class counsel had accomplished prior to settlement,\u201d and allows the court to \u201cdetermine whether counsel had an adequate appreciation of the merits of the case before negotiating.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 537 (citation, quotations &amp; alterations omitted). The District Court thoroughly discussed the development of this case prior to settlement, highlighting the extensive factual discovery of industry participants, consumers, and experts in the field; the retention of economic experts; the review of publicly available information; the experiences of counsel who had previously sued De Beers for price-fixing; and the analysis of proceedings relating to De Beers\u2019s other contractual entanglements in the field. (App\u2019x 292.) The Court further observed that several of the individual suits had been in litigation for years before negotiation of the settlement, and emphasized that classes had been certified in several individual suits after significant factual investigation and legal development. <em>(Id.) </em>The Court committed no error in concluding that counsel adequately appreciated the merits of the case prior to reaching a settlement, and we agree that this factor favors approval of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\n<em>d. The Risks of Establishing Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The fourth <em>Girsh </em>factor \u201cexamine[s] what the potential rewards (or downside) of litigation might have been had class counsel decided to litigate the claims rather than settle them.\u201d <em>Cendant, </em>264 F.3d at 237. As already highlighted, the District Court discussed at length the various difficulties plaintiffs would likely encounter in attempting to collect on default judgments in foreign jurisdictions, observing that the Court\u2019s monetary judgments would likely be perceived as \u201cbeyond its authority\u201d and \u201ceffectively void.\u201d (App\u2019x 294-95.) The objectors\u2019 misguided contention that no risk of establishing liability exists entirely disregards the potential drawbacks of litigating and attempting to collect in foreign jurisdictions, including the extensive motion practice and expense such an uncertain tactic would entail. We are also influenced by De Beers\u2019s track record of rejecting United States jurisdiction over its legal affairs and the fact that De Beers has continued to deny any wrongdoing even in reaching a settlement agreement in this matter. Accordingly, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that this factor favors settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">e. <em>The Risks of Establishing Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As with the fourth <em>Girsh </em>factor, \u201cthis inquiry attempts to measure the expected value of litigating the action rather than settling it at the current time.\u201d <em>Cendant, </em>264 F.3d at 238-39 (citation &amp; quotations omitted). The District Court found that entry of a default judgment against De Beers would prompt the court to \u201cconduct such hearings or order such references as it deems necessary and proper\u201d to ascertain the amount of damages since the damages had not presently been established with certainty. (App\u2019x 296 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)).) The expert reports submitted by the various parties indicated that these proceedings would likely entail a \u201cbattle of the experts,\u201d with each side presenting its figures and defenses to the other side\u2019s proposals. <em>(Id. </em>297.) Because of the \u201cuncertainty attendant to such a battle,\u201d the District Court determined this factor to weigh in support of settlement, <em>(id.), </em>and the objectors do not contest this finding on appeal. Accordingly, we find no flaw in the District Court\u2019s decision that the additional \u201crisk in establishing damages\u201d counsels in favor of approval of the settlement. <em>Cendant, </em>264 F.3d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\n<em>f. The Risks of Maintaining the Class Action Through Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The sixth <em>Girsh </em>factor \u201cmeasures the likelihood of obtaining and keeping a class certification if the action were to proceed to trial\u201d in light of the fact that \u201cthe prospects for obtaining certification have a great impact on the range of recovery one can expect to reap from the class action.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 537 (internal quotations &amp; citation omitted). Class certification is tenuous, as a \u201cdistrict court retains the authority to decertify or modify a class at any time during the litigation if it proves to be unmanageable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). As we have discussed <em>supra, </em>although the size and variety of issues implicated in this nationwide class action do not present an obstacle to certification of a settlement class, \u201cthere is a significant risk that such a class would create intractable management problems if it were to become a litigation class, and therefore be decertified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that the considerable risk of maintaining the class action through trial weighed in favor of settlement.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\n<em>g. Ability of Defendants to Withstand a Greater Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The seventh <em>Girsh </em>factor considers \u201cwhether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount significantly greater than the settlement.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 537-38 (citation, quotations, &amp; alteration omitted). The District Court observed that \u201clittle fact-finding has been done on this issue,\u201d and noted that the parties did not dispute De Beers\u2019s ability to withstand a greater judgment. (App\u2019x 298-99.) Even so, the Court found this factor to neither favor nor disfavor the proposed settlement because \u201cit would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to collect a judgment from De Beers.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The objectors contend that the District Court made insufficient findings as to De Beers\u2019s market capitalization, which suggested an ability to withstand a much higher judgment, and, therefore, should have weighed this factor against the settlement. (Bagolie Br. at 26-27).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In comparing the value of settlement versus trial, we must be careful to judge the fairness factors \u201cagainst the realistic, rather than theoretical, potential for recovery after trial.\u201d <em>In re Global Crossing Sec. &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>225 F.R.D. 436, 461 (S.D.N.Y.2004). In this regard, a finding that an immediate settlement is preferable to the high unlikelihood of collecting a theoretical judgment against De Beers appears entirely reasonable. Moreover, a defendant\u2019s ability to withstand a much higher judgment does not necessarily \u201cmean that it is obligated to pay any more than what the [class members] are entitled to under the theories of liability that existed at the time the settlement was reached.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 538. That said, \u201c[t]he proponents of a settlement bear the burden of proving that the <em>Girsh </em>factors weigh in favor of approval,\u201d and we have previously found that defendants\u2019 speculative ability to pay \u201csubstantially more than they did under the Settlement\u201d cut against approval, \u201calbeit only moderately.\u201d <em>Cendant, </em>264 F.3d at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">At bottom, we agree that, \u201cin any class action against a large corporation, the defendant entity is likely to be able to withstand a more substantial judgment, and, against the weight of the remaining factors, this fact alone does not undermine the reasonableness of the instant settlement.\u201d <em>Weber v. Gov\u2019t Empl. Ins. Co., </em>262 F.R.D. 431, 447 (D.N.J.2009). As such, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that De Beers\u2019s ability to withstand a greater judgment does not necessarily undermine the fairness of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">\n<em>h. The Range of Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the Best Possible Recovery and All Attendant Risks of Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The final two <em>Girsh </em>factors consider \u201cwhether the settlement represents a good value for a weak case or a poor value for a strong case.\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 538. The reasonableness of a proposed settlement is assessed by comparing \u201cthe present value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>[at trial], appropriately discounted for the risk of not prevailing ... with the amount of the proposed settlement.\u201d <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 322. Notably, in conducting the analysis, the court must \u201cguard against demanding too large a settlement based on its view of the merits of the litigation; after all, settlement is a compromise, a yielding of the highest hopes in exchange for certainty and resolution.\u201d <em>GM Truck, 55 </em>F.3d at 806 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Applying this framework, the District Court described the methodology utilized by the Indirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass\u2019s expert, who theorized that the average overcharge for diamond sales was 4.85% and the total worldwide overcharge equalled $4.99 billion; the United States consumes approximately 50% of the diamonds and diamond jewelry worldwide, rendering the overcharge to the U.S. market equal to $2.49 billion. (App\u2019x 300.) Accordingly, the proposed $272.5 million Indirect Purchaser Settlement Fund represented 10.93% of this overcharge. <em>(Id.) </em>The expert further posited that although the Direct Purchaser Class recovery could not be precisely quantified in the absence of data as to the exact amount of non-De Beers sales to Direct Purchasers, the value could reasonably be estimated. Placing the total value of United States imports of rough diamonds during the Direct Purchaser Class Period at $4.3 billion, the expert estimated that at least 46% \u2014 or approximately $2 billion \u2014 of the rough diamond sales were excluded sales; applying the 4.85 weighted overcharge percentage to that $2 billion, the expert theorized that the overcharge percentage was near $100 million. <em>(Id.) </em>As such, the proposed $22.5 million recovery represented more than 20% of the single damages. <em>(Id.) </em>The District Court found this estimate reasonable and the objectors do not protest this methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Instead, the objectors contend that the District Court abused its discretion in overvaluing the settlement by considering only estimated <em>single </em>damages in its \u201cbest possible recovery\u201d inquiry, rather than comparing the settlement amount to the <em>treble </em>damages that are an automatic component of antitrust damages recovery in many jurisdictions. (Bagolie Br. 28, 32-43.) Although the objectors correctly note that the District Court compared the settlement recovery to single damages in evaluating the propriety of the settlement\u2019s monetary component, (App\u2019x 301), we do not agree with the objectors that this methodology constituted legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Some disagreement exists in the case law as to whether the reasonableness of a settlement amount should be evaluated by comparison to the potential single damages of a class or the trebled damages authorized in certain jurisdictions. <em>Compare County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., </em>907 F.2d 1295, 1324 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201c[T]he district judge correctly recognized that it is inappropriate to measure the adequacy of a settlement amount by comparing to a trebled base recovery figure.\u201d), <em>Carnegie v. Household Intern., Inc., </em>445 F.Supp.2d 1032, 1035 (N.D.Ill.2006) (\u201c[Numerous courts have held that in determining a settlement value, the potential for treble damages should not be taken into account.\u201d), and <em>Lorazepam &amp; Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., </em>205 F.R.D. 369, 376 (D.D.C.2002) (\u201c[T]he standard for evaluating settlement involves a comparison of the settlement amount with the estimated single damages.\u201d), <em>with In re Auction Houses Antitrust Litig., </em>2001 WL 170792, at <em>*7 </em>(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2001) (\u201c[T]here are few perceptible justifications of the single damages standard for the determination of the fairness of antitrust class actions,\u201d which \u201cplaces the settlement court, [acting] as a fiduciary for the absent class members, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>a position in which it may be forced to approve a settlement that no non-representative plaintiffs would accept\u201d), and <em>In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig., </em>216 F.R.D. 197, 210 n. 30 (D.Me.2003) (\u201c[I]f a settlement reflects a potential damage recovery, it should logically reflect the other parts of that recovery (trebling and attorneys\u2019 fees) that the statute awards automatically.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">That said, \u201cwe know of no authority that <em>requires </em>a district court to assess the fairness of a settlement in light of the potential for trebled damages.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> <em>Comm.

By the same token, we do not require them to do so in all cases.\u201d). Rather, \u201ccourts generally determine fairness of an antitrust class action settlement based on how it compensates the class for past injuries, without giving much, if any, consideration to treble damages.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> <em>Rodriguez, </em>563 F.3d at 964; <em>see also City of Detroit v.

Nat\u2019l Football League, </em>887 F.2d 408, 415-16 (2d Cir.1989). Without delving into the debate over whether single or treble damages are the proper variable of comparison, we cannot label the District Court\u2019s adherence to the commonly accepted procedure for assessing the fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of a settlement an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Moreover, many of the state law claims asserted would not provide for treble damages recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Finding no abuse in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the proposed settlement offered a reasonable recovery, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cwhen accounting for the additional relief provided by the injunction,\u201d (App\u2019x 301), we are also not persuaded that the Court erred in assessing the reasonableness of the settlement in light of all of the attendant risks of litigation. <em>Girsh, </em>521 F.2d at 157. The District Court found the \u201cmagnitude of the potential risks in litigation, including likely profound difficulties enforcing United States default judgments in the relevant foreign countries, establishing personal jurisdiction, and establishing liability,\u201d to compare unfavorably to the recovery offered by the proposed settlement. (App\u2019x 301-02.) Based on this assessment, we find the District Court\u2019s conclusion that these final factors weigh in favor of the settlement compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">On balance, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding the Settlement as a whole fair, adequate, and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>2. Plan of Allocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The objectors next aver that the previously discussed differences in state law mandate a differential allocation in the percentage of recovery within the Indirect Purchaser Consumer Settlement Fund, which should \u201caccount for the[] varying strengths and weaknesses\u201d of consumer claims as informed by the applicable state law treatments of indirect purchaser causes of action. (Murray Br. at 15-18.)

In prior instances where objectors challenged the fairness of intra-class allocation of settlement funds, we have explained that \u201cwhere a class is found to include subclasses divergent in interest,\u201d the use of subclasses may be appropriate and \u201cis designed to prevent conflicts of interest in class representation.\u201d <em>Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 271. We have likewise noted the potential drawbacks of sub-classing, including the potential \u201c \u2018Balkanization\u2019 of the class action,\u201d and creation of \u201ca huge obstacle to settlement if each subclass has an incentive to hold out for more money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>404 F.3d 173, 202 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cCendant Sec.\u201d)). </em>We accord \u201csubstantial deference to district courts with respect to their resolution of this issue\u201d because such decisions \u201crequire[] a balancing of costs and benefits that can best be performed by a district judge.\u201d <em>Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 271. \u201cWhere the district court has declined to certify a subclass\u201d and treats all class members as falling within a single class for purposes of a fund allocation, \u201cwe will ordinarily defer to its decision unless it constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cendant Sec., </em>404 F.3d at 202) (quotations &amp; alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">In <em>Insurance Brokerage, </em>the objectors asserted that the district court abused its discretion in failing to require the establishment of subclasses where \u201cthe increased recovery of one sub-class was achieved at the expense of another subclass\u2019s diminished recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270. There, the plan of allocation tied reimbursement \u201cto the extent of damages incurred on certain policies of insurance,\u201d and was \u201callocated in such a way that policyholders who likely incurred the most damage are entitled to a larger proportion of the recovery than those whose injuries were less severe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272-73. Although we observed that the proposed sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>classes \u201cha[d] some appeal\u201d in remedying an unequal division of the settlement fund, we deferred to the district court\u2019s thorough explanation that the objectors had failed to evidence \u201cdivergent or antagonistic interests between the three groups,\u201d and had not established that \u201cthese groups have claims of varying merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272 (citation <em>&amp; </em>quotations omitted). Indeed, despite the factual disparities in the type of insurance at issue, the district court had highlighted that \u201call of the class members shared a unified interest in establishing [ ] liability for engaging in anticompetitive conduct which increased the cost of premium for all policyholders,\u201d undermining the showing of divergent interests. <em>Id. </em>at 273. We further noted that the plan of allocation \u201cwas carefully devised to ensure a fair distribution of the settlement fund,\u201d and \u201cmerely created a structure for ensuring that reimbursement [was] tied to the extent of damages incurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272. Accordingly, we found the settlement allocation fair and within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We reached a different conclusion in <em>Pet Food, </em>629 F.3d at 353. There, the district court carefully examined the fairness of the total settlement fund, but did not discuss whether an allocation of the fund to a sub-segment of claims \u2014 namely, to consumers who had received refunds outside of the settlement \u2014 was inadequate and rendered the settlement unfair and unreasonable to those who had received nothing on account of their claims. 629 F.3d at 353 (noting that although \u201cwe do not doubt the able District Court properly determined that the fund was a fair and adequate settlement of all the claims advanced by plaintiffs in this case[,] ... [w]e are unable to determine whether the $250,000 allocation was a fair and adequate settlement of the Purchase Claims\u201d). There, we decided that the district court lacked sufficient information to decide whether the allocation to certain claimants was fair, and, thus, we remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Like the progressive settlement contemplated in <em>Insurance Brokerage, </em>the settlement at issue here provides for a pro rata distribution to all class members, and does not distinguish based upon any variables, such as the applicable state law of claimants\u2019 states of residence or location of purchase. While the District Court here did not specifically evaluate the pro rata allocation through the fairness lens, it did consider the differential allocation question in conducting the predominance analysis, noting the imprecision inherent in weighing class member claims \u201cbased on the relative strength of different state law claims.\u201d (App\u2019x 279.) The District Court further noted in its Rule 23(a) analysis that the various \u201cindividual classes were represented by separate counsel during settlement negotiations, allowing for \u2018adequate structural protections to assure that differently situated plaintiffs negotiate for their own unique interests.\u2019 \u201d (App\u2019x 220 (quoting <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 533).) Moreover, the Court observed that there were no intra-class conflicts since all putative members experienced injury caused by De Beers, all sought recovery for overpayment caused by allegedly anticompetitive behavior, and all shared common interests in establishing damages and injunctive relief. <em>(Id. </em>at 220-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">It may be entirely reasonable to apply the same damages calculation to claimants from all states because, as the district court in <em>Warfarin </em>observed, \u201c[i]t is purely speculative that claimants from indirect purchaser states could anticipate a greater recovery than claimants from other states.\u201d <em>In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>212 F.R.D. 231, 260 (D.Del.2002); <em>see also Cendant, </em>264 F.3d at 250 (given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the \u201cspeculative\u201d nature of such an inquiry, differences in the liability standards between \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 10(b) securities claims did <em>not </em>warrant differential plan of allocation). And only by engaging in the type of fact-intensive merits and choice-of-law analyses that we have rejected could a district court attempt to assay the \u201cvarying strengths and weaknesses\u201d of asserted state claims. <em>(See </em>Murray Br. at 15-18.) We can find no support in our case law for differentiating within a class based on the strength or weakness of the theories of recovery. Accordingly, we decline to require such an analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Moreover, it is noteworthy that each putative class member suffered the same alleged injury as a result of De Beers\u2019s anticompetitive conduct, irrespective of the vagaries of applicable state laws. Recognizing this, the plan of allocation here \u201cadjust[s] diamond purchases to a common measure,\u201d allowing an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison \u201cof the relative amount of damages suffered by various claimants within the classes and subclasses and permits distribution pro rata based on the relative amounts of damages suffered.\u201d (App\u2019x 1530.) Courts \u201cgenerally consider plans of allocation that reimburse class members based on the type and extent of their injuries to be reasonable,\u201d <em>In re Co-rel Corp. Inc., Sec. Litig., </em>293 F.Supp.2d 484, 493 (E.D.Pa.2003), and we are mindful that \u201cdistrict courts have broad supervisory powers over the administration of class action settlements to allocate the proceeds among the claiming class members equitably,\u201d <em>McCoy v. Health Net, Inc., </em>569 F.Supp.2d 448, 469 (D.N.J.2008). The record here confirms that the District Court carefully considered expert advice in accepting the plan of allocation, and \u201c[t]his kind of decision is intensely fact-based, falling within the purview of the District Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cendant, </em>264 F.3d at 254. In light of the foregoing analysis, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in accepting the carefully negotiated plan of allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Lastly, the objectors contend that the settlement\u2019s minimum claim payment requirement of $10 provides inadequate settlement relief, as it will eliminate the rights of many class members without providing any compensation. (Petrus/Giddings Br. at 12.) They urge that a minimum payment provision contradicts the purpose of the class action mechanism to provide recovery even where the amount is \u201cpaltry.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 16 (quoting <em>Yang v. Odom, </em>392 F.3d 97, 106 (3d Cir.2004)).) We disagree and find no abuse in the District Court\u2019s decision to approve the minimum claim payment threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As other courts have observed, <em>\u201cde minimis </em>thresholds for payable claims are beneficial to the class as a whole since they save the settlement fund from being depleted by the administrative costs associated with claims unlikely to exceed those costs and courts have frequently approved such thresholds, often at $10.\u201d <em>In re Gilat Satellite Networks, Ltd., </em>No. CV-02-1510, 2007 WL 1191048, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 19, 2007); <em>see, e.g., In re Global Crossing Sec. &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>225 F.R.D. 436, 463 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (noting that the minimum recovery requirement is a common procedure that addresses \u201cthe undeniable fact that claims-processing costs money, which comes out of the settlement fund\u201d); <em>Mehling v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>248 F.R.D. 455, 463 (E.D.Pa.2008) (approving settlement plan with $50 minimum payment). The District Court adopted the Special Master\u2019s considered decision that \u201cadministrative costs to make <em>de minimis </em>payments are too large to justify the small payments,\u201d and the objectors have offered only conclusory counter-allegations. (App\u2019x 1531). Indicative of the disingenu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ous nature of their responses is the objectors\u2019 assertion that \u201c[i]n exchange for their release, millions of class members [will] receive no money.\u201d (Quinn Br. at 63-64.) This argument fails to acknowledge the injunctive relief offered by the settlement, however, which is intended to benefit all class members regardless of individual monetary recovery.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Furthermore, the objectors appear to ignore a key rationale underlying the class action mechanism. In addition to providing individual class members with payments, \u201c \u2018[t]he policy at the very core of the class action mechanism\u2019 \u201d is to provide sufficient incentive to prosecute an action \u201c \u2018by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone\u2019s (usually an attorney\u2019s) labor,\u2019 \u201d <em>Yang, </em>392 F.3d at 106 (quoting <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 617, 117 S.Ct. 2231). In this instance, the representative parties and their counsel were properly ineentivized to bring and prosecute this action through settlement, resulting in a net benefit to the class. As a result, based upon the evidence offered before the Special Master and the arguments alleged herein, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in approving this element of the plan of allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>C. Objections to the Fee Award</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AAH\">The objectors likewise aver that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees that they urge are excessive. (Quinn Br. at 65; Hicks Prelim. Op. Br. at 7; Petrus/Giddings Br. at 12.) They contend that class counsel will receive in excess of $73 million \u2014 equal to approximately 25% of the $293 million principal settlement fund \u2014 despite this being a default judgment case, which entailed minimal motions practice and discovery. Additionally, considering the large number of putative class members and the alleged lack of risk undertaken by class counsel in prosecuting this case to settlement, the objectors urge that the award is unjustified under our jurisprudence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Our case law makes clear that a \u201crobust\u201d and \u201cthorough judicial review of fee applications is required in all class action settlements,\u201d <em>In re Diet Drugs, </em>582 F.3d 524, 537-38 (3d Cir.2009) (citation &amp; quotations omitted), but that \u201cthe amount of a fee award ... is within the district court\u2019s discretion so long as it employs correct standards and procedures and makes findings of fact not clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>396 F.3d 294, 299 (3d Cir.2005) (citation &amp; quotations omitted). <em>See also Ursic v. Bethlehem Mines, </em>719 F.2d 670, 675 (3d Cir.1983) (\u201c[T]he district court has discretion in determining the amount of a fee award ... in view of [its] superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\u201d) (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Attorneys\u2019 fees requests are generally assessed under one of two methods: the percentage-of-recovery (\u201cPOR\u201d) approach or the lodestar scheme. \u201cThe former applies a certain percentage to the settlement fund,\u201d while \u201c[t]he latter multiplies the number of hours class counsel worked on a case by a reasonable hourly billing rate for such services.\u201d <em>Diet Drugs, </em>582 F.3d at 540 (citation, quotations, &amp; alterations omitted). The POR method \u201cis generally favored in common fund cases because it allows courts to award fees from the fund \u2018in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for failure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rite Aid, </em>396 F.3d at 300 (citation &amp; quotations omitted). The lodestar method, which is more commonly utilized in statutory fee-shifting cases and \u201cwhere the expected relief has a small enough monetary value that a percentage-of-recovery method would provide inadequate compensation,\u201d <em>Diet Drugs, </em>582 F.3d at 540-41, is then used \u201cto cross-check the reasonableness of a percentage-of-recovery fee award,\u201d <em>In re AT &amp; T Corp., </em>455 F.3d 160, 164 (3d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Because the case at issue entailed a common fund, the District Court applied the POR method and utilized a lodestar crosscheck. (App\u2019x 310.). The objectors do not dispute the propriety of this approach, and we find no fault with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In determining the appropriate percentage fee award, the District Court then devoted detailed consideration to each of the ten factors that we identified in <em>Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., </em>223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir.2000),<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d 283,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the complexity and duration of the litigation, the time and skill committed to the litigation, the ever-present risk of nonpayment from De Beers\u2019s tenuous status in the United States, the absence of substantial objections, and the achievement of both monetary and injunctive relief without any governmental investigation or assistance all weighed in favor of approving the Special Master\u2019s recommended 25% attorneys\u2019 fee award. (App\u2019x 311-21.) The objectors do not contend that the District Court applied incorrect legal standards or procedures or that the Court improperly \u201cbrushed over our required analysis.\u201d <em>In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., </em>243 F.3d 722, 735 (3d Cir.2001). Rather, they disagree with the Court\u2019s factual findings as to two of the factors; they contend that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>should find an abuse of discretion because this case is \u201c \u2018neither legally nor factually complex and did not require significant motion practice or discovery\u2019 by class counsel.\u201d (Quinn Br. at 65 (quoting <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>243 F.3d at 743).)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Because of the objectors\u2019 narrow focus before us and the District Court\u2019s thorough analysis of each of the <em>Gunter </em>and <em>Prudential </em>factors, we will only address the specific objections raised herein. As an initial matter, the objectors neglect to mention the primary reason for our finding of error in <em>Cendant PRIDES </em>\u2014 the principal case advanced in support of their position. There, we criticized the district court\u2019s failure to \u201cexplicitly consider any of [the <em>Gunter </em>] factors,\u201d and its neglect to \u201c \u2018make its reasoning and application of the fee-awards jurisprudence clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>243 F.3d at 734-35 (quoting <em>Gunter, </em>223 F.3d at 196). We engaged in our own analysis of the propriety of the fee award only because the district court failed to consider the fee award factors that we had deemed \u201cessential to a proper exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735; <em>see also Ne. Women\u2019s Ctr. v. McMonagle, </em>889 F.2d 466, 475 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201c[A]n appellate court, which relies on a cold record, is even more poorly positioned to assess the nature and quality of the legal services performed at the trial court level.\u201d). We have no such concern here, as the District Court clearly set forth its reasoning for the fee award. Indeed, the objectors never explain exactly where in its lengthy analysis the District Court misapplied the <em>Gunter </em>factors; the objectors simply dislike the conclusion reached by the Court. <em>See generally McMonagle, </em>889 F.2d at 475 (\u201c[T]he appellate court may not upset a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion on the basis of a visceral disagreement with the lower court\u2019s decision.\u201d) (citation &amp; quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Moreover, the District Court\u2019s factual findings as to the complexity and demands of this case further distinguish the instant circumstances from <em>Cendant PRIDES </em>and do not suggest an abuse of discretion. As we discussed in <em>Rite Aid, </em>the <em>Cendant PRIDES </em>counsel \u201conly spent approximately 5,600 hours on the action,\u201d \u201cCendant had conceded liability and no risks pertaining to liability or collection were pertinent.\u201d 396 F.3d at 304 (discussing <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>243 F.3d at 735). These factors are absent in this case. Contrary to the objectors\u2019 contention, the Special Master and District Court both observed that counsel devoted nearly 39,000 hours to litigating this matter in the various federal and state courts and to the subsequent negotiations and disputes pertaining to the settlement itself. The Court noted that, apart from addressing complicated legal questions and the secrecy surrounding the diamond industry, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was forced to litigate against opposition from intervenors and amicus curiae, engaged in protracted settlement negotiations lasting approximately one year, and ultimately confronted the difficult settlement, distribution, and injunctive issues addressed in this appeal. (App\u2019x 317-18.) Given the complexity of the legal and factual issues implicated and the difficult questions raised in the post-settlement process, we find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the complexity and duration of the litigation supported the requested fee.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Furthermore, unlike in <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>the risk of nonpayment here remained ever-present throughout the litigation and settlement proceedings. The objectors dispute that counsel faced such risk after agreeing to settle and the depositing of the settlement amount into an escrow account. It is unclear, however, whether an agreement to settle after inception and prosecution of a matter should play a role in a court\u2019s evaluation of the risk of nonpayment; indeed, our case law has \u201cnever addressed whether courts must reconsider the risk of nonpayment as the action evolves.\u201d <em>Diet Drugs, </em>582 F.3d at 543. Although we previously approved a district court\u2019s evaluation of risk \u201cas of \u2018the inception of the action and not through the rosy lens of hindsight,\u201d\u2019 we emphasized that our endorsement took into consideration the district court\u2019s \u201cmore comprehensive\u201d reevaluation of the risk over the course of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Diet Drugs, </em>553 F.Supp.2d 442, 478 (E.D.Pa.2008)). There, we did not directly resolve whether a district court should reassess risk throughout a litigation, but found the risk of nonpayment to be ongoing, noting that while a settlement agreement and \u201cthe escrow funds undoubtedly reduced the risk of nonpayment, those funds were but one part of an intricate agreement\u201d and the efforts of counsel could still \u201chave been for naught.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Here, we are similarly satisfied that counsel faced a legitimate risk of nonpayment throughout the litigation. The District Court found that De Beers possessed few assets in the United States against which a judgment could be enforced and effectively dodged jurisdiction in the United States for over fifty years, evidencing a cognizable risk of nonpayment at the inception stage. (App\u2019x 319.) Although the District Court\u2019s order did not address the prospects for nonpayment post-settlement, it is evident that De Beers never conceded liability or admitted any wrongdoing, and that the escrow funds \u201cwere but one part of an intricate agreement\u201d that \u2014 as demonstrated by the Panel\u2019s original decision to reject settlement class certification-continued to pose a genuine risk of nonpayment to counsel. As such, the objectors\u2019 \u201cview of the risk of nonpayment is more myopic than the Court\u2019s,\u201d <em>Diet Drugs, </em>582 F.3d at 543, and we are not persuaded that the District Court abused its discretion in finding this factor to favor the requested fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Finally, the objectors\u2019 assertion that the award improperly exceeds the awards in similar cases is equally unavailing. In <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>we discussed fee awards in class actions in which the settlement fund exceeded $100 million and which relied upon the POR method, find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ing that \u201cthe attorneys\u2019 fee awards ranged from 2.8% to 36% of the total settlement fund.\u201d 243 F.3d at 737. Similarly, in <em>Rite Aid, </em>we found no abuse of discretion in a district court\u2019s reliance on three studies that demonstrated an average percentage fee recovery in large class action settlements of 31%, 27-30%, and 25-30%. 396 F.3d at 303. Here, the District Court determined that the 25% fee requested by counsel fell within this range. (App\u2019x 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We are cognizant that a comparison of this award to fees ordered in other cases is a complex analytical task, in light of variations in the efforts exerted by attorneys and the presence of complex legal and factual issues. That said, we have emphasized \u201cthat a district court may not rely on a formulaic application of the appropriate range in awarding fees but must consider the relevant circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>243 F.3d at 736. Although this case may have lacked some of the contested motion practice and extensive discovery elicited in some of the other cases receiving similar percentage awards, <em>see id. </em>at 740-41, the case presented other challenges, including \u201cDe Beers\u2019[s] denial of jurisdiction [and liability], the secrecy of the diamond industry, and unavailability of ordinary discovery methods, the substantial risk of non-collection of a U.S. judgment in foreign countries and the historic injunction obtained.\u201d (February 15, 2008 Report and Recommendation of Special Master on Incentive Awards, Cost Reimbursement &amp; Attorneys\u2019 Fee Awards at 31.) The District Court here properly considered the relevant <em>Gunter </em>and <em>Prudential </em>factors, and determined that the case presented all of the factors we had recognized as supporting a higher award: \u201ccomplex and/or novel legal issues, extensive discovery, acrimonious litigation, and tens of thousands of hours spent on the case by class counsel.\u201d (App\u2019x 320 (quoting <em>Cendant PRIDES, </em>243 F.3d at 741).)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Because the District Court employed the \u201ccorrect standards and procedures\u201d and its findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, we do not find an abuse of discretion in its calculation of the attorneys\u2019 fee award. <em>Rite Aid, </em>396 F.3d at 299.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\">. The Settlement involved five individual class actions pending in federal court and two other class suits pending in state court. The individual federal suits presently before us are: <em>Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>Index No. 04-cv-02819 (D.N.J.); <em>Null v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>Madison Co. No. 05-L-209 (Madison County, Ill. Cir. Ct., removed to S.D. Ill.); <em>Leider v.

Central Holdings Ltd., </em>No. 04-cv-04098 (D.N.J.). The two other class actions pending in state court pertinent to the Settlement and this set of appeals are: <em>Hopkins v. De Beers Centenary A.G., </em>San Francisco County No. CGC-04-432954 (Cal.Super.Ct), and <em>Cornwell v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>Maricopa Co. No. CV2005-2968 (Ariz. Super.

Because the Panel found the certification of the class to be flawed, it did not reach the Rule 23 fairness objections to the settlement, distribution plan, and fee award, or the District Court's resolution of these objections. <em>See Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 142 n. 6. Because we now conclude that the District Court\u2019s certification of the proposed settlement was appropriate, we will also address these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">.

For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">. Sightholders are selected by De Beers\u2019s subsidiary Diamond Trading Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) based upon specific criteria, \"including their financial standing and reliability, their market position, their distribution ability, their marketing ability, and their compliance with Diamond Trading Company Diamond Best Practice Principles.\u201d (App'x 1438.) In 2006, DTC had ninety-three sightholders, nine of which had head offices in the United States and seventy-six of which had sales offices in the country. <em>{Id.) </em>Sightholders sell both rough and polished diamonds, as well as diamond jewelry. <em>{Id.) </em>By way of example, the retailer Tiffany &amp; Co. is a majority-owner of the South African sightholder Rand Precision Cut Diamonds, which sells polished diamonds and manufactures jewelry for sale in Tiffany stores. <em>{Id. </em>1438-39.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b328-14\">. The process by which De Beers sold its rough diamonds entailed a \"diamond pipeline,\u201d which began with the sale of rough diamonds and ended with the purchase of retail diamond jewelry by consumers. The participants in the diamond pipeline included rough stone wholesalers, cutters and polishers of rough diamonds, finished stone wholesalers, diamond jewelry manufacturers and wholesalers, and retailers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-15\">. The theories of recovery in the individual cases are as follows: <em>Anco Industrial </em>was filed on behalf of all direct purchasers of rough diamonds pursuant to Clayton Act \u00a7\u00a7 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>and 16, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 26, to prevent and restrain violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. <em>British Diamond </em>was filed on behalf of direct purchasers of polished diamonds pursuant to Clayton Act \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 16, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 26, to prevent and restrain violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. <em>Corn-well </em>was filed on behalf of all purchasers of diamonds in Arizona pursuant to Ariz.Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 44-1402 for monopolization of the market for diamonds, and under \u00a7 44-1403 for establishment, maintenance or use of monopoly. <em>Hopkins </em>was filed on behalf of California residents who purchased diamonds in California pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 16720, <em>et seq., </em>alleging engagement in a continuing unlawful restraint of trade; pursuant to \u00a7 17200, <em>et seq., </em>for violation of the unfair competition law; and under California common law for monopolization and attempted monopolization. <em>Leider </em>was filed on behalf of consumers who purchased diamonds or diamond jewelry pursuant to the Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8-11; under \u00a7 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26, for injunctive relief in connection with \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and for damages for violations of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act; pursuant to federal and New York state common law for damages and injunctive relief; under N.Y. Gen. Bus. \u00a7\u00a7 349-350; and under New York\u2019s Donnelly Act and the antitrust laws of fifteen other states and the District of Columbia. <em>Null </em>was filed on behalf of all purchasers of De Beers diamonds pursuant to 815 111. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 505/1, <em>et seq., </em>and \u00a7 510/2, alleging unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and, in the alternative, pursuant to the consumer fraud and deceptive practice laws of the various states where purchases of diamonds were made. <em>Sullivan </em>was filed on behalf of a class of all persons and businesses in the United States who purchased polished diamonds indirectly from De Beers pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act for injunctive relief, and pursuant to state antitrust and deceptive practices acts for monetary relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">. The <em>Leider </em>plaintiffs subsequently reached agreement with the parties to the Indirect Purchaser Settlement to resolve that matter in accordance with the terms of the Settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. The Indirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass is estimated to contain between 67 and 117 million members, while the Indirect Purchaser Reseller Subclass contains an estimated 38,152 members. The Direct Purchaser Class is estimated to contain approximately 130 members. (App\u2019x 275 n.l.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b331-15\">. The Special Master advised that distribution of the Direct Purchaser Settlement Fund be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>conducted on a pro rata basis and that each Direct Class member receive the Net Settlement amount multiplied by the quotient of the Adjusted Purchases of the claimant divided by the aggregate Adjusted Purchases of all approved direct purchaser claims. The Adjusted Purchases of a claimant would be calculated by multiplying the amount paid for Rough Diamonds by 1.22 (the average Rough to Polished Matrix factor), and adding the total amount paid for Polished Diamonds. (App\u2019x 1533-34.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. The Special Master recommended that the Indirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass receive a pro rata share of the Indirect Purchaser Settlement Fund, calculated by multiplying the Net Consumer settlement fund amount by the quotient of a consumer's total recognized diamond claim divided by the total recognized diamond claims of all consumers. (App\u2019x 1547.) In contrast, a Reseller Subclass member's claim would be calculated in a three step process: (1) all of the claimant's diamond purchases are converted to the common metric of polished wholesale value and adjusted to reflect the number of years each Reseller operated during the class period; (2) claims are weighted by applying the absorption weighting factor derived from a fixed effects regression analysis for each type of diamond purchase; and (3) the claimant's pro rata share of the Reseller Subclass settlement fund is the ratio of the claimant's \"absorption adjusted purchases\u201d to the sum of all claimants' \"absorption adjusted purchases.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>1575.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\">. The Special Master's report noted that Indirect Purchaser Consumer claims aggregating less than $165 for mixed stone jewelry or products, and less than $95 for diamond only jewelry or products, would be considered <em>de minimis. </em>(App'x 1547-48.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\">. Additionally, the Special Master recommended a four-part notification program\u2014 entailing direct notice, publication notice, \"earned media outreach\u201d in the form of press releases and news reporting, and electronic notice \u2014 finding that it provided notice \"in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposed settlement.\u201d (App\u2019x 1518-27 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)).) The District Court adopted this recommendation and method of notification in its October 1, 2007 Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\">. The District Court rejected the Special Master's recommendation of adding a percentage of the interest earned on the total settlement fund to the total attorneys' fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">.

A related objection was filed on grounds that the equal allocation of the Indirect Purchaser Settlement Fund without consideration of a claimant\u2019s state of controlling law was improper since some states purportedly prohibited recovery by indirect purchasers. These objectors asserted that class members from states permitting indirect purchaser recovery should be entitled to greater monetary compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">. As the Panel Opinion noted, the parties did not explain, nor did the record reveal, any reason for the disparity in the time periods covered by the Settlement between the Indirect and Direct Purchaser classes. <em>See Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 143 n. 8. We do not consider this difference pertinent to the appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b335-11\">. Based on its assessment, the Panel found that at least twenty-five states and the District of Columbia possess <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealer statutes or have judicially extended antitrust standing to indirect purchasers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">. As mentioned above, because the Panel concluded that certification was inappropriate, it did not reach the Special Master's recommendations or the objections to the disIribution plan and fee award. <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 142 n. 6. In light of our finding that class certification is appropriate, we assess these objections for the first time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. The objectors also challenge the District Court's purported failure to identify the state law claims that should receive class treatment under the existing certification order, as we discuss below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. As mentioned, certain states have enacted statutes known as <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>repealers,\u201d which extend antitrust standing to indirect purchasers and consumers. <em>See supra </em>n. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">. Contrary to the objectors' and the Panel\u2019s view that <em>Warfarin\u2019s </em>analysis is inapplicable because the plaintiffs in that case purportedly shared a common claim under the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, our holding in <em>Warfarin </em>did not address the Delaware statute in analyzing predominance. 391 F.3d at 528-29. Indeed, <em>Warfarin </em>did not consider whether every class member even possessed a claim under Delaware law, nor did it undertake a choice-of-law analysis to determine whether all members in the nationwide class could assert a claim under the Delaware statute. Rather, we simply concluded that any claims arising under the varying state laws and the Delaware statute could be proved with common evidence, thereby supporting a finding of predominance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b341-11\">. A comparable approach is evidenced in our decision in <em>Prudential, </em>where we affirmed the district court's finding of predominance based upon the central issue in the case' \u2014 a common nationwide scheme of deceptive conduct by the defendant to defraud millions of customers. 148 F.3d at 315. Similarly, in <em>Linerboard, </em>we noted that the \u201ccritical inquiry will be whether defendants successfully concealed the existence <em>of </em>the alleged conspiracy,\u201d and \u201cthe fact of <em>concealment </em>[] is the polestar in an analysis of fraudulent concealment.\u201d 305 F.3d at 163 (emphasis in original). Because it was the defendant's conduct that demanded attention, we found that \u201callegations of proof are all common to the defendants, not the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. No one seriously disputes that De Beers's alleged conduct, if true, was anticompetitive and violated state antitrust laws. Our disagreement with the dissent arises solely out of the question whether certain class members\u2019 potential inability to satisfy some states\u2019 statutory standing requirements should have precluded the District Court from certifying the settlement class in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b342-9\">. As we noted in <em>Insurance Brokerage, </em>we do not presume here \"that common issues necessarily predominate in every antitrust case.\u201d 579 F.3d at 267 n. 26 (citing <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 321-22). Here, we merely conclude that the District Court was free to determine that common issues of law or fact stemming from De Beers\u2019s conduct in this instance satisfied the predominance requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">. Other courts have similarly declined to examine the controlling substantive law pertinent to asserted claims at the class certification stage. <em>See, e.g., Schumacher </em>v. <em>Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., </em>221 F.R.D. 605, 612 (D.S.D. 2004) (\"Where federal claims and common law claims are predicated on the same factual allegations and proof will be essentially the same, \u2018even if the law of different states might ultimately govern the common law claims\u2014 an issue that need not and is not decided at this juncture \u2014 certification of the class for the whole action is appropriate.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Walsh v.

We do not reach this conclusion so as to allow district courts to \"shirk\u201d the requirements of Rule 23 when certifying the class, as the dissent suggests. (Dissenting Op. at 348 n. 13.) We do not ignore the differences in state law, but rather find, based on our precedent, that those differences do not defeat predominance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\">. In conducting the analysis in <em>Warfarin, </em>we expressly distinguished the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>In re Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., 288 </em>F.3d 1012 (7th Cir.2002), in which certification of a nationwide class arising under the tort laws of all fifty states was sought for purposes of litigation, rather than settlement. 391 F.3d at 529.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b346-4\">. We are aware that there may still be circumstances, as we and other Courts of Appeals have noted, where \" '[i]n a multi-state class action, variations in state law may swamp any common issues and defeat predominance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klay v.

But these decisions are inapplicable here, as the certification orders at issue pertained to litigation classes and were preoccupied with the attendant manageability aspects of certification. More explicitly, the courts expressed unease that if \"more than a few of the laws of the fifty states differ, the district judge would face an impossible task of instructing a jury on the relevant law,\u201d and noted \u201cthe difficulties in trying the [] claims on a class basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation &amp; quotations omitted). Unlike those situations \"where the certification inquiry [is] set against the backdrop of an impending trial,\u201d <em>Ins. Broker., </em>579 F.3d at 269, the settlement context here does not present equivalent concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">. Unsurprisingly, we are not alone in recognizing the \"key\u201d distinction between certification for settlement purposes versus litigation, and \"courts are more inclined to find the predominance test met [in the settlement context], even when there are differences in applicable state laws.\u201d <em>Ersler v.

Although we will not here speculate as to the type of \"situations where variations in state laws are so significant so as to defeat commonality and predominance even in a settlement class certification,\u201d <em>Warfarin, </em>391 F.3d at 530, we are confident that the several common questions of law or fact arising from a \"single central issue\u201d \u2014 namely, De Beers's alleged anticompetitive conduct and the resulting injury caused to each class member\u2014 predominate over any issues concerning individual class members, <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 314 (citation &amp; quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\">. As noted, the Panel conducted an extensive review of relevant state statutes and reached the conclusion that \u201cindirect purchasers do not have a right to recover in all states, and, therefore, no question of law or fact regarding their legal rights is uniform throughout the class.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b348-4\">. The Panel echoed the objectors\u2019 position, concluding after examining the laws of fifty states that many jurisdictions \"categorically foreclosed\u201d a legal right to recover on the merits to indirect purchasers. <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 151 n. 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b348-5\">. The marginal role played by the question of \"validity\u201d of claims in class settlement certification situations is further evidenced by considering our subsequent <em>Prudential </em>decision. <em>See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., </em>261 F.3d 355, 366 (3d Cir.2001) <em>(\"Prudential II </em>\u201d). There, we released all state-law claims \u2014 including unnamed claims \u2014 \"arising from the same nucleus of operative facts as the claims\u201d actually considered by the Court without adjudicating the validity of those other allegations. <em>Id. </em>We observed that \"a judgment pursuant to a class settlement can bar later claims based on the allegations underlying the claims in the set-tied class action\u201d even where the \u201cprecluded claim was not presented, and could not have been presented, in the class action itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We reasoned that while our \"power to release those claims as part of a judgment\u201d may \"seem anomalous,\u201d \"we have endorsed the rule because it 'serves the important policy interest of judicial economy by permitting parties to enter into comprehensive settlements that \"prevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>TBK Partners, Ltd. v. Western Union Corp., </em>675 F.2d 456, 460 (2d Cir.1982)). As such, the unidentified prospective claims could be included in the settlement without adjudication of their validity since they arose from the identical fraudulent scheme perpetrated by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. The objectors\u2019 associated argument that the predominance inquiry presupposes that every putative class members possesses at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>least a single valid cause of action likewise misses the point. While Rule 23 may presuppose that every class member does actually allege a predominantly common claim against a defendant, Rule 23 does not mandate that each of these claims must be shown capable of prevailing on the merits at the certification stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. To further clarify, we use the term \u2018'statutory standing\u201d to refer to the possession of a viable claim or right to relief, not to a jurisdictional requirement. <em>See generally Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, </em>523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct 1003, <em>140 </em>L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (\"It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction,\u201d and \"jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action\u201d) (citations and alterations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">. The Panel analyzed the antitrust claims separately from the consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims, seemingly concluding that plaintiffs could only prevail if each putative class member alleged either a \"uniform\u201d antitrust cause of action, a \u201cuniform\u201d consumer protection cause of action, or a \"uniform\u201d unjust enrichment claim. <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 146, 150. We will not read into Rule 23 this heightened threshold requirement that plaintiffs must allege an identical cause of action, when all that is required is that common issues of law or fact predominate over questions particular to individual class members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\">. The dissent describes this requirement in varied ways: under their view, class members who, \"according to the plain terms of controlling law have no claim at all\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 347 n. 11), have \"no legal claim\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 340), have \"no cause of action,\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 341), have a claim \u201cclearly lacking a colorable basis\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 346), or have a claim \"nonexistent as a matter of substantive law\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 345), are barred from partaking in this class action settlement. The problem with this requirement, however, is that in order to separate class members possessing an \"existent\u201d legal claim from those possessing a \u201cnonexistent\u201d one, district courts would have to perform a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry into each class member's claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\">. At the same time, it is by no means clear that the dissent\u2019s proposed analysis could be cabined to only consider the differing statutory standing requirements in the process of evaluating the validity of claims. As discussed <em>supra, </em>statutory standing for indirect purchasers is treated as but one element of a cause of action, rather than a jurisdictional requirement, as the dissent mistakenly suggests. If a district court were required to evaluate the statutory standing element to assess a claim\u2019s viability, logic and consistency suggest that the court should also consider other aspects of a claim for Rule 12(b)(6) and other deficiencies. This approach would delay proceedings in the trial court, as it would require the parties to engage in ill-timed, protracted merits litigation at the class certification stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">. Application of the proposed inquiry to the instant matter demonstrates the likely obstacles the District Court would encounter under this approach. The objectors present Ohio\u2019s statutory regime as emblematic of the impropriety of the type of class settlement certification at issue here. Citing the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. Microsoft Corp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 278, 834 N.E.2d 791 (2005), they urge that Ohio law prohibits all indirect purchaser claims asserting violations of Ohio antitrust law, common law claims for unjust enrichment where a purchaser cannot establish that he conferred a benefit upon a defendant, and claims alleging violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act predicated upon monopolistic pricing practices. (Quinn Br. at 60-61.) As a result, they insist that, \u2019\u2019[d]irectly contrary to the district court's [certification], an Ohio class member does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>have a valid claim under Ohio law.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 61.) The objectors contend that a similar problem exists for other <em>Illinois Brick </em>states. This inference is flawed for several reasons. First, the objectors fail to engage in the type of choice-of-law exercise necessitated by their proposed approach \u2014 the evaluation of whether an Ohio class member is asserting a claim pursuant to Ohio law or pursuant to the law of a repealer state or a state affording an alternative basis for recovery. Undoubtedly, this analysis would present significant hurdles and potentially alter the presumed outcome. Second, although <em>Johnson </em>provides that an indirect purchaser lacking an antitrust claim under <em>Illinois Brick </em>cannot circumvent this limitation by relying upon the Ohio consumer protection statute, the Ohio -Supreme Court did not, nor could it, preclude consumer protection claims predicated on fraud or deception. As the plaintiffs point out, the claims settled here include allegations of fraud and deception separate from the antitrust allegations, suggesting that some avenue of recovery arising from the same defendant conduct remains available to indirect purchasers even in Ohio. <em>{See </em>Pis.' Br. in Response to Quinn\u2019s Response to Class Counsel's Mot. for Leave to File Record Excerpts 13-14.) Finally, if the court is to evaluate the viability of plaintiffs\u2019 statutory standing element under Ohio law at the class certification stage, the objectors presented no sensible reason why the court should not likewise inspect the viability of every other aspect of an antitrust, consumer protection, or unjust enrichment claim, such as statutes of limitation, conditions precedent to suit, and the like. We do not doubt that such an exhaustive analysis would produce absurd results and cause undue delay in our trial courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">. Of course, some global settlements may nevertheless be rejected for failing to meet the requirements of Rule 23. In <em>Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999), the Supreme Court rejected a global settlement in a mandatory class action based on a limited fund theory under Rule 23(b)(1)(B). There, the plaintiffs seeking class certification failed to demonstrate that the fund available to pay claims was limited beyond the fund amount agreed to by the parties. There, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) were not met; here, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. The Panel agreed with this characterization, holding that \"the order contravenes the Rules Enabling Act\u201d because it \"extends antitrust remedies that, in many instances, have no root in state substantive law.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 149. The Panel rejected the argument that De Beers\u2019s willingness to stipulate to liability obviated this concern, noting that a court was obligated even in the settlement context to ensure that all of Rule 23\u2019s requirements were met and could not \"effectively grant[] relief to individuals to whom De Beers had no antitrust liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dissent repeats this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">. The Panel agreed with this argument, noting that certain states\u2019 \"categorical refus[al] to allow indirect purchasers to bring a price-fixing claim\" was \"not trivial\" and represented \"fundamental policy differences among the several states.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 152, 148. The Panel concluded that these state interests were in effect \"subordinated to De Beers's desire to resolve all indirect purchaser claims simultaneously\u201d and \"in a quest to clear the queue in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152 (citation &amp; quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">. The dissent concludes that approving class certification here endorses the enlargement of substantive rights because had some class members brought these claims individually in state court, they would \"be immediately shown the exit.\u201d (Dissenting Op. at 352.) This is incorrect, for the state court would not automatically dismiss them without a motion from De Beers. More significantly, nothing would prevent De Beers from settling those claims in lieu of moving to dismiss them, and doing so in that scenario would not be an enlargement of substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In responding to this point, the dissent equates an objection to class certification with a motion to dismiss, but such treatment demonstrates the very flaw in its position. Class certification and motions to dismiss involve two distinct (and different) standards, and the former does not permit as extensive an inquiry into the merits as the latter does. <em>(See </em>Dissenting Op. at 352-53 n. 21.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\">. The dissent decries this position, contending that including Indirect Purchasers in the class who could not, on an individual basis, state a claim for recovery impermissibly modifies the rights of those Indirect Purchasers who could recover individually. In so asserting, the dissent assumes that the size of the settlement fund would be the same if the Indirect Purchasers who cannot recover individually were excluded from the class. Surely this cannot be the case, for the settlement amount to which De Beers has agreed must be based in large part on the number of potential class members and on securing global peace. Had those Indirect Purchasers who could not recover individually been excluded, we seriously doubt that the Indirect Purchaser settlement fund would still be $272.5 million.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b356-5\">.

Although the experts mentioned that De Beers lost its dominant share of an increasingly competitive market, the experts never opined \u2014 as the objectors contend \u2014 that plaintiffs face no significant threat of future antitrust harm.

The Special Master \u2014 whose findings were accepted by the District Court\u2014 thoroughly considered several expert reports and econometric models submitted by various counsel discussing the proper share of damages within the Indirect Purchaser class. The Special Master established an appropriate distribution of the Indirect Purchaser fund based upon estimated damages to both the Consumer and Reseller subclasses, and the objectors have not demonstrated the inaccuracy of this analysis. <em>(See </em>App'x 1473-1508.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">.

Nonetheless, class settlement in mass tort cases (especially personal injury claims) remains problematic, leading some practitioners to avoid the class action device\u2014 most prominently in the recent $4.85 billion mass settlement of 50,000 claims arising out of use of the drug Vioxx. In fact, some observers believe there has been a shift in mass personal injury claims to aggregate non-class settlements. \u201cThe <em>Zyprexa </em>and <em>Ephedra </em>settlements, as well as the more recent <em>Guidant </em>and <em>Vioxx </em>settlements, suggest that the MDL process has supplemented and perhaps displaced the class action device as a procedural mechanism for large settlements.\u201d Thomas E.

Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551-52, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>(2011); <em>In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., </em>552 F.3d 305, 315-21 (3d Cir.2008); <em>In re Initial Pub.

A key question in a litigation class action is manageability\u2014 how the case will or can be tried, and whether there are questions of fact or law that are capable of common proof. But the settlement class presents no management problems because the case will not be tried. Conversely, other inquiries assume heightened importance and heightened scrutiny because of the danger of conflicts of interest, collusion, and unfair allocation. <em>See Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (\u201c[OJther specifications of the Rule [23] \u2014 those designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions \u2014 demand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the settlement context.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In conducting a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d under Rule 23, lower courts have applied the strictures laid down in <em>Amchem </em>and <em>Ortiz, </em>and added some of their own. So far, the developing jurisprudence appears to have justified the judgment of the Judicial Conference\u2019s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and Advisory Committee on Civil Rules to defer consideration of a variant rule for settlement class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Rule 23(a) sensibly provides that every certified class must share common questions of law or fact. For (b)(3) classes, common questions must predominate over individual questions, claims must be typical, and the class action device must be superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. Naturally, there is some overlap in the requirements for commonality, typicality, and predominance \u2014 all of which must be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Commonality for a settlement class should be satisfied under the standard for supplemental jurisdiction first set forth in <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), allowing joinder of claims deriving from a common nucleus of operative fact. <em>See also Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v.

Variation in state law should not necessarily bar class certification. The focus in the settlement context should be on the conduct (or misconduct) of the defendant and the injury suffered as a consequence. The claim or claims must be related and cohesive and should all arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact. The \u201ccommon contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution \u2014 which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. The interests of the class members should be aligned.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The nature of the predominance analysis reflects the purpose of the inquiry, which is to determine whether \u201ca class action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote ... uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 615, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 advisory committee note). This is important even though, in the settlement context, a court need not worry about the challenge of litigating the claims to a verdict in a single proceeding. If the class presented a grab-bag of unrelated claims, a trial court would be unable to ensure that absent class members\u2019 interests were protected. The question, then, is what kind of common issues a settlement class must share to satisfy commonality and predominance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">In certain areas, such as antitrust, common issues tend to predominate because a major focus is the allegedly anticompetitive conduct of the defendant and its downstream effects on plaintiffs. <em>See In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., </em>579 F.3d 241, 268 (3d Cir.2009). Commonality and predominance are usually met in the antitrust settlement context when all class members\u2019 claims present common issues including (1) whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was actionably anticompetitive under antitrust standards; and (2) whether that conduct produced anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets. <em>See id. </em>at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Even when a settlement class satisfies the predominance requirement, the inclusion of members who have a questionable chance of a favorable adjudication may present fairness concerns that demand the district court\u2019s attention. Trial courts must enforce the Rule 23(a) and (b) requirements in order to obtain a \u201cstructural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals affected.\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 627, 117 S.Ct. 2231. In discharging this responsibility, district courts have a number of ways to address fairness concerns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Due to the context-specific nature of these judgments, district courts should be afforded a broad ambit of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">For viable settlement classes, <em>Amchem </em>and <em>Ortiz </em>made clear that expediency could not negate the requirements of Rule 23, which serve to protect absent class members. <em>See Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 621, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (\u201cSubdivisions (a) and (b) [of Rule 23] focus court attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity so that absent members can be fairly bound by decisions of class representatives. That dominant concern persists when settlement, rather than trial, is proposed.\u201d). The principal danger of collusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>lies in the prospect that class counsel, induced by defendants\u2019 offer of attorneys\u2019 fees, will \u201ctrade away\u201d the claims of some or all class members for inadequate compensation. There is also the possibility that a settlement will not serve the interests of all of the class members, which may be in tension. In <em>Amchem, </em>for instance, the Court concluded the settlement was not demonstrably fair-there was insufficient allocation to asbestos claimants who were seriously injured (e.g. mesothelioma) and insufficient protection of non-impaired plaintiffs. 521 U.S. at 625-28, 117 S.Ct. 2231. The Court worried that the claims of the exposure-only class members were being released without adequate protection. <em>IcL; see also In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., </em>148 F.3d 283, 315 (3d Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cPrudential\u201d) </em>(identifying and distinguishing Amchem\u2019s concerns); <em>In re Gen. Motors Corp. PickUp Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liability Litig., </em>55 F.3d 768, 784-86 (3d Cir.1995) (providing summary of the debate regarding propriety of mass tort settlements prior to Amchem).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">These observations elucidate the issues of predominance and fairness present in this case. Here, the objectors contend certain claims (claims under state-law following <em>Illinois </em>Brick) are not viable \u2014 that is, they fail to state a cause of action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For this reason, objectors believe that defendants are barred from settling these claims in a settlement class action because of the predominance requirement. Under objectors\u2019 view of Rule 23, trial courts would be obligated at the settlement class certification stage to decide which state\u2019s law would govern for that particular plaintiff, and whether a plaintiff has stated a valid cause of action, even if no defendant has raised a Rule 12(b)(6) objection \u2014 the usual way to contest the validity of a claim. Objectors contend they seek to protect absent class members, but fail to explain how absent class members \u2014 all of whom claim injury \u2014 are harmed by the defendants\u2019 willingness to settle all potential claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">This interpretation also presents significant administrative problems. Objectors view the indirect purchaser class as composed of members who either have valid claims under the laws of states with <em>Illinois Brick </em>repealers or members who have invalid claims under the laws of non-repealer states. But a claim cannot be declared invalid without proper analysis, which would require a choice-of-law examination for each class member\u2019s claim. Such analyses may pose difficulties in cases where the residence of the class member is not the sole consideration; modern choice-of-law standards often consider an array of factors particular to individual plaintiffs. Consequently, individual 12(b)(6) inquiries for settlement class certification could present serious difficulties in administration and greatly increase costs and fees, and may deplete rather than increase the recovery of even successful plaintiffs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Issues of predominance and fairness do not undermine this settlement. All plaintiffs here claim injury that by reason of defendants\u2019 conduct \u2014 market manipulation and fraud \u2014 has caused a common and measurable form of economic damage. They seek redress under federal antitrust laws and state antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment laws. All claims arise out of the same course of defendants\u2019 conduct; all share a common nucleus of operative fact, supplying the necessary cohesion. Class members\u2019 interests are aligned. The entire DeBeers settlement class consists of members with some pleaded claim (but not necessarily the exact same one) arising out of the same course of allegedly wrongful conduct such that shared issues of fact or law outweigh issues not common to the class and individual issues do not predominate. As the class structure and settlement assure fairness to all class members, there appears to be nothing in Rule 23 that would prohibit certification and settlement approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Moreover, the focus on the alleged insufficiency of some members\u2019 claims is misplaced. Settlement of a class action is not an adjudication of the merits of the members\u2019 claims. It is a contract between the parties governed by the requirements of Rule 23(a), (b), and particularly (e),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and establishes a contractual obligation as well as a contractual defense against future claims. Here, class members and DeBeers want to settle all state and federal claims arising out of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct. <em>Amchem </em>recognized the legitimacy of such a settlement under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>23, setting forth applicable parameters. The court\u2019s responsibility is to supervise and assume control over a responsible and fair settlement. Those requirements have been met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">A responsible and fair settlement serves the interests of both plaintiffs and defendants and furthers the aims of the class action device. Plaintiffs receive redress of their claimed injuries without the burden of litigating individually. Defendants receive finality. Having released their claims for consideration, class members are precluded from continuing to press their claims. Collateral attack of settlements and parallel proceedings in multiple fora are common realities in modern class actions \u2014 features that can imperil the feasibility of settlements if defendants lack an effective way to protect bargained-for rights. <em>See Prudential, </em>314 F.3d at 104-OS. If the indirect-purchaser claims at issue here were excluded, nothing would bar the plaintiffs from bringing them as separate class actions or as aggregate individual actions, leaving defendants \u201cexposed to countless suits in state court\u201d despite the settlement. <em>In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., </em>261 F.3d 355, 367 (3d Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cPrudential II\u201d). </em>(Here, prior to removal and MDL consolidation, it appears an Illinois state court certified a nationwide litigation class asserting indirect-purchaser claims under the laws of all 50 states.) Perhaps a defendant will be willing and able to defend or settle all of these actions separately, or perhaps it won\u2019t. Either way, the costs (direct and indirect) and risks of continuing litigation will be greater. A defendant, therefore, may be motivated to pay class members a premium and achieve a global settlement in order to avoid additional lawsuits, even ones where it might be able to file a straightforward motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Finally, new limitations such as those proposed by objectors would, I believe, undercut the policy goals of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\u201cCAFA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, and the Multidistrict Litigation Statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, both of which are designed to encourage the consolidation of mass claims national in scope \u2014 and in the case of CAFA, with particular reference to class actions based on state law claims. Of course, district courts must fully enforce the requirements of Rule 23. But the limitations objectors propose here \u201cwould seriously undermine the possibility for settling any large, multi district class action.\u201d <em>Prudential II, </em>261 F.3d at 367.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The class action device and the concept of the private attorney general are powerful instruments of social and economic policy. Despite inherent tensions, they have proven efficacious in resolving mass claims when courts have insisted on structural, procedural, and substantive fairness. Among the goals are redress of injuries, procedural due process, efficiency, horizontal equity among injured claimants, and finality. Arguably a legal system that permits robust litigation of mass claims should also provide ways to fairly and effectively resolve those claims. Otherwise, mass claims will likely be resolved without independent review and court supervision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b382-4\">JORDAN, Circuit Judge, joined by SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">This is the Majority\u2019s considered view of the law: in certifying a class action, it makes no difference whether the class is defined to include members who lack any claim at all. As my colleagues in the Majority see it, \u201cwere we to mandate that a class include only those alleging \u2018color-able\u2019 claims, we would effectively rule out the ability of a defendant to achieve \u2018global peace\u2019 by obtaining releases from all those who might wish to assert claims, meritorious or not.\u201d (Op. at 310.) So, \u201ccome one, come all,\u201d regardless of substantive legal rights. That remarkable declaration sets the class action ship in our Circuit badly adrift.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">To be clear, the problem with the enormous, nationwide class most particularly at issue in this case is not that it may include people with marginal or dubious claims. The class of indirect purchasers of De Beers diamonds actually presents a far more troubling problem than that. It includes people who have no legal claim whatsoever. That is clear on the face of the statutory and decisional law of several states whose laws are invoked as the basis for this class action,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and no one has been able to mount a cogent argument to the contrary. Despite the Majority\u2019s elaborate construction and dismantling of straw man arguments about commonality and predominance, those state laws ought to stand as an insurmountable barrier to any proper certification of a nationwide indirect purchaser class. By treating the dictates of state law as irrelevant, to be passed over in the name of \u201cglobal peace,\u201d the Majority has endorsed the fabrication of substantive rights where none before existed. This is, in short, a bad day for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Rule 23, for federalism, and for those who thought the Rules Enabling Act was a restraint on judicial legislating. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">1. Where We Agree</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The Majority devotes much attention to the question of whether \u201ccommonality and predominance are defeated merely because available rights and remedies differ under the several laws that form the basis for the class claims.\u201d (Op. at 301.) In addressing that question, the Majority inaccurately characterizes the now-vacated panel opinion as having required \u201cthat everyone in a class must allege precisely identical or \u2018uniform\u2019 causes of action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Op. at 302) (citing <em>Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>613 F.3d 134, 149 (3d Cir.2010), <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted and vacated by Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>619 F.3d 287 (3d Cir.2010)). But the panel opinion made no such statement, nor have the objectors claimed that all class members must share a \u201cuniform cause of action.\u201d The only \u201cuniformity\u201d required by the panel opinion, or argued for by the objectors, is that at least some \u201cquestion of law or fact regarding [class members\u2019] legal rights [be] uniform throughout the class.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 149. Insisting that there be a uniform question of law or fact is nothing more than an application of the Rule 23(a)(2) requirement that there be \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d The Majority\u2019s assertion that the panel demanded there be uniform causes of action \u2014 a requirement far different than requiring uniform questions \u2014 is unfounded and should not detain us any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">On this much we can agree: that, as the Majority says, \u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s singular conduct gives rise to one cause of action in one state, while providing for a different cause of action in another jurisdiction, the courts may group both claims in a single class action.\u201d (Op. at 302.) If that were the case before us, we would have unanimity. The problem, though, is that the defendants\u2019 singular conduct here gives rise to causes of action in some states while providing for no cause of action at all in others. Under these circumstances, there can be no grouping of claims into a single class action, because, by definition, some would-be class members have no claim. As a result, and as discussed in the following section, there can be no common questions of law or fact with respect to that subset of would-be class members and, therefore, neither the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) nor the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) can be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">II. Commonality And Predominance Under Rule 23</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">The objectors<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have challenged the commonality of the indirect purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>class, stating that \u201cputative class members who do not even have an arguable cause of action under applicable law do not qualify for inclusion in a class action for failure to satisfy [the] Rule 23(a)(2) requirement of \u2018questions of law or fact common to the class.\u2019 \u201d (Supplemental Brief of Appellant Susan M. Quinn on Rehearing En Banc at 11-12) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2).) While they initially couched their arguments about commonality in terms of predominance under Rule 23(b)(3), the objectors\u2019 position has always been that common questions of law or fact do not predominate because there simply are no questions of law or fact common to the entire class of indirect purchasers. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Brief for Appellant Susan M. Quinn at 32 (\u201cThe evidence supporting a lack of commonality is abundant.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 38 (\u201c[T]he question of antitrust conspiracy is not common to the class.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 44 (\u201cThe district court did not even determine that there was a common question involving unjust enrichment.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 45 (\u201cThe district court did not find a common question regarding [the consumer protection/deceptive trade practice] claims.\u201d).) The panel opinion thus addressed the objectors\u2019 arguments in that light, holding that there was no predominance because there were no questions of law or fact common to the entire class. <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 148 (\u201c[T]here can be no certification of a nationwide class of state indirect purchaser plaintiffs because there is no common question of law or material fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Ultimately, though, whether the objectors\u2019 argument is framed as a Rule 23(a)(2) commonality challenge or a Rule 23(b)(3) predominance challenge is immaterial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As noted by the Majority, we have said before that \u2018\u201cwe consider the Rule 23(a) commonality requirement to be incorporated into the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement, and therefore deem it appropriate to analyze the two factors together.\u2019 \u201d (Op. at 297 (quoting <em>In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., </em>579 F.3d 241, 266 (3d Cir.2009)).) Whatever label we hang on the objectors\u2019 argument, it always has been clear that their basic contention is that there are no questions of law or fact common to all class members, which necessarily means that common questions do not predominate. Whether coined as a Rule 23(a)(2) problem or as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Rule 23(b)(3) problem, the determinative question of commonality is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Majority spends little time explaining what makes questions \u201ccommon,\u201d but the principle they seem to espouse is that questions are common when the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct was common as to all of the class members\u201d and when \u201call of the class members were harmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (Op. at 298.) Based on that, the Majority asserts that, as to the indirect purchaser class, \u201ceach class member shares a similar <em>legal </em>question arising from whether De Beers engaged in a broad conspiracy that was aimed to and did affect diamond prices in the United States\u201d (Op. at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted)) and shares \u201ccommon <em>factual </em>questions as to whether De Beers \u2018acted in concert to artificially fix, maintain, and stabilize prices and to monopolize trade and commerce in the market for polished diamonds.\u2019 \u201d (Op. at 300 (quoting App. 278-79).) Those questions are common to the class, according to the Majority, because the \u201callegations are unaffected by the particularized conduct of individual class members, as proof of liability and liability itself would depend entirely upon De Beers\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities.\u201d (Op. at 300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In seeking to justify its \u201cwelcome all comers\u201d approach to class certification, the Majority has produced an internally inconsistent definition of commonality. On the one hand, as just noted, the Majority emphasizes that \u201cproof of liability and liability itself would depend entirely upon De Beers\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive activities\u201d (Op. at 300), as if no reference need be made to the status of individual class members. Indeed, if one examines what the Majority identifies as \u201ccommon <em>factual </em>questions\u201d and \u201csimilar <em>legal </em>question[s,]\u201d it is apparent that no reference to anyone but De Beers is called for, which means that the class is entirely unbounded. Everyone in the world could share in a class defined on those lines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the other hand, evidently recognizing the problem with a commonality definition that looks only at De Beers\u2019s activities, the Majority adds as something of an afterthought that, well yes, there must be some limiting feature of the class and that feature is injury; class members must have been injured by De Beers\u2019s unlawful conduct. (Op. at 297-98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Of course, as soon as one acknowledges that commonality requires a consideration of whether class members have sustained injury, one ought also have to acknowledge, by logic grounded in hornbook law, that \u201cinjury\u201d is not an abstraction but rather refers to a concrete and legally cognizable injury. A definition of commonality that says, in effect, \u201cif you feel wronged, you have a claim\u201d is a giant step away from precedent and the underlying premise of Rule 23, which is designed to efficiently handle claims recognized by law, not to create new claims. <em>Cf. Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1431, 1442, 176 L.Ed.2d 311 (2010) (\u201cCongress authorized ... promulgation] [of] rules of procedure subject to its review, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(a), but with the limitation that those rules \u2018shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u2019 \u00a7 2072(b).\u201d). Never before has any court, to my knowledge, tried to take the position effectively adopted by the Majority here, namely that, in deciding commonality, one need not be concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>with whether the alleged injuries of class members are legally cognizable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In stark contrast to the Majority\u2019s practically limitless definition of commonality is the measured definition provided by the Supreme Court in its recent decision in <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011). The Court there clarified the meaning of \u201ccommonality\u201d under Rule 23, saying that the concept is \u201ceasy to misread.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2551. In a passage particularly apropos of the Majority\u2019s new rule, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">[A]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common \u2018questions,\u2019 For example: Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart? Do our managers have discretion over pay? Is that an unlawful employment practice? What remedies should we get? Reciting those questions is not sufficient to obtain class certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Emphasizing a point that the Majority ignores, the Court explained that \u201c \u2018[w]hat matters to class certification ... is not the raising of common \u201cquestions\u201d\u2014 even in droves \u2014 but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate <em>answers </em>apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Richard A. Nagareda, <em>Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, </em>84 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 97, 132 (2009)). In other words, common questions must have answers that \u201cwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, as defined by <em>Dukes, </em>\u201ccommon questions\u201d are those that, because they have answers that will affect the validity of all class members\u2019 claims, can be said to be legally relevant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">A necessary corollary of that definition is that, for there to be any common questions, all class members must have at least some colorable legal claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Otherwise, it is nonsense to speak of \u201cresolv[ing] an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>It cannot be sufficient, as the Concurring Opinion in this case suggests, simply for each class member to have \u201csome pleaded claim.\u201d (Concurrence Op. at 338.) Merely pleading a claim is not enough, because \u201cRule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. A party seeking class certification must ... prove that there are in fact ... common questions of law or fact....

The court may delve beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements for class certification are satisfied.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). As the panel opinion explained it, \u201cto obtain certification of an indirect purchaser class, plaintiffs would have to show that all class members share a right to recover for antitrust harms, such that one or more common issues affect all members\u2019 claims.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>Dukes\u2019s </em>instruction that, for questions to be \u201ccommon\u201d in the sense contemplated by Rule 23, their answers must affect the validity of claims, does not set forth a new principle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Amchem Products, Inc. v.

It seems self-evident that there can be no \u201cgenuine controversy\u201d with respect to plaintiffs whose claims are nonexistent as a matter of substantive law. Likewise, in <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>we noted that Rule 23 requires plaintiffs to show that the elements of their claim are \u201ccapable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members.\u201d 552 F.3d at 311-12. Again, for plaintiffs who lack any claim, there are certainly no elements of a claim that are \u201ccapable of proof,\u201d either common or individual. Accordingly, in assessing commonality or predominance, an inherent step is deciding that class members possess at least some legal basis for asserting a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">By misconstruing Supreme Court precedent, the Majority denies that district courts have either the need or the power to take that essential step. My colleagues declare that \u201c[a] court may inquire [at the class certification stage] whether the elements of asserted claims are <em>capable </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>proof through common evidence, but lacks authority to adjudge the legal validity or soundness of the substantive elements of asserted claims.\u201d (Op. at 305 (emphasis added).) However, the Majority\u2019s position is contrary to what the Supreme Court has just said in <em>Dukes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">A statement in one of our prior cases, <em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 177, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974), is sometimes mistakenly cited ...: \u201cWe find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.\u201d But in that case, the judge had conducted a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit, not in order to determine the propriety of certification under Rules 23(a) and (b) (he had already done that, <em>see id. </em>at 165, 94 S.Ct. 2140), but in order to shift the cost of notice required by Rule 23(c)(2) from the plaintiff to the defendants. To the extent the quoted statement goes beyond the permissibility of a merits inquiry for any other pretrial purpose, it is the purest dictum and is contradicted by our other cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">131 S.Ct. at 2552. Thus, any suggestion that a district court is prevented from \u201cadjudging the legal validity or soundness of the substantive elements of asserted claims\u201d at the class certification stage is clearly mistaken after <em>Dukes. </em>That should already have been clear, however, from our statement in <em>Hydrogen Peroxide </em>that \u201c[a] concern for merits-avoidance should not be talismanically invoked to artificially limit a trial court\u2019s examination of the factors necessary to a reasoned determination of whether a plaintiff has met her burden of establishing each of the Rule 23 class action requirements.\u201d 552 F.3d at 318 n. 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The Majority repeatedly suggests that requiring adherence to substantive law would \u201cintroduce a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry as to every claim in the class.\u201d (Op. at 305.) More specifically, my colleagues in the Majority say that, if my approach were followed, \u201cdistrict courts would be obligated at the class certification stage to, <em>sua sponte, </em>conduct a thorough Rule 12(b)(6) analysis of every ... claim to ensure that each plaintiff ... possesses a valid cause of action....\u201d (Op. at 308.) That characterization is incorrect. Rather, I advocate a procedure essentially identical to the one that occurred here: A district court is approached with a class complaint requesting relief under a variety of state statutes. Because of differences among those statutes, it is clear that some class members are entirely without a cognizable claim. Objectors bring those issues to the district court\u2019s attention. Because \u201csuch variances ... are so significant as to defeat commonality and predominance even in a settlement class certification,\u201d <em>In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., </em>391 F.3d 516, 529-30 (3d Cir.2004) (hereinafter <em>\u201cWarfarin Sodium II </em>\u201d), the district court should deny certification. Assuming the parties revise the class to eliminate claims clearly lacking a colorable legal basis, and assuming the class otherwise satisfies Rule 23, the district court could then certify the class.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Note that the court in this hypothetical has neither performed a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry, nor conducted an individualized assessment of claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It has simply engaged in a straightforward analysis of the applicable law. This is by no means unusual in considering the certification of a settlement class. In <em>Prudential, </em>the plaintiffs \u201ccompiled a series of charts setting forth comprehensive analyses of the various states\u2019 laws potentially applicable to their common law claims.\u201d 148 F.3d at 315 (internal quotation marks omitted). There, we concurred with the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe elements of the[ ] common law claims are substantially similar and any differences fall into a limited number of predictable patterns.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In short, I have proposed only what the law has heretofore always required: one must actually have a legal claim before getting in line for a legal recovery. When objections are raised that persuasively demonstrate that a portion of a proposed class does not have any such claim, courts of law are obliged to follow the law. That is the circumstance we face, as was detailed at length in the panel opinion and is again described briefly herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>III. Some Class Members Lack A Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">As noted by the Majority, the indirect purchasers in the consolidated actions \u201csought damages pursuant only to state antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment statutes and common law.\u201d (Op. at 287.) Unlike the direct purchasers, the indirect purchasers did not seek damages under federal law, because, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), only direct purchasers may bring an antitrust claim under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Although most states have traditionally followed federal law in interpreting their own state antitrust laws, some have enacted <em>\u201cIllinois Brick </em>Repealers,\u201d rejecting the rule that only direct purchasers may recover for an antitrust violation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 16750(a). By contrast, others have expressly followed <em>Illinois Brick </em>and declared unequivocally that, in their states, indirect purchasers lack standing to bring a claim. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Microsoft Corp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 278, 834 N.E.2d 791, 798 (2005). Several states have been even more precise, explaining that indirect purchasers lack standing to bring what is effectively an antitrust claim, regardless of how the claim is labeled, so that recovery is precluded even if, for example, it is sought under a consumer protection act (\u201cCPA\u201d) or the common law. <em>See, e.g., Abbott Labs., Inc. (Ross Labs. Div.) v. Segura, </em>907 S.W.2d 503, 507 (Tex.1995) (\u201cWe will not interpret the [Texas CPA] in a manner that rewards creative pleading at the expense of consistent application of legal principles.... Our holding today only forecloses the recovery of damages for seeking a prohibited antitrust recovery under the masquerade of our [CPA].\u201d); <em>Johnson, </em>834 N.E.2d at 801 (holding that Ohio antitrust statute \u201cprovides the exclusive remedy for\u201d claims predicated upon \u201cmonopolistic pricing practices,\u201d and thus dismissing claims under Ohio\u2019s CPA and common law). In at least some states, then, indirect purchasers are absolutely precluded from bringing an antitrust claim, no matter how they dress it up.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Nevertheless, the Majority declares that those class members whose claims purportedly arise in states that preclude indirect purchaser recovery can still be part of the indirect purchaser class. The Majority offers two arguments in support of that conclusion. First, noting that indirect purchasers lack only statutory standing under <em>Illinois Brick, </em>rather than Article III standing, the Majority asserts that \u201cstatutory standing is simply another element of proof for an antitrust claim, rather than a predicate for asserting a claim in the first place.\u201d (Op. at 307.) The Majority does not cite any authority to support that assertion, and there is reason to doubt it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But, in any event, it misses the point. Even if the Majority\u2019s <em>ipse dixit </em>were true as to antitrust claims under federal law, there is no basis for saying it is so with respect to claims under the laws of the several states that have adopted the ultimate holding of <em>Illinois Brick. </em>Indeed, in several of those states, courts have indicated that indirect purchasers are barred from asserting a claim because they lack standing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For instance, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \u201can indirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>purchaser of goods may not assert a Valentine Act [, i.e., a state antitrust act] claim for alleged violations of Ohio antitrust law.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>834 N.E.2d at 798. Likewise, the New Jersey Supreme Court has held that \u201cindirect purchasers ... have no standing to assert a private right of action under the New Jersey Antitrust Act.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>190 N.J. 336, 921 A.2d 414, 416 (2007). The Connecticut Supreme Court has said the same, explaining that Connecticut law allows \u201conly those consumers who purchase directly from the antitrust defendant to bring suit under our state antitrust law.\u201d <em>Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., </em>260 Conn. 59, 793 A.2d 1048, 1058 (2002). Thus, it is clear that there are states that decidedly do treat statutory standing<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as \u201ca predicate for asserting a claim in the first place.\u201d (Op. at 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Second, the Majority asserts, using the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>case as an example, that \u201calthough <em>Johnson </em>provides that an indirect purchaser lacking an antitrust claim under <em>Illinois Brick </em>cannot circumvent this limitation by relying upon the Ohio consumer protection statute, the Ohio Supreme Court did not, nor could it, preclude consumer protection claims predicated on fraud or deception.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 310 n. 39.) The Majority then says that \u201cclaims settled here include allegations of fraud and deception separate from the antitrust allegations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 310 n. 39.) While the Majority is correct that Ohio does not \u201cpreclude consumer protection claims predicated on fraud or deception,\u201d it is not correct that such claims were brought in this case under the Ohio CPA \u2014 or under the CPA of any state following <em>Illinois Brick. </em>Of the seven complaints covered by the proposed class action settlement, only two made allegations referencing violations of the Ohio CPA, <em>Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>No. 04-cv-02819 (D.N.J.) and <em>Null v. DB Investments, Inc., </em>No. 05-L-209 (S.D.Ill.), and both of those complaints predicated their Ohio CPA claims on monopolistic pricing practices. In <em>Sullivan, </em>the only allegation with respect to the Ohio CPA is that \u201cDefendants\u2019 contract, combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade and to monopolize and defendants\u2019 monopolization constitute a violation of various state antitrust and/or consumer protection and deceptive and unfair business practices acts and laws.\u201d (App. at 652 \u00b6 47.) Likewise, the allegations in <em>Null </em>are that the CPA \u201claws of the various states\u201d were violated \u201cthrough one or more of the following unfair and/or deceptive acts and/or practices: illegally and artificially restraining trade and increasing the price of diamonds by controlling inventory, limiting supply, restricting purchase and falsely advertising the scarceness of diamonds.\u201d (App. at 629 \u00b6 61, 626 \u00b6 45.) Thus, the only claims brought under the Ohio CPA in any of the class actions now at issue were \u201cpredicated upon monopolistic pricing practices,\u201d and, therefore, according to the highest court in Ohio, those claims are precluded. <em>Johnson, </em>834 N.E.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Moreover, even if any of the complaints could be construed as raising claims for fraud under some state CPAs,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>claims were, it appears, never brought to the attention of, or considered by, the District Court, nor were they raised before the Panel. As a result, the District Court made no findings with respect to fraud claims under state CPAs, including whether the elements of those claims could be proven by \u201cevidence common to the class,\u201d as required by <em>Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 325. Of the five common questions identified by the District Court, none pertain to fraud.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, even if there were fraud claims for all class members \u2014 which, for the reasons I have identified, there are not \u2014 there has been no finding of commonality and predominance with respect to those claims and, therefore, the District Court\u2019s class certification cannot rightly be affirmed on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The bottom line is that, as to those class members who purport to bring claims under the laws of states following <em>Illinois Brick, </em>the status of being an indirect purchaser is not only the gateway to membership in the class, it is what entirely disqualifies them from asserting any claim based on De Beers\u2019s price-fixing conduct. That is a straightforward application of state law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The class thus includes members who are barred from asserting a claim in the first place. And, because those class members lack any claim, there are no questions common to all class members for which the answers \u201cwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. Consequently, pursuant to longstanding principles of aggregate litigation, most recently reaffirmed in <em>Dukes, </em>there is neither commonality nor predominance under Rule 23.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>IV. The Rules Enabling Act and Federalism</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In addition to violating the terms of Rule 23, certifying this class violates the Rules Enabling Act and basic principles of federalism. The Rules Enabling Act authorizes the creation of \u201crules of practice and procedure,\u201d but states that \u201c[s]uch rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(a), (b). In <em>Dukes, </em>the Supreme Court highlighted the role of the Rules Enabling Act in class certification decisions, holding that, \u201c[b]ecause the Rules Enabling Act forbids interpreting Rule 23 to \u2018abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,\u2019 \u201d the proposed class could not be certified because it would have abridged Wal-Mart\u2019s statutory right to litigate certain defenses. 131 S.Ct. at 2561 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b)). That point is consistent with the Court\u2019s past cautionary statements that an overly expansive reading of Rule 23 will violate the Rules Enabling Act. <em>See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 845, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999) (\u201cThe Rules Enabling Act underscores the need for caution. As we said in <em>Amchem, </em>no reading of the rule can ignore the Act\u2019s mandate that rules of procedure shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Am-chem, </em>521 U.S. at 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (\u201cWe therefore follow the path taken by the Court of Appeals, mindful that Rule 23\u2019s requirements must be interpreted in keeping with Article Ill\u2019s constraints, and with the Rules Enabling Act, which instructs that rules of procedure \u2018shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b))).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In this case, by approving certification of the indirect purchaser class, the Majority proceeds heedless of that advice and endorses the enlarging of substantive rights. Using the Majority\u2019s example of a member of the indirect purchaser class asserting under Ohio law a claim based on De Beers\u2019s price-fixing, it is indisputable that the same member would, if he tried to bring his claim individually in an Ohio court, be immediately shown the exit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Controlling law allows no result but dismissal of such a claim. But, under the Majority\u2019s class action certification theory, that individual now has a right to share in the settlement fund based on a claim he is otherwise forbidden to bring. If that is not an enlargement or modification of substantive rights, it is hard to know what would be. <em>Cf. Shady Grove Orthopedic </em>Assocs., 130 S.Ct. at 1442 (stating that, for purposes of the Rules Enabling Act, a rule is substantive in nature if it alters the rules of decision by which courts adjudicate rights). The Majority seems to have a \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d feeling about dispensing new rights, but legitimate class members are harmed. If we enforced substantive law as we ought to, those who actually have claims would not be required to share the proceeds of a proper settlement with those who do not.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Certifying the indirect purchaser class is, for the same reasons, contrary to principles of federalism. The policy decisions of the constituent states of our country are \u201cfundamental aspect[s] of our federal republic and must not be overridden in a quest to clear the queue in court.\u201d <em>In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </em>288 F.3d 1012, 1020 (7th Cir.2002). When one of those states says to its citizens \u201cyou have no claim\u201d \u2014 and the law covering many of the class members here is just that clear \u2014 but those under that edict nevertheless are joined in a class with people who do have a claim, by what logical process consistent with federalism can aggregating the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave-nots\u201d imbue those \u201chave-nots\u201d with the very claim that the state has said is foreclosed to them? There is no sound answer to that question. There is only the Majority\u2019s and the Concurrence\u2019s policy preference, in derogation of controlling state law, for \u201cglobal peace\u201d through unfettered access to class action settlements.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">My colleagues in the Majority of course dispute that certifying this class implicates either the Rules Enabling Act or federal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ism. With respect to the Rules Enabling Act, they say that there has been a \u201cvoluntary settlement agreement between parties\u201d (Op. at 312) (quoting <em>Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, </em>609 F.3d 590, 593 (3d Cir.2010)), and \u201ca district court\u2019s certification of a settlement simply recognizes the parties\u2019 deliberate decision to bind themselves according to mutually agreed-upon terms without engaging in any substantive adjudication of the underlying causes of action\u201d <em>(id.). </em>That may be so when a settlement involves only private parties who all participate in the settlement process, but it is not true in a class action settlement. In that latter context, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require district courts to be intimately involved, because the approval of a class action settlement gives the government\u2019s imprimatur to the terms of the settlement and binds absent parties.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As already discussed, a court is not supposed to certify a class without determining that there is a \u201cgenuine controversy\u201d or, in other words, that there is at least some legal basis for class members to claim relief. If a district court credits potential class members with having a valid claim when the underlying state law says there is none, the court has, by definition, enlarged and modified those class members\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Moreover, while De Beers is now pleased to stipulate to liability in all fifty states, and, for its own purposes, is willing to forego legal arguments that it could have raised about the substantive rights of class members, a defendant\u2019s willingness to waive an argument is not a reason to ignore it. It is rather the very reason that collusive settlements are a problem. No matter how much De Beers wants to bind everyone in America, and no matter how much the attorneys involved stand to gain from their percentage of the settlement, and no matter how laudatory the \u201cglobal\u201d resolution of a price-fixing case may be as policy matter, there are limits on the power of federal courts to facilitate settlements and bind absent class members and objectors. <em>Amchem </em>admonishes courts approving settlement classes to pay \u201cundiluted, even heightened, attention\u201d to issues of predominance as well as to the other requirements of Rule 23 to ensure that a certified class is not overbroad. 521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231. Approving a class certification that groups together plaintiffs who have claims with those who plainly do not results in such a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Furthermore, while the Majority speculates that the approach I suggest will seriously impede class action settlements, it is far from clear that limiting class certification to people who have legal claims would actually undermine the goal of global peace. Indeed, as the Concurrence acknowledges, similar concerns in other cases have proved largely unfounded. (Concurrence Op. at 334.) But even if one assumes that the Majority\u2019s concerns about \u201cglobal peace\u201d have some merit, Rule 23 remains the sole benchmark for determining whether a settlement class can be certified. In <em>Amchem, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated that point over Justice Breyer\u2019s criticism that the Court had given insufficient weight to the value of settlement. <em>See Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 629, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (\u201cRule 23, which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>be interpreted with fidelity to the Rules Enabling Act and applied with the interests of absent class members in close view, cannot carry the large load OCR, class counsel, and the District Court heaped upon it.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(Breyer, J., dissenting) (\u201cI believe that the need for settlement of this mass tort case, with hundreds and thousands of lawsuits, is greater than the Court\u2019s opinion suggests.\u201d). In <em>Ortiz, </em>the Court rejected a settlement expressly designed for \u201ctotal peace,\u201d 527 U.S. at 864-65, 119 S.Ct. 2295, even as several justices acknowledged the need for a resolution to the \u201celephantine mass of asbestos cases,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 865, 119 S.Ct. 2295 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring). We are not free to rewrite the requirements of Rule 23 simply because it would allegedly advance the goal of global peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Majority also dismisses any federalism concern, reasoning that the policy concerns behind <em>Illinois Brick </em>do not apply. As the Majority sees it, <em>\u201cIllinois Brick\u2019s </em>restriction on indirect purchaser recovery was motivated by prudential concerns for manageability; it does not reflect a categorical policy judgment that indirect purchasers do not merit antitrust protection.\u201d (Op. at 313.) Thus, says the Majority, because the \u201cDistrict Court\u2019s certification order did not undermine these prudential concerns,\u201d the District Court did not \u201cinappropriately subordinate!] state sovereignty in certifying the class.\u201d (Op. at 314.) But regardless of the Majority\u2019s novel views about the policy judgments underlying <em>Illinois Brick </em>and whether \u201cindirect purchasers ... merit antitrust proteetion,\u201d the states which have chosen to follow <em>Illinois Brick </em>have decided \u2014 and plainly stated \u2014 that indirect purchasers have no substantive right to recovery under their laws. Principles of federalism do not permit us to write our own exceptions into unambiguous state laws simply because we think that the states would see things differently if only they had our policy insights.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Somehow, though, the Majority thinks that \u201cthe class settlement posture of this case largely marginalizes the objectors\u2019 concern that state law variations undermine a finding of predominance.\u201d (Op. at 302 - 03.) Once again, the promise of settlement trumps everything else, even variations in state laws as wide as \u201cyou have a claim\u201d versus \u201cyou have none.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">I cannot voice strongly enough my disagreement with this elevation of settlement to the status of ultimate and overriding good. <em>{See </em>Op. at 310) (\u201c[W]ere we to mandate that a class include only those alleging \u2018colorable\u2019 claims, we would effectively rule out the ability of a defendant to achieve \u2018global peace\u2019 by obtaining releases from all those who might wish to assert claims, meritorious or not.\u201d). It has been aptly observed that \u201c[sjocial peace is not the Article III mission.\u201d Paul D. Carrington &amp; Derek P. Apanovitch, <em>The Constitutional Limits of Judicial Rulemaking: the Illegitimacy of Mass-Tort Settlements Negotiated Under Federal Rule 23, </em>39 Ariz. L.Rev. 461, 475 (1997). Rather, we are to \u201cdecide cases or controversies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>peace becomes a natural and very welcome byproduct of focusing on that specific mission, \u201cbecause for every carefully wrought judicial decision, there may be hundreds or thousands of matters that are privately resolved \u2018in the shadow\u2019 of the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On its own terms, then, the Majority\u2019s decision is short-sighted and counterproductive. In the interest of short-term peace, it sacrifices long-term legitimacy and, with that, a more stable, lasting peace. By failing to enforce the limits of Rule 23, today\u2019s decision will encourage frivolous class action claims and have the predictable consequence of weakening the incentives \u2014 the sheltering shadow \u2014 under which non-frivolous disputes would otherwise be properly resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In sum, when a federal court issues an order certifying that there are questions of fact or law common to all class members, it necessarily concludes, whether explicitly stated or not, that all class members have at least some colorable legal claim. When there are members of a putative class who do not, under the operative substantive law in a case, have a colorable claim, certification of the class enlarges the substantive rights of those members. Any such order is thus a violation of the Rules Enabling Act, and, when it occurs in a class whose only claims are based in state law, it also violates core principles of federalism. The damage done by that judicial usurpation is not made better by invoking the benefits of social peace through litigation settlement. Private parties have a free hand in settling their own disputes, but class action settlements require federal courts to determine the rights and obligations of people who are not there to speak for themselves \u2014 hence the Supreme Court\u2019s insistence that class action settlements \u201cdemand undiluted, even heightened, attention ...,\u201d especially when there is a risk of \u201cunwarranted or overbroad class definitions,\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231. That risk has been realized here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\">. The class action device has a venerable pedigree in equity practice. As early as the seventeenth century, English chancery courts employed bills of peace to facilitate representative suits analogous to \"common question\" suits under Rule 23(b)(3). Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. et al., <em>An Historical Analysis of the Binding Effect of Class Suits, </em>146 U. Pa. L.Rev. 1849, 1861-65 (1998).

The 1966 amendments to Rule 23 substantially modified earlier practice and ushered in a class action \"revolution\u201d by introducing most of the current aspects of class action litigation, particularly the broad provisions of 23(b)(3) and the concomitant procedural safeguards requiring predominance and notice.

For a litigation class, the key decision is whether or not to certify the class. Once a class is certified, the dynamics of the case change dramatically. For many plaintiffs, denial of certification may sound the death knell of the action because the claims are too small to be prosecuted individually. For many defendants, class certification may create hydraulic pressure to settle, even for claims defendants deem non-meritorious. For these reasons, the Supreme Court adopted Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) to permit a discretionary interlocutory appeal from the grant or denial of class certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b378-5\">. Trial courts can certify subclasses in situations where divergent interests implicate fair allocation \u2014 a situation not presented here, as all indirect class members have aligned interests. Certifying subclasses may be proper \"[w]here a class is found to include subclasses divergent in interest.\u201d <em>In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., </em>579 F.3d at 271 (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(c) advisory committee note). Even the conflicts in <em>Amchem </em>were amenable to resolution through sub-classes. <em>See Ortiz, </em>527 U.S. at 856, 119 S.Ct. 2295 (explaining that <em>Amchem </em>requires \u201ca class divided between holders of present and future claims\u201d to be \"divi[ded] into homogeneous subclasses ... with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel\u201d). Objector Quinn, in her answer to the petition for rehearing, states that subclasses would adequately address the <em>Illinois Brick-based </em>disparities in this case; she does not argue that it would be categorically improper to afford class treatment to indirect purchasers governed by <em>Illinois Brick. See </em>Quinn Answer at 11. The District Court here examined whether indirect purchasers\u2019 interests diverged depending on the law applied to their claims, and found such differences to be irrelevant in the context of this settlement. I find no abuse of discretion in such a conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">. Objectors also claim that variance on state claims (based on consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws) defeats predominance as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. The purported \"overbreadth\u2019' of the putative class at issue here is qualitatively different from the Supreme Court\u2019s concerns in <em>Amchem. </em>Under <em>Amchem </em>the significance of variations in state laws is properly assessed in terms of the interests of absent class members. The proposed <em>Amchem </em>settlement, extinguishing claims for different injuries with different onsets incurred at different times due to conduct of different defendants, under-compensated exposure-only claims and those with mesothelioma. Here, objectors contend some class members do not have a valid cause of action, but these class members with non-repealer state law claims have lost nothing through inclusion in the class. Objectors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>speculate inclusion of non-repealer state law claims necessarily diminishes the settlement accrued to class members whom they contend have undisputedly valid claims. But they provided no support for their assertion. In <em>Amchem </em>the objectors provided evidence of intraclass conflicts detrimental to class members. For example, 15% of the proposed <em>Am-chem </em>settlement\u2019s mesothelioma claims arose in California, where the average recovery for a mesothelioma claim was more than double their maximum recovery in the settlement. <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 610 n. 14, 117 S.Ct. 2231.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The objectors have not shown that plaintiffs suffering identical economic injuries due to a single course of conduct on the part of the defendant have conflicting interests solely because some class members may have stronger claims depending upon variation in state law. Objectors assume that the non-repealer state claims have zero settlement value and that defendants would contribute the same amount to the common settlement fund regardless of how many claims the settlement may extinguish. But the settlement of the considerable bulk of claims against the defendants for a prior course of conduct may be of substantially greater value to defendants than a settlement of only the strongest claims against them. And, unlike in <em>Amchem, </em>objectors have not shown the inclusion of more claims was achieved by grossly underpaying some class members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">. Rule 23(e) is especially relevant in this context because it governs the settlement, dismissal, or compromise of a class action. It requires court approval of any agreement, and establishes five procedural requirements that must be satisfied:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may be withdrawn only with the court\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">. Facing liability for alleged misconduct, a defendant may desire global settlement for several possible reasons: (1) redressing plaintiffs' injuries; (2) the possibility of liability; (3) the direct costs of defending suits, often in multiple fora; (4) the risk of financially unmanageable jury verdicts which may threaten bankruptcy; (5) the effects of pending or impending mass litigation on its stock price or access to capital markets; (6) the stigma of brand-damaging litigation; and (7) maintaining financial stability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">. In <em>Prudential II, </em>we affirmed the grant of an injunction enjoining a state-court action brought by policyholders who were members of the <em>Prudential </em>class to the extent the state-law claims were based on or related to claims released in the class action. We agreed with the district court that allowing the policyholders to prosecute their civil actions in state court \u201cwould allow an end run around the Class settlement by affording them (and other class members who might later attempt the same strategy) an opportunity for relitigation of the released claims.\u201d 261 F.3d at 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). We noted that the position urged by the policyholders \"would seriously undermine the possibility for settling any large, multi district class action.

More precisely, we are dealing here with a set of class actions, since the settlement involves the resolution of several cases, as the Majority opinion notes. For ease of reference, however, I will often refer to these matters in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\">. The Majority is oddly persistent in this confusion. Despite the clear language in the panel opinion and repeated assurance in this dissent that class members need not all share a \"uniform cause of action\u201d to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23, the Majority continues to say by implication and assertion that the panel opinion suggested that all members of the class must assert a \"uniform\u201d cause of action or \"identical ... issues or claims.\u201d <em>See </em>Op. at 301 (\"We have never required the presentation of identical or uniform issues or claims as a prerequisite to certification of a class.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 302 (\"Nothing in our case law or the language of Rule 23 commands that everyone in a class must allege precisely identical or \u2018uniform\u2019 causes of action ... and statutory variations do not defeat predominance in the presence of other exceedingly common issues.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>id. </em>at 308 n. 36 (\"The Panel ... seemingly conclude[d] that plaintiffs could only prevail if each putative class member alleged either a \u2018uniform\u2019 antitrust cause of action, a \u2018uniform\u2019 consumer protection cause of action, or a \u2018uniform\u2019 unjust enrichment claim.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b383-14\">. Both before the panel and the en banc court, objector Susan M.

Although the parties do not particularly press the issue in their briefs, an argument can be made that the proposed class might also fail to meet the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4), which provides that a court may certify a class only if \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). By proposing a class that consists of individuals who have no cause of action under state or federal law, the class representatives have diluted the recovery for those who actually have claims. Moreover, the class representatives also unnecessarily incur the cost of giving notice under Rule 23 to individuals who have no right to relief, as well as the cost of compensating class counsel for undertaking unnecessary tasks associated with such notice. <em>Cf. In the Matter of Aqua Dots Prods. Liability Litig., </em>654 F.3d 748, 752 (7th Cir.2011) (\"A representative who proposes that high transaction costs (notice and attorneys' fees) be incurred at the class members\u2019 expense to obtain a refund that is already on offer is not adequately protecting the class members' interests.\u201d (citing <em>Thorogood v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>627 F.3d 289, 293-94 (7th Cir.2010))). Those costs reduce the total amount of recovery available to the appropriate members of the proposed class <em>(i.e., </em>individuals who may assert an antitrust claim under federal or state law). In other words, a class representative who unnecessarily increases the cost of litigating a class action by including improper plaintiffs in the class definition is at risk of being found to not \"adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. If one were actually to accept a test that looked solely at the behavior of the alleged wrongdoer, it would make no difference who was in the class. Thus, in this case, it would be appropriate to certify a class consisting of everyone on earth, regardless of diamond purchases, since the supposedly common questions would stay the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">. While trying to distance itself from the consequences of its own ruling today, the Majority asserts that the \"[indirect purchaser] class members ... possess a legally cognizable injury acknowledged in hornbook law, as their injuries are real, and stem not from simply feeling 'wronged,' as the dissent suggests ..., but from De Beers\u2019s alleged anticompetitive conduct, conduct which antitrust laws forbid.\u201d (Op. at 301.) If only my colleagues in the Majority actually applied that assertion, this dissent would be unnecessary, since the assertion concedes that (1) recovery should be preconditioned on the existence of an injury that is legally cognizable, and (2) whether an injury is legally cognizable depends on the operative substantive law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b386-14\">. Similarly, if predominance means anything, it must mean that the resolution of <em>something </em>will actually affect <em>somehow </em>the claims of all class members. The claims might vary among the class members, but, at a minimum, some legal right to recover has to be held by everyone in the class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b386-15\">. A colorable claim is one that at least \"appeals] to be true, valid, or right.\u201d Black's Law Dictionary 301(9th ed.2009). Requiring a district court to consider whether a claim appears to be valid before certifying class, when the court is expressly apprised of good reasons to doubt the same, does not transform the Rule 23 inquiry into one under Rule 12(b)(6), as I discuss <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\">. To the extent that the quoted statement, read in isolation, might suggest a rule that all class members had to share an antitrust claim, the context of the statement \u2014 coming after a discussion of other types of statutory or common law claims that might give rise to common questions \u2014 makes it clear that the panel was requiring only that all class members' right to recover arise from the same harm or injury \u2014 something unambiguously required under Supreme Court precedent. <em>See, e.g., Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551 (\"Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have suffered the same injury.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. The following passage in the American Law Institute's <em>Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation </em>articulates this basic principle:</p>\n<p id=\"A3g\">The legal and factual issues involved in any individual civil claim are a function of applicable substantive law.... Factual issues concern disputes about whether the evidence at trial demonstrates, under the applicable standard of proof, the existence of a given element.... A factual issue may rise to the level of a common issue if ... a common body of evidence to be presented on behalf of multiple claimants at trial is capable of proving the existence of a material fact as to all such claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">ALI, Principles of Law: <em>Aggregate Litigation </em>\u00a7 2.01(b)(2010). Thus, the treatise supports the proposition that in order to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s commonality requirement, there must be some \u201cmaterial\u201d issue. Materiality is a \"function of applicable substantive law.\u201d <em>See id.; In re Lemington Home for the Aged, </em>659 F.3d 282, 290 (3d Cir.2011) (\"A material fact is '[a] fact[] that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986))). By necessary implication, if certain members of the proposed class cannot assert a claim under either federal or state law, then there can be no common questions of law or fact that are \"material.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. There are at least two other problems with the Majority\u2019s assertion that \"[t]o adopt the position of the dissent and the objectors is to introduce a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry as to every claim in the class before a class may be certified.\u201d (Op. at 305.) First, it ducks the difficulty at the center of this case, which is not and never has been about merely dubious claims. Claims that are of doubtful quality still have, as the adjective indicates, some doubt about them, which means they still retain at least some superficial possibility of being valid. Such claims, because they cling to that possibility, will typically not need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>cause a district judge any agita in addressing the certification of a class for settlement purposes. The central problem in this case, however, goes beyond factual disputes or debatable points of law. The problem here is that there are class members who, according to the plain terms of controlling law, have no claim at all, not even a dubious one. We are not rightfully at liberty to ignore that, nor was the District Court. The second problem with the Majority\u2019s parade-of-horribles rhetoric in response to the suggestion that class members should actually have claims <em>(see </em>Op. at 307 - 11) is that objectors have always been entitled to raise a legal challenge to claims being included in a class, even a settlement class. <em>Cf. Hydrogen Peroxide, </em>552 F.3d at 320 (\"[A] district court exercising proper discretion in deciding whether to certify a class will ... make findings that each Rule 23 requirement is met or not met, having considered all relevant evidence and arguments presented by the parties.\u201d). In other words, district courts have always been required to ensure that the requisites of Rule 23 have been met, and that includes an obligation to address the non-frivolous arguments and objections that are put to them. A court does not need to assess <em>sua sponte </em>every potential problem, nor need it engage in \"an intensive cataloguing of each class member\u2019s claim\u201d (Op. at 308), but it must give objections their due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">. The Majority\u2019s recoiling at the individualized assessment of claims also reflects a failure to appreciate that some such assessment does typically take place at some point during the settlement process. The parties share a common interest in ensuring that individuals falling outside the class do not share the benefits of the settlement. For that reason, a class member here must submit a proof of claim demonstrating his or her purchase of a diamond within the relevant time period. As is often the case, parties to an antitrust settlement want to ensure that individuals seeking a share of the settlement actually bought a product with an allegedly inflated price, demonstrating their membership in the class. <em>See Warfarin Sodium II, </em>391 F.3d at 525. Some settlements create elaborate systems for evaluating not only the validity but the severity of each class member\u2019s injuty. <em>See In re Prudential Insurance Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, </em>148 F.3d 283, 295-96 (3d Cir. 1998). These proofs of claim are rarely evaluated by the court. \"Although the court has general supervisoty powers over settlements, it usually does not handle the actual administration. As a rule, the administration is delegated either to a special master or to the plaintiff's counsel or a committee of counsel.\u201d 4 Alba Conte &amp; Herbert Newberg, <em>Newberg on Class Actions </em>\u00a7 11:33 at 68-69 (4th ed.2002). It is universally recognized that the special master, committee, or other body created to administer the settlement agreement is responsible for evaluating the validity of claims and calculating the individualized recovery of a particular class member. <em>See </em>David F. Herr, <em>Manual for Complex Litigation </em>\u00a7 21.661 (4th ed. 2011) (\"The administrator or special master may be charged with reviewing the claims and deciding whether to allow claims that are late, deficient in documentation, or questionable for other reasons.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">. For a more detailed discussion of which states preclude claims entirely, <em>see Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 147-48 &amp; n. 10-11, 150-51. According to the Majority, the panel opinion \"undertook a wide-ranging fact-finding review of state antitrust statutes....\u201d (Op. at 293.) That description is puzzling, however, because there was no fact-finding involved. The review of state law was just that: a review of law. The panel opinion took the very ordinary approach of examining the laws on which the plaintiffs purported to base their claims, including state antitrust laws. The opinion also stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We are certainly not saying that nuanced differences among state laws will prevent the certification of a class, nor are we suggesting that a state-by-state cataloguing of differences in state law is necessary every time a multi-jurisdiction class is certified. We are saying that the difference between having an antitrust claim under state law and having none is no mere nuance and cannot be solved by any reconfiguration of the nationwide class short of changing it from a nationwide class to one or more classes that exclude those who have no claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\"><em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 148 n. 12. Both the Majority and the Concurring Opinions claim that it is wrong for us to pay attention to the differences in state law because, as the Concurrence puts it, \"trial courts would be obligated at the settlement class certification stage to decide which state\u2019s law would govern. ...\u201d (Concurrence Op. at 337.) It bears repeating, then, that nothing said by the panel opinion or in this dissent would entail the cataloguing of differences in state law in the mine run of cases. However, when, as in this case, an objection has been raised pointing out that there is a body of claims that are undeniably impermissible under the law of the state which governs them, we are not free to shirk the responsibility of separating those unfounded claims from the class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b391-5\">. It is not clear, to begin with, that the Majority\u2019s \"statutory standing\" label accurately describes the substantive law of the several states denying a claim to indirect purchasers. That aside, and although a dismissal for lack of statutory standing may be viewed as akin to a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), <em>see Baldwin v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., </em>636 F.3d 69, 73 (3d Cir.2011) (noting that \"[a] dismissal for lack of statutory standing is effectively the same as a dismissal for failure to state a claim\u201d), compelling authority teaches that the absence of statutory standing can also implicate the court's power to adjudicate a dispute under Article III, <em>see Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (\"Dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because of the adequacy of the federal claim is proper ... when the claim is so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Whether a party has standing under Article III is a distinct inquiry from whether the party may assert a cause of action under state or federal law. In <em>Bond v.

In its effort to diminish the significance of the state laws denying a cause of action to indirect purchasers, the Majority likens those laws to pre-suit notice requirements or other issues of form that may vary from state to state. (Op. at 310.) But we are not talking here about the niceties of notice. In a class action invoking the laws of multiple jurisdictions, there will often be variations in the law pertaining to how a particular claim is to be presented. Those variations may at times be framed as prerequisites to the bringing of a cause of action or restrictions on the manner in which the action is brought. Were the aggregated claims to be brought individually, those prerequisites would in all likelihood be met on a claim-by-claim basis, but, since the claims are aggregated, those prerequisites are appropriately bypassed. They amount to nothing more than variations in form, not in kind, and neither the panel opinion in this case nor the objectors nor this dissent have advocated the elevation of form over substance. Differences in form are not at issue here; it is the very existence of any cause of action at all that is at stake. The distinction is crucial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b394-5\">. I am not suggesting that no cl\u00e1ss of indirect purchasers could have been certified here. On the contrary, as the panel opinion noted,</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It may be that the antitrust and consumer protection statutes in a more limited number of states are sufficiently similar that common issues of law or fact would predominate with respect to plaintiffs in those jurisdictions. However, it was improper for the District Court to certify a nationwide class of plaintiffs based on state law when many states withhold antitrust standing from indirect purchasers and where the variability in consumer protection and unjust enrichment law in a context like this is extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\"><em>Sullivan, </em>613 F.3d at 153-54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">. The Majority tries to deny this, saying that a state court would only dismiss the invalid claim upon a motion by the defendant. (Op. at 313 n. 43.) But the procedural mechanism that prompts application of substantive law is irrelevant. Whether or not a motion brings to light a claim\u2019s fatal flaw, the flaw is there. To continue with the Ohio law example, there is clearly no colorable claim for an indirect purchaser, and that is true whether or not a defendant chooses to file a motion to dismiss. Ohio law does not depend on the whim of De Beers or any other defendant. It is telling that the Majority\u2019s rejoinder on this point is, in effect, \u201cyes, the claimant could be tossed out of state court, but only if there were a motion.\u201d That seems a concession that the differing results that now obtain in this Circuit and in Ohio state courts reflect an expansion of substantive rights. As to the \"there must be a motion\u201d comment, irrelevant and of questionable accuracy though it may be, it prompts re-emphasis of this fact: there was a motion in this case, in the form of the objections to the nationwide settlement of the indirect purchaser class. Thus, the legal problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>was squarely before the District Court, as it is now before us. It does not matter that the motion came from someone other than De Beers. The issue has been raised and cannot be dodged by saying no one brought it up. Nor can it be avoided by saying that De Beers could have settled an individual suit in Ohio. We are obviously not dealing with the settlement of a dispute between private parties in Ohio state court; we are dealing with a class action settlement binding on absent parties and sanctioned by a federal court purporting to apply Ohio law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">. Herein lies a fundamental flaw in the Concurring Opinion as well, which takes the view that \"[u]nder <em>Amchem </em>the significance of variations in state law is properly assessed in terms of the interests of absent class members[,]\u201d and that here class members from states adhering to <em>Illinois Brick </em>\"have lost nothing through inclusion in the class.\u201d (Concurrence Op. at 337 n. 7.) Very true. The problem here is not that some absent class members who deserve compensation are left out by the settlement. The problem is that some class members who deserve nothing are included in the settlement and hence are diluting the recovery of those who are entitled to make claims. That harm is real, and the cause of it, the overbreadth of the class, is akin to the problem in <em>Amchem. See Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (\"But other specifications of [Rule 23] \u2014 those designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions \u2014 demand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the settlement context.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\">. The Majority cites <em>Warfarin Sodium II </em>in an effort to justify its decision today, but we were careful to say in that case that \"there may be situations where variations in state law are so significant so as to defeat commonality and predominance even in a settlement class.\u201d 391 F.3d at 529. That observation seems obvious and unassailable, and we are presented here with exactly that kind of situation. If we cannot bring ourselves to say plainly that the certification here was improper, one is forced to wonder what limit is left on the reach of Rule 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b396-5\">. The Majority also writes that, in <em>Prudential, </em>\"we agreed with the district court that 'approval of a settlement under Rule 23 merely recognizes the parties' voluntary compromise of their rights and does not itself affect their substantive state law rights,\u201d and, therefore, held that \"the proposed settlement could not violate the Rules Enabling Act.\u201d (Op. at 312 (quoting <em>Prudential, </em>148 F.3d at 324).) However, we also held in <em>Pmdential </em>that the proposed settlement was not contrary to the cited state law, and, therefore, the Rules Enabling Act could not possibly have been implicated. <em>Pmdential, </em>148 F.3d at 324 &amp; n. 77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\">. The Concurring Opinion's assertion that the settlement of a class action is merely \u201ca contract between the parties\u201d (Concurrence Op. at 338) misses this point, though the opinion adds a reference to Rule 23 <em>{id. </em>at 338 n. 8). The states have an interest in not having their laws strained beyond recognition or ignored entirely. A class action settlement, whether it involves a settlement or a litigation class, is not simply a private contract. If it were, it would not need court approval, and federal courts called upon to supervise class actions, including resulting settlements, are obligated to see that Rule 23 does not become a tool for modifying state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
