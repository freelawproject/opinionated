There is sufficient in the bill of complaint to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>justify the raising of an implied contract in the absence of any denial of the facts alleged, and the bill could be maintained without this on the ground of fraud, which, I think, is pleaded with sufficient clarity. I think also that the complainant is entitled to a mandatory order at this time directing the delivery of the models to the complainant.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-4\"><em>Mr. Lionel P. </em>Kristeller, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-5\"><em>Messrs.
