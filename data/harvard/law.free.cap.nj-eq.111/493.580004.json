Loeb and Dorothy A. David. Complainant, the wife, the widow of a Dr. Samuel Brown, was married to defendant Levi David, on June 19th, 1929. Previously to this marriage, and for many years, Levi David had been living separately from his first wife, by whom he had several children, all apparently well over twenty-one years of age at the time of his second marriage, his marriage to complainant. The testimony was to the effect that -Levi David was estranged from his children as well as from his first wife for this long period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-10\">\u201cComplainant testified that she knew Levi David about nine years before she was married to him; that she several times lent him sums of money; that in September, 1928, she lent him $1,000; that he gave her a note for this loan. She took possession of a small hotel on New York avenue, Atlantic City, which was opposite the Pitney Hotel owned by Levi David. She testified that she went to Baltimore for a rest, and that upon her return in Eebruary, 1929, Re came over and helped me with the suitcases, and I came into the house, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>oh, lie was so glad to see me, and then he says \u2014 oh, yes, by the way he said he had some news, and he was like overjoyed, you know, with a glad smile. Yes, and he said his wife died a couple of months ago.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-4\">\u201cComplainant testified that shortly after this conversation that the negotiations proceeded:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-5\">\u201c \u2018Well, he asked me if I have \u2014 whenever I have time to, he would like to talk to me. I says, \u201cwell, I have time now.\u201d He says, \u201call, right.\u201d So we went in the front room and sat down, so he asked me if I had ten thousand dollars. He says \u2014he looked at me; he says, \u201cI know it is rather personal, but the reason I am asking you that,\u201d he says, \u201cI have got some business proposition to put to you.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cno, I havent\u2019s got any ten thousand dollars.\u201d I says, \u201cI have eight, and a thousand dollars that you owe me, that is nine thousand.\u201d Then he says, \u201cwell, then, that is all right.\u201d He says the reason he asked me that he said if I let him have it, he will make me half a partner in his properties, he'says, but he says, with the understanding, he says, \u201cthat if you are willing to marry me.\u201d Of course I thought it was a rather serious proposition that he put then to me, and I says, \u201cwell, I tell you, Mr. David,\u201d I says, \u201cI can\u2019t say nothing right now,\u201d I says, \u201cI will have to think it over. If you give me a couple of weeks time,\u201d I says, \u201cI will let you know.\u201d He says, \u201coh, yes, indeed, I didn\u2019t expect you to answer right now, but I just put that proposition to you.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\">\u201cComplainant testified that she thought over matters and in June consented to Levi David\u2019s proposition:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\">\u201c \u2018You see, when I went to the bank, when I agreed that I will marry him, I says, \u201cyes, I will accept that proposition.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d he says, \u201cyou go up to the lawyer and make an appointment.\u201d I call up the lawyer and made an appointment. <em>\u2018Q. </em>Who was the lawyer whom you called? <em>A. </em>Mr. Champion. <em>Q. </em>Of Babcock &amp; Champion? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir. So the following morning Mr. Champion says to be up there. So I also made the same time an appointment with Mr. David to come into the \u2014 to meet me at my place, we will both go together. So he says all right, and he met me nine-thirty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>and I was in the bank nine o\u2019clock and took the money out, and also \u2014 eight thousand dollars. I also took out the note of the thousand dollars. And while I was. there at the vault I took out the deed of my own property. Of course he never mentioned that to me and I never spoke to him about it, but I took it out myself, and when we went to the lawyer to told him,\u2019 I says, \u201cMr. David, you know what I decided,\u201d I says, \u201cI have my own property, you know,\u201d and I says, \u201cI will also convey it in your name, too, because,\u201d I says, \u201cwell, as long as you mean well, so do I,\u201d I says, \u201cand I want all together you know, it shouldn\u2019t be mine and yours straight.\u201d And he says that was very nice * * *. Well, when Mr. Champion explained to Mr. David, you know, and me about the deeds, and he says, \u201cyou understand what it means, you know that you convey your half of interest in the property and so does Mrs. David \u2014 Mrs. Brown,\u201d and he says what\u2014 then he also mentioned about the survivor would get it all. <em>\u2018Q. </em>That is, it was to be a joint tenancy? <em>A. </em>Joint tenancy. <em>Q. </em>And the survivor was to get whatever was left? <em>A. </em>Yes.\u2019 Then he says, \u201cyou understand what I mean, and whoever dies first, you know, then goes to the other.\u201d <em>A. </em>So when \u2014 \u2022 at the time I was a little nervous, and this I didjn\u2019t think until I \u2014 when I went out. So in the afternoon when I thought over what Mr. Champion said, I told it to my husband, Mr. David, I says, \u201cyou know one thing,\u201d I says, \u201che said something there and I really feel funny about it because,\u201d I says, \u201che said the survivor get it all and,\u201d I says, \u201cwe don\u2019t know tomorrow who will die first, and I have my children are poor, and they are small, and they need my support and,\u201d I says, \u201cif I die first, you know, what justice am I doing to the children,\u201d I says, \u201cthey will be left a public charge.\u201d He says, \u201coh, well, I would take care of them, but,\u201d he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter to me, I didn\u2019t ask you for it, you done it yourself, and I thought it is nice.\u201d He says, \u201cyour property is just the spit in the bucket,\u201d that is the words he really used. He says, \u201cyou have the big mortgage on it, anyhow; it is a small property.\u201d <em>\u2018Q. </em>Did you finally agree to leave that out of consideration? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir, and did he.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cTwo deeds of conveyance were executed by the defendant, Levi David, one conveying his Atlantic City property and the other conveying three properties owned by him on North Second street, Philadelphia, to himself and Mrs. Brown as joint tenants. Levi David acknowledged the execution of the deeds before Mr. Champion, master in chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-4\">\u201cComplainant testified that she gave Levi David the note for $1,000 and also the $8,000 that she had told him she had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-5\">\u201cMr. Champion testified as to what happened at the time the deeds were executed. He had the benefit of a rather full memorandum which he had written at the time. His testimony supports complainant\u2019s version. Mr. Champion testified that he explained the effect of the deeds to Levi David; that he had no interest in the transaction except that of an attorney; that he was paid only for his time, apparently $60 or $75. There were encumbrances on the Atlantic City property, a first and a second mortgage. The Philadelphia properties apparently were each encumbered by a mortgage. Complainant alleged that her husband had defaulted on one of the mortgages covering the Atlantic City propertj^, with the plan of divesting complainant\u2019s interest in the property, and that he was proceeding or arranging to proceed in the same way with respect to the Philadelphia properties, one or more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-6\">\u201cAfter the marriage at Wildwood, the complainant and her husband occupied the same bed in a room in the Wildwood home of complainant\u2019s sister. Complainant testified that the marriage was consummated at Wildwood, and at Atlantic City, on the return from Wildwood; that she and her husband went to New York and cohabited as husband and wife, in the Manger Hotel, and also thereafter in Green\u2019s Hotel in Philadelphia, and at 307 Atlantic avenue, Atlantic City, where she and her husband went to live, where they both occupied the same bed, until Januarjr, 1930, when they moved to another apartment in Atlantic City; that on May 2d, 1930, her husband brought two men employed by a storage company to the apartment; that, with the assistance of these men, he took from the apartment his trunk with his belong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ings; that he concealed the place to which he was going, by stating that he was going to a certain other place; that he left against her wishes and her protest; that he left her penniless, since which time she had received no support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-4\">\u201cThe two men from the storage company testified, fully corroborating complainant. One of these men, being sorry for complainant, went to her, a day or two after, and told her where the husband had gone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-5\">\u201cTwo witnesses testified in corroboration of consummation at Atlantic City.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-6\">\u201cDefendant Levi David flatly contradicted complainant, Mr. Champion, the witnesses on consummation of the marriage, and the two moving men. He testified that he met complainant on the street in March, 1929, and added:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-7\">\u201c \u2018When I passed there, somebody \u2014 I went on this side of the street and she was on the other side. She was there \u2014 -she was on the north side of the street. Then somebody call me. Somebody call me, then I looked around. Then she raise her hand and wave a little. Then I waited. I never see her before. I never know her before. The she came to me and say, \u201cMr. David, is it your hotel rented?\u201d I say, \u201cyes, is rented, that man got an agreement for two years yet.\u201d \u2022 She say, \u201cI am awful sorry, I got a good party for you.\u201d I say, \u201cI am sorry, too, that the hotel, he got an agreement for two years.\u201d After that she say ,\u201cwell, Mr. David, how is going?\u201d I say, after that, I say, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Mrs. Brown ?\u201d She says, \u201cyes, I am Mrs. Brown,\u201d Then she said \u2014 stop again to talk, \u201cwell, what is the matter don\u2019t get married?\u201d and so on. I say, \u201cwell, I didn\u2019t get the right one yet.\u201d That is begin to talk. She told me she is fixing up the house, and she asked me about married. I says I didn\u2019t have the right one yet. She says, \u201chow is it about when the right one stand right in front of you ?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-8\">\u201cDefendant Levi David testified that he was nearly seventy-four years of age at the time of the hearing. Complainant testified that she was thirty-nine years of age at the time of the marriage; that she understood defendant was fifty-five years of age at the time of the marriage; that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>fendant had stated to the mayor who officiated at the marriage that his age was fifty-five. The certificate of marriage shows defendant\u2019s age as fifty-five. Defendant testified he gave his age as fifty-six. He testified that Mr. Champion read the deeds to him; that he thought he was signing for \u2018a third\u2019 of the properties; that he thought his wife was entitled to a third. Later, he testified that he thought he was giving her \u2018twenty-five per cent.\u2019 or \u2018a quarter.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-4\">\u201cOnly two witnesses testified for defendant. One, Mrs. Shapiro, testified that complainant and the other witness, Lillian Gilbert, met in Mrs. Shapiro\u2019s store \u2018a few month ago.\u2019 Lillian Gilbert testified that complainant then said, upon complainant being introduced to her, by Mrs. Shapiro, who then stated that Lillian Gilbert knew defendant Dorothy David, that she, complainant, had had no intercourse with her husband; that Mrs. Shapiro \u2018was right there and heard the whole conversation;\u2019 but Mrs. Shapiro did not testify to hearing any such conversation. It is extremely unlikely that complainant would make any such statement to a woman to whom she had just been introduced, when she knew that her husband was contesting in this court her marriage to him on the ground of non-consummation. Complainant denied having had any such conversation with Lillian Gilbert.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-5\">\u201cOn April 5th, 1930, prior to the abandonment, the husband conveyed his interest in his Atlantic City property to his three daughters, the defendants Bertha Eubenstein, Elene D. Loeb and Dorothy A. David, the consideration for the conveyance being expressed in this deed as $12,000 and love and affection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe answer of the defendants states that the defendant Levi David, on April 5th, 1930, conveyed his interest in his Philadelphia properties to the same daughters \u2018for cash moneys loaned and advanced from time to time by each of them to the said Levi David.\u2019 The husband testified that he conveyed the Philadelphia properties to these three daughters because \u2018I owed them money; they did not pay anything when I delivered deeds. I owed them $12,000.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-7\">\u201cAny rents received from the properties have not been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ceived by complainant, but apparently rents were received by the husband and/or his daughters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-4\">\u201cComplainant\u2019s bill of complaint alleges that defendant Levi David abandoned complainant and had neglected or refused to support her, and prays for a decree that he be decreed to maintain the complainant. And the bill prays for a discovery of the real estate belonging to Levi David; for a discovery of the consideration paid by the defendants Bertha Rubenstein, Elene D. Loeb and Dorothy A. David for the conveyance or conveyances by Levi David to them; for a discovery of the rents; that the defendants Bertha Ruben-stein, Elene D. Loeb and Dorothy A. David be decreed to convey the premises conveyed by the defendant Levi David so that the same may be sold if necessary, to comply with the decree of this court; that a receiver be appointed; that the defendants account for the rents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">\u201cThe joint and several answer of all the defendants denies the allegations of the bill, and avers that the conveyances to the defendants Bertha Rubenstein, Elene D. Loeb and Dorothy A. David were in payment of a cash indebtedness owed by Levi David to them severally; that the conveyance by him to them was for a valuable consideration; and denies a consummation of the marriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThere are two counter-claims, one by Levi David, in which he alleges that the conveyance to complainant was made in consideration that the complainant should marry him and consummate said marriage; that complainant refused to consummate the marriage; that Levi David never intended to convey to complainant a one-half interest in the premises, but only one-third interest therein; that this counter-claim prays that the conveyance to complainant may be set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-7\">\u201cThe second counter-claim prays that the marriage between Levi David and complainant may be declared null and void, for fraud. At the hearing, this second counter-claim was amended so that it became the counter-claim of the defendant Levi David Tor the use of Bertha Rubenstein, Elene D. Loeb and Dorothy A. David.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-8\">\u201cThe testimony of the husband was unsatisfactory, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>credible, and in large part a tiresome iteration of CI do not remember.\u2019 His testimony was plainly false in many particulars. Apparently he was not only estranged from his first wife and his daughters, defendants Bertha Rubenstein, Elene D. Loeb and Dorothy A. David, for many years, but he was bitter towards them all during the same period. His relations with his daughters were such that it is altogether unlikely that he would get money from them or that he had love or affection for them. I think he deliberately lied in giving his testimony. He impressed me very unfavorably. On the other hand, complainant seemed to me to be a truthful witness, and a woman who had made a great mistake in marrying this man, but who had done so honestly and in good faith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-4\">\u201cBy the conveyances to the daughters the husband divested himself of all his property. There is no proof of any consideration for the conveyances. It is clear that they were made with actual intent to defraud complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-5\">\u201cThe conveyances seem to have been made to the daughters equally. In making these omnibus conveyances, there was no attempt to match the values of the properties with the total of the sums alleged to be due to the grantees, nor any attempt to convey to the daughters in proportion to the alleged several debts due the daughters respectively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-6\">\u201cNone of the daughters testified. It may be that the daughters did not testify because, for one reason, that the wife\u2019s allegation was true, namely, that the mortgages on the properties were being foreclosed at the instance of the husband, to defeat complainant\u2019s interest in the properties, so that any decree to come, if against the husband, would not, in the daughters\u2019 view, have much effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">\u201cDefendants made no real attempt to prove the existence of any antecedent indebtedness which might furnish a consideration for the conveyances. It is clear that the conveyances were made as part of the husband\u2019s plan to defeat the wife\u2019s claim for support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-8\">\u201cI find there was no fraud in the marriage; that the marriage was consummated; that the husband unjustifiably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>abandoned complainant and refused and neglected to support her; and I advise a decree for maintenance, and will fix the amount thereof, and of counsel fees, on application. And I advise a decree that the defendants make discovery of the profits of the properties conveyed; that they account for one-half part of such profits; and that the counter-claim of the defendants be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-4\">\u201c(After deciding as above herein stated, it appearing that the husband was not complying with the decree for maintenance which had been entered, and that he could not be found, a supplemental decree was signed, adjudging that the conveyances were without consideration and made for the purpose of defrauding complainant, and directing a reconveyance of the properties.)\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-5\"><em>Mr. John G.
