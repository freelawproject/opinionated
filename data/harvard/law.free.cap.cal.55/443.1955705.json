Therefore, if you believe from the evidence that an iron tamping-bar was an unsafe instrument to use on the powder, or if you believe that a wooden bar would have been safer, then it was negligence on the part of the defendant to furnish iron tamping-bars to its employes, provided the defendant knew, or by the use of ordinary care and diligence could have ascertained, that such iron bar was unsafe, or that a wooden bar would have been safer, and the plaintiff was ignorant thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-4\"><em>u </em>Fifth.\u2014That if you believe, from the evidence, that the powder, aside from- the implements used upon it, was unsafe and dangerous in itself, when handled and employed in the same way as black powder, and that the defendant either knew or could have known that fact by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, then you must find for the plaintiff, provided you further believe, from the evidence, that the plaintiff was ignorant of that fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">\u201cSeventh.\u2014That if there is a proximate and discoverable cause which may have produced the injury, and which the evidence will warrant you in finding was sufficient for that end, then the mere fact that another cause existed which was adequate to the production of the same result, will not necessarily relieve the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\"><em>11 </em>Eighth.\u2014That when one enters into the service of another, he assumes the probable risks incident to the service, but the risk which the servant assumes must be measured by the master\u2019s duty, and is qualified by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\"><em>11 </em>Ninth.\u2014That there is another qualification or exception to the risk which the servant assumes, and that is, he assumes no risk except such as existed at the beginning of the employment, and such as arc incident to the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">\u201c Tenth.\u2014In order to imply assent to the hazards and risks, they must be patent, and such as the servant knows of or ought to know of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">\u201c Twelfth.\u2014That the defendant cannot relieve itself from responsibility on account of the carelessness or negligence of a third party; therefore,if you believe that Joseph Thomas was careless or negligent in the use of the powder, and that the- de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>fondant, relying on his statement, used the powder in a careless or negligent manner, it is evidence of negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\">\u201c Thirteenth.\u2014The employer must in all cases indemnify his employe for losses caused by the employer\u2019s want of ordinary care, and if the plaintiff necessarily suffered loss and injury in direct consequence of his obedience to the directions of his employer, he is entitled to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">\u201cFourteenth.-^That if you believe, from the evidence, that the negligent act complained of was committed before the defendant had properly and carefully performed its duty, you must find for the plaintiff, unless you are satisfied that the Excelsior powder, in comparison with black powder, is safe when submitted to the same tests as black powder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">\u201cFifteenth.\u2014That 6 ordinary care \u2019 is dependent in a great measure upon the circumstances of each particular case, and that in the use of combustible or explosive materials, great care is required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">\u201cEighteenth.\u2014In estimating damages, the jury should take into consideration the bodily suffering of the plaintiff, his pain of mind, and his business, and all expenses, if any, incurred on account of injuries received, and the employment of physicians and nurses, medicine and board, and also whether the injuries are likely to be permanent or only temporary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-8\">\u201cNineteenth.\u2014That if you should find for the plaintiff, he is entitled to recover not only the amount of damages which he suffered prior to the commencement of the action, but also all the damages proceeding continuously from the injury complained of, which he has suffered up to the verdict, and which it is reasonably certain that he will suffer in the future. In other words, if the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action, you should allow him such damages as in your opinion will fully compensate him for the loss and injury he has sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-9\">\u201cTwentieth.\u2014You are instructed that the defendant in this action cannot avail itself of the experiments performed by the Excelsior Powder Company, or of the Providence Mining Company, prior to the introduction by the defendant of Excelsior powder into its mine, as evidence of care on its part, unless you believe, from the evidence, that the defendant knew of these experiments at that time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Thereafter, the Court, of its own motion, gave to the jury, in writing, the following instructions, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-4\">\u201cIn this case, as it appears to me, one of the most material questions grows out of the point made by the plaintiff, at the trial, that the defendant introduced into its mine a new powder, known to it to be highly dangerous and unsafe when used for blasting purposes in the same manner as black powder, without disclosing that fact to the plaintiff; but, on the contrary, di- ' rccted him to use it, and tamp in every respect as he had been accustomed to use and tamp black powder; whereby, though he followed such direction with great care, prudence, and skill, a premature explosion occurred, by reason of his tamping it with an iron bar, as miners were accustomed to tamp black powder, and he was thereby injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">\u201c Upon this point, I charge you that if the foreman, under whom the plaintiff was working, and from whom he took his orders, was charged with the duty, and had the power to employ and discharge the men, and knew, or had reason to believe, the Excelsior powder could not with safety be tamped with an iron tamping-bar, and without informing the plaintiff thereof, or imparting to him the knowledge lie possessed, directed him to use it, and treat it in the same manner as he had been accustomed to treat black powder, including the use of the iron bar; and if the plaintiff followed such directions with ordinary care, prudence, and skill, and a premature explosion occurred by reason of the use of the iron tamping-bar, then the defendant is liable for the injuries the plaintiff thereby sustained, provided said plaintiff was, at the time, ignorant upon the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">\u201c It is true that the plaintiff, when he contracted with the defendant to work in its mine, took ripon himself all the risks necessarily and usually incident to such employment, but if the defendant had knowledge or information showing that the particular powder was dangerous or unsafe to a degree beyond that which plaintiff could fairly be supposed to know, or anticipate, it was bound to impart to him such information as that he might then have the opportunity of deciding for himself whether or not he would assume the extra risk and danger.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-7\"><em>Dibble &amp; Kitts, </em>and <em>Geo.

(Wood\u2019s Master and Servant, 558; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Smithville, </em>29 Conn. 558.) The plaintiff was aware of the particular risk, and accepted it, and cannot complain. <em>(Sullivan </em>v. <em>India M. Co. </em>113 Mass. 398-9; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>N. Bedf. C.

Counsel here cites very numerous authorities to support the instructions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-4\">Myrick, J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">This action was brought to recover damages for personal injuries to plaintiff, caused by the premature explosion of blasting powder, known as Excelsior powder, manufactured by one Haffenager. Under the pleadings in this case the substantial issues were: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">1. As to the safety of the Excelsior powder as a blasting powder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">2. As to whether the defendant exercised due care in supplying a reasonably safe powder, and in permitting the Excelsior powder to be used by its -workmen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">3. Whether the plaintiff knew or ought to have known of the qualities of the powder, and whether he exercised due care in its use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">4. Whether the defendant provided proper appliances for the use of the powder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The Court fully and clearly instructed the jury as to the relations existing between plaintiff and defendant as master and employe, the obligations resting upon each toward the other, and as to the care proper to be exercised by each.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Upon the trial, plaintiff asked the witness Price whether Ilaffenao-er was a skillful chemist or scientist. Plaintiff also asked O the witness Drisco as to the reputation of Haffenager as a scientist or chemist. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s objection, \"the Court permitted \u25a0 the questions to be asked. There was no error in these rulings, as the defendant had by its answer tendered the issue \u201c that said Haffenager was reputed to be and was an accomplished chemist and scientist.\u201d Plaintiff asked the question, \u201c What was the reputation of Haffenagcr\u2019s powder as a safe or dangerous blasting compound ? \u201d The witness to whom this question was put, was a quarryman at the Oakland quarry. It does not appear that the reputation referred to by the inquiries to' him ever came to the knowledge of defendant or its officers or agents; nor that it existed in any place where it would be the duty of defendant to have made inquiries; nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>did plaintiff offer to place that reputation in any locality; the witness may have known the reputation of tlie powder at Oakland, or in some foreign country. The <em>reputation </em>of the powder was not directly in issue. <em>Its safety </em>was the point in issue. Its reputation was material only in the light of showing whether defendant used proper care in ascertaining its safety. The admission of the answer to this question was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The defendant\u2019s witness, Polglase, testified that he was a practical miner, not a scientist or chemist; did not know what ingredients composed the Excelsior, black, or Giant powder; had used blasting powders twenty-two years; had used about six hundred pounds of Excelsior powder in six hundred to a thousand blasts in the defendant\u2019s mine before the injury to plaintiff, and that no injury of any kind had occurred. He was then asked by defendant, \u201c In the light of your experience, what do you say as to the safety of the Excelsior powder for blasting purposes ? \u201d Plaintiff\u2019s objection to this question was sustained. Under \u00a7 1870, subd. 9, Code of Civil Procedure, defendant was entitled to the opinion of the witness, otherwise no miner, nor any person not a professional scientist or chemist, no matter what experience he may have had, can give his opinion. Usually, the question whether a person be an expert is for the trial court to determine definitely, and the ruling will not be reviewed ; but in this case we think the defendant was entitled to the opinion of the witness, based as it was upon his own experience. <em>(Estate of </em>Toomes, 54 Cal. 509, and authorities there cited; <em>Blood </em>v. Light, 31 Cal. 115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We think that all the instructions given, and all the rulings upon instructions, were correct,'with one exception, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cNinth,\u2014That there is another qualification or exception to the risk which the servant assumes, and that is, he assumes no risk, except such as existed at the beginning of the employment, and such as are incident to the business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">This instruction was given at the request of plaintiff. As we understand the instruction, it is, that the employe assumes such risks, and such risks only, (not incident to the business) as existed at the beginning of the employment; and if there be a risk which did not exist until after the beginning of the employment, but commenced to exist during the course of the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ment, the employe had no risk regarding the same. We do not think that this instruction states the correct rule. It should have added to it words equivalent to these: or which existed during the course of the employment, of which the employe had knowledge or was bound to have knowledge.\u201d If an appliance be introduced after the commencement of the employment, from the use of which follows a risk which the employe knows or ought to know\u2014that is, if the risk or danger be known to him or be patent and obvious\u2014he assumes the risk by continuing in the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">G. D. Buckley, Esq., attorney for respondent, makes the point, \u201c There can be no valid appeal from the decision of the Court denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, for the reason that no notice of motion to that effect was served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney of record.\u201d The history of the ease relating to attorneys for plaintiff is as follows: The complaint is signed \u201c G. D. Buckley, plaintiff\u2019s attorney.\u201d The order of court, rendering judgment, recites that the cause came on for trial; \u201cthe said parties appeared by their attorneys; G. D. Buckley and H. V. Beardan appeared as counsel for the plaintiff,\u201d etc. Service of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was accepted by \u201c II. V. Beardan, one of the attorneys for plaintiff.\u201d Service of the notice of appeal was admitted by \u201cG. D. Buckley and II. V. Beardan, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys.\u201d Service of the transcript was admitted by \u201c G. D. Buckley and H. Y. Beardan, attorneys for plaintiff and respondent.\u201d The transcript is indorsed, \u201c G. D. Buckley, Esq., H. Y. Beardan, Esq.| attorneys for respondent.\u201d Three briefs have been filed on behalf of respondent, one signed \u201c Buckley <em>&amp; </em>Beardan, attorneys for respondent,\u201d one \u201c II. Y. Beardan, attorney for respondent,\u201d indorsed \u201c G. D. Buckley, Esq., II. Y. Beardan, attorneys for respondent \u201d; the other, in which the point is made, is signed \u201c G. D. Buckley, attorney for respondent.\u201d On the argument, both gentlemen appeared and took part.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">From this history it seems to us that Mr. Buckley has recognized Mr. Beardan as his associate in the case sufficiently to estop him and his client from <em>now </em>saying that Mr. Beardan was not, at the service of notice of motion for a new trial, one of the attorneys for plaintiff, and as such entitled to receive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>service. Mr. Buckley\u2019s acts constitute a waiver. Any other view would be as unjust to Mr. Reardan as to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b477-5\">Sharpstein, J., concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I concur in the reversal of the judgment and order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. As to the point that the notice of motion for a new trial was not served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney of record, I think that it should be disregarded, on the ground that the objection comes too late.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
