The appearance of Mr. Smith for defendants ivas merely equivalent to service of the summons; and, notwithstanding this appearance, defendants had the statutory time. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 416; <em>Pearce </em>v. Tally, 8 Tex. 304.) The error can be reviewed on an appeal from the judgment. <em>(Ricketson </em>v. Compton, 23 Cal. 638; <em>Gimmy </em>v.

Neither of the defendants answered, and the summons, with the affidavit or proof of service, and the complaint, with a memorandum indorsed thereon that the default of the defendants in not answer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ing was entered, constitute a part of the judgment roll; and the question whether there was error in the entry of the default of the defendants before the expiration of ten days after service of summons upon them, can be considered on the appeal from the judgment. The Court below seems to have laid some stress upon the fact of a notice of appearance for the defendants having been given by their attorney the day before the default was entered. The effect of that notice was not to shorten the time within which the defendants were allowed by law to answer. They were entitled to ten days after the service of the summons upon them within which to demur or answer, and it was error to enter their default before the expiration of that period of time. <em>(Burt </em>v. <em>Scrantom,, </em>1 Cal. 416 ; <em>Ricketson </em>v.
