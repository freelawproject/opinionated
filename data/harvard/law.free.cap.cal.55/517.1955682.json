S. Stats, at Large, 1863-4, p. 325), provides: \u201c There shall be, and <em>is hereby granted to the State of California </em>the cleft or gorge in the granite peak of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, situated in the County of Mariposa, in the State aforesaid, and the headwaters of the Merced River, and known as the Yosemite Valley, with its branches,\u201d etc., \u201cwith the stipulation, nevertheless, <em>that the said State shall accept this grant with the express conditions </em>that the premises shall be held for <em>public use, resort and recreation, </em>shall be inalienable for all time, but leases not exceeding ten years may be granted for portions of said premises. All incomes to be derived from leases of privileges to be expended in the preservation and improvement of the property or the roads leading thereto. * * * * * The premises to be managed by the Governor of the State, with eight other commissioners, to be appointed by the executive of California, who shall receive no compensation for their services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">It will be observed that by the terms of the act of Congress the grant <em>to the State of California </em>was to take effect when the State should <em>accept, </em>with certain conditions : \u201c With the <em>stipulation, </em>nevertheless, that the said State <em>shall accept this grant with the express </em>conditions,\u201d etc. When the act of Congress was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>passed, there was no perfected agreement with the State; the act was a proffer to the State, and was to operate a grant, provided the State should join in the stipulation that certain conditions\u2014in the nature of conditions subsequent\u2014should be by it assumed. It is not necessary to inquire whether by any legal proceeding, based upon a forfeiture, the land could be recovered by the Federal Government in case the State should fail to comply with the obligations by it assumed with reference to the subject of the grant, or whether the Tosemite Valley passed forever to the State, in reliance upon the pledged honor of the State that it should be preserved, dedicated, and managed as contemplated by the act of Congress. Ho provision of the act of the California Legislature of April 15th, 1880, has been called to our attention as being in itself a violation of any one of the conditions named in the act of Congress, or of any part of the stipulation entered into by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">By the first section of the Act of April 2nd, 1866, (Stat. of California, 1865-6, p. 710) the Legislature <em>accepted </em>the grant for the State \u201cupon the conditions, reservations, and stipulations contained in said act of Congress,\u201d and thereby became bound to carry into effect the stipulation which it had entered into, and which the act of Congress had required should be entered into, as a condition to the grant becoming operative. By accepting the grant upon the stipulations contained in the act of Congress, the State assumed the duty of providing, by appropriate legislation, 1st, for inalienably preserving the premises for public use, resort, and recreation ; 2nd, prohibiting leases of any portion for a longer term than ten years; 3rd, for the application of all \u201cincomes \u201d to the preservation or improvement of the property or roads leading thereto; 4th, authorizing the Governor to appoint eight commissioners, who, with himself, shall, without compensation, \u201c manage \u201d the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The fact that the Legislature, on the 2nd of April, 1866, discharged its duty (by legislation with reference to the several subjects, with respect to which legislation was pledged by the acceptance of the grant) <em>in the same act </em>as that which contained the acceptance, does not affect the question we are considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The grant was accepted, upon the conditions, etc., and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>rest of the act may be treated as if it were a separate and subsequent law\u2014^ law which may be changed as often as the representatives of the people of the State .may deem it proper; provided the stipulation or pledge of the State, given when the grant was accepted, is not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">There can be no doubt that, by accepting the grant, the State assumed certain obligations in the <em>nature </em>of a trust, which it would be a violation of good faith to disregard. We know of no way by which these obligations can be enforced in a State court; but, however this may be, we arc quite certain that as yet no violation of the duties imposed upon the State by her acceptance of the grant has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">It is urged by counsel for respondent that the act of Congress and the statute of the State created a \u201c charity.\u201d In a larger sense, this is true, since the legislation, national and State, while placing the legal title in the State, was intended to operate as a gift to the general public use, free from \u201c the taint of every consideration, personal, private, and selfish.\u201d But when we inquire whether the result is a <em>gift for charitable uses, </em>such as may be <em>regulated, directed, and enforced by a Court of Equity, </em>we are met by insurmountable obstacles to the conclusion that the matter is within any branch of equitable jurisdiction of which this Court can take cognizance. It is a dedication to the public, brought about by the combined action of the Federal and State Governments. The State is the trustee\u2014if there be a trustee\u2014but a trustee whom this Court has no power to remove. We cannot enforce any decree with respect to the mode or manner in which the State sir all discharge the duties it has assumed. (Hill on Trustees, 49; Perry on Trusts, 40, 41.) The commissioners are mere agents of the State, who bear no relation (other than that borne by other citizens) to the Government of the United States, but whose duties are defined, whose powers exercised, under and by virtue of State laws alone. Persons thus clothed with functions affecting the public, assigned to them by State laws, arc <em>officers </em>of the State. <em>(Bradford </em>v. <em>Justices\u2019 Court, </em>33 Ga. 332; <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>23 Ind. 449; <em>Waldo </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>12 id. 569; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mayor etc. </em>37 N. Y. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The nature of the title created by the Federal and State leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>islation must depend simply upon the act of Congress and the State statute. Upon a reference to them, we can discover but a distant analogy between the present and the cases cited in the able and ingenious brief of counsel for respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In <em>Price </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>28 Pa. St. 23, it was held that a devise to a <em>school, </em>where both rich and poor were taught, and religious was combined with literary and scientific instruction, was for charitable uses. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>Amb. 651, was a bequest of money to be applied to the purchase of water-works for the inhabitants of a town. Held, a charitable use, void by the statute of mortmain. <em>McDonogh </em>v. <em>Murdoch, </em>15 How. 367, determined the validity of legacies, for charities, to the cities of Baltimore and Hew Orleans; and held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the cities were authorized to take by the laws of Maryland and Louisiana. In <em>Mitford </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>1 Phill. Ch. 105, it seems to have been assumed that a devise to the \u201c Government of Bengal \u201d was a devise to the Governor-General as an individual. In <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Heelis, </em>2 Sim. &amp; Stu. 67, it was said that a fund derived wholly from assessments under an act of Parliament, and not at all from bounty, was not a charitable fund to be administered by a Court of Equity. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Neale, </em>5 Allen, 575, and <em>Coggeshall </em>v. <em>Pelton, </em>7 Johns. Ch. 292, decide that certain cities were competent to be trustees. In <em>Inglis </em>v. <em>Trustees of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor, </em>3 Peters, 99, it was held that a bequest to the Chancellor of the State of Hew York Avas equivalent to a designation of that officer by his proper name, and the trust Avas to be executed by him in his individual character. In <em>Nightingale </em>v. <em>Goulbourne, </em>2 Phill. Ch. 594, that a bequest to the Chancellor of Exchequer was a bequest to the holder of the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">It may be admitted that one may sometimes be charged as trustee Avho is clothed with a poAver with reference to real estate, although the legal title may not be vested in him. It is Arcry possible that, in a proceeding brought by the State, the Yosemite commissioners might be compelled to an accounting, etc., in case of misappropriation of funds. But this Avould not make them any the less officers, nor could it affect the question of the poAver of the Legislature to provide for their removal and the appointment of other persons in their stead. The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ute of April 15th, 1880, like that of April 2nd, 1866, provides for eight commissioners to. be appointed by the Governor, who, with that officer, are required to <em>manage </em>the property in accordance with the stipulation entered into by the State when the grant was accepted. Inasmuch as the commissioners originally appointed were officers, their term of office expired four years after their appointment. (Const, of 1849, art. x, \u00a7 7; Const, of 1879, art. xx, \u00a7 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions that the Court below enter judgment as prayed for in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Sharpstein, J., Myrick, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Thornton, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
