The act of approving the valuation necessarily involves an examination of the subject, and the exercise of official judgment and discretion; and the rule is universal, that in such cases mandamus will not lie.

Without some such provision the Controller could have no official knowledge of any demand against the State. At most, the Governor had only the power to examine the <em>mode </em>of proceeding for the purpose of ascertaining if that proceeding had been conducted as required by the act. <em>(Koppikus </em>v. <em>The State Capitol </em>Commissioners, 16 Cal. 255; <em>Stockton R.

Until he shall concur with the appraisal, the condemnation cannot be made operative. This necessarily involves an inquiry e.nd ascertainment of the actual value of the property, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>employment of judgment and discretion on the part of the Governor. The power to determine whether the appraisal is correct is his, and we cannot deprive him of his discretion or adjudicate the value for him. In all matters resting in the sound discretion of the person to whom a duty is confided by law, mandamus will not lie to control the discretion or determine the decision which is to be made.

The application here is, that he be compelled to issue his certificate <em>approving </em>the valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Boss, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">[By agreement between McKee, J., and Thornton, J., the latter acted for the former in this case.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
