What is meant by <em>a special provision </em>is illustrated by the former law providing for the government of the library.

The objection is urged by respondent that the books, etc., required by the library should first be purchased, and the claims therefor be presented to the Board of Examiners for their inspection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>approval. Wo do not think that the transactions of the Board of Trustees are the basis of claims within the meaning of \u00a7 660, Political Code. The chapter of the Political Code relating to the State Library, places the library under the control of the Board of Trustees, and authorizes the board \u201c to draw from the State treasury, at any time, all the moneys therein belonging to the library fund; \u2018and the librarian is to purchase books, maps, engravings, paintings, and furniture for the library,\u2019 according to such rules and regulations' as the Board of Trustees may prescribe.\u201d Their judgment, then, as to what books, etc., may be proper to be added to the library, is not subject to review by the Board of Examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Let the writ issue as prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Sharpstein, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
