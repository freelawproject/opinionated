They have been paid their salaries for eleven months, and the question here is whether they are entitled to their salaries for the month of June, 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We see no difficulty in construing the provisions of the act according to the terms employed. The term of office commenced from the \u201cappointment by the Governor,\u201d and that the qualification of the Commissioners was not intended to be included in the word \u201c appointment,\u201d is apparent from the wording of the second section, which provides that the qualification shall take place after the appointment. Doubtless the Commissioners were not authorized to proceed with the investigations committed to their charge until they had qualified. But they were obliged, by the language of the act, to qualify within thirty days after their appointment, and their failure to qualify would have operated a vacation of their appointment; but when they did qualify, they became entitled to their salary from the date of the Governor\u2019s appointment. From the date of that appointment, the appointees were in office or they were not. The statute <em>says </em>that their office commenced with the appointment, and further, that their qualification was a different and subsequent thing from their appointment. The case would be different if the law in terms required them to take the oath before their term should commence. We are quite convinced that petitioners were \u201cholding the office\u201d from the date of the Governor\u2019s appointment. This would not sometimes be the case. As was said by Field, J. <em>(People </em>v. Whitman, 10 Cal. 47): \u201c To the complete investiture of an office, the acts of the appointing power and of the person appointed, must, <em>in some instances, </em>concur. The appointment is complete when the commission is signed by the President, but it is competent for Congress to require the performance of certain acts by the appointee, such as the execution of security, the taking of an oath of office, and the like, before he can enter into possession of the office. <em>This has been done </em>in relation to the office of Surveyor-General. The performance of the acts arc conditions precedent to the holding of the office. (<em>United States </em>v. <em>Le Baron, </em>19 How. 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>It is also competent for the Legislature to make the taking of the oath of office, etc., a condition subsequent, and to provide, as in the case before us, that the appointees should hold the office from the date of the appointment, subject to the condition that if they failed to qualify, or perform some other act, the appointment should go for naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">By this reasoning the State loses nothing, since the term of office was twelve months, and if the term did not commence until one month after the appointment, the Commissioners are entitled to a salary for the month of July, 1877. They are entitled to be paid for twelve months\u2014they have been paid but for eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Let the writ issue as prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Boss, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
