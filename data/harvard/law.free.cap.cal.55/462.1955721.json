Verbal notice alone was given by the clerk to the Superior Judge and Sheriff, but inasmuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>as the object of the provision requiring notice is only that those officers may be present, and as the case shows that both were, in fact, present when the drawing was had, it is entirely immaterial whether <em>any </em>notice was given them.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Section 215 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires that the clerk shall notify the Sheriff and <em>County Judge. </em>It would seem that it was intended that the Superior Judge should succeed to the duty of the County Judge in respect to the drawing of jurors. (Const. Schedule, \u00a7 3.) But even if there be doubt of this, the statute, in respect to the mode of drawing, is not \u201c inconsistent \u201d with the Constitution, except in the particular that there is no longer a County Judge. In other respects, it continues in Operation and effect by virtue of section <em>one </em>of the <em>Schedule. </em>It follows that the grand jurors were regularly drawn, the <em>cleric </em>and <em>Sheriff </em>being present.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
