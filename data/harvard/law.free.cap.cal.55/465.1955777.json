The defendant failing to answer within the twenty days allowed, a judgment by default was entered against him, which was afterward set aside by the Court. The affidavit upon which the default was opened was by the defendant\u2019s attorney, and was to the effect that the demurrer was not heard on the first day of the term, as was the usual practice of the Court, but was called up upon special notice at a later day; that it was the custom of affiant to take memoranda of orders made at the beginning of the term, but that, for the reasons above stated, he failed, through inadvertence to make any mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>orandum of the order in question; that affiant was engaged in other matters during the remainder of the term\u2014forgot all about the case; that defendant had stated the facts constituting his defense to affiant, as stated in the proposed answer filed with the affidavit, and that affiant engaged and fully intended to file an answer, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">The stipulation referred to in the opinion was for the entry of the order for the continuance of the case referred to above.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-6\"><em>J.
