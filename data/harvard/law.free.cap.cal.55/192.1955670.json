The plaintiff claimed under a patent issued upon a mineral claim, of date Dec. 9th, 1873. The defendant, in its answer, alleged that the timber was granted to its predecessor, the Central Pacific Eailroad Company of California, by the Act of Congress of July 1st, 1862, entitled \u201c An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri Eiver to the Pacific Ocean,\u201d etc. The judgment recites that, by consent of the parties, the plaintiff\u2019s patent was made part of his pleading, and that the cause was submitted to the Court upon the pleadings.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-8\"><em>W.

Plaintiff claims it by virtue of his patent, issued December 9th, 1873. There are five reservations in this patent, and there is no reservation of timber at all. The defendants claim that they are entitled to the timber under the Act of Congress of 1862. (Eeads act.) It is under that that the railroad company claims the timber.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-9\"><em>Mr. Justice </em>McKinstry, presiding.</author>\n<p id=\"ApG\">The words of the grant are very broad. We all think that this judgment will have to be affirmed. The language seems to be about as broad as it can be : that \u201c the timber thereon is hereby granted.\u201d The only possible doubt would be as to whether \u201c timber \u201d included all trees and wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Hale &amp; Craig, for </em>Respondent.\u2014There is no controversy as to that, I understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><em>Mr. Justice </em>McKinstry.\u2014Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
