It is alleged in the complaint, and denied in the answer, that the $1,000 note was made in lieu of the balance on the second note. The Court found that Bouton made the note, but failed to find for what it was given. The evidence clearly showed that the $1,000 note was given for the balance of the other note; and the law is settled that, in such case, unless the new note is intended as a payment, it remains secured by the mortgage.

(<em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>50 Cal. 105.) The findings of the Court are fully sustained by the evidence, and the authorities cited by respondent do not apply. If the assignment to Mrs. Bouton had merely transferred an interest in the note equal to $2,551.36, the argument might have some force ; but, as a matter of fact, she is the holder of, and owns the whole of the note, and the assignment carried with it a corresponding interest in the mortgage.

Bouton, denies that the payment was made on the second note mentioned in the complaint, or that the same was ever surrendered to E. Bouton, or that he in lieu thereof, or for the balance thereon, executed and delivered the $1,000 note; and denies, further, that on the 1st of July, 1876, or at any time, it was agreed that the $1,000 should be secured by the mortgage. Defendant Margaret F., by way of <em>cross-complaint, </em>alleges that \u201con the 1st day of July, A. D. 1876, said plaintiff, for a valuable consideration, to wit, the payment to her by this defendant of the sum of $2,551.36, United States gold coin, indorsed, assigned, sold, transferred, and delivered the note hereinbefore fully set forth, and which fell due on the 22nd day of April, 1877, together with said mortgage, by which the payment of said note was so secured to this defendant, who ever since then has been and is now the lawful owner and holder of said last mentioned note, and the mortgage by which the payment of the same is secured as above set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u201c That the whole of the principal sum mentioned in the last described note is unpaid, and no portion of the interest thereon has been paid, and there is now due from said E. Bouton as principal, and said Nancy Wakefield as indorser on said note, the sum of $3,108, gold coin, and interest thereon at the rate of one per cent, per month from April 22nd, 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201c That this defendant, as the indorsee of plaintiff, holds a prior lien on said mortgaged premises as security for the payment of said last named note and interest, and that the interests of the other parties to this action in said mortgaged premises are all subject to said lien of this defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth findings are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201c 3. That on the 1st day of July, A. D. 1876, and while she was the lawful owner and holder thereof, this plaintiff for a valuable consideration, to wit, the payment to her by the defendent, Margaret F. Bouton, of the sum of $2,551.36, in United States gold coin, which sum was then and there the separate property of said Margaret F. Bouton, indorsed, assigned, sold, transferred, and delivered the second of the hereinbefore described notes, to wit, the said note which fell due as aforesaid on the 22nd day of July, 1877, together with the said mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>by which the payment of the said note was so secured, to the defendant, Margaret F. Bouton, as her separate estate, who ever since then has been and is now the lawful owner and holder thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201c4. That the defendant, E. Bouton, on the 1st day of July, 1876, executed and delivered to the plaintiff herein his certain promissory note for the sum of $1,000, gold coin of the United States, payable two months after its said date, with interest thereon in like gold coin, at the rate of one and one-half per cent, per month until paid, and the payment of the principal sum, or the interest thereon, as mentioned in the said last named note, was not at any time secured either in whole or in part; nor was it ever agreed by or between any of the parties to this suit that the said principal sum, or interest thereon, or any part thereof, should be secured to be paid by said mortgage, or should in any way become a lien upon said mortgaged premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201c 5. That no payment of principal or interest has ever been paid upon cither of the aforesaid three notes, and the same remain wholly due, unpaid, and unsatisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201c 6. That said plaintiff is now the lawful owner or holder of the first of said notes mentioned in the complaint, and which fell due as aforesaid on April 22nd, 1876, and there is now due and owing to her thereon from the defendant, E. Bouton, the sum of $3,108, Avith interest from April 22nd, 1875, at the rate of one per cent, per month, all in gold coin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c 7. That there is now due and OAving from said defendant, E. Bouton, on the second mentioned note described in the complaint, and which fell due as aforesaid on the 22nd day of April, 1877, to said Margaret F. Bouton, avIio is now the lawful OAvner and holder thereof as aforesaid, the sum of $3,108, with interest from April 22nd, 1875, at the rate of one per cent, per month, all in gold coin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c 8. That both the principal sum and interest due upon said \u00edavo last mentioned notes of dates April 22nd, 1875, are a lien upon said mortgaged premises, and the payment of the same\" is secured by said mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">These findings are attacked by appellant as not sustained by the evidence. If it were a question of fact to be passed upon by us as an original question, we Avould entertain doubt Avhether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the plaintiff fully understood the arrangement, and that her indorsement Avould operate an assignment of the note for $3,108, and <em>pro tanto </em>of the mortgage; but the Court below, before whom the Avitnesses appeared, found in effect that the minds of the parties met, and denied a motion for a neAv trial. There certainly was a conflict in the evidence, since the witness, E. Bouton, swore that he explained to witness that his wife, the defendent, Margaret F. Bouton, would not advance the money unless the security was transferred to her, and that he Avould require plaintiff to indorse the note (which she did) so that he could deliver it to Margaret F., to secure her. The mortgage note was not then due, and the note Avhich he gave for the balance bore one-half per cent more interest, than did the note secured by the mortgage. It has been so repeatedly held that we Avill not reverse a finding of fact when there is a substantial conflict in the evidence, that it is unnecessary to do more than again call attention to the rule. What is said above applies to the finding that nothing was paid in satisfaction of the second of the notes secured <em>by </em>the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u25a0 It is urged that the Court below failed to find upon a material issue. The complaint alleges that the $1,000 note Avas given in lieu of the second note described in the complaint and for the balance thereon, and the ansAver denied this allegation. It is said the Court found that defendant, E. Bouton, made and delivered to plaintiff the note for $1,000, hut failed to find for what said note was given. But the case sIioavs that $1,000 was (approximately) the balance due upon the note indorsed, and the Court did find that it never was agreed between the parties that the $1,000 note should he secured to he paid by the mortgage, or should in any way become a lien on the mortgaged premises. It is alleged in the complaint, and not denied' in the answers, that the $1000 note was given for the balance due on the note indorsed. The real issue, therefore, Avas whether that note was to he secured by the mortgage, and upon that issue the Court found as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Mobbison, C. J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
