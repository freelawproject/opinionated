Defendant relies upon an instrument hereinafter recited, which was executed and delivered by plaintiff in consideration of two thousand dollars paid him by defendant. It is perfectly obvious that plaintiff cannot come into a Court of Equity and ask for a decree debarring defendant from asserting any claim under the instrument, without restoring the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">But defendant has set forth the nature of his claim, and is entitled to have his rights adjudicated. The decision of this case, therefore, must turn upon the construction of the instrument following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201c This indenture, made the fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, between Solomon Chandler and Naomi Chandler, his wife, of the County of Yolo, and State of California, parties of the first part, and Gates S.

(Hawes </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>49 Cal. 369.) If it be also assumed that the English <em>Statute of Uses </em>was part of our law prior to the Codes, the deed could not operate as a <em>covenant to stand seized to uses, </em>because the only consideration for such covenant was blood or marriage. (2 Bl. Com. 338.) Whether the statute 27 Henry viii, chap. 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>is a portion of our law or not, it is quite certain that the <em>Statute of </em>Enrollments, 27 Henry viii, chap. 16, has never been in force in this State, because its provisions are in conflict with our system of laws, and with specific statutes, and the common law of England has never been adopted \u201c as a rule of decision\u201d only so far as it is not repugnant to the laws of this State. (Pol. Code, \u00a7 4168.) If the Statute of Uses was part of our law, one could have covenanted to stand seized, or bargain and sell, to the use of another at a future day.. (4 Kent, 298.) Chancellor Walworth, in the Court for the Correction of Errors, in an opinion, \u201cthe reasoning of which,\u201d says Professor Washburn, 3 Peal Prop. 325, \u201c would seem to leave little doubt in the matter beyond what arises from the circumstances that other courts have taken a different view of the law,\u201d shows that a freehold <em>in futuro </em>could be created by a bargain and sale operating under the Statute of Uses. <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>Eagle Fire Co. of New York, </em>9 Wend. 621.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">If the Statute of Uses was not in force in this State when the deed was executed, the bargain and sale will be recognized and enforced in a Court of Equity, as it would have been before the statute. When uses were raised by conveyances at common law, operating by transmutation of possession, the uses declared in such conveyances did not require a consideration. The real owner had divested himself of the legal estate, and the person in whom it was vested being a mere naked trustee, equity held him bound in conscience to execute the directions of the donor. If there were no uses declared, and no consideration, the use resulted to the feoffor or releasor, for, under such circumstances, it would not be presumed that the feoffor or releasor intended to part with the use. In case of covenants to stand seized, and of a bargain and sale, prior to the Statute of Uses, the inheritance remained in the contracting party. In such case the transaction was a mere contract which required either a good or a valuable consideration, without which it would not be enforced by a Court of Equity. (4 Kent.) Where, however, the covenant to stand seized, or bargain and sale, was supported by a proper consideration, there can be no doubt that a Court of Equity would, and now should, contemplate the actual rights of the parties, and construe the instrument in such manner as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>effectuate their intention. Admitting the instrument cannot be enforced as a grant, it is a contract on the part of the bargainer to transfer the whole legal estate to the bargainee, and on the part of the latter to convey a life estate to the former. The decree might have provided for appropriate conveyances to carry out the evident purpose of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Kor is it necessary to decide whether the English Statute of Uses was adopted in this State as a portion of the common law. If the clause in the deed may be construed as a declaration of trust by defendant, and the effect of the statute was to transfer the life estate to <em>cestui qui </em>use\u2014or if its effect was to give a life estate to the bargainer with remainder in the bargainee\u2014or if, by any other theory as to the effect of the statute, the use and legal title were united, during the life of plaintiff, a Court of Equity, to Avhom the AAdiole matter has been submitted, has power to settle and determine the actual rights of the parties, (and prevent future complications) by decreeing a formal conveyance of the fee from plaintiff to defendant, and a reconveyance for the life of the former by the latter. In our opinion this should be done. (See <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Estate of </em>Dodge, 2 Wms. (Vt.) 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The order denying a new trial is affirmed. The judgment is reversed, and the Court beloAv is directed to enter a decree in iccordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Ross, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
