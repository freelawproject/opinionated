The answer denies all the allegations of the complaint, except the taking, and alleges in effect that the defendant took the goods as Sheriff of San Bernardino County, by virtue of executions against the plaintiff\u2019s vendor (Gilman) ; and that the property was, at the time of the levy, the property of said Gilman, and that all interest of the plaintiff in the property was by virtue of a pretended sale to her by the said Gilman; and that the said sale is and was void, and fraudulently made for the purpose of hindering, delaying, and defrauding creditors of said Gilman, and without any consideration from plaintiff. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-7\"><em>C. W. C. Rowell, A. B.
