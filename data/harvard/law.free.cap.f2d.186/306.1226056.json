See Commissioner v. Culbertson, 337 U.S. 733, 69 S.Ct. 1210, 93 L.Ed. 1659. cf. Lamb v. Smith, 3 Cir., 183 F.2d 938 and Davis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 161 F.2d 361. The question presented is simply one of fact and we cannot say that the Tax Court\u2019s holding on this point was clearly erroneous; indeed, if the question were presented to us <em>de novo, </em>we would arrive at the conclusion reached by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-22\">The decisions of the Tax Court are correct and will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
