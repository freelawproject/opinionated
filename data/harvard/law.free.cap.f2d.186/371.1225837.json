These are said to be (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that the employees shall he free to strike \u201cin the event that Safeway shall refuse to bargain collectively with respondents for the location managers employed by Safeway; (2) that such location managers \u201cshall be subject to and be entitled to the benefits of any collective bargaining agreement that may be entered into,\u201d and (3) that Safeway \u201cshall select all location managers * * * from the membership of Local 648.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">A rule to show cause was issued in response to which respondents filed numerous affidavits and a motion to modify the decree by striking from the paragraph quoted above the reference to supervisory employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The primary question now presented to us is whether the \u201clocation managers\u201d mentioned, are \u201csupervisory employees\u201d within the meaning of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The language above quoted from the Board\u2019s order, which was the language of this court\u2019s decree, was inserted in the order and the decree pursuant to a stipulation of the parties. There is therefore nothing to be found in the record to throw any light upon whether the so-called \u201clocation managers\u201d were intended to be within the prohibition of the Board\u2019s order referring to \u201csupervisory employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">While it might be possible for this court to make a finding of fact upon the basis of the showing which has been made here as to whether the location managers in question are in fact supervisory employees within the meaning of the Act, we think it inappropriate that such a determination should be made initially by this court upon a petition to adjudge in contempt. In our view this is a matter primarily for determination by the Board upon appropriate evidence to be taken by it. We think we should not be called upon to find the facts in this proceeding based, as it is, upon a stipulated decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Accordingly the matter is remanded to the Board to permit it, if it shall be so advised, to take testimony and to make appropriate findings as to whether the location managers should or should not be included within the prohibitory language quoted above. Should the Board undertake such further hearing and supplement its order in accordance with its findings, it will then be in a position to petition this court for a further decree of enforcement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
