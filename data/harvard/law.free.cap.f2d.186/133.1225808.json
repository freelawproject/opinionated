The establishment of loss in such year was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for recovery since the deduction therefor was claimed for the year 1941. The Commissioner had allowed the claim for the year 1940 but had disallowed it as accruing from a loss sustained during 1941. Upon consideration of the facts and circumstances in the case, we conclude that the finding of the trial Judge is supported by the evidence. Cf. Mine Hill &amp; Schuylkill Haven R. Co. v. Smith, 3 Cir., 184 F.2d 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">The judgment appealed from is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
