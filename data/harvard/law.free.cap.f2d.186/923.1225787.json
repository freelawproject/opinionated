Appellants attempted to allege a cause of action for unfair competition and a violation of a trademark. The complaint alleged in substance that appellants Chamberlain and Central Hanover Bank Company are the trustees of the estate of the late Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) ; that Mark Twain 'Company is a corporation organized by Samuel L. Clemens during his lifetime for the purpose of engaging in the business of exploiting and publishing the literary property written by him and for the purpose of development of the name \u201cMark Twain;\u201d Clara Clemens Samossoud is the sole heir of Samuel L. Clemens, deceased. It is alleged that appellants claim all rights possessed by Clemens at the time of his death in literary property, including the copyright to most of Clemens\u2019 works; that the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d was used by Clemens to designate himself as the author of his works; that the name acquired considerable popularity because of the excellent quality of the works to which it was attached; that appellants are deriving income from exploiting, publishing, selling and licensing \u201cMark Twain\u201d works. It is further alleged that the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d has been registered under the federal trade-mark law and under the trade-mark laws of the various states, and has been licensed by appellants for use in connection with literary products and for commercial purposes in connection with non-literary products. The complaint further alleges that appellee has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>been exhibiting throughout the United States a motion picture produced by defendant entitled \u201cBest Man Wins,\u201d and advertising this picture in such a way as to give the impression that Samuel L. 'Clemens wrote the story, in that appellee\u2019s advertisements say their picture is \u201cA Story only Mark Twain Could Tell,\u201d \u201cMark Twain\u2019s Favorite Story,\u201d \u201cMark Twain\u2019s Tale of a Gamble in Hearts,\u201d and other similar statements. It is alleged that Clemens never wrote a story entitled \u201cBest Man Wins,\u201d and that the motion picture bears only slight resemblance to the Mark Twain short story, \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.\u201d It is further alleged that the picture \u201cBest Man Wins\u201d is \u201can inferior motion picture photoplay,\u201d which \u201ctells a very common, ordinary and what is commonly characterized in the motion picture theatrical industry as a \u2018corny\u2019 love story.\u201d Further, it is alleged, that the quality of this picture, coupled with the representation that the story was written by Clemens, has depreciated the value of those literary works of Mark Twain which are protected by copyright and of the trade name \u201cMark Twain,\u201d in connection with its use in other commercial enterprises. (Since the \u201cJumping Frog\u201d is in the public domain there is no claim of copyright infringement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The prayer of the complaint is for an injunction against further misleading advertisements, an accounting of the gross receipts in connection with the motion picture, damages and other appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The District Court concluded that inasmuch as the story \u201cJumping Frog of Cala-veras County\u201d was in the public domain and that there is also, in the public domain, other historic material with the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d which belongs to everybody and since there exists no exclusive right to the use of the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d there was no unfair competition in what appellee did.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The cause of action attempted to be set forth in the amended complaint is not bottomed on a claim of exclusive use or validity of trade-mark. Prior to the Lanham Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., appellants\u2019 claim arising out of the allegedly valid registration of a trade-mark under the Federal Trade-Mark Law would have been significant in determining the jurisdiction of the federal court but would not have given rise to a separate \u201ccause of action.\u201d Cf. Hurn v. Oursler, 1933, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148. Various provisions of the Lanham Act now give protection under federal law regardless of the registration under federal law of the trade name concerned, provided the unfair competition takes place in interstate commerce. See, Stauffer v. Exley, 9 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 962. The merit of the attempted statement of a cause of action in the amended complaint, if any, must be found in its relation to the remedies conferred under \u00a7 1125, T. 15 U.S.C.A., that being the section appellants. are attempting to invoke. Said! section, as it applies here, provides that any person \u201cwho shall * * * use in connection with any goods or services * * * a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words * * * tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, * * * shall be liable to a civil action by any person * * * who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">We have hereinbefore detailed the allegations relative to the misrepresentations made upon which appellants rely. From those allegations appellants plead the conclusion that the story thus falsely described and represented was of such an inferior and \u201ccorny\u201d character as to bring all Mark Twain\u2019s stories into disrepute and thereby lessen the value of his literary products, and that inasmuch as appellants are engaged in marketing certain literary works of Mark Twain and in exploiting and licensing the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d, and have the exclusive right so to do, that the false representations and descriptions used by ap-pellee in advertising the inferior picture \u201cBest Man Wins\u201d will damage them. In arriving at a conclusion as to whether the amended complaint states a cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>we take as true all allegations well pleaded. We are not concerned with proof. At first blush it might be said that the allegations made fit snugly into the provisions of \u00a7 1125, T. 15 U.S.C.A. However, we do not think said section changes the fundamental requirements necessary to sustain a suit for unfair competition, one such requirement being a direct injury to the property rights of a complainant by passing off the particular goods or services misrepresented as those of complainant. Deceiving the public by fraudulent means, while an important factor in such a suit, does not give the right of action unless it results in the sale of the goods as those of the complainant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here the advertising in no manner intimated that the story on which the \u201cBest Man Wins\u201d was based was the property of appellants. They had no more right to the use of the story \u201cJumping Frog of Calaveras County\u201d than did appellee. There is no <em>passing off </em>other than alleged misrepresentation of the authorship of the story. Appellants do not have the right to the exclusive use of the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d. It is not alleged that appellee is selling the story as appellants\u2019 story; their complaint is that the association of the name \u201cMark Twain\u201d with a \u201ccorny\u201d production injures appellants\u2019 chances to sell other works of that eminent author by detracting from his fame as such. To our minds this is a nebulous, far-fetched conclusion. We could almost take judicial notice of the fact that the fame of \u201cMark Twain\u201d cannot be so easily marred. Of course we realize that a determination of the weight of evidence that might be produced is not our function here. We mention it merely to point up the weakness of the allegations made. We repeat, there is nothing in the advertisements that could lead anyone to believe that \u201cBest Man Wins\u201d is the goods or business of appellants or that appellants are in any manner connected with the picture or story. Appellants do not have a monopoly. They own only a portion of the extant works of Mark Twain. In order to entitle appellants to the relief sought it would be necessary for them to allege that they have an exclusive right to the use of the story in question and they must be injured directly by appellee\u2019s acts. Cf., Mosler Safe Co. v. Ely-Norris Safe Co., 273 U.S. 132, 47 S.Ct. 314, 71 L.Ed. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Here appellee is not attempting to appropriate values that are the property of appellants because the story \u201cJumping Frog of Calaveras 'County\u201d is not owned by appellants. It is not alleged that appellants acquired all rights and privileges as to the use of his stories then extant which Samuel L. Clemens may have had prior to his death and in fact it is doubtful such an allegation could be successfully made.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">It is argued that injunctive relief has been granted on the theory of dilution of the value of literary property. We do not so construe the authorities cited in support of that contention. We think those cases were based upon unfair competition wherein <em>passing off </em>was involved and wherein the plaintiffs had proven secondary meaning. We think the name Mark Twain is incapable of acquiring a secondary meaning in connection with literary property. The name Mark Twain, from a literary standpoint, indicates only the writings of Samuel L. Clemens, which is a primary meaning. Establishment of a secondary meaning is necessary in order to sustain an action for unfair competition where the goods are entirely non-competing and unrelated. Centering our sights upon the situation in this case as it is presented by the allegations of the amended complaint we find it distinguishable from the authorities upon which appellants rely in that appellants have no right to the exclusive use of the name Mark Twain; that the name has no secondary meaning and the sole rights inherited from Samuel L. Clemens were to certain copyrighted stories of which the story in question here was not included.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-5\">.
