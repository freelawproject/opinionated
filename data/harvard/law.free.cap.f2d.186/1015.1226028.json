The towboat had been and was to be used by the Packers in towing fishing boats and their fishermen from the Packers\u2019 stationary receiving station at Naknek on Kvichak, an inlet of Bristol Bay, Alaska, some twenty miles or more out to the fishing grounds in Bristol Bay and later, at the end of the fishing day, returning to tow the boats and fishermen and their catch back to the receiving station. However, the towboat was not engaged in any fish towage for the Packers at the time Peterson\u2019s injuries were sustained and it does not appear that the boat, owned by a California corporation, then was in the territorial waters of Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The obligations and correlative rights of the owner of a vessel to the members of her crew constitute one of the most important of the \u201ccharacteristic features of the general maritime law\u201d which the decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 529, 61 L.Ed. 1086, held must not. be modified by state legislation. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 175, [23 S.Ct. 483, 487, 47 L.Ed. 760] held that for such an injury as that sustained by Peterson, the ship and owner \u201care liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued.\u201d It further held that the vessel and owner are liable for damages to a sailor arising from the unseaworthiness of the vessel or her appliances. To this the Jones Act, 46.U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688, added the owner\u2019s liability to the seamen for negligently caused injuries. The present characteristic feature of the general maritime law is that the owner is obligated to his seamen in all these situations. To Peterson, who suffered from no negligence or unseaworthiness, the Packers are liable by maritime law for no more than his wages to the end of the fishing season and his maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">The added liability of the owner to this seaman under the Board\u2019s award includes' the sum of $3,450 for permanent total disability and at least doubles the ship\u2019s.operating cost in this respect. Per contra, had the seaman had a complete cure with no subsequent disabilities, he would have recovered as Alaska compensation but 65% of what the owner would have to pay him in wages under the maritime law. It is obvious that here is clear modification by state legislation of one of the paramount characteristic features of the general maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-14\">Peterson contends that the Jensen case is not applicable because (a) the maritime occupation of the vessel was not in interstate or foreign commerce and (b) the daily voyage is for a distance of. but 20 miles from Naknek. Both contentions are disposed of adversely by the Supreme Court in London Guarantee &amp; Accident Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, 279 U.S. 109, 123, 49 S.Ct. 296, 73 L.Ed. 632, where the seaman\u2019s voyage was on a vessel carrying sportsmen to a fishing ground between 3 and 5 miles off the City of Santa Monica, California, and his injury \u25a0 was held not within that state\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>The London Guarantee opinion distinguishes that case from its decisions in Sultan Railway &amp; Timber Co. v. Department of Labor, 277 U.S. 135, 48 S.Ct. 505, 72 L.Ed. 820; Millers\u2019 Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud, 270 U.S. 59, 46 S.Ct. 194, 70 L.Ed. 470, and Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, 257 U.S. 469, 42 S.Ct. 157, 66 L.Ed. 321, relied upon by appellants, on the ground that in none of those cases was the injured man exclusively engaged in the operation of a vessel in navigable waters. They are described as cases of an \u201camphibious nature.\u201d Our decision in Alaska Packers Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, 9 Cir., 95 F.2d 279, is similarly distinguishable. The employee there had an amphibious occupation, both on shore and at sea. Likewise in Davis v. Department of Labor, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246. There Davis was employed both in the land occupation of cutting steel from a bridge and recutting. it on a barge. His amphibious occupation brought him in the twilight zone of occupation which had nothing to do with the navigation of a vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">So also the recent decisions in Moores\u2019s Case, 323 Mass. 162, 80 N.E.2d 478, affirmed Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Moore 335 U.S. 874, 69 S.Ct. 239, 93 L.Ed. 417, where an iron worker and rigger was employed both on land and on a barge, and Baskin v. Industrial Accident Commission, 89 Cal.App.2d 632, 201 P.2d 549, reversed 338 U.S. 854, 70 S.Ct. 99, where the shipyard worker\u2019s duties were predominately on shore. In all these cases it is the amphibious character of the <em>employee\u2019s </em>duties which brought him within the \u25a0 \u201ctwilight zone\u201d of the Davis case, supra. None was based on the mere amphibious character of the <em>employer\u2019s </em>business or businesses. Peterson\u2019s employment solely as a deckhand on his vessel in navigable waters is in \u201cclear daylight\u201d not amphibious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Appellants argue that Peterson, solely occupied in navigation, with no shore duties, became a laborer in the processing of fish, because the navigation of his vessel involved the transport of fish to the cannery \u2014 that is to say, because the employer\u2019s business is amphibious. Such a holding by us would be applicable in the great pre-war lumber trade between Oregon ports and Shanghai, China. The deckhand on a steamer would be deemed a laborer in the business of selling lumber and subject to the Oregon compensation law because his employer bought his lumber and assembled it at an Oregon port and carried it in his own vessel, which the sailor assisted in navigating, to his employer\u2019s own yard in China and there sold the lumber so transported. Under the London Guarantee case, supra, such a trade is none the less analogous because of the greater distance of transport or that it is in foreign commerce. It is only in the amphibious cases that the factor of nearness of the occupation from shore is treated as pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">No case is cited holding or stating .that a sailor, engaged solely in, say, a deckhand\u2019s service in the navigation of the ship, becomes a different kind of employee because of the general character of the employer\u2019s business. So to hold would be to deem the Jensen case overruled in its entirety, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Standard Dredging Corp. v. Murphy, 319 U.S. 306, 309, 63 S.Ct. 1067, 87 L.Ed. 1416, that is continues to have some vitality as to state workmen\u2019s compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">. Laws of Alaska, Ex.Sess.1946, p. 49 et seq., 2 A.C.L.A. \u00a7 43-3-1 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">. The Jensen decision was a five-four decision, but there is language in Justice Holmes\u2019 dissent which is construable as recognizing the principles of the majority as sustained in a case of injuries to a seaman. It is significant that Justice Holmes did not dissent in the London Guarantee case, considered infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
