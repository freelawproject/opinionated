At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, and entered an order dismissing the case. The order of dismissal also directed the narcotic agents to return the defendant\u2019s automobile, which had been seized at the time of arrest for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">The Government has appealed from that portion of the order directing the return of the forfeited automobile, and the sole question here is whether the court had jurisdiction to remit the forfeiture. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Section 2 of the Contraband Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 782, authorizes the seizure and forfeiture pf an automobile used in the transportation of narcotics and other designated contraband. Section 4 of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 784, expressly makes applicable \"All provisions of law relating to the seizure * * * of * * * vehicles for violation of the custom laws\u201d including \u201cthe remission or mitigation of such forfeitures\u201d. And, the applicable provisions of the custom laws are also extended \u201cto forfeitures incurred or alleged to have been incurred under the internal revenue laws.\u201d See 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3726. The only exception to the application of the custom laws to forfeitures incurred under the revenue laws is in cases arising under the Liquor Enforcement Act. In 1935 Congress divested the Secretary of the power to remit or mitigate forfeitures in liquor cases and placed it exclusively in the District Courts. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646, now \u00a7 3617, 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">As we said in United States v. One 1941 Plymouth Tudor Sedan, 10 Cir., 153 F.2d 19, the Federal district court has exclusive jurisdiction to remit forfeitures for violation of the revenue laws relating to liquor violations and power to remit all other forfeitures for violation of revenue laws is vested exclusively in the Secretary of the Treasury. See also United States v. Heckinger, 2 Cir., 163 F.2d 472; United States v. Gramling, 5 Cir., 180 F.2d 498; United States v. Andrade, 9 Cir., 181 F.2d 42; United States v. One 1946 Plymouth Sedan, D.C., 73 F.Supp. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">Appellee\u2019s only remedy is to petition the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 1618 of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C.A. (the applicable custom law), which expressly authorizes the Secretary to grant remission or mitigation \u201cif he finds such * * * forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention * * to violate the law, or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify the remission or mitigation * *</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">The judgment is reversed with directions to vacate that part of the order granting the remission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
