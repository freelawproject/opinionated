It will be sufficient to hold, as we do, that, upon the issue of liability, the evidence as to the position of the cars after the collision, as to the skid marks on the pavement, and of eye witnesses who saw the trucks shortly before the collision, was ample to take the case to the jury, ample to support the finding that defendant was negligent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">Upon the other issue, whether the evidence sustained the finding that Gunn was in the course of his employment, we think it ample to show that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">The principle relied on by appellant that an employer is not liable for injuries caused by his car when the employee is driving it without the consent, or contrary to the orders, of the employer, is good enough law, as is the principle that when an employee is authorized to use a car for a specific purpose and he deviates from that purpose,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the employer is not liable. These principles are, however, without application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">Here there was no deviation, from a specified route, duty, or mission, on a frolic of the driver\u2019s own. There was no taking the car out contrary to orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gunn had express orders to use the car on a mission and then drive it to his home, and it would be drawing too fine a bead to hold that because he might, if he had been in a greater hurry, have 'been able to finish his mission a little earlier, he had violated the instructions for not driving after eight o\u2019clock or had temporarily left his master\u2019s employment. It would likewise be so to say that, because it was generally understood that he was not to drive the car after eight o\u2019clock, the moment the clock struck eight, as was the case with Cinderella, he would in law be considered as having the car snatched from him, leaving him on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-18\">This is not a case where, turning aside, he drove the car over a route and on other business than that directed by the employer. This is, at best for defendant, only a case of an employee, directed to perform a mission or do a job, not doing it precisely as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the employer ordered and yet if he was negligent, the employer is liable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">There was ample basis for the jury\u2019s answers to special issues Nos. 1 and 2, none for the granting of the directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">No error appearing, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Asi\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">.
