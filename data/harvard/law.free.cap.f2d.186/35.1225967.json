They were careful to see that they take care of their own men * * *. Was this Defendant careless or was it cautious? I submit the record shows that it was careful and it was cautious from the very beginning when we made this contract. It even went to the place of not only protecting their own men with Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance but it also went * * *. * * * How could a contractor be more careful, gentlemen, I ask you under this evidence * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ADFe\">.
