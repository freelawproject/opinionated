The line between questions of fact and of law is frequently narrow but in the instant case the acts done by the appellee to reduce the appellant\u2019s damages were sufficient and were clearly demonstrated by the evidence. The trial judge committed no error in sending the case to the jury. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
