It applied in September 1947 to the United States Patent Office for entry of the words \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d upon the principal register under the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., hereinafter more particularly described, as a trade-mark for live cattle. The firm alleged use of the mark in commerce beginning in September 1940 and stated that it was \u201capplied to the crates in which the cattle are shipped by means of labels or tags on which the mark is shown.\u201d The specimen submitted to show actual use is a photograph of a crate, sufficiently large to enclose a cow or steer, to which is affixed a placard, \u201cLyndale Farm, Floydada, Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-24\">The Examiner of Trade-Marks refused registration of the words \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d on the ground that they are merely a trade name and lack the essential characteristics of a trade-mark. The firm promptly appealed to the Commissioner of Patents alleging that \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d functions both as a trade name and a trade-mark. The Examiner\u2019s Statement, prepared by the Head of Trade-Mark Operations in the Patent Office, in response to the appeal, based the refusal to register on two grounds; viz., that the mark is primarily geographically descriptive, and that it is used merely as a trade name. The, first ground was held to be ruled by In re Lamson &amp; Co., 135 F.2d 1021, 30 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1030. The second ground was premised upon the manner of use, the mark appearing to the examiner to be used on the crate as a shipping tag, merely \u201cinforming the outside world of the location and name of the farm from which the cattle originates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The Assistant Commissioner of Patents in a well reasoned opinion, 80 U.S.P.Q. 4'5, agreed with appellant that the Lanham Act does not forbid registration of a trademark otherwise eligible merely because it is also a firm or trade name in whole or part, but observed that if such words are to qualify for registration it is necessary that their use be such as to identify the goods rather than the manufacturer or his location. The Assistant Commissioner thought that the cattle crate placard served merely to inform \u201cthe outside world of the location and name of the farm,\u201d and Tield that as so used the mark sought to be registered functioned not as a trademark but as a trade name and could not \"be entered on the principal register. He also concluded that the mark is unregis-tera'ble because primarily geographically descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Lyndale Farm by its counsel has appealed \u2022to this court from the decision of the Assistant Commissioner, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1071; R.S. \u00a7 4911, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 59a, 28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1542. There thus comes before us the \u25a0first appeal arising on an application for \u2022registration filed in the Patent Office subsequent to the effective date of the Lan-Tiam Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a5a-dedup-0\">On behalf of the appellant it is asserted \u2022that \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d functions in a dual capacity, as both a trade-mark and a trade, name. Appearing on the placard placed on the side of the shipping crate, \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d is said by appellant to \u201cserve \u2018to identify his goods and distinguish them from those \u2014 sold by others,\u2019 \u201d satisfying thereby the definition contained in Sec. 45 \u25a0of the Lanham Act: \u201cThe term \u2018trademark\u2019 includes any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured \u2022or sold by others.\u201d The words \u201cFloydada, Texas\u201d also appearing on the placard, appellant thinks, do not detract from the trade-mark significance of \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d but merely designate the location of the mark\u2019s owner. Thus it is, appellant states, that \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d identifies its user\u2019s goods as well as indicating its business name, and functions in the dual capacity of trade-mark and trade name.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">On behalf of the Commissioner of Patents it is urged here that the use of \u201cLyn-dale Farm\u201d with \u201cFloydada, Texas\u201d is the commercial use of a business name, and is not a trade-mark use, though counsel does not dispute that under some circumstances a name may be used both as a trade-mark and a trade name. It is advanced, however, that in this case the words \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d do not identify a brand of cattle but merely serve as a shipping tag to state the location of the business whence the cattle originate.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">Sections 1 and 2 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.CA. \u00a7\u00a7 1051 and 1052, specify that it is \u201ctrade-marks\u201d which are registrable on the principal register, while Sections 3 and 4, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1053 and 1054, permit the registration of service marks, collective marks, and certification marks in the same manner and effect as trademarks and with entitlement to the - same protection as the Act accords trade-marks, though the Commissioner is authorized to establish a separate register for such marks. Section 7(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1057(b), accords to the certificate of registration of marks registered on the principal register <em>prima, facie </em>evidence of valid registration, ownership in the registrant, and his exclusive right to use the mark in commerce on specified goods or services. Section 15, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1065, adds the important feature of incontestability of right to use a mark which has been in continuous use for five consecutive years following the date of registration, subject to four provisos, the fourth of which states that \u201cno incontestable right</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>shall be acquired in a mark <em>or trade name </em>which is the common descriptive name of any article * * (Emphasis supplied.) Since incontestability is only conferred upon marks registered on the principal register, the mention of \u201ctrade name\u201d in the above proviso may be thought to supply an inference that trade names are registrable as such on the principal register.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 23 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1091, provides for a supplemental register upon which marks and names capable of distinguishing an applicant\u2019s goods or services and not registrable on the principal register may be registered. Such marks by Section 26, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1094, are not eligible for many of the procedural and substantive benefits conferred by the Act upon marks registered on the principal register. Section 32(1) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114(1), provides for a civil action by. the registrant against one who infringes a registered mark, and Section 33(a), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1115(a), makes the certificate of registration of any mark registered on the principal register <em>prima facie </em>evidence in such an action of the registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use the mark in commerce on the specified goods or services, and <em>conclusive </em>evidence of that right if the mark has become incontestable under Section 15 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1065. The conclusive evidentiary nature of the certificate of an incontestable mark is, however, subject to seven special defenses. Section 39, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1121, confers jurisdiction upon the federal courts of all actions arising under the Act regardless of the amount in controversy or the presence or lack of diversity of citizenship of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Section 44(b) of the Act, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1126(b) entitles persons who are nationals, domiciliaries, or doing business</p>\n<p id=\"acl-dedup-1\">in any foreign country a party to conventions or treaties relating to trade-marks, trade names, or unfair competition to which the United States is a party, to the benefits of the Lanham Act so far -as required to give effect to the conventions or treaties. Section 44(c, d, e, and f), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(c, d, e, and f), provide for the registration by persons identified by Section 44(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(b) of their marks on the principal and supplemental registers. Section 44(g), 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1126(g) relates to <em>trade names </em>owned by such persons and states that they \u201cshall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration whether or not they form parts of marks.\u201d Section 44(h), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(h) makes available to such persons the remedies specified in the Act for infringement of marks in protecting those persons against unfair competition. Section 44(i), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u25a0 1126(i) confers upon United States citizens or residents the same benefits granted' the persons identified by Section 44(b), IS U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(b). Thus it is that a federal cause of -action exists in behalf of a United States citizen or resident whose.<em>trade name </em>is unfairly used in a manner-affecting commerce whereby the remedies, of the Lanham Act provided for the infringement of registered marks are made available in repressing such acts of unfair-competition affecting unregistered trade-names.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ajs-dedup-1\">Trade-marks and trade names are-distinct legal concepts within the ambit of' the law of unfair competition. A trademark is fanciful and distinctive, arbitrary- and unique.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A trade name may be descriptive, generic, geographic, common in., a trade sense, personal, firm, or corporate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A trade-mark\u2019s function is to identify and distinguish a product, whereas a_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>trade name\u2019s function is to identify and distinguish a business.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prior to the Lanham Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the general requirement was that a trade-mark be affixed to the goods it was to identify and distinguish,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while it was unnecessary to attach a trade name to merchandise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>- Trade-marks have traditionally been protected by actions for trade-mark infringement; trade names, by actions to restrain passing-off or unfair -competition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The distinction between trade-marks and trade names has been so well and so long established that we would not attribute to Congress the intention to -dissolve the distinction merely on the strength of the possible inference contained in the fourth proviso of Section 15 of the Act. An inference is not a sufficient basis for any conclusion that Congress intended to merge well established and distinct common law concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Section 44(i) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(i), read in connection with Section 44(g), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(g) and Section 44(b), 1'5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1126(b) confers upon trade names increased protection from acts of unfair competition. The important section 2(f), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(f) would permit <em>inter alia </em>a trade name -which has become distinctive of applicant\u2019s <em>goods </em>in commerce to be registered on the principal register upon a showing of adequate proof of distinctiveness. The instant application was not filed under the provisions of Section 2(f). Beyond Sections 44(i), (g), (b), and 2(f), we doubt that Congress intended by the Lanham Act to confer any new status upon trade names.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Certain it is that there is no provision in the Act permitting registration on the principal register of trade names as such.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\"> We turn then to a consideration of whether \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d as used by the appellant is trade-mark use. Appellant relies upon the affixation of the placard \u201cLyndale Farm, Floydada, Texas\u201d upon the cattle shipping crate to satisfy the Section 45 requirement relating to use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>a mark in commerce, \u201cplaced in any manner on the goods or their containers * * * or on the tags or labels affixed thereto\u201d, and the Section 45 definition of a trade-marlc, \u201cname * * * used by a * * * merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others.\u201d To come within the purview of the Lanham Act, a mark must not only be used as a trade-mark, but it also must be used as a trade-mark in commerce. The two definitions in Section 45 just cited do not establish a rule that affixation of a name to any container in which goods are or may be placed at any stage of the transportation or marketing process is trade-mark usage in commerce. Before \u201cuse in commerce\u201d is considered, \u201ctrade-mark usage\u201d must be established. Where affixation to goods, as distinguished from use on displays associated with the goods, is relied upon to establish trademark use, the affixation required is not satisfied by affixation to a container whose nature in relation to the goods transported is such that its use in the marketing process is ended when the transportation phase itself is at an end. This holding is not contra to our decision in Barron-Gray Packing Co. v. Bruce\u2019s Juices, Inc., 162 F.2d 217, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1106, where it was held that a mark affixed to the cartons in which small cans of fruit juice were packed was a sufficient affixation to the goods sought to be identified by the mark where the juices were sold to wholesale and retail distributors by the carton, and it was a matter of common knowledge that such goods are purchased by the case or carton. Cattle are not, to our knowledge, marketed in crates, nor does it affirmatively appear from the record that the name \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d would come to the attention of wholesale or retail purchasers as identifying the cattle being purchased. As the Restatement of the Law of Torts puts it in Comment <em>b </em>to Section 718: \u201cThe designation is not affixed however, under the rule stated in this Section,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> if it is attached only to the container, case or wrapper in which the goods are placed for purposes of transportation or storage only.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s application and exhibit clearly describe and depict only the use of \u201cLyndale Farm\u201d on a case or container in which the cattle are placed for purposes of transportation. Furthermore, the inference is created by the addition of the address \u201cFloydada, Texas\u201d to the placard that the use here involved does not so much distinguish appellant\u2019s cattle as it identifies appellant as the source of the shipment while the crate and its contents are in transit. That is trade name usage as distinguished from trade-mark usage. We think the denial of registration of \u201cLyn-dale Farm\u201d on the principal registe- because of failure to show trade-mark usage is, on the record before us, well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">We do not pass upon the denial of registration on the additional ground that \u201cLyn-dale Farm\u201d is primarily geographically descriptive, as it is unnecessary to the disposition of the case. Such action, it is to be observed, should not be construed as approval or disapproval of the rejection below on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">We find no error in the refusal to register appellant\u2019s mark on the principal register on the ground herein discussed in full. The decision appealed from is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">.
