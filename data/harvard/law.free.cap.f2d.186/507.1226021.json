The appellants\u2019 contention is based on an artificial and forced \u00a1construction of Section 47, sub. a(12) and (13) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 75, sub. a(12) and (13), and Rule B-7(B.) of the. Rules of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-29\">Notice of the application for fees was given to all creditors of record and the amount granted by the court was by no means excessive in view of the labor done and the result accomplished by the trustee\u2019s attorney. Consequently, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
