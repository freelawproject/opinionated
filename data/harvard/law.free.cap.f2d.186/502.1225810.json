The order is based upon substantial evidence and is entirely proper since it forbids only violations of section 8(a)(1) of the Act. Respondent complains because not granted a continuance of the hearing before the Trial Examiner because of engagements on the part of its officers; but this was a matter resting with the sound discretion of the Trial Examiner and the Board and it does not appear that there has been any abuse of the discretion. The order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
