The Commissioner had determined that the property involved, namely, a number of houses constructed by the petitioners, were held by the latter primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course o.f trade or business within the meaning of \u00a7 117(j) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(j) (1), hence the profit from the sale is taxable \u2022as ordinary income. Petitioners\u2019 argument is that the property was held primarily for rental purposes, and that the gains from the sales should be treated as long-term capital gains. The Tax Court made findings resolving the dispute in favor of the Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">The issue is essentially one of fact. We see no clear error in the Court\u2019s finding, and its judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
