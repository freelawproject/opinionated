Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b373-11\">Appellant and one Claude Phillips were jointly indicted for the theft of two head of cattle, the property of John Solomon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-12\">Appellant requested a severance on the trial, which having been, granted, he was alone placed on trial, and the trial resulted in his conviction, with the punishment assessed.at two years in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-13\">John Solomon testified, in substance: That he missed the cattle from his \"pasture in Cooke County about the 9th of March. A few weeks after-wards he found them in Montague County in possession of a party who was driving them to the Indian Territory. That this party had bought the cattle from John O\u2019Brien, and that when he, witness, had proved his title, this party gave him an order upon O\u2019Brien for the value of the cattle, which order O\u2019Brien paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-15\">O\u2019Brien corroborated the testimony of Solomon, and testified that he had purchased the animals from Charley Paul.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-16\">Charley Paul testified: That he bought the animals from defendant, and gave him a six-shooter and $6 in money for them. Other evidence showed that defendant was arrested in La Salle County, Texas, about 400 miles from Cooke County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Defendant, in his own behalf, testified, after being duly sworn: On or about the 1st day of March, 1893, John Childers, Claude Phillips, and myself were leaving the town of Muenster, Cooke County, Texas, and when about one-half mile east of Muenster we met-a German driving two head of cattle, and I proposed to buy them from him. He offered to take 812 for them. I borrowed the money from Claude Phillips, and paid him for them. One of them was a 2-year-old red steer; the other a blue roan steer yearling. I drove the cattle that night to the <em>\u201c </em>Luella \u201d pasture, where they stayed until the next morning, when I drove them to Lote Swage to sell them to him. He was not at home. I traded the cattle to Charley Paul for a pistol and 86.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">Cross-examined: Yes, I left Cooke County right soon after this trade. I went to Hunt County, Texas, and stayed awhile there. I went to Webb County, Texas, to my cousin William Mathews. Yes, I got several letters from Cooke County while I was in Hunt County. I got letters from my mother and sister. Yes, I got letters from Charley Paul. My letters were not directed to John Mathews, but they were directed to Jim Elliott, who was a half-brother of mine. Yes, I got some letters while in Webb County; they were directed to my cousin, William Mathews, and some of them were directed to me. The reason I left Cooke County was to go to work for my cousin in Webb County, to pay him an old debt I owed him. Yes, I went through Hunt County to go to Webb County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">Redirect examination: The reason I had my letters addressed to Jim Elliott, in Hunt County, was, there was another John Mathews there, and I did not expect to stay long, and he could get them and send them to me. Jim Elliott is a half-brother of mine. I was arrested in Webb County, about thirty miles from Cotulla, La Salle County, where George Rosseau came for me. A deputy sheriff and a ranger arrested me; after they did so, they sent me into a pasture to get my horse. I went alone; could have gotten away if I had wanted to. In going to Cotulla, the officers and I stopped at a dance, and at Cotulla the officers let me go where I pleased, and I went to the depot and met the officer, George Rosseau, from Cooke County. A man of the name of H. Ma.y came to me with a horse, and told me to get on him and leave. I told him that I had done nothing to run from, and I did not want to escape.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">John Childers, being sworn, testified, for the defendant: I was present when defendant bought two cattle from a man; I think he was a German; that was about half a mile east of Muenster, in Cooke County. They were a 2-year-old red steer, the other a blue roan yearling. The defendant paid $12 for them; he got the money from Claude Phillips.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">Cross-examined: I have known defendant a good many years. We were never in the cattle business together. Yes, he has helped me to drive some, a few times. I don\u2019t know where defendant carried the cat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tie after buying them. I left him there, and went back to Muenster to get some more whisky. No, I never saw that man before nor since that defendant got cattle from. Don\u2019t know who he was.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-5\"><em>A. M. Green </em>and <em>G. II.

Without a bill of exceptions reserved, the action of the court refusing a continuance will not be revised on appeal. Willson\u2019s Crim, Proc., sec. 2187.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">2. Error is assigned because of the supposed failure of the court to instruct the jury in regard to defendant\u2019s explanation of his possession of the alleged stolen cattle. Upon this phase of the case the court charged the jury as follows, to-wit: \u201cIf you find that defendant bought the two head of cattle he is charged with stealing, or if you have a reasonable doubt as to his having bought said cattle, you will acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The defendant accounts for Ms possession of the cattle through purchase from a German. The charge pertinently and correctly submits this explanation to the jury. He gave no other explanation of Ms possession. The charge as given is the law applicable to that phase of the case. Williams v. The State, 29 Texas Cr. App., 167; Conners v. The State, 31 Texas Cr. Rep., 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">3. Defendant\u2019s objection to the alleged improper remarks of the county attorney were promptly sustained by the court, and the attorney admonished to keep within the record. The defendant did not request instructions to the jury directing them to disregard said remarks. Young v. The State, 19 Texas Cr. App., 536; Kennedy v. The State, 19 Texas Cr. App., 618; Willson\u2019s Crim. Proc., sec. 2321.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">No injury is shown. Defendant received the lowest term of punishment. We find no error in the record requiring a reversal, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
