Criminal District Court of Harris County\u2014Jurisdiction.\u2014The Criminal District Court of Harris County has, under the Constitution (article 5, section 19, and articles 1496 and 1497, Revised Statutes), \u201c original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases of which the District and County Courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction under the law,\u201d and \u201c exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all criminal cases tried and determined by justices of the peace, mayors, and recorders.\u201d In short, its jurisdiction is either \u201c original and exclusive,\u201d or it is \u201c appellate;\u201d and where it has \u201c original and exclusive,\u201d it can not exercise appellate jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b400-12\">2. Same\u2014Disorderly House.\u2014Under provisions of article 341, Penal Code, as amended by the Act of 1889, page 33, the offense of keeping a disorderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>house is a misdemeanor cognizable by justices of the peace, and in such cases the Criminal District Court of Harris County could only exercise \u201c appellate\" jurisdiction, and that court has no \u201c original and exclusive jurisdiction\"\u2019 of such cases.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b401-5\">Appeal from' the Criminal District Court of Harris.

This plea was overruled, and upon the trial defendant was convicted, with his punishment assessed at a fine of $200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-8\">No statement is necessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-9\"><em>Henry F. Fisher, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqY2\">On the proposition that the court had no jurisdiction, see Revised Statutes of Texas, articles 1496 and 1497. The former article gives said court \u201c original \u201d jurisdiction only in such cases of which District and County Courts, under the general laws, have \u201c original and exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d The latter article gives said court \u201c appellate \u201d jurisdiction in criminal cases tried and determined in Justice\u2019s, Mayor\u2019s, etc., Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\">Article 76, Code of Criminal Procedure (citing the Constitution), gives-the Justice Court original concurrent jurisdiction with other courts where the punishment is by fine only, and where the maximum of said fine does not exceed $200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-11\">Article 341 of the Penal Code, as amended by the laws of 1889, page 33, affixes a fine of $200 for keeping a disorderly house (such disorderly house as is contemplated under the indictment in the case at bar).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-12\">Article 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for transfer of causes improperly originated in the District Courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-13\">Counsel for appellant submits, it is manifest from article 1496, Revised Statutes, that the court below could exercise \u201c original\u201d jurisdiction in such cases \u201c only\u201d of which the District and County Courts, under the general laws, had original and \u201c exclusive\u201d jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-14\">The penalty for keeping a disorderly house, such as is charged by the indictment, is $200. Laws of 1889, p. 33. Under article 76, Code of Criminal Procedure, the justice of the peace has concurrent original jurisdiction, because the maximum fine does not exceed $200. Now, if the justice of the peace had \u201c concurrent\u201d jurisdiction, then the District and County Courts, under the general laws, did not have \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction; and if the District and County Courts did not have exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>jurisdiction (and this they did not, because justice jurisdiction was concurrent), then the Criminal District Court of Harris County had no original jurisdiction. The proposition is too clear to require further discussion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-5\"><em>R. L. </em>Henry, Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b402-6\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A9r\">Appellant was indicted in the Criminal District Court of Harris County for keeping a disorderly house, in violation of article 341 of the Penal Code, as amended by the Act of 1889, page 33. The punishment for this offense is $200, and is therefore cognizable by the Justice Courts of this State. Const., art. 5, sec. 19. It is contended, that the jurisdiction of said court in this case could only be appellate, and not original, as was exercised. If this proposition is correct, this conviction is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">With reference to its jurisdiction, the Constitution, article 5, section 1, provides, that \u201c the Criminal District Court of Galveston and Harris counties shall continue, with the district, jurisdiction, and organization now existing by law, until otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">This jurisdiction is found, as it appertains to the question here involved, in articles 1496 and 1497 of the Revised Statutes. Article 1496 provides, that \u201cThe Criminal District Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases of felony and misdemeanors in the counties of Galveston and Harris, of which the District and County Courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Article 1497 provides, that \u201cThe said court shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all criminal cases tried and determined by justices of the peace, mayors, and recorders in said counties of Galveston and Harris, under the same rules and regulations provided by law for appeals from justices of the peace, mayors, and recorders to the County Court in criminal cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">In misdemeanors the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court, under existing law, is either \u201coriginal and <em>exclusive,\u201d </em>or it is <em>\u201cappellate.\u201d </em>In cases where it has \u201c original and <em>exclusive \u201d </em>jurisdiction, it can not exercise \u201c appellate\u201d jurisdiction. Its appellate jurisdiction is exercised over cases appealed from the Justice Courts; hence its \u201c original and <em>exclusive \u201d </em>jurisdiction can not apply to that class of cases. The Legislature has not sought to exclude such \u201coriginal and exclusive\u201d jurisdiction to cases over which the Justice Courts have power to try and determine; nor, indeed, could it do so under the provisions of the Constitution. Ginnochio v. The State, 30 Texas Cr. App., 584. The Legislature has not sought to confer power concurrent with the Justice Courts upon the Criminal Court to try and determine cases of this character, and until that has been done, such jurisdiction can not be exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The Criminal District Court was without authority to render the judgment in this cause, wherefore it is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
