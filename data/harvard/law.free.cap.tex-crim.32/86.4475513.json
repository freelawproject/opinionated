The sole question raised in the case is, whether the State can prove the crime of incest by evidence of more than one act. This is not an open question. It is well settled, that in prosecutions for adultery, or for illicit intercourse of any class, evidence is admissible of sexual acts between the same parties prior to, or, when indicating continuousness of illicit relations, even subsequent to, the act specifically under trial. Whart. Crim. Ev., sec. 35. The testimony tends strongly to establish illicit relations, long continued, between the parties, and, if true, there can be no question of appellant\u2019s guilt. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
