Tried below before Hon. S. W. Blount, Special Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">The indictment in this case charged appellant and one Sam Swan and one W. E. T. Ogletree jointly with breaking into the county jail of Sabine County, on the 25th of March, 1885, with intent and for the purpose of effecting the rescue and escape of Fred Connor, William Con-nor, Willis Connor, and John Connor, who were confined therein on a charge of murder, and of which the said Fred Connor had already been tried and convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-11\">Appellant was alone placed upon trial, and the trial resulted in his conviction, the punishment being assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-12\">A motion was made to quash the indictment for insufficiency of allegation (amongst other things), in that it failed to aver that the parties \u201c acted together,\u201d and failed to allege that they did by \u201cforce\u201d break into said jail.

Ogletree were jointly indicted for breaking into the county jail of Sabine County, for the purpose of liberating several prisoners therein confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Appellant was tried and convicted; hence this appeal. Motion to quash the indictment was made, because it did not allege that appellant and his codefendants \u201c acted together <em>\u201d in the </em>commission of the said <em>offense; and </em>further, that it omitted to charge the breaking to have been done \u201c willfully\u201d and by \u201c force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The terms \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cforce\u201d do not occur in the statute defining this offense. Penal Code, art. 212. It was not necessary to insert either term in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Indictments charging two or more persons with the same offense are sufficient, in that respect, without averring they \u201cacted together.\u201d Such allegation, when made, is surplusage. Watson v. The State, 28 Texas Cr. App., 34; Finney v. The State, 29 Texas Cr. App., 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The plea of defendant setting up the disqualification of the special judge is not supported by testimony nor shown to be true, wherefore the court did not err in overruling it. The record contains neither a statement of facts nor a bill of exceptions. We find no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
