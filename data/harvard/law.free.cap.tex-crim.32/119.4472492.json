Constitutional Law \u2014 Legislation at Special Session \u2014 Governor\u2019s Proclamation as to Matters to be Considered. \u2014 It is provided by article 4, section 8, of the State Constitution, that when the Governor convenes the Legislature on extraordinary occasions, \u201chis proclamation therefor shall state specifically the purpose for which the Legislature is convened;\u201d and by section 40 of article 3 it is also provided, that \u201cwhen the Legislature shall be convened in special session there shall be no legislation upon subjects other than those designated in the proclamation of the Governor calling such session, or presented to them by the Governor,\u201d etc. <em>Meld, </em>it was not the intention of these provisions to require the Governor to define, in his proclamation, with precision as to detail, the subjects of legislation, but only in a general way by his call to confine the business to the particular subjects indicated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b137-10\">2. Same \u2014 Reapportionment of Judicial Districts.\u2014Where, among other subjects, the proclamation of the Governor calling a special session convened the Legislature \u201cto reapportion the State into judicial districts,\u201d <em>held, </em>that the judicial districts mentioned in the proclamation were those presided over by the district judges; that the authority to reapportion or reorganize the judicial districts of the entire State necessarily carried with it the power to reapportion any given number of such districts, and that it was for the Legislature, and not the Governor, to determine what the legislation should be, with regard to such reapportionment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>3. Caption of Legislative Act Creating a Judicial District.\u2014The caption of an act creating a judicial district is not violative of section 35 of article 3 of the Constitution, providing, that \u201c no bill * * * shall contain more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title,\u201d because it omits to state the different counties constituting the newly created district, nor that one or more of the counties composing such district was or were transferred from some adjoining district.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-6\">4. Challenge to Array of Grand Jury.\u2014In order for a party confined in jail to avail himself of the right to challenge the array of the grand jury, as provided by article 377, Code of Criminal Procedure, it is necessary that he should make a request to be brought from jail for that purpose.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-7\">5. Continuance.\u2014Where the murder was committed in October, and defendant filed his application for continuance in January, in order that the blood found upon his clothing might be analyzed, <em>held, </em>there was a total want of diligence, and that the continuance was properly refused. <em>Held, </em>further, that such analysis could not have been material where the defendant's proposition was to show thereby that the blood stains came from a squirrel he had dressed on the morning of the homicide, while the evidence, both for the State and the defendant, showed that he did not dress the squirrel.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-8\">6.

Evidence\u2014Silence of Party when Accused of Crime\u2014It was not error to permit the State to prove that the husband of deceased said to defendant, when they met at the body of the murdered woman, \u201cAleck, you have killed my wife,\u201d and that defendant made no reply, but walked off.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-10\">8.

Tried below before Hon. Lafayette Kirk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-15\">Appellant was indicted for the murder of Jane Wilkins, by striking and cutting her with an axe. At his trial he was found guilty of murder in the first degree, and his punishment assessed at death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-16\">Defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, in which he attacked the constitutionality of the Act of the called session of the Twenty-second Legislature, organizing and establishing the Twenty-first Judicial District of the State of Texas, and transferring the county of Bastrop from the Twenty-second Judicial District, to which it belonged, and making it a part of the said Twenty-first Judicial District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-17\">The constitutional objections were: first, that the act does not express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>in its title the real purpose thereof, or the real subject matter contained therein; second, that the proclamation of the Governor calling the special session of the Twenty-second Legislature, which passed said act, did not present to said Legislature the matter contained in said act as subject for legislation; third, that said act being void, no legal term of court could be held at the time said case was called for trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">This plea to the jurisdiction was overruled. The same matter was again presented on motion to quash the indictment in the case; and another ground set up in said motion to quash was, \u201c because the defendant was not allowed an opportunity to challenge the array or any member of the grand jury that returned the indictment against him, he being, at the time said grand jury was empanelled, confined in the county jail, and not being present in person or represented by counsel, and not knowing' that the said grand jury was being empanelled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">This motion to quash having been overruled, appellant filed a motion for a continuance, that an opportunity might be afforded him of having certain blood spots, which were found upon his clothing and introduced in evidence by the State, subjected to chemical analysis and microscopic examination, in order that it might be ascertained whether the blood found was that of a human being or of some other animal; his application alleging that the blood was from a squirrel which he had dressed the day of and before the homicide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">The evidence adduced in the case is as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-8\">J. F. Nash, witness for the State, being duly sworn, testified as follows: I hold the position of marshal of the town of Bastrop. I heard of the killing of Jane Wilkins, who was Oliver Wilkins\u2019 wife, on the night of October 15, 1892. It occurred in the town and county of Bastrop, in the State of Texas. It was sometime about 10o\u2019clock when I heard of it. When I got there I found the body lying in the yard, between the two doors on the south side of the house. It was lying on the face, with the hands under it. There were two deep gashes in the head, and one in the shoulder. There was an axe lying beside the body, and covered with blood. There was blood on the ground around the body, and blood on the wall of the house near the body, as high as five feet from the ground. There was also a bloody axe lying on the ground, near the body. Ben Holiday lives in the southwest corner of the block on which the Wilkins house is situated. Darcas Gage lives on the northeast corner, and the Wilkins house is on the northwest corner. Ann Morrison and her husband, Frank Morrison, live across the street from Oliver Wilkins\u2014 directly north. I think the street is about 15 feet wide, and Morrison\u2019s house is some 10 feet from the street. Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house faces south. It is about 60 or 70 yards from deceased\u2019s house to Ben Holiday\u2019s. It is about 75 to 100 yards to John Kerr\u2019s from Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>was some blood on a top plank of Wilkins\u2019 yard fence, south of the gate, made by finger prints. The finger prints, in blood, were about two inches below the top edge of the plank, and the plank was broken. Aleck Brown, the defendant, was arrested sometime in the summer before the killing occurred, for disturbing the peace, and he pleaded guilty, and paid part of his fine, and worked the rest out on the street. He was charged with disturbing the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">Cross-examined: Oliver Wilkins, the husband of Jane Wilkins, the deceased, made the complaint against Aleck Brown, for disturbing the peace. The body of Jane Wilkins was found on the south side of the house, a few feet from the door of the main room, nearest the door of the east room. This east room is an old room, not used much. There was nothing in it. The feet were directly under the eaves of the house. The head was directly south, as though she had been standing with her back to the wall. I don\u2019t think it was over five minutes after I heard of the killing until I got there. There were a good many there when I got there. Aleck Brown, John Kerr, Ben Holiday, and Aunt Barcas Gage were there when I got there. Aleck Brown went after Oliver Wilkins, the husband of the deceased. I think he went after him of his own accord. When Oliver got there I noticed him, and he seemed very much excited. He went and got his gun and went out in the garden. Aleck Brown lives 200 yards or more from Wilkins\u2019 house, a little west of south of Wilkins\u2019 house. The blocks are divided into squares of three acres tracts. Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house, where deceased was killed, is in the northwest corner of one three acres block, and Barcas Gage\u2019s house is near the southeast corner of the same block, and about 45 yards distant. Frank Morrison\u2019s house, where Ann Morrison lives, is on the block immediately north of Oliver Wilkins\u2019, and Ben Holiday\u2019s house is on the same block the Wilkins house is on, and in the same southwest corner. Bally Nunn\u2019s house is on the same block with Frank Morrison\u2019s house, and in the northeast corner of same. Kerr\u2019s house is a little south of east from Wilkins\u2019 house, and between 75 and 100 yards distant. Aleck Brown\u2019s house is a little west of south from Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house, and about 200 yards distant. In going the most direct route from Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house to defendant\u2019s, you would pass by the Ben Holiday house. In going from the Ben Holiday house to the Taylor house, in the most direct route, you would pass by Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house. Maria Gage lives about one-quarter of a mile from Ben Holiday\u2019s house, a little east of north. These three acres blocks are surrounded by streets. Ben Holiday\u2019s house is the only one you would necessarily pass in going from Oliver Wilkins\u2019 to defendant\u2019s, by the most direct route. Immediately north of defendant\u2019s house is an enclosed three acres block, with no houses or improvements on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\"

deceased. The first time I knew Jane was dead, Ann Morrison came to my house and called me, and said, \u201cI think some one has killed or hurt Jane.\u201d I went up there, and found her lying on the ground, with her head cut open, and a bloody axe lying near her. I screamed, and kept a-screaming. No one came, and I went back and put on my clothes. When I came back, John Kerr came. His nephew, Walter Wheeler, came with him, and shortly afterwards Aleck Brown came, and he stooped over Jane and said, \u201c Yes; sure enough, she is dead.\u201d Aleck said to John Kerr, \u201c Let\u2019s put her in the house.\u201d Kerr said, \u201c No.\u201d Aleck walked off, put his elbows on the fence, and leaned his head on his hands. I said, \u201cWho will go after Oliver Wilkins ?\u201d and Aleck said, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Before cotton picking time, Aleck and Jane had trouble, fussing and quarrelling. Aleck was frequently at Oliver Wilkins\u2019 , both in the day and at night, while Oliver was absent, and no one at home.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-20\">Cross-examined, witness testified: Ann Morrison called me three times. I was asleep when Ann called me. When Oliver came up, he said, \u201c There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>is my poor wife.\u2019 \u2019 After Ann Morrison called me, I went right up, in my night linen. I put my hands on her head, and I thought she said, \u201cMa.\u201d The body was still warm. I screamed, and kept hallooing, \u201c Some one has killed my poor child!\u201d I went back, and dressed. I don\u2019t think it took me fifteen minutes. I went just as quick as I could. Jane Wilkins married Tobe Cook\u2019s father the first year of freedom. Aleck Brown was then only a baby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">Re-examined by the State: About four months before the death of deceased,-the defendant and deceased were at Oliver Wilkins\u2019 house, quarrelling, and I went to them and tried to stop it, and defendant started off, and then stopped, and picked up a big stick of wood, and threw at deceased, and hit the fence; and I said, \u201cAleck, I am going to make your p\u00f3cket blue for that; \u201d and he said, \u201c G-od damn you! I will make your heart bleed in less than six months,\u201d and then left. Oliver Wilkins\u2019 family consisted of only himself and wife, and a little 5 or 6-year-old boy, and no one lived at his place except this family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">J. F. Nash, recalled for the State, testified: He arrested the defendant on this.charge on the night of the murder. Very shortly after witness got to Wilkins\u2019, being shortly after 10 o\u2019clock, he had on no hat or coat or overshirt, and only a clean undershirt on the upper portion of his-body. ! The sleeves he had on when arrested had some spots of blood on them at the time he was arrested. I went that night to defendant\u2019s house, and found a white straw hat and a pair of pants of defendant\u2019s, both of which had some spots of fresh blood on them; but I did not notice the blood on the hat and pants of defendant until the next morning, but noticed it on the shoes that night. The blood on the hat was a small spot on the under side of the brim, and a large spot on the band, and there were large spots on his shoes. The blood has faded away some, but I can see it on the hat and pants and shoes now. The deceased had been struck three times in the head and once in the shoulder, with the axe or some sharp, cutting instrument.

From sundown until Aleck Brown came after me to tell me of my wife\u2019s death, I was at the white folks\u2019 gambling joint at the Home Saloon. John Majors, Warren Flemming, Joe Sims, and others were there.

When I came back, Aleck Brown, the defendant, was talking with Jane Wilkins, the deceased. He was standing on the outside and she was on the inside of the yard fence of Oliver Wilkins\u2019 place. My little boys, who had gone up to the Taylor House, got home about half an hour, or maybe three-quarters of an hour, after I got back from town. I live on the most direct route from defendant\u2019s house to Oliver Wilkins\u2019, and in going to the Taylor House, by the most direct route, from my place, you would have to pass Oliver Wilkins\u2019 place. Maria Gage lives about one-quarter of a mile southeast from where I live; and at the time of the death of Jane Wilkins, Maria Gage owed me a dollar, which she promised to pay on that day, but did not pay on that day. My house is very near the sidewalk, and on the night of the murder there was a lamp burning with a full light until a few minutes before I heard Aunt Barcas screaming, when she found her daughter dead.

The defendant, Aleck Brown, was there by the fence, talking to her. They said \u201cYes \u201d about something. I was gone about half an hour.

The street is about thirteen yards wide. Oliver\u2019s house is about ten feet from the street, on the south side, and mine about the same distance, on the north side. Oliver\u2019s house fronts south, and mine east. On the night of the murder, about 8 o\u2019clock, or after, I saw Aleck Brown standing on the outside of Oliver\u2019s yard fence of Oliver\u2019s house, at or near the northwest corner. Jane Wilkins, the deceased, was standing on the inside, and they were talking to each other. They were close together, and one each side of the fence. They were quarrelling, I don\u2019t know what about. They stood there quarrelling for several minutes. I heard him say something about money, and I heard Jane say she was through with him, and would have nothing more to do with him. She left, and immediately went in the house, and defendant immediately opened the gate, and went in, and left the gate open. He followed Jane immediately into the house. I heard some noise in Jane\u2019s house. It sounded like some persons fussing and quarrelling. This rumpus was kept up several minutes, and I could not tell what was said by the persons fussing and quarrelling.

I heard Jane say, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d Then I heard the defendant, Aleck Brown, say something in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>answer, but could not tell what it was. Then I heard about four licks struck, and heard Jane scream after the first lick was struck, but heard her voice no more after I heard the second blow. After I heard the blows, and heard Jane scream, I saw some one run and jump over the fence right south of the gate, and run down by Ben Holiday\u2019s, in the direction of his house. I heard a plank of the fence break as he got over the fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">I have seen the defendant there frequently, both day and night, while Oliver Wilkins was not at home.

I stayed a little while, and when I came out I could hear them in the house talking, quarrelling, and sounded like they might be fighting, and I recognized it as Aleck\u2019s voice. They kept this up until I went in the house again. I stayed a few minutes, and when I came out they were out in the yard. I could hear them quarrelling and talking in the yard. I could not understand all the defendant said. He talked low, but I could understand Jane. She called him a liar three times. I went back in my house the third time. Not long after I went in I heard the blows struck, and the screaming of deceased; and then I heard some one run across the yard, and saw him jump over the fence, and heard the fence break as he got over. ' I could not tell how he was dressed. I then went in my house, and stayed about half an hour, I think, and then I called Jane, but she did not answer. I then went and called Aunt Darcas, her mother, and she came, and found Jane \u25a0dead, with her head split to pieces, with a bloody axe by her side. The defendant and deceased had had quarrels before, and at one time he bit one of her fingers nearly off. I have known the defendant, Aleck Brown, ever since he was a baby. (And the witness points him out, and identifies him in open court, before the jury, and says she is positive he is the man who was engaged in the conversation and quarrelling with the deceased on the night of the murder.)

His proclamation shall state specially the purpose for which the Legislature is convened.\u201d It is further provided by article 3, section 40, of said Constitution: \u201c When the Legislature shall be convened in special session, there shall be no legislation upon any subject other than those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>designated by the proclamation of the Governor calling such session, or presented to them by the Governor; and no such session shall be of longer duration than thirty days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The proclamation, among other things, convened the Legislature \u2018\u2018 to reapportion the State into congressional, senatorial, judicial, and representative districts, and to provide for the election of officers therein.\u201d The judicial districts mentioned in the proclamation were those presided over by the district judges. A casual inspection of the proclamation renders this certain. That the authority to reapportion or reorganize the judicial districts of the entire State necessarily carried with it the power to reapportion any given number of such districts, is to our minds a self-evident proposition. The office of the proclamation is to designate the subjects, and not the manner or extent of legislation on such subjects. \u201c It was not the intention to require the Governor to define with precision as to detail the subjects of legislation, but only in a general way by his call to confine the business to the particular subjects.\u201d Mitchell v. Turnpike Co., 3 Humph., 455; Devereaux v. City of Brownsville, 29 Fed. Rep., 742; Baldwin v. The State, 21 Texas Cr. App., 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">1. That the Legislature may only enact legislation in part in relation to the subject mentioned in the call does not render such legislation invalid, nor is it necessary to the validity of such legislation that the whole subject matter should be acted on by the Legislature. The call includes the entire subject of reapportioning the judicial districts, and authorized <em>\u201c </em>any and all such legislation upon that subject as was deemed necessary by the Legislature. It was not necessary, nor would it have been proper, for the Governor, in his proclamation, to have suggested, in detail, the legislation desired. It was for the Legislature to determine what the legislation should be.\u201d Baldwin v. The State, 21 Texas Cr. App., 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">2. We do not concur in contention of counsel, that the object and purpose of the act are not sufficiently stated in its caption. It was not necessary to state in the caption the different counties constituting the newly constituted district, nor to state that one of the counties composing such district was transferred from some adjoining district. The caption is sufficient, and not violative of article 3, section 35, Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">3. Defendant\u2019s motion to set aside and quash the indictment because he was not allowed an opportunity for challenging the array of jurors constituting the grand jury was not well taken. He made no request to be brought from jail for that purpose. This was necessary. Code Crim. Proc., art. 377; Willson\u2019s Crim. Stats., secs. 1901, 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">4. A continuance was sought in order to have analyzed the blood found upon the defendant\u2019s clothing. There was no diligence used to obtain such analysis, and no excuse given for such failure. The murder occurred October 15, and the application for continuance was filed January 14 following. Again, the blood spots were found upon defendant\u2019s hat, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pants, shirt, and shoes, and the application alleges that it came from a squirrel he had dressed on the.morning preceding the homicide at night. The evidence adduced by himself, as well as by the State, shows that he did not dress the squirrel. He introduced his daughter, who stated that a squirrel had been given her on the morning in question, but that it was dressed before she received it, and she carried it home after it was given her, and the State introduced the witness who made the present, and who also dressed it. The analysis could not have been material, under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">5. When the allegations in a bill of exceptions are contradicted by a statement of the court, annexed to the bill, such statement will be held to correctly present the matter at issue. As thus qualified, the bill disclosed that Oliver Wilkins, husband of deceased, said to defendant, \u201cAleck, you have killed my wife.\u201d Defendant made no reply, and walked off. The admission of this evidence was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">6. It was not error to receive and record the verdict on Sunday. Powers v. The State, 23 Texas Cr. App., 42; Walker v. The State, 13 Texas Cr. App., 618; Shearman v. The State, 1 Texas Cr. App., 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">7. The bill of exceptions recites the reception of the verdict on Sunday, which was the 15th day of the month. The entry of the judgment is shown by the transcript to have been made on the 14th. Because of this variance it does not follow that the judgment was entered on Sunday. If entered on Sunday, it was a fact easy of ascertainment and proof, and should have been shown, if it was desired to set aside the judgment on this ground. We are not authorized to presume, from the variance in the dates stated, that such entry actually occurred on the 15th, or on Sunday. Presumptions are indulged in aid and support of the judgment. The party attacking the judgment must overcome such presumptions. The day set out in record of judgment simply recited the beginning of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">8. The court\u2019s omission to instruct the jury in regard to the law of manslaughter was not error. The evidence does not raise that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">9. The evidence .supports the conviction. In addition to previous quarrels and difficulties between the parties, and threats of the defendant against deceased, the killing, and the manner of its execution, were attended with such circumstances of enormity and cruelty as afford sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion, that the killing was the result of a sedate, deliberate mind, and formed design, and that it was com- \" mitted upon express malice. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
