Impeachment of Witness\u2014Collateral Matter Tending to Degrade, how far Admissible.\u2014While the question as to whether a witness can be impeached by requiring him to testify and disclose collateral matter as to his personal history tending to his disgrace, but going to affect his credibility, has been a subject of much discussion and contrariety of decision, it appears to be now settled, in England, that where a witness is cross-examined he may be asked any question which tends, first, to test his accuracy, veracity, or credibility; or second, to shake his credit by injuring his character; and the ruling in many of the American States and in Texas is, thathe may be compelled to answer any such question, however irrelevant to the facts in issue, and however disgraceful to himself, except where the answer might expose him to a criminal charge.\u201d See opinion for a discussion in extenso of the subject.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-11\">2. Same \u2014 Illustration. \u2014 Where it should appear, on cross-examination, that the witness had a previous criminal experience, as for instance that he had spent part of his life in jail, or was convicted, or had suffered some infamous punishment, or had been in jail on a criminal charge, it would tend to shake or impair his credit, and the jury should have such information concerning him.

Same\u2014Witnesses on Bail to Answer for a Crime\u2014So reason is seen why the above rules are not applicable to the case of a witness who is charged with crime, but has been permitted to give bail for his appearance to answer said crime. The presumption of innocence is certainly no greater in his favor than in the case of one imprisoned on account of inability to give bail.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-13\">4. Same \u2014 Limitation and Restriction as to such Examination of a Witness.\u2014Where a witness is permitted to be examined as to collateral matters tending to degrade him, it is essential to a true estimate of his character by the jury, and it is the duty of the court to so limit and restrict the examination as that the inquiry relates to transactions comparatively recent, and which bear directly upon the present character of the witness.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-14\">5. Same.\u2014When a witness is asked a question, on cross-examination, about a matter tending to disgrace him, which is collateral to the main issue, and only affecting his credit, ordinarily his answer is binding, and contradictory evidence is inadmissible to impeach him upon such matter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b449-15\">6.

That thereupon the State\u2019s attorney stated to the court, that the purpose of the question was to impeach the character of the witness; and the court thereupon overruled the objection of defendant, to which action of the court he then and there excepted.

It simply refers us to the rules of evidence known to the common law for guidance. Code Crim. Proc., art. 725. Turning to the source, we find that of the various modes of impeaching a witness this alone has been the subject of much opposition and discussion; that is, whether a witness can be compelled to answer a question degrading him, collateral to the main issue, but relevant to his credit. In other methods of impeachment, the question is as to the <em>application </em>of the rule. In this, the existence of the rule is denied. It seems, however, to be conceded, that if the question is relevant to the main issue in the case, the witness upon cross-examination is bound to answer, however degrading it may be to him. It is where the evidence is not relevant to the issue, but only goes to affect his credit, that the authorities can not be reconciled. 1 Best on Ev., 130; 1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 459; Whart. Crim. Ev., 8 ed., 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">We may therefore follow the authorities whose reasoning appeals strongest to our judgment, and adopt that rule which tends to elucidate the truth, which is the object of all rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Now, while it is true that the question \u201chas never been solemnly settled,\u201d as stated by Mr. Greenleaf (1 Greenleaf on Evidence, section 459), yet eminent judges, at nisi prius trials, began at an early day to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>such questions to be asked, and compelled the witness to answer them. Whart. Crim. Ev., 474. Lord Eldon, in speaking of this practice, thus states the law in his day: \u201cA party can not be called upon to criminate himself; it used to be said a party could not be called on to discredit himself, but in modern times courts have permitted questions, to show from transactions not in issue, that the witnesses are of impeached character, and therefore not so credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">So that it would seem that though the olden authorities were against the practice (1 Phillips on Evidence, 289, 294), yet the current of authority soon changed in England and America. Indeed, in his digest of the law of Evidence, Sir James Stephen states the rules of cross-examination as follows: \u201cWhere a witness is cross-examined, he may be asked any question which tends (1) to test his accuracy, veracity, or credibility, or (2) to shake his credit, by injuring his character. He may be compelled to answer any such question, however irrelevant to the facts in issue, and however disgraceful to himself, except where the answer might expose him to a criminal charge.\u201d Willson\u2019s Crim. Stats., sec. 2511. This character of cross-examination is permitted upon the theory, that where a man\u2019s life or liberty depends upon the testimony of another, it is of the highest importance that they whom the law makes the exclusive judges of the facts and the <em>credibility </em>of the witnesses, should know how far the witness is to be trusted. They ought to know his surroundings and status, so as not to give to one belonging to the criminal class the same credit as he whose character is irreproachable. If, therefore, it should appear on cross-examination, that the witness had a previous criminal experience, or spent a part of his life in jail (Real v. The People, 42 New York, 270; Thompson on Trials, 458; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 455), or was convicted, or has suffered some infamous punishment, or had been in jail on a criminal charge (1 Best on Evidence, 130), it would tend to shake or impair his credit, and the jury should have such information. While it may seem hard to compel a witness to commit perjury or destroy his own standing before the court, it would seem absurd to place the feelings of a profligate witness in competition with the substantial rights of the parties in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">But it is to be remembered, and all the authorities unite in the statement, that the examination must be kept within bounds by the court; that the question should only be permitted where the ends of justice clearly require it, and the inquiry relates to transactions comparatively recent, bearing directly on the <em>present </em>character of the witness, and is essential to the true estimation of his testimony by the jury. 1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 459; Whart. Crim. Ev., secs. 474, 476; Taylor on Ev., secs. 1314, 1315. It should be the care of the trial judge to confine the interrogatory to matters coming within the said limitations, and promptly suppress all inquiry into matters not recent nor relevant to credit, otherwise the witness box <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>would become a source of scandal and an offense. It is also to be observed, that when a witness is asked a question which tends to disgrace him, and answers the question, the cross-examining party is, in general, bound by the answer, if collateral to the issue and only going to the credit of the witness. For to admit contradictory evidence would raise collateral and independent issues not relevant to the main question. 1 Greenl. on Ev., 455; 2 Phil, on Ev., 950; Best on Ev., 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The doctrine contended for by appellant, which, in attacking credibility, limits inquiry to the general reputation of the witness for truth and veracity in his neighborhood, is as unsatisfactory in theory as it has been in practice. The proposition announced in Boon v. Weathered, 23 Texas, 684, 686, that one of vicious character \u201c may still preserve the priceless virtue of truth, though every other virtue is gone,\u201d is not the teaching of human experience. Such a case would be deemed an exception, so marked as should require the fact to be affirmatively shown. Among the dissolute and degraded we do not, naturally, seek nor expect to find this best characteristic of manhood. Without proof to the contrary the jury may fairly assume, that from the immoral and criminal character truth has fled with other virtues. While, therefore, the method of impeachment contended for is one of the recognized modes, we see no reason why it should be exclusive. We think the jury may reach, in many cases, a more satisfactory estimate of a witness\u2019 character from admissions drawn from his own lips upon cross-examination, than by impeaching his general reputation by <em>other </em>witnesses\u2014a method seldom understood by even intelligent witnesses, and too often made the opportunity of malice and revenge. For experience clearly demonstrates, that in most efforts to swear away the character of a witness, animosity or injury is the incentive or cause of the most positive impeaching testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Under these views, we do not think the court erred in permitting the question to be asked. Again, this question of collateral impeachment came before this court in the Lights case, 21 Texas Criminal Appeals, 309, in which it was held competent to discredit a witness by asking him if he had not been in the penitentiary. And the court expressly overruled Ivey\u2019s case, in 41 Texas, 35, which held a witness could not be compelled to answer whether he had not just come out of jail to testify?\u201d The Lights case held such a question clearly admissible, citing Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, 474, and Real v. The People, 42 New York, 270, in which the doctrine is laid down, that a witness, on cross-examination, may be asked \u2018 whether he has been in jail, penitentiary, or other place that would tend to impair his credit ?\u201d The Lights case has been repeatedly followed in this State. Woodson case, 24 Texas Cr. App., 162; Williams\u2019 case, 28 Texas Cr. App., 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Now, it seems from the foregoing authorities that a witness may be interrogated as to his having been in the penitentiary or jail, whether on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>conviction or on a preliminary charge. But it is the nature of the charge rather than from the imprisonment that may affect credit; and it certainly does not seem clear why the fact of a person being able to give bond and thereby escape imprisonment should bar an inquiry into his credibility. The presumption of innocence is certainly no greater in favor of one under bond than one who, from his inability to give bond, is compelled to undergo imprisonment. We do not think the court erred in permitting the question to be asked of the witness Glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">There are no other questions that need be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
