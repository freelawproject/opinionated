J. 8. A. </em>19:37 \u2014 1. Since the election is to be held November 3, the appeal was argued and orally decided by affirmance on October 21. At that time we stated that in due course a written opinion would be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Several years- ago the borough created the \u201cBorough of South Plainfield Sewerage Authority\u201d (hereafter called the authority) and appointed its members, under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:144-1 <em>et seq. </em>The authority has been functioning ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">On September 23, 1959 the borough adopted a resolution requesting the Clerk of Middlesex County to place upon the ballot for referendum the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201c1. Shall the Sewerage Authority of the Borough of South Plain-field proceed with its plans for financing and installing sanitary sewers in the Borough of South Plainfield?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">2. Shall the Mayor and Council of the Borough of South Plainfield undertake the planning, financing, and installing of sanitary sewers in the Borough of South Plainfield?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\"><em>N. J. 8. A. </em>19 :37-l provides for uou-biuding referenda \u201cto ascertain the sentiment of the legal voters of the munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>pality * * * upon any question or policy pertaining to the government or internal affairs thereof * *</p>\n<p id=\"ATy\">Judge Vogel held that the questions here sought to be propounded did not relate to any question or policy pertaining to the government or internal affairs of the municipality because (quoting from his opinion) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201c* * \u00ab y. js cieal. from a study of the pertinent statutes that the sewerage authority has full and exclusive power to \u2018undertake the planning, financing, and installing of sanitary sewers\u2019; and it is equally clear that the Mayor and Council of the Borough of South Plainfield has [sic] no power to act in response to any decision arrived at by the public in the event the questions set forth in the resolution are presented for the consideration of the electorate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> We agree. <em>N. J. 8. A. 40:14A </em>\u2014 1 <em>et seq. </em>makes it clear that the borough has uo authority to do anything included within question 1 <em>(cf. Beyer v. Tp. Committee of Tp. of Mt. Holly, </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>409 <em>(Law Div. </em>1949); <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:14.4-35) and is absolutely forbidden to do what is asked in question 2. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:14A-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The reasoning in Judge Vogel\u2019s opinion paralleled that of the majority in <em>Botkin v. Mayor and Borough Council of Borough of Westwood, </em>52 <em>N. J. Super. </em>416 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), appeal dismissed <em>per curiam, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>218 (1958). Appellants contend that the <em>Botkin </em>case is not in point because a sewerage authority under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>40:14ff~l <em>et seq. </em>is merely an agency of the municipality, not a separate and distinct corporate entity as was the consolidated school district involved in the <em>Botkin </em>case, citing <em>County of Camden v. Pennsauken Sewerage Authority, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>456 (1954). Furthermore, say appellants, the majority opinion in <em>Botkin </em>should not be followed because three Justices of the Supreme Court disapproved it and the remaining four declined to pass upon its merits (28 <em>N. J. </em>218).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">These arguments misapprehend the fact that the majority and the dissenting opinions in <em>Botkin </em>agreed upon the fundamental principle, governing the application of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>19:37-l, that referendum questions must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>relate to action which the municipality has the authority to take, whether the contemplated action is against a separate corporate entity, or an \u201cagency\u201d as alleged here. If the municipality has no power to act it has no right to seek the voters\u2019 advice whether to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The opinions in <em>Botlcin </em>differed only upon the application of that principle to the referendum question then before the court, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cShould any action be considered to effect a deconsolidation of the Consolidated School District of Westwood and Washington Township?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The majority held that the local governing body was not empowered to seek such legislation, and therefore it had no right to place the question on the ballot. The dissent was based upon the proposition that under the facts there present the municipality did have the right to seek the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Appellants argue that here, if question 1 were answered \u201cno\u201d and question 2 \u201cyes,\u201d it would constitute an expression of sentiment that the municipality take all necessary steps to carry out the wishes of the voters, including obtaining legislation. But referendum questions must be given the meaning that the average voter would give to them. It would be the rare voter who would take these questions to mean that the municipality was asking the advice of the voters on whether to seek legislation to abolish the authority or to curtail its powers. Most voters would vote \u201cno\u201d to the first question if they disapproved of the authority\u2019s plans, even though they did not contemplate the abolition of the authority or the shearing of its powers. Likewise, it is hardly likely that any voter who voted \u201cyes\u201d to question 2 would suspect that the municipality has no legal right to plan and install sewers unless legislation first abolishes the authority or amends <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:14A-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">No other basis is suggested upon which it can be pretended that these questions relate to any \u201cquestion or policy pertaining to the government or internal affairs\u201d of the munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>pality, within its jurisdiction. Whether the authority is an entity as completely separate from the municipality as a school district is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
