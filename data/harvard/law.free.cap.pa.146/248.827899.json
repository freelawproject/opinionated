That defendant was the owner during the year 1890, after the adoption of said ordinance, of one one-horse wagon and one two-horse wagon, which he kept for hire, and with them he hauled property for pay within said borough, without having first taken out a license under the ordinance aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">\u201c 4.

That said ordinance was passed in pursuance of the act of April 22,1889, entitled \u2018 A further supplement to an act regulating boroughs, approved the third day of April, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, authorizing the corporate authorities to levy and'collect a license tax on hacks, carriages and other vehicles, carrying persons or property for pay.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-11\">\u201c If the court be of opinion (1) that said act of April 22, 1889, is constitutional, and (2) that said ordinance is in conformity with said act of April 22, 1889, and (3) that suit for the recovery of the amount of said license fee was properly instituted before a justice of the peace, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff; but if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendant; the costs to follow the judgment, and either party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>After argument, the court, McIlvaine, P. J., on May 21, 1891, filed, the following opinion : ' -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">The defendant admits that \u201c he is the owner of one one-horse wagon and one two-horse wagon, which he keeps for hire \u25a0 and with which he hauls property for pay within the borough of Washington;\u201d and that he has not taken out a license under the ordinance approved January 20, 1890, entitled \u201cAn ordinance imposing a license tax on vehicles,\u201d and its supplement of April, 1890. [The questions submitted to the court for its opinion are: (1) Is the act of assembly approved April 22, 1889, constitutional? (2) Is the ordinance in conformity with said act ? and (3) Can the license fees due from the defendant be recovered by a suit before a justice of the peace ? These questions in our opinion must all be answered in the affirmative.] 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">The act of assembly approved April 22, 1889, P. p. 39, can well be characterized as a bunglesome piece of legislation, yet we, are not satisfied that it is wholly unconstitutional. It is true that the enactment of the first section is broader than the title, and so far as the power conferred on town councils to \u201c limit the compensation \u201d for the use of hacks, etc., is concerned, it must be held to be unconstitutional. But, striking this out of the first section, it leaves the enactment the same as expressed in the title of the act, and hence not repugnant to the clause of the constitution which provides that the title of an act shall clearly express the subject thereof: \u00a7 3, article III. Neither do we think the act repugnant to \u00a7 6, article III. of the constitution; for it does not revive, amend, extend or confer the provisions of an existing law. It is a supplement of the act of 1851, and. simply adds one more power to the many already conferred on the corporate officers of a borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">There can be no doubt that \u201c an entire act is not necessarily unconstitutional, because the title fails to give notice of some particular matter contained therein.\u201d The rule has been to sustain the portion of which the title gives notice: Dewhurst v. Allegheny City, 95 Pa. 442, and cases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">The first section of the act confers the power on the town councils \u201c to enact ordinances establishing reasonable rates of license tax on all hacks, carriages, omnibuses and other vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>used in carrying persons or property for pay, within the limits of boroughs.\u201d The title of the act gives full notice of this enactment, and the first section of the act is thus far constitutional and must be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The second section, in its provision that the license tax shall be collected as other licenses, taxes, fines and penalties are now authorized by law to be collected, cannot all stand, because taxes and fines and penalties are not collected in the same way, but in \u00e1 totally different way. To say that a license tax shall be collected as taxes are collected, and to say that a license shall be collected as fines and penalties are collected, is to prescribe two ways of collecting the license tax which are irreconcilably repugnant. And, as but one way of collecting the license tax was evidently intended to be pointed out, the rule is to take the last way pointed out; that is, the license tax is to be collected as fines and penalties are collected, before a justice of the peace under \u00a7 7, act of April 15, 1885: Packer v. Railroad Co., 19 Pa. 211.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">But, even if \u00a7 2 were to be stricken from the act, because of the objections that have been urged against it, still we are of the opinion that the license could be collected by the borough from the defendant, on an implied promise. If the borough had the power under the first section of the act of 1889, as we think it had, to enact the ordinance in question, and that ordinance required the defendant to pay a license of three dollars for his one-horse wagon, and a license of five dollars for his two-horse wagon, if he used them for hire, and he did use them for hire, the law implies a promise on his part to pay the eight dollars, and they can be recovered by the borough in an action of debt before a justice of the peace, if no other remedy is provided. This doctrine is sustained by Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 542. In that case, an act of congress imposed a tariff on certain imported goods, and provided no way to collect it. The importer refused to pay, and the Supreme Court held that an action of debt by the United States against-the importer, would lie upon his implied promise to pay the tariff when he imported the goods, upon the \u201c principle that every person will obey the will of the legislature.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">[And now, May 21,1891, this cause came on to be heard upon the facts stated, in the nature of a special verdict, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>argued by counsel; whereupon, upon due consideration, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff.] a</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">\u2014Thereupon, the defendant took this appeal specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">1.

Justice Stebbett :</author>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The facts recited in the case stated presented for the consideration of the court below three questions: (1) Whether the act of April 22, 1889, therein referred to, is constitutional ; (2) whether the borough ordinance conforms to the act; (3) whether payment of the license tax due by defendant, under the provisions of the ordinance, can be enforced by suit before a justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">These questions were rightly answered in the affirmative, and judgment on the case stated was accordingly entered in favor of the plaintiff. The act in question is entitled \u201c A further supplement to an act regulating boroughs,.....au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>thorizing the corporate authorities to levy and collect a license tax on hacks, carriages, and other vehicles carrying persons or property for pay, \u201d etc. The first section of the act empowers the council of every borough \u201c to enact ordinances establishing reasonable rates of license tax on all hacks, carriages, omnibuses, and other vehicles used in carrying persons or property for pay, and limit the compensation for the same within the limits of said borough. \u201d The second section provides \u201c that said ordinance shall be enforced as other borough ordinances are by law enforced, and the license tax shall be collected as other licenses, taxes, fines, and penalties are now authorized by law to be collected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The power of the legislature to pass such an act cannot be questioned. There is nothing either in the title or in the body of the act that offends against any provision of the constitution. The title gives to all persons interested ample notice of the subject of the act; quite sufficient, at least, to lead them to an inquiry into the body of the bill. Nothing more than that is required: Allegheny Co. Home\u2019s Appeal, 77 Pa. 80. The power given in the body of the act to limit compensation, etc., cannot be regarded as a distinct subject from that clearly expressed in the title. On the contrary, it is germane to that subject and hence the act is not in conflict with \u00a7 3, article III., of the constitution: Millvale Borough v. Railway Co., 131 Pa. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We are also of opinion that the borough ordinance sufficiently conforms to the act; and also, that suit for the collection of the license tax was properly instituted before a justice of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">There was no error in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
