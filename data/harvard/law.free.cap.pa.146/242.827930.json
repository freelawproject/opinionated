I do hereby authorize and direct my executor to sell and convey at public or private sale, my farm in North Strabane township, Washington county, Pa., adjoining lands of Rev. T. B. VanEman, Wm.

But, if the court be not of that opinion, then judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant, costs to follow judgment; either party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error or an appeal thereon, as the case may be.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">The will of Samuel Alexander, deceased, a copy of which was attached, gave certain pecuniary and specific legacies in the first, second and third paragraphs, the fourth paragraph being as set forth in the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-10\">After argument, the court, McIlvaine, P.

All the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal or mixed, I bequeath and devise to my daughter, Elizabeth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Alexander, (subject to the right of dower of my wife Mary, therein,) to be held by her in fee-simple: Provided, nevertheless, that in ease she should die without leaving lawful issue, then it is my will that the property above devised to her shall be equally divided amongst the children of my brother, Dr. J. W. Alexander.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">Had Elizabeth Alexander a fee-simple title in the real estate of her father under this clause of his will, which passed by her will to the persons therein named; or, by the death of Elizabeth Alexander, unmarried and without issue,'did the title vest in Margaret Ray, the use plaintiff, and the other children of Dr. ,J. W. Alexander?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">In seeking for a precedent which may aid us in coming to a proper conclusion on this question, it is unnecessary to go farther back than the Pennsylvania leading case of Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 W. 447. Michael Carle devised certain real estate to his two sons, Adam and Henry, their heirs and assigns forever, and in a subsequent clause of the will provided as follows : \u201c Because my son Henry is not yet married, that if he should die without leaving any lawful issue, that then his full share shall fall or go in equal share to my three children, Adam and Anna Mary and Susannah, to one of them as much as to the other.\u201d Mr. Justice Sergeant, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court on the question, what title did Henry Carle take in the real estate devised to him by his father, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">\u201c The principle has now become a settled rule of property, in relation to lands, that if a devise be made to one in fee, and if he die without issue, or on failure of issue, or for want of issue, or without leaving issue, then over to another in fee, the estate of the first taker is a fee-tail, which, if he have issue, passes to them ad infinitum by descent as tenants in tail. The estate vests in the first taker fully, and to all intents and purposes as a fee-tail; and any devise over after the failure of such, must of course be after an indefinite failure of issue, and bad as an executory devise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-8\">The authority of this case has been recognized by the Supreme Court in at least thirty reported cases, the last one to our knowledge being Hackney v. Tracy, 137 Pa. 53. In that case, Mr. Justice Green says :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-9\">\u201cWe have repeatedly said that the case of Eichelberger v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>.Barnitz has never been shaken, and it is certainly the law of the state at. the present time. There, have undoubtedly been cases in which we have held that, where language somewhat similar was used, \u2018 the failure of issue \u2019 upon which the estate of the first taker was to determine, was a definite, and not an indefinite failure of issue; but in all these cases, some particular reasons, founded upon the language of the will indicating that the testator intended a definite failure of issue, controlled the decision. It was contended for the appellants that such a reason exists in the present case, in the fact that the limitation over is to the sister Mary, by name, and that, she being a living person at the death of the testator, a definite failure of issue, must have been intended, and that such a limitation was not too remote to sustain an executory devise. There arp cases in which such a fact is held important, in connection with other considerations. But, standing alone, it is clearly not sufficient, as has been held in many of the cases. Thus, in Eichelberger v. Barnitz, the limitation over was to the testator\u2019s \u2018 other three children, Adam and Anna Mary and Susannah.\u2019 They were the testator\u2019s own children, and were specifically named as second takers, which might be well urged against the failure of issue being regarded as indefinite, yet it was so held.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">In the language of the will of Samuel Alexander we can find nothing to indicate that by the words, \u201c without leaving lawful issue,\u201d he intended a definite failure of issue. As a matter of fact he may have so intended, but such intention cannot be found, either expressed or implied, within the four corners of his will. In apt language he made the devise in favor of the plaintiff, and the other children of Dr. J. W. Alexander, depend upon an indefinite failure of issue, and created an estate-tail in his daughter, Elizabeth Alexander, which, by operation of our act of 1855, became a fee-simple estate in her, subject to her testamentary disposition. And, the daughter having devised the farm to others than the use plaintiff, she cannot recover in this action. The devise over to the children of Dr. J. W. Alexander is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">And now, March 30, 1891, judgment upon the facts stated and submitted in the nature of a special verdict, is entered against the plaintiffs and in favor of the defendants for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>land described in tbe writ of ejectment, and for the costs of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">\u2014Thereupon, the plaintiffs took this appeal, assigning the foregoing decree for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-5\"><em>Mr. George Shiras, Jr., </em>(with him <em>Mr. A.

Justice Stebbett :</author>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">This case is ruled by Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 W. 447; Hackney v. Tracy, 137 Pa. 53, and that line of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">In the fourth item of his will the testator, Samuel Alexander, bequeathed and devised to his daughter, Elizabeth Alexander, \u201c all the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal, and mixed,.....to be held by her in fee-simple: Provided, nevertheless, that in case she should die without leaving lawful issue, then it is my will that the property above devised to her shall be equally divided amongst the children of my brother, Dr. J. W. Alexander.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">In apt words, the devise over to the beneficial plaintiff and other children of Dr. J. W. Alexander, is made to depend upon the death of testator\u2019s daughter Elizabeth, \u201cwithout leaving lawful issue,\u201d which, according to-the established in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>terpretation. of such expressions in a will, means a .general, indefinite failure of issue, and not a failure at the death of the first taker. There is nothing on the face of the will to change the technical meaning of the word \u201c issue,\u201d in the phrase above quoted, or to show that the testator meant \u201c children,\u201d or issue living at a particular period, instead of the whole line of succession. It follows that Elizabeth Alexander took an estate in fee-tail, which, under the operation of the act of 1855, was enlarged to a fee-simple, and thus became subject to her testamentary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">For these and other reasons, more fully stated in the opinion of the court below, there was no error in entering judgment, on the case stated, in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
