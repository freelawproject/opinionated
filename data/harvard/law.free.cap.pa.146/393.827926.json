The statement of claim filed was not furnished in the paper-books. Issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-13\">At the trial, on October 29,1890, the plaintiffs proved an account for goods sold and delivered to the McKeesport Workingmen\u2019s Co-operative Association, incorporated under the act of June 7, 1887, P. L. 365. The first item of the account was dated March 3, 1889. It was then shown that on February 15, 1889, F. A. Chadwick, the defendant, who was president of said association, caused to be delivered to the plaintiffs a letter of that date reading as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-14\">\u201c This is to certify I will pay or be responsible for all goods purchased at Arbuckles for the W.\u2019s Co-operative Ass\u2019n; pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>mente to be made every two weeks, commencing February 26, 1889.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AV8\">It was shown, further, that before the date of the foregoing letter, the plaintiffs had an unsettled account against said association, but had refused further credit to it; and that after said letter was received, sales were made to the association on the faith of the defendant\u2019s engagement. The plaintiffs gave in evidence, also, the record at No. 710 December Term 1889, Arbuckles &amp; Co., Limited, v. McKeesport Workingmen\u2019s Cooperative Ass\u2019n, being assumpsit for the same cause of action as in this case, showing that the association had defeated the plaintiffs\u2019claim therein under the provisions of \u00a78, act of June 7, 1887, P. L. 368, prohibiting the giving of credit to or by such associations. And it was admitted that Chadwick, the defendant herein, after the date of his letter, had made certain payments which were credited upon the old account against the association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">The plaintiffs having rested, the defendant, being examined in his own behalf, testified that after the date of his letter, he had paid, out of the funds of the association but by means of his personal checks, sums aggregating four hundred and fifty dollars, which he supposed were credited on the account in suit. The defendant then offered in evidence four checks drawn by him to the order of the plaintiffs, dated in June and July, 1889, and aggregating four hundred and fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">Objected to, because the witness has already stated that this was not his individual money but the money of the association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">Counsel for defendant then proposed to prove by the witness that, at the time this letter was written, the defendant was informed by the manager of the association and was led to believe that there was no indebtedness to Arbuckles &amp; Co.; that he made this guaranty with the understanding that payment and settlement should be made every two weeks, and that after this guaranty was made, the sum of four hundred and fifty dollars was paid by him out of the association\u2019s money, with the understanding that it should be applied to the indebtedness that was contracted by the association after the writing of this letter, and having no knowledge of any previous indebtedness, he paid this sum of four hundred and fifty dollars on the debt that wras contracted since that letter was written; and that this was paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>by his individual checks, Arbuckles &amp; Co. having no knowledge of the fact that this was association money or other money than that of F. A. Chadwick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">Objected to, as to the part that relates to the understanding and information of the witness, unless that extends to the connection of the plaintiffs with the information which was given to him; also, to the latter part, that it was paid with his individual check; on the ground that it contradicts the witness in that he stated that it was paid with the funds of the association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">By the court: Objections sustained; exception.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">The case closing on the testimony the court, Collier, J., charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">The whole matter in this case is one of law for the court, and not for the jury.
