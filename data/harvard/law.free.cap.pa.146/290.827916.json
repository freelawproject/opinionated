K. Jennings </em>was appointed auditor to make distribution of the proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">On July 25,1889, the auditor filed his report, wherein it was found, inter alia, that on March 24, 1883, the Atlas Works, Limited, a partnership organized under the act of June 2,1874, P. L. 271, for the purpose of carrying on a general foundry and machine business, by E. R. Hugus and R. H. Negley, its chairman and secretary, respectively, executed and delivered a bond for twenty-six thousand dollars, real debt, to the Peoples\u2019 Savings Bank, secured by a mortgage on its leasehold and fixtures guaranteed by Andrew Carnegie by indorsement thereon; that, on the same day, judgment was entered on the bond, the mortgage being recorded afterward, on December 14, 1883; that, default having been made, Mr. Carnegie paid the debt secured, principal and interest, and on June 23, 1886, took an assignment of the securities to himself; that on August 13, 1886, the Briar Hill C. &amp; I. Co., having that day obtained its judgment against the Atlas Works, Limited, issued the execution to No. 159 September Term 1886, E. D., and levied upon the-leasehold and fixtures of the execution.defendant; and that on August 26,1886, Mr. Carnegie issued the execution to No. 77 October Term 1886, E. D. After finding certain other facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>indicating a defective organization of the Atlas Works, as a limited partnership, and irregularities in its method of management, the auditor\u2019s report proceeded :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">There is only one question of importance at issue in this cause, and that is a question of law. The controversy is between the Briar Hill 0. &amp; I. Co. and Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The fund for distribution arises from the sale of the leasehold of the Atlas Works, Limited, upon sundry executions; two of which, to wit, Nos. 51 September Term 1886, and 77 October Term 1886, were in favor of Andrew Carnegie. The fieri facias at No. 77 October Term 1886, was issued upon a judgment in favor of the Peoples Savings Bank, for use of Andrew Carnegie, v. the Atlas Works, Limited, upon the bond accompanying the mortgage made by the Atlas Works, Limited, to the Peoples Savings Bank, the payment, of which was guaranteed by Andrew Carnegie. Said bond was assigned to Mr. Andrew Carnegie on the twenty-third of June, 1886 ; and it is conceded that the judgment on said bond related back to the date of the recording of said mortgage, to wit, the fourteenth day of December, 1883, and was therefore the first lien, and Mr. Carnegie would be entitled to the whole of the fund, after the payment of costs and taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">But it was claimed by Mr. Houseman, attorney for the Briar Hill C. &amp; I. Co., that the said mortgage was invalid for reasons hereinafter stated, which would entitle his clients to receive the amount of their claim. It is apparent, therefore, that if the mortgage above mentioned was a valid lien, that would be the end of this case. Mr. Plouseman\u2019s reasons for contesting the validity of the lien of said mortgage, specifically stated, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-7\">1. That the organization of the limited-partnership association called the Atlas Works, Limited, was entirely defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-8\">2. That the subsequent conduct of the managers in neglecting to hold regular meetings; in omitting to re-elect officers; in not filling the places of the two members of the firm, Rufus C. Crocker and George M. Miller, who had died prior to the execution of the mortgage referred to; in neglecting to keep full and perfect minutes of the proceedings of the board of managers; in acting without the sanction of regular meetings of the association, etc., renders the action of the alleged board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>of managers in executing said bond and mortgage absolutely void as to other creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\">3. That, by reason of the informalities above mentioned, the said association had ceased to exist as a limited-partnership association under the law, and that in March, 1883, E. R. Hugus and R. H. Negley were not lawfully the chairman and secretary of the said association, with power to sign and execute the said bond and mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">In support of his position, Mr. Houseman cites Eliot v. Him-rod, .108 Pa. 569, and quotes the following language from the opinion of the court: \u201c General partners, by recording a statement in due form, false with respect to subscription and payment of capital, are not within the statute, which, on certain terms abrogates the common-law rule, that he who contracts to contribute capital and share in the profits of a firm, shall be liable for its debts. Each partner is liable, unless saved by the statute. If the partners have not complied with the statutory requisites, a limited-partnership association has not been formed. Where there is no record of a proper statement, there is no statutory association.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">This language is very strong; and if this were a proceeding to charge the individual members of the Atlas Works, Limited, with the debts of the firm, the defects in organization and the irregularities in the subsequent management of the business of the firm, are so apparent that the auditor does not see how he could avoid the conclusion that the members of said association were not within the protection of the. statute. But, to hold that on account of these irregularities and defects, there was actually no association under the law capable of performing any acts which would be binding upon it, is another and very different question. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">A partnership association organized pursuant to the provisions of the act of June 2, 1874, and its supplements, is not, in the judgment of the auditor, a mere common-law partnership, plus the attribute of a limited liability on the part of its members ; but it is a creation of the legislature, is sui generis, and, though analogous both to a partnership at common law and a corporation, in many respects, yet it differs from each in that it possesses some of the characteristics of both. It is a quasi corporation. It has special restrictions and privileges.. It ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ists only from the recording of its articles. It may adopt a common seal, and certain formalities are requisite to the validity of its acts. Only certain officers have the power to act to bind it, and in certain cases they must act together. When they have made an apparent compliance with the requirements of the act, by filing their articles of association, schedules, etc., they become a partnership limited de facto, endued with all the powers of such associations, restricted in their mode of action according to the requirements of the act, and bound by the acts of their agents when performed in a manner conforming to the requirements of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">A defect in the original organization, or a subsequent neglect of the requirements of the statute in the management of the business of the association, would, not, in the judgment of the auditor, constitute a good defence in an action by a creditor of the association upon a contract made by the association (except that in certain cases contracts must be signed by at least two of the managers), when set up by the association itself ; and the auditor is unable to perceive in what respect another creditor of the association would be in any better position to set up such a plea than the association itself, especially if he had, as in this instance, done business with the association as a limited-partnership association. The statutory remedy is not to relieve the association itself, but to hold the individual members thereof liable, on the ground that they have not brought themselves within the protection of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">This seems to be the effect of the decision in Eliot v. Him-rod, supra. It is true that the opinion states that \u201cif the partners have not complied with the statutory requisites, a limited partnership has not been formed; where there is no record of a proper statement, there is no statutory association; \u201d but we must take into account what was the question before the court. It was solely as to the liability of the individual members of the association; and rve must presume, unless we go much further than the court has gone, that what was meant was that, so far as any protection to the members of the association was concerned, \u201ca limited partnership had not been formed,\u201d and that there was \u201c no statutory association.\u201d To hold that a failure to comply with the statutory requisites re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>suited in the formation of a mere common-law partnership, and wrested from the association its power to bind itself by the methods pointed out by the statute, would be productive of the grossest injustice and fraud. No deed, bond, mortgage, note, or other paper, executed under the formalities of the statute, would be binding, if the association should subsequently be declared to have been informally organized. It is certainly much more reasonable to say that when a partnership association is organized under the act, all its engagements entered into under the forms prescribed by law are valid and binding, and the defective formation has no effect upon the obligation, but only on the kind of liability which shall arise under it. As has already been intimated, such associations cannot take advantage of their own wrong and plead lack of power to enter into the obligation ; nor can a creditor who had dealt with the firm as a partnership, limited, contest its existence in order to defeat the claim of an adverse claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">Whether this association has complied with the provisions of the act sufficiently to limit the liability of the members, is immaterial for the purposes of this case. By the filing and recording of the articles of association and schedules, they became prima facie and de facto a partnership limited, under the act, with power to bind themselves by the forms prescribed by the same. Therefore, it follows that if this bond was executed by the proper officers and with the legal formalities, its lien must prevail over all subsequent encumbrances.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">\u2014Finding that the bond and mortgage were executed in pursuance of a resolution of the board of managers regularly called for the express purpose, the whole board being present, that it was signed by the chairman and secretary and attested by the common seal of the association, and that the execution, though in certain respects informal, was in sufficient compliance with the act to hind the association, the auditor reported a distribution, first to costs, taxes, and auditor\u2019s fee, and thereafter $23,783.10 to fieri facias No. 77 October Term 1886, Peoples\u2019 Savings Bank for use of Andrew Carnegie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">To said report, the Briar Hill C. &amp; I.
