There was notMng upon which the ruling could be intelligently reviewed. Moreover, after the amendment, the case stood against the \u201cApollo Savings Bank\u201d alone, with nothing to show the character of the association, or the names of the parties composing it. If a partnership, there was no defendant. A judgment for the plaintiff, therefore, would be fruitless.</syllabus>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b103-9\">Before Paxson, C.'J., Sterrett, Green, Clark, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-10\">No. 263 October Term 1891, Sup. Ct.; court below, No. 376 June Term 1886, C. P.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-11\">On May 31,1886, Abner McConnell issued a summons \u201c in case sur contract,\u201d against \u201cthe Apollo Savings Bank, a corporation under the laws of Pennsylvania.\u201d On December 27th the plea of nul tiel corporation was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-12\">At the trial, on June 5, 1890, additional pleas and specifications were filed, but what they were was not shown in the paper-books. The trial proceeding, the plaintiff was called in his own behalf:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-13\">Mr. Mechling: \u201cQ. State if you were the possessor of any land, and how much and what it was worth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-14\">Mr. Buffington: I wish to ask what he proposes to prove by this witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-15\">Mr. Mechling: We wish to prove that he was the owner of some land and that he sold it, or made the arrangement to sell it, with the president of the association. I want to prove what he did; whether he is in possession of it now or not, and what became of it. I think that is just exactly what is necessary to make out our case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>By the court: The counsel complain that your proposition does not enlighten them sufficiently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">Mr. Mechling: In addition, we propose to show the court that we owned this property and were in possession of it, and by an agreement with the banking association it was sold and the proceeds never turned over; and he is a competent witness, no doubt, about that. I propose to show these facts, and corroborate by other evidence to be brought up afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">Mr. Buffington: We object; (1) Because the statement made by the counsel of what he proposes to prove, would impose no legal liability upon the defendant. (2) There is no offer \u00bfo show that the defendant company is a corporation. (B) Because there has been no tender of the amount that this bank expended in purchasing the real estate, in the payment of it, or an offer to pay for it. (4) Because there is no copy of any agreement filed with the papers in the case, and under the rules of evidence it should be given in evidence ; and, as an additional reason, the defendant company being a copartnership, and John B. Chambers being dead, the witness is incompetent to testify to facts that occurred in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">By the court: They deny that they are a corporation, and you will have to show that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">Mr. Mechling: We will prove it by the books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">By the court: Well, bring them right here. The counsel for the Apollo Savings Bank say that the}' are not a corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\">Mr. Mechling: I ask leave of the court to amend the record in that regard, and they can try the case again if they want to. I ask for this amendment, and let the case be determined accordingly. 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-12\">By the court: We will make the amendment, but we caution you that you may have trouble getting testimony in, the way the record stands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-13\">\u2014The record was then amended so as to read \u201c against the Apollo Savings Bank,\u201d striking out the words, an incorporation under the laws of Pennsylvania.\u201d The case then proceeded :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-14\">Mr. Buffington : We make the further objection, that there is no offer to show that there is such a body corporate or partnership as the Apollo Savings Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Mr. Mechling: That objection is out of place. The amendment corrects that. I propose to show right here, that the Apollo Savings Bank is doing business and were at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">By the court: Proceed with what you propose to prove.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">S. M. Jackson, sworn: \u201c Q. State if you are in any way connected with the Apollo Savings Bank. A. Yes, sir. Q. How long? A. Since 1881. Q. Were you connected with the bank at the time this transaction was made with McConnell? A. I was. Q. State under what title and what name that institution did business? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\">Mr. Buffington: I would like to ask whether the way they did business is in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">\u201c A. The articles of association are in writing. Q. Is it a corporate institution either by the legislature or the court ? A. It is an association.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">Mr. Buffington: The writings are the best evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-10\">By the court: Yes, that would be the best evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-11\">Mr. Mechling: He has stated that it is an association doing business, and it is not necessary, now that the answer is made; we would not be required to produce the writing after the question is answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-12\">By the court: Have you nothing further ? We will sustain the objection made to the testimony and seal you a bill of exceptions; exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-13\">By the court: Have you nothing further to offer, Mr. Mechling?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-14\">Mr. Mechling: No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-15\">By the court: Gentlemen of the jury, we direct you to render a verdict for the defendant, as there is no testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-16\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. Judgment being entered, the plaintiff took this appeal, specifying:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-17\">1. \u201c That the court clearly erred in not permitting the plaintiff to testify in his own behalf.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-18\"><em>Mr. Frank Mechling </em>(with him <em>Mr. W. It. Boyer), </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-19\">It is clear that it was the intention of \u00a7 5 (e), act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 159, to exclude a party from testifying, only when the opposite party is dead. In this case, the Apollo banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>association is not dead, and the death of its president would not be sufficient to exclude the testimony of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-6\"><em>Mr. Joseph Buffington </em>(with him <em>Mr. Orr </em>Buffington), for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-7\">Counsel filed .no printed brief.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-8\">Per Curiam.:</author>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The single specification of error is \u201c That the court clearly erred in not permitting the plaintiff to testify in his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1E\">There is nothing in the paper-book of the appellant which enables us to dispose of this question intelligently. We gather, however, from the fragmentary glimpses of the case which it discloses, that the president of the bank was dead, and the testimony referred to had reference to some conversation or contract to which he was a party. In the printed argument of the appellant it is said: \u201cIn this case, the Apollo banking association is not dead, and the death of its president would not be sufficient to exclude the testimony of the plaintiff.\u201d This might be so if the defendant bank was an incorporated association, but it appears not to have been such. The record discloses that upon the trial below the plaintiff moved the cour\u201c to so amend the record as to read \u2018 against the Apollo Savings Bank,\u2019 striking out the words \u2018an incorporation under the laws of Pennsylvania.\u2019 \u201d This amendment was allowed, so that the suit stands against the Apollo Savings Bank, without anything upon the record to show the character of the institution, or the names of the persons composing it, if it be a partnership or a private banking association. If the latter, there is no defendant on the record. A suit against a firm must set out the names of the individuals composing the firm. A judgment against the Apollo Savings Bank would do the plaintiff no good, if he had one. Under the circumstances, we can do nothing but affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
