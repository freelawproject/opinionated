The cause being called for trial, the jury returned a verdict that they found the defendant not guilty of the felony charged, but guilty of fornication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\">On October 16th, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court in arrest of judgment, assigning the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-12\">\u201c 1. There cannot legally be a conviction of fornication under the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-13\">\u201c 2. The indictment contains no count for fornication, and the conviction of that offence is unlawful, and cannot be sustained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7N\">After argument, the court, White, J., on December 12, 1890, overruled the said motion; exception. Sentence having been passed, the defendant was granted an allocatur and took this appeal, assigning the order overruling the motion in arrest of judgment, for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-14\"><em>Mr. W.

It holds, first, that rape, fornication and .bastardy, may be joined in an indictment, and second, that fornication is an incident to rape. In the present case there is no count for fornication, and the jury acquitted of rape and found the defendant guilty of fornication; and our contention is that a defendant cannot be convicted of an incident to a fact, and at the same time acquitted of the fact.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-5\">There was no appearance for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-15\">See act of May 19, 1887, P.

The jury acquitted him of the rape, but convicted him of fornication. We have held in a recent case, Commonwealth v. Lewis, 140 Pa. 561, that rape, and fornication and bastardy may be joined in an indictment, and that fornication is an incident of rape. The appellant contends that he cannot be convicted \u201c of an incident to a fact, and at the same time acquitted of the fact.\u201d But the law is well settled that a man may be acquitted of an offence charged, and yet be convicted of a constituent offence involved within it. This principle does not need the citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
