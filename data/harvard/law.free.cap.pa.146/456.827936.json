Sargeant from the report of viewers assessing damages occasioned by the opening of Negley Avenue, Pittsburgh. In this issue, the claimant was made plaintiff, and the city of Pittsburgh, defendant. Plea filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-16\">_ At the trial, on May 4, 1891, it was made to appear that the city of Pittsburgh, by ordinance enacted September 13, 1887, provided for the opening of Negley Avenue, from Roup street to Bryant street; that said avenue passed diagonally through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>a tier of lots of the plaintiff fronting on Wayne street; that Wayne street was an unopened street on an older plan for that portion of the city, known as the East Liberty plan, approved by councils in 1870 ; that no steps had ever been taken by the city towards opening any portion of Wayne street; that Negley Avenue was actually opened on March 1, 1888, and that on March 2,1888, an ordinance was passed vacating Wayne street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">At the close of the testimony, the court, Slow\u00ae, P. J., charged \u2022 the jury in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">The simple question you have to determine is, how much was this property damaged, if at all, by the location and opening of this street through the land of the plaintiff ?.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">[There is but one question that plaintiff\u2019s counsel and I differ upon, so far as I see, and of course you must follow my suggestion, as counsel says ; and that is the effect of the vacation of Wayne street. It was not vacated until after this other street was laid out, and we are to assess this damage as at the time it was laid out and opened. But you are to treat it as though it had been vacated; and it was in fact, I understand, vacated within twenty-four hours, or a day or two after the other street was laid out, but you take it as though it was vacated contemporaneously with the laying'out of that street. Then Wayne street, as it went through Mrs. Sargeant\u2019s property, vested in her; and it would seem to me to be out of all character to give her that street and then give her the value of it too. It must be taken, then, as though the street was vacated and did not exist, at the time the other street was laid out.] 3 . . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel request the court to charge :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">1. In determining the question whether the plaintiff is damaged by Negley Avenue, the jury should determine it as of the date when Negley Avenue was actually located and opened, and any pretended vacation of Wayne street afterwards should not be allowed to affect their verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">Answer: Refused.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">\u2014The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant.

This land is crossed by a street laid out many years ago, on what was then known as the East Liberty plan, which has not been opened. The possession of the plaintiff has never been disturbed by the city, and the street known as Wayne street exists only on paper. The progress of improvements has brought the neighborhood of the plaintiff\u2019s land into demand for building purposes, and an avenue known as Negley Avenue has been so laid out and opened as to give the plaintiff a front of five hundred and fifty feet thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">This case was begun by a proceeding for the purpose of assessing the damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the opening of Negley Avenue. She asked that these should be assessed as if Wayne street had been actually opened on its recorded site, alleging that if opened it would cross her land at such an angle that, with Negley Avenue opened, it would seriously affect the value of her lots. The counsel for the city replied that Wayne street had been vacated since Negley Avenue was opened, and gave evidence to show that fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked the court to instruct the jury that her damages should be assessed as of the time when the avenue was actually opened, and that circumstances occurring since should not^be considered by them in settling the amount. This, the court declined to do, but, on the other hand, instructed them that they should assess the damages, \u201c as though it (Wayne street) was vacated contemporaneously with the laying out of that (Negley) street.\u201d To make this perfectly plain, he proceeded to say: \u201c It must be taken, then, as though the street was vacated and did not exist, at the time the other (Negley) street was laid out; \u201d notwithstanding the admitted fact that it was not vacated, and that it did exist upon the maps as a street regularly laid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We think the proposition embodied in the point was correct, and the answer of the court was wrong, yet the result reached was exactly right. The learned judge might have told the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s point was good law, but that it did not justify them in considering the effect upon her property of any unopened street. Damages are assessed upon the opening, not upon the laying out of streets. Negley Avenue was opened, and the question was, how has the opening of that thoroughfare affected the plaintiff? If Wayne street shall be opened at any time hereafter, a similar question will then be raised as to the effect of such opening. Then the jury will take into consideration the situation of Negley Avenue, its direction through the plaintiff\u2019s land, * and how lots may be best laid out upon it. They will consider how the opening of Wayne street will affect these lots as to size and shape and desirability, and if it reduces their value, the damages will then be assessed. They ought not to be assessed twice. The court below was quite right, therefore, in confining the attention of the jury at this time to the effect of the opening of Negley Avenue, not because Wayne street had been vacated, but because it had not been opened. The direction was right; the reason was wrong. We ought not, therefore, to disturb this judgment, since, if the right reason had been given, the result would necessarily have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
