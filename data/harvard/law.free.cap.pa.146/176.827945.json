B. Duvall, who accepted the duties of the trust and had never been finally discharged therefrom ; that the said A. B. Duvall and the other devisees took possession of the real estate devised to them, and were still the owners thereof; that said A. B. Duvall had settled an account to No. 2 May Term 1867, A. A., whereby it appeared he had paid to Mary Duvall, Eliza Hannen, Ruth Garrett, Nancy Robinson and Sarah How, the legacies bequeathed to them, but he had neglected and refused to pay the petitioner, who had become of age on April 2, 1872, the legacy of eight hundred dollars bequeathed to her, or any part thereof; praying the court to cause due notice to be given to said A. B. Duvall, executor, and to A. B. Duvall, Nancy Robinson and Mary Duvall, devisees, and to other persons interested, if any, and thereupon proceed according to equity to make such decree or order touching the payment of said legacy, with interest, as might be requisite and just, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-8\">An answer having been filed, the cause was set down for hearing on bill and answer. After argument, the court, Mc-Ilvaine, P. J., on December 80,1890, filed an opinion in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\">Betters testamentary were issued to Alexander B. Duvall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>his son, who settled his only and final account, which was duly confirmed by this court on the-day of May, 1867. Mary Duvall, wife of the testator, died before he did. Abigail Graves became twenty-one years of age on the second day of April, 1872. From 1866, to the time when she arrived at her majority, she had for her guardian Amor Jeffries, who settled his guardianship account in this court to No. 11 August Term 1872, A. A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">The legacy bequeathed to Abigail Graves by her grandfather has never been paid. She now seeks by this proceeding to enforce its payment. The case, by agreement of the parties comes before us on bill and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">The contention is, that the petitioner is entitled to a decree, first, because the legacy \u201c is charged upon and payable out of the realty, and is recoverable under the act of February 24, 1834, \u00a7 59; \u201d second, because \u201c A. B. Duvall having elected to take as devisee and to act as executor, and having taken charge of the whole estate, is a trustee thereof for the legatees and is answerable to the Orphans\u2019 Court under the act of February 24, 1834, \u00a7 47.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">The first question for our determination is, did the testator intend to charge the payment of this legacy upon his real estate ? A cardinal rule of construction is \u201c that the real estate is never to be charged with the payment of legacies, unless the intention of the testator so\u2018to charge it, is either expressly declared, or fairly and satisfactorily to be inferred from the language of the will; \u201d and \u201cthe intent of the testator is to be gathered from the four corners of the will, taken as a whole.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-10\">There can be no possible claim in the case before us that the testator in express terms charged the payment of his granddaughter\u2019s legacy upon the real estate. Her legacy is a general pecuniary legacy. His real estate, which consisted of three pieces, was unconditionally and specifically devised to the respondents in this proceeding. Neither do we think, taking the whole will together, that there is the slightest intimation, on its face, that the testator intended this legacy to be paid out of the real estate. But it is contended that facts outside the will show that the testator intended to exempt the personal estate and that by implication the real estate is charged. We have been cited to a number of obiter dicta in support of this position.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>It is true that a court can in the case of many wills more satisfactorily construe them, if it is \u201c fully advised of the circumstances under which the will was made, as to the state of the testator\u2019s property, family and the like; \u201d but, being advised of these facts does not empower the court to change the testator\u2019s will, or to make a new will for him, in order to relieve a legatee from the hardship of losing her legacy in case of an insufficiency of the personal estate. These circumstances can only be resorted to in aid of a proper interpretation, where on the face of the will it might be doubtful. After all, the intention must be discoverable in the will. In the case of Okeson\u2019s App., 59 Pa. 100, Justice Shabswood says : \u201c It is certainly true that no particular language is necessary to create such a charge. The intention of the testator is to be carried out wherever it is discoverable from anything contained in the instrument. But there must be something from which it can be inferred.\u201d In a case where the testator owned no personal estate, at the time he made his will, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia, in holding that his real estate was not charged with the payment of general pecuniary legacies, said: \u201c While the intention to charge lands with the payment of legacies need not be declared in express terms, it. must be disclosed by the will itself, and cannot be inferred from the mere fact that at the time of its execution the testator owned no personal estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">In the case at bar, it is claimed that the inventory filed in the estate of the testator shows that his entire personal estate, all of which was bequeathed to his daughter Mary, amounted to only $789.85, while the money legacies bequeathed in his will amount to $3,203. The petitioner alleges that all the personal property which the testator had when he made his will, was what was afterwards included in the inventory, and that therefore it follows that the testator when he made his will intended to exempt bis personal estate from the payment of these general legacies. There is nothing on the face of the will to support this position.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">The language: \u201c all the personal property that may be on the premises (where I reside) at the time of my decease, stock, household goods and every article of <em>property </em>that may be on the premises to me belonging,\u201d does not indicate that the testator intended in this bequest to include all his personal estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>On the contrary, it clearly indicates that when he made his will he had personal property elsewhere and of a different kind. He had another farm that, according to the answer, was let at a rental of two hundred dollars per year, and he may have had moneys owing him from those whom he then considered solvent debtors, and who afterwards became insolvent and whose indebtedness was not included in the inventory filed. The simple allegation of the petitioner, who was only eight or nine years of age when her grandfather made his will, unsupported by proof, is not sufficient to establish the fact that he had, outside of his real estate specifically devised, only an estate of $789.85, when his will was executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">Again; if we look at the terms of the will wherein the real estate is devised, we find that the three specific devises are in substantially the same language ; and if- any part of the testator\u2019s real estate is charged with the payment of the general legacies, it is all charged. But, in the case of Nancy Robinson he coupled with the devise this language: \u201c Also, I bequeath to her and her heirs the sum of two hundred dollars in money to build a house on the same.\u201d Why did he give her two hundred dollars in money to improve her real estate, if he intended it should be charged with its share of the general legacies before bequeathed ? Why did he give Mary Duvall, his daughter, the specific legacy of all the personal property on the real estate specifically devised to her, if he intended it to be charged with the general legacies ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">The fact that the testator, after giving certain sums of money to certain of his children, specifically and unconditionally devised his real estate to others of his children, and specifically bequeathed certain personal property to one of the devisees and gave another two hundred dollars to improve her real estate, leads to the inevitable conclusion that the testator when he made his will knew or thought that he had other personal property, moneys, or credits to meet the demands of his will outside the specific devises and legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">But it is claimed that, even if these general legacies were not a charge on the land, Alexander Duvall, the executor, should be adjudged to pay the petitioner\u2019s legacy. This position is untenable. In the first place, a proceeding against the executor as a delinquent trustee cannot be joined with a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ceeding against the devisees to collect a legacy charged on real estate. But, independent of this, there is nothing in this will to indicate that the testator intended that the executor, Alexander Duvall, was to pay these general legacies if he accepted the real estate devised to him. His devise is not in the shape of a residue, nor is it blended with personal estate. Accepting what the will gave him, in no way bound him personally, or as executor, to pay the legacies bequeathed to other beneficiaries under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">The fact that Alexander Duvall, after being advised by his counsel that he was not liable for the payment of these general legacies, out of the goodness of his heart paid them all but the petitioner, does not make him liable in this proceeding. He must be allowed to regulate and place a limit upon his own generosity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\">On the whole case, we are of opinion,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-8\">1. [That the petitioner\u2019s legacy is not a charge upon the testator\u2019s real estate devised to the respondents.] 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">2. [That Alexander Duvall is not liable personally, or in virtue of his office as executor, for the payment of the petitioner\u2019s legacy, no assets from the personal estate having come into his hands which could be applied to that purpose.] 8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-10\">3. [And that this court has jurisdiction in this proceeding only in the event that the petitioner\u2019s legacy is a charge on the land.] 3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-11\">And now, December 30, 1890, this cause came on to be heard upon the amended petition and answer thereto, and after hearing the parties, upon due consideration it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the prayer of the petitioner be refused and the petition dismissed at the cost of the petitioner; exception.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-12\">\u2014Thereupon, the petitioner took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-13\">1-3.

That the legacy is a charge on testator\u2019s real estate devised to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">2. That her uncle Alexander Duvall, one of the appellees, is liable either personally, or by virtue of his office as executor of his father\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In an opinion, reciting all the facts and fully considering the questions presented, the Orphans\u2019 Court held that appellant\u2019s legacy is not and never was a lien on the land; that Alexander Duvall neither expressly nor impliedly assumed payment of the lagacy; nor is he liable therefor by virtue of his office as executor, because no assets applicable to the payment thereof ever came into his hands; and hence this proceeding cannot be sustained. An examination of the record has satisfied us that the court was right in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As a general rule, \u201c the personal estate is not only the primary, but prima facie the exclusive fund for the payment of legacies, and this conclusion cannot be repelled by showing that the testator had no personal estate when the will was executed, and must therefore have intended that the legacies should come out o\u00a3 the real estate.' \u2022 Where one dies without leaving sufficient personal estate for the payment of his bequests, they are adeemed wholly or pro tanto, unless there is something more than the mere gift of the bequest to denote an intention that it should be paid out of the land: \u201d Aldrich v. Cooper, 2 W. &amp; T. Lead. Cas. in Eq. 346. \u201c While the intention to charge lands with the payment of legacies need not be declared in express terms, it must be disclosed by the will itself, and cannot be inferred from the mere fact that, at the time of its execution, the testator owned no personal estate; non constat that he may not do so at a subsequent date: \u201d Haddock\u2019s Est., 18 W. N. 243. The intention of the testator to create a charge on real .estate is to be carried out whenever it is discoverable from anything contained in his will, but there must be something on the face of the instrument from which it can be inferred: Okeson\u2019s App., 59 Pa. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u25a0 There is not the slightest intimation, in any part of the will before us, that the testator intended the legacy in question to be paid out of his real estate. On the contrary, the indications are all the other way. The bequest to appellant is a general pecuniary legacy, \u201c to be paid when she is twenty-one years of age.\u201d Testator\u2019s real estate, consisting of three pieces, is unconditionally and specifically devised to his son Alexander and two of his daughters, respectively. This case is clearly distinguishable from Clery\u2019s App., 35 Pa. 54. In that case the intention to charge the realty was shown, not only in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>strongly implied exoneration of the personalty, but in the fact that tbe legacies became payable only on the termination of the life-estate of the testator\u2019s widow, to whom the personal property was bequeathed absolutely; and in the further fact that the testator specifically directed the \u201c overseers \u201d of his will to \u201csee that all the above legacies are paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The proposition that a devisee of land who acts as executor of the will, must either refuse to aecept\u2019the unconditional devise, or render himself liable to pay pecuniary legacies, is wholly untenable. It does not appear that Alexander Duvall, either as executor of his father's will or in his individual capacity, did or omitted to do anything that should render him liable to payment of the legacy in question. The questions presented in this case are so fully considered and satisfactorily disposed of in the opinion of the Orphans\u2019 Court that further comment is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
