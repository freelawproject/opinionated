Those judgments declared that the school committee violated G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in transferring Powers from his position as a regional high school assistant principal to that of a middle school assistant principal, that the school committee violated G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ing an inappropriate executive session, and ordered that Powers be reinstated in his former position. We transferred this matter on our own motion, and we affirm the judgments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>Powers was assistant principal of the Apponequet Regional High School from 1977 through 1982. In 1981, the school committee began formulating revisions in its operating plans in response to St. 1980, c. 580 (Proposition <em>2Vt). </em>In July, 1982, the superintendent of schools approached Powers and a middle school assistant principal concerning their willingness to exchange positions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Powers was not receptive to this proposal. The superintendent confirmed by letter his intention to effectuate the exchange; Powers informed him that he considered the transfer involuntary and that he wished to address the school committee. Further correspondence from Powers\u2019 counsel informed the superintendent and the school committee that Powers considered the move to be a demotion and demanded due process. The school committee took the position that no demotion had occurred, but informed Powers he might be heard at an early August school committee meeting. Powers requested a statement of the charges against him several days prior to the school committee meeting. That meeting was postponed until late September. In the interim, the superintendent informed Powers that no charges existed against him but that he would be furnished a statement of reasons for the transfer and be permitted to speak at the upcoming school committee meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Powers attended the September meeting, at which he received a memorandum of the reasons for the transfer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He addressed the school committee. At an October meeting, the school committee went into executive session and received legal advice concerning the possibility of litigation by Powers. The school committee voted to approve the transfer the following week. Powers was ordered to assume his new position immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>2. <em>Proceedings below. </em>The trial judge compared the differences between the high school and the middle school assistant principals\u2019 responsibilities, taking into consideration eleven functions. He found that a transfer would change Powers\u2019 duties. He observed that fellow professionals would perceive the transfer to be a demotion which would cloud Powers\u2019 future employment prospects, notwithstanding satisfactory explanations for the move. The judge concluded that the transfer was a demotion. Further, he concluded that the protections of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A, applied to Powers. As no formal statement of charges had been presented to Powers, the trial judge declared that the transfer had been made in violation of the statute, and ordered that Powers be reinstated in his previous position.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The trial judge declared the executive session of the school committee illegal, as violative of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. Where no \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cimminently threatened\u201d litigation was involved, the judge ruled that the litigation strategy exception to the open meeting law was not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">3. <em>Issues presented for review.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The school committee argues that the ruling concerning \u201cdemotion\u201d was incorrect; that G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A, does not apply; that even if a demotion occurred substantial due process was accorded Powers; and that Powers\u2019 hearing before the school committee substantiates invocation of the litigation strategy exception to G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">4. <em>The determination that a demotion had occurred. </em>In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding demotion, we are confined to examining whether the findings were clearly ^erroneous or the conclusions inconsistent with statutory norms. <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 508 (1976). The school committee argues that neither the evidence of \u201cchange\u201d nor the evidence of perceived demotion are adequate to support the conclusion concerning demotion. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>agree. Although certain acts are deemed to be demotions within G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A, an exclusive definition has not been supplied by the Legislature, nor has the case law exhausted this issue. <em>Glennon </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, </em>375 Mass. 757, 762-766 (1978). <em>Glennon </em>suggests that an appropriate standard for determining \u201cdemotion\u201d is whether \u201csubstantial changes\u201d in administrative duties are wrought by a change in position. <em>Id. </em>at 765. The omission of the word \u201csubstantial\u201d from the trial judge\u2019s finding regarding the change cannot affect the result where eleven functions were closely scrutinized. Further, there is no error in the trial judge\u2019s consideration of how Powers\u2019 peers and potential employers would perceive the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">5. <em>Compliance with G.L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A. </em>Having determined that a demotion existed, the trial judge examined the necessity for compliance with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A. That section provides that no demotion may be made except for \u201cinefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct, insubordination, or other good cause.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Applying the principle of ejusdem generis, the judge reasoned that \u201cother good cause\u201d is limited to other circumstances involving unsatisfactory performance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The school committee argues that \u201cother good cause\u201d includes \u201cother good reason\u201d unrelated to bad conduct. Assuming, without deciding, that the school committee\u2019s more expansive reading is correct, its argument must fail as the argument does nothing to relieve the school committee of compliance with the statute\u2019s procedural protections. Even if a demotion can be necessitated by a system-wide reorganization, the procedural requirements of the statute are not automatically circumvented. Cases concerning school closings and the resulting elimination of posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tians are inapposite here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This case concerns an exchange of positions between a high school and a middle school administrator to foster certain educational objectives.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The nature of those objectives, coupled with other reorganizational plans, indicates that this is not a case in which the procedural protections of \u00a7 42A can be dispensed with. We deal here with an individual situation, not a systemic reorganization.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">6. <em>Adequacy of procedural due </em>process. The school committee argues that even if this court upholds, and we do, the trial judge\u2019s conclusions concerning demotion and compliance with G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A, the school committee may be exonerated because it accorded Powers adequate procedural due process. We cannot agree. The judge found that no written charges were given to Powers, thereby rejecting the school committee\u2019s contention that the memorandum of \u201creasons\u201d was sufficient. Under the circumstances, we cannot say this was error. We are not here faced with any concept of flexible due process, but with specific and concrete statutory language. We note that the record reflects a most haphazard attempt to conform the facts of Powers\u2019 transfer with the temporal requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u00a7 42A. The measures employed here included several volleys of correspondence and a shuffling of meeting schedules; this falls short of the statutory requirements. We perceive no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion, and leave to another day discussion of whether a statement of \u201creasons\u201d as opposed to \u201ccharges\u201d might be sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 42A if all other requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 42A, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo principal, supervisor, assistant principal, or professional employee performing the duties of a principal, supervisor, assistant principal, by whatever title his position may be known, who has served in that position for over three years shall without his consent be demoted except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct, insubordination or other good cause; nor unless, at least thirty days, exclusive of customary vacation periods, prior to the meeting at which the vote is to be taken, he shall have been notified of such intended vote; nor unless, if he so requests, he shall have been furnished by the committee with a written charge or charges of the cause or causes for which his demotion is proposed; nor unless, if he so requests, he has been given a hearing before the school committee, which may be either public or private at the discretion of the school committee, and at which he may be represented by counsel, present evidence and call witnesses to testify in his behalf and examine them; nor unless the charge or charges shall have been substantiated; nor unless the superintendent shall have given the committee his recommendations thereon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\">General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23B, provides in relevant part: \u201cAll meetings of a governmental body shall be open to the public and any person shall be permitted to attend any meeting except as otherwise provided by this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">it \u201cNo executive session shall be held . . .
