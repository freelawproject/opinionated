The plaintiffs\u2019 action against International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was commenced in the Superior Court in Middlesex County in February, 1980.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> IBM filed a petition for removal to the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts, claiming diversity of citizenship, and the case was removed to that court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The defendants moved in Federal court for summary judgment on all counts of Bratt\u2019s amended complaint. In November, 1982, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted the motions for summary judgment, and Bratt appealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following oral argument by the parties, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit certified the questions of law to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We conclude as follows with respect to the libel law questions. For a defendant in a libel case to lose a conditional privilege to publish defamatory material by \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication,\u201d <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R.R., </em>341 Mass. 293, 297-298 (1960), the plaintiff must prove that the defendant published the defamatory information recklessly. An employer has a conditional privilege to disclose defamatory information concerning an employee when the publication is reasonably necessary to serve the employer\u2019s legitimate interest in the fitness of an employee to perform his or her job. A conditional privilege may be lost by abuse; the same standard for abuse through excessive publication applies when the defamatory material is medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">We also conclude, concerning the invasion of privacy claim under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, that the disclosure of private facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>about an employee through an intracorporate communication is sufficient publication to impair an employee\u2019s right of privacy. We further conclude that no conditional privilege exists for legitimate business communications under \u00a7 IB. However, in evaluating whether an employer\u2019s disclosure of personal information concerning an employee constitutes an unreasonable interference with the privacy right, we would balance the employer\u2019s legitimate business interest in disseminating the information against the nature and substantiality of the intrusion. Finally, we would use the same balancing test if the information disclosed about an employee is medical information. A physician retained by the employer may disclose to the employer medical information concerning an employee if receipt of the information is reasonably necessary to serve a substantial and valid business interest of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We summarize the facts as they have been presented to us in the certification memorandum of the Court of Appeals. Bratt has been an employee of IBM since 1970 and is presently employed by the company. Bratt experienced several problems in his employment during the years 1971 through 1978. To seek resolution of these difficulties, Bratt utilized IBM\u2019s \u201copen door policy,\u201d an internal grievance procedure which enables employees to confront higher management with their complaints should their immediate supervisors fail to resolve the problems.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Bratt used the open door procedure approximately four times from 1971 through 1978, to complain of not receiving promotions and salary raises that were promised him or that he believed he deserved. Bratt also utilized the open door procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to complain about an evaluation of his work, which was less than he thought merited. As a result, he came to deal with the defendant Wesley Liebtag, director of personnel programs for IBM in Armonk, New York. Although Liebtag told Bratt at their first discussion that the offensive work rating would be destroyed, this did not occur until Bratt went to see Liebtag a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Bratt again utilized the open door procedure when he discovered that copies of suggestions that he had made for improving certain internal company practices were missing from his files. Bratt was informed that such suggestions had not been implemented. He was troubled that these proposals, as well as his work in general, were not appreciated. Bratt again confronted Liebtag, who told Bratt that any suggestions that he made were part of his job, and he should not be seeking personal recognition for such proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">After the unsuccessful meeting with Liebtag, Bratt told his supervisor that he was suffering from \u201cbad nerves,\u201d headaches, and an inability to sleep. At the supervisor\u2019s suggestion, Bratt consulted with the defendant Dr. Nugent, a general practitioner retained by IBM. Following a routine physical examination, Dr. Nugent called Bratt\u2019s supervisor and expressed her opinion that Bratt was paranoid and should see a psychiatrist immediately. Bratt\u2019s supervisor relayed this information to her supervisor who, in turn, disclosed this to Liebtag. Liebtag made a memorandum for his file, summarizing the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Subsequently, Bratt\u2019s latest open door grievance was denied. Bratt was so informed. One of his supervisors then called Liebtag to relay Bratt\u2019s reaction. Liebtag summarized this conversation with the supervisor and his own impressions of Bratt\u2019s behavior in a memorandum which he forwarded to two IBM managerial supervisors. The memorandum stated that Bratt went into his supervisor\u2019s office with the letter denying his latest grievance. The supervisor observed that Bratt was distraught and crying. The supervisor made an appointment for Bratt with a psychiatrist. Liebtag wrote that this latest episode indicated that Bratt appeared to have a mental problem that went beyond IBM. He concluded that the corporate medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>director should communicate with Bratt\u2019s psychiatrist in order to obtain, within the company, an expert appraisal of Bratt\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Although Liebtag averred in his affidavit that only two managerial supervisors received copies of this memorandum, Bratt contends that approximately sixteen people within IBM learned about his condition. Bratt also disputes the accuracy of his diagnosis as paranoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The manager\u2019s manual used by IBM provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[p]rior approval of the employee . .. will be obtained before either disclosing or seeking confidential medical information, except in an emergency or where such disclosure is required by law.\u201d The manual also provides that confidential medical information will not be provided to \u201cmanagers or Personnel\u201d without an employee\u2019s prior consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Bratt\u2019s libel claim is based on Liebtag\u2019s distribution of the memoranda that he made concerning Bratt\u2019s mental condition. Bratt\u2019s claim for invasion of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, is premised on two grounds. First, that IBM violated Bratt\u2019s right of privacy by disclosing information about his use of the open door policy to personnel who should not have received this information. Second, that there was an improper disclosure of Dr. Nugent\u2019s description of Bratt as paranoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">1. <em>Libel claim, </em>a. <em>Questions 1 and </em>2<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(defendants\u2019 conditional privilege and the standard for abuse of the privilege). </em>Massachusetts courts have recognized that a person may possess a conditional privilege to publish defamatory material if the publication is reasonably necessary to the protection or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>furtherance of a legitimate business interest. <em>See Retailers Commercial Agency, Inc., petitioner, </em>342 Mass. 515, 520 (1961); <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R.R., </em>341 Mass. 293, 296 (I960).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 594 comment f, at 266 (1977) (conditional privilege in making defamatory statements exists where publisher has lawful pecuniary interest in making the publication); comment e, at 265 (in determining whether an interest not given direct legal protection warrants protection by conditional privilege, courts should weigh publisher\u2019s interest in the defamatory matter, should it be true, against harm to plaintiff\u2019s reputation by disclosure of false information).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R.R., supra, </em>we recognized that an employer has a conditional privilege to use defamatory language to ascertain the identity of a person who allegedly stole goods from the business. We decided, however, that loud and repeated public accusations concerning the plaintiff constituted an abuse of the conditional privilege \u201cby an unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication of the defamatory matter.\u201d Proof of \u201cactual malice\u201d was not a prerequisite to loss of the privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We did not specifically state in the <em>Galvin </em>case whether negligence or recklessness was the threshold standard for determining whether a conditional privilege was lost by publication of defamatory matter. However, our description of the misconduct in <em>Galvin </em>as unreasonable or excessive, as well as something less than \u201cactual malice,\u201d appears to favor recklessness or \u201cmalice in fact\u201d as the standard. See also <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>220 Mass. 171, 176 (1915) (conditional privilege in defamation action lost by proof of \u201cmalice in fact\u201d; proof of \u201cmalice in fact\u201d can be made in a number of ways).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Massachusetts case law and the Restatement of Torts support the view that recklessness should be the minimum level of misconduct which results in loss of a conditional privilege. In <em>Retailers Commercial Agency, Inc., petitioner, supra, </em>we stated that a mercantile agency possesses a conditional privilege in communicating credit information to a client, since these agencies fulfil a legitimate business need. We stated also that an agency can abuse the privilege and become liable for transmitting defamatory credit information if the plaintiff proves that the communication was motivated by malice or was an unnecessary, unreasonable, or excessive publication. Further interpreting this rule, we stated that \u201c[mjalice in uttering false statements may consist either in a direct intention to injure another, or in a reckless disregard of his rights and of the consequences that may result to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, quoting <em>Gott </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>122 Mass. 235, 239 (1877). We also rejected the view that mere negligence would destroy the privilege: \u201cThis view . . . would place undue limitations on communications which the law seeks to protect. \u201d <em>Retailers Commercial Agency, Inc., petitioner, supra </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Our cases have recognized that a conditional privilege may be abused, and lost, in a number of ways. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 599 comment a, at 286 (1977). In <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>386 Mass. 721, 726 (1982), we stated: \u201cOne manner of such abuse is publication with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard of the truth.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>326 Mass. 185, 192 (1950), we stated: \u201cThe rule long established by this court is \u2018that an occasion which would justify such a communication may be abused in such a manner as to deprive the party making it of the excuse of privilege. . . . The jury may . . . [find for the plaintiff] from proof that the defendant knew the charges to be false, or had no reason to believe them to be true [and] also from the terms in which the communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tian is made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Atwill </em>v. <em>Mackintosh, </em>120 Mass. 177, 183 (1876).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Ezekiel </em>v. <em>Jones Motor Co., </em>374 Mass. 382, 390-391 (1978) (defendant employer could lose privilege of communicating reasons for plaintiff\u2019s discharge to union grievance board if statements made out of actual malice or reckless disregard for plaintiff\u2019s rights). The policy reasons behind the recognition of a conditional privilege impel us to conclude that whatever the manner of abuse, recklessness, at least, should be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We therefore conclude that loss of a defendant\u2019s conditional privilege in a defamation action through \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication\u201d requires proof that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>defendant acted recklessly. Accordingly, we answer the first question, \u201cYes.\u201d To the second question we respond, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">b. <em>Question </em>3<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(conditional privilege where medical information published; standard for abuse of the privilege). </em>Massachusetts case law has not determined the issue whether the same standard for abuse of the conditional privilege would apply to a defendant employer when the defamatory material \u00a1 published is medical information. Precedents in other jurisdic- i tians, as well as treatise authority, persuade us that the same standard should be used. Several courts have recognized that I \u201c[e]mployers . . . have a legitimate need ... to determine 1 whether or not their employees are professionally, physi- I cally, and psychologically capable of performing their duties.\u201d <em>Hoesl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 F. Supp. 1170, 1176 (N.D. Cal. 1978), aff\u2019d 629 F.2d 586 (9th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>72 Ga. App. 458, 461 (1945). It appears equally settled that \u201ca communication re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>specting the character of an employee ... is qualifiedly privileged if made in good faith by a person having a duty in the premises to one who has a definite interest therein. \u201d <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>150 Fla. 503, 505 (1942), quoting 33 Am. Jur. Libel \u00a7 173, at 168 (1941). See <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Grew, </em>220 Mass. 171, 177-178 (1915) (person discussing character and capabilities of former servant with prospective employer has qualified privilege); <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Tobin, supra </em>at 190-191 (conditional privilege exists where publisher and recipient have common interest and communication reasonably calculated to further that interest). Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 596, at 274-276 (1977) (same). Thus, courts have considered as conditionally privileged disclosures by employers of defamatory medical information concerning employees which is relevant to the employees\u2019 fitness to perform their work. See <em>Hoesl </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1176; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 505, 509; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra. </em>We accept the principle that an employer can lose this privilege only if the plaintiff proves that the disclosure resulted from an expressly malicious motive, was recklessly disseminated, or involved a reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Thus, our answer to question 3 is, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">2. <em>Breach of privacy claim, </em>a. <em>Question </em>I<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(intracorporate communications and the right of privacy). </em>General Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>c. 214, \u00a71B, inserted by St. 1974, c. 193, \u00a7 1, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d This court has interpreted \u00a7 IB to proscribe the required disclosure of facts about an individual that are of a highly personal or intimate nature when there exists no legitimate, countervailing interest. See, e.g., <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 307-308 (1982); <em>id. </em>at 312 (Abrams, J., concurring) (reasonableness of requiring employee to disclose personal facts must be weighed against employer\u2019s valid business interests). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiseman, </em>356 Mass. 251, 261-262 (1969) (prohibiting general public viewing of film depicting State mental patients to protect patients\u2019 privacy, yet allowing film to be shown in medical, academic, and legal settings, since public interest in improving State institutional facilities outweighs privacy interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Although we have never decided directly whether an intracorporate communication amounts to a sufficient publication under \u00a7 IB, our dicta in privacy cases and our decision on this issue in a libel case prove instructive. In <em>Bander v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 337, 348 (1943), we decided that a defamatory communication between agents of the same corporation, with reference to some aspect of corporate business, constitutes a publication for purposes of maintaining a libel action. Accord <em>Arsenault </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>485 F. Supp. 1373, 1379 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d, 636 F.2d 1199 (1st Cir. 1980), cert, denied, 454 U.S. 821 (1981). Cf. <em>Riceman </em>v. <em>Union Indem. Co., </em>278 Mass. 149, 151-152 (1932) (defendant surety company\u2019s transmittal of defamatory material in letter sent to different division of company sufficient to sustain allegation of publication). In <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., supra, </em>we indicated that to require intracorporate disclosure from employees of unreasonably intrusive, personal information in response to an employer\u2019s questionnaire would constitute a violation of the principles of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. <em>Id. </em>at 306-307, 308 n.9. Although no \u00a7 IB action could be maintained in the <em>Cort </em>case because questions asked were not inappropriate, and, possibly because the employees refused to answer, or gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>frivolous responses to, certain questions, we acknowledged that a factual situation could exist where an intracorporate disclosure of intrusive facts would give rise to an invasion of privacy claim. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 310. Cf. <em>Brodericks. Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 44 (1975), cert, denied, 423 U.S. 1048 (1976) (answering police commissioner\u2019s questionnaire regarding alleged misconduct would not infringe police officers\u2019 privacy rights because officers relinquished these rights by publicly engaging in conduct under investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We conclude that the disclosure of private facts about an employee among other employees in the same corporation can constitute sufficient publication under the Massachusetts right of privacy statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Thus, we answer question 1, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9OW\">b. <em>Questions 2 and </em>3<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>(legitimate business communications balanced against right of privacy). </em>Massachusetts case law does not recognize a conditional privilege, as such, for legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>mate business communications under the right of privacy statute. We have concluded previously, however, that because \u00a7 IB proscribes only unreasonable interferences with a person\u2019s privacy, legitimate countervailing business interests in certain situations may render the disclosure of personal information reasonable and not actionable under the statute. See, e.g., <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., supra </em>at 308, 310; <em>id. </em>at 312 (Abrams, J., concurring); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiseman, supra </em>at 262. Cf. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812, 817-818 (1978) (even if payroll records of municipal employees considered highly personal information, their disclosure, under public records statute, not unreasonable, given paramount right of public to know salaries of public servants).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We acknowledged in <em>Cort, </em>however, that \u201cin the area of private employment there may be inquiries of a personal nature that are unreasonably intrusive and no business of the employer and that an employee may not be discharged with impunity for failure to answer such requests.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 308 n.9. In evaluating whether the information sought from employees could amount to an unreasonable interference with their right of privacy, we stated that the employer\u2019s legitimate interest in determining the employees\u2019 effectiveness in their jobs should be balanced against the seriousness of the intrusion on the employees\u2019 privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 308. Cf. <em>Cefalu </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>8- Mass. App. Ct. 71, 77 (1979) (right of privacy based on concept that certain conduct of individual is personal and confidential, and of no concern to public). An employer thus may seek certain personal information concerning an employee when the importance of the information in assessing the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ployee\u2019s efficacy in his work outweighs the employee\u2019s right to keep this information private.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In response to question 2, we conclude that no conditional privilege for legitimate business communications exists under the Massachusetts right of privacy statute. However, an employer\u2019s obtaining and disclosing of personal information concerning an employee may not amount to an unreasonable interference with the employee\u2019s right of privacy in violation of \u00a7 IB. In determining whether there is a violation of \u00a7 IB, it is necessary to balance the employer\u2019s legitimate business interest in obtaining and publishing the information against the substantiality of the intrusion on the employee\u2019s privacy resulting from the disclosure.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Therefore, we answer question 2, \u201cNo,\u201d with qualifications.

However, we would balance an employer\u2019s valid business interest with the employee\u2019s right to privacy in determining whether disclosure of private facts about an employee resulted in an actionable invasion of privacy. We would adhere to the same balancing test when medical information about an employee is disclosed by an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We recognize a patient\u2019s valid interest in preserving the confidentiality of medical facts relayed to a physician.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Hannaway </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>2 Mass.

See, e.g., <em>Hague </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>(where patient\u2019s physical con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>dition made basis of a legal claim, physician\u2019s extrajudicial disclosure warranted so as to ensure just result). <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>291 Ala. 701, 708-709 (1973) (physician\u2019s duty not to make extrajudicial disclosures of medical data concerning plaintiff subject to exceptions where public interest or interests of patient warrant disclosure); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Geraci, </em>29 Misc. 2d 791, 793-794 (N.Y.

As we already noted, an employer may have a substantial and valid interest in aspects of an employee\u2019s health that could affect the employee\u2019s ability effectively to perform job duties. See, e.g., <em>Pitcher </em>v. <em>Iberia Parish School Bd., </em>280 So. 2d 603, 608 (La. Ct. App. 1973) (school board could require teachers to provide annual certification by physician of their fitness to teach); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Geraci, supra </em>at 793 (government employer may have valid interest in medical facts concerning employee which affect his capacity to do his job). In response to question 4, we conclude that when medical information is necessary reasonably to serve such a substantial and valid interest of the employer, it is not an invasion of privacy, under \u00a7 IB, for a physician to disclose such information to the employer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\"> The initial complaint by Bratt alleged actions for intentional infliction of emotional distress against IBM, and a claim by Carol Lee Bratt, Bratt\u2019s wife, for loss of her husband\u2019s consortium. Bratt was granted his motions for leave to file amended pleadings in December, 1981, at which time he added the claims of libel and invasion of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b525-12\"> Subsequently, Bratt successfully moved to add as defendants Wesley R. Liebtag, an employee of IBM, and Dr. Martha Nugent, an agent of IBM. Bratt also was granted a motion to add another count to his complaint which was based on Nugent\u2019s alleged publication of Bratt\u2019s confidential medical information, without his authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b525-13\"> The judge also had denied Bratt\u2019s motion to file a fourth amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The IBM manager\u2019s manual describes the open door procedure, in part, as follows: \u201cAny employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to that employee\u2019s satisfaction by his or her immediate manager may bring the complaint or concern to the attention of higher management. . . . While the employee will normally choose to address an appeal first at the local level, the Open Door procedure makes available to an employee either direct or progressive access to any level of management in the Corporation. . . . Management should be sensitive to assure that no action is taken which may appear to be retaliation for an employee\u2019s appeal under the Open Door Policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> Questions 1 and 2, certified by the Court of Appeals, are as follows: \u201c1. In the case of a libel claim, when defendant has a conditional privilege, does loss of that privilege through \u2018unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication,\u2019 <em>see Galvin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>[N.H. &amp; H.R.R.] 341 Mass. 293, 297-[2]98 (1960), require more than ordinary negligence? 2. If so, does abuse of the privilege through such publication result from something less than recklessness?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Bratt contends that a conditional privilege may be lost through \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication,\u201d on a showing that the defendants negligently published the information. The defendants claim that the privilege can be defeated only by a showing of at least recklessness in publishing the material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">This court also has recognized that there is a qualified, or conditional, privilege \u201cwhere the publisher and the recipient have a common interest, and the communication is of a kind reasonably calculated to protect or further it.\u201d See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>326 Mass. 185, 190-191 (1950). Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 596, at 274-276 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\"> One type of \u201cmalice in fact\u201d described in <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Grew, supra, </em>was \u201cthe wilful doing of an injurious act without lawful excuse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b530-5\"> In <em>Retailers </em>this court concluded that loss of the conditional privilege was warranted by evidence of recklessness in the preparation of a credit report, specifically by failing to check, and thus inaccurately reporting, several important facts in the plaintiff\u2019s credit history which were capable of precise verification. <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\">A conditional privilege may thus be abused whether the fault lies in the determination of the truth of the information involved or whether the fault lies in improper publication of the defamatory matter. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 599 comment a, at 286 (1977). The Restatement also takes the position that an abuse of the conditional privilege requires proof that the defendant knew that the defamatory statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 592A, at 260 (1977). The Restatement logically posits that, to give effect to a conditional privilege, the standard for defining when it has been abused must entail proof beyond mere negligence, which is the standard necessary to maintain a defamation action absent a conditional privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 259-260. See generally <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 858 (1975) (if plaintiff is not a public official or a public figure, he may recover in libel action against publisher by proof of negligence in publishing defamatory falsehood). To apply the negligence standard to a conditional privilege would defeat the concept and its objective of promoting the free flow of information to further a legitimate private or public interest. Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Restatement also appears to sanction a scienter prerequisite to finding an \u201cexcessive publication\u201d which abuses the conditional privilege. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 604, <em>supra </em>at 292. Section 604 states that one who \u201cknowingly publishes the [defamatory] matter to a person to whom its publication is not otherwise privileged, abuses the privilege unless he reasonably believes that the publication is a proper means of communicating\u201d the matter to a privileged person. <em>Id. </em>Comment b of \u00a7 604 states that excessive publication does not occur merely by an incidental publication of the information to unprivileged persons unless the communication is \u201cunnecessary and unsanctioned by a custom based on ordinary necessities of business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293. See also <em>New York &amp; P.R. S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>16 F.2d 734,738-739 (1st Cir. 1926) (conditional privilege not lost although third persons overheard communication, provided their presence occurred in usual course of business affairs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> The third question with respect to the libel law claim is certified to us as follows: \u201c3. Is the standard for abuse through excessive publication the same when the defamatory matter published is medical information?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Bratt asserts that a negligence standard should apply to defamatory medical information disclosed by an employer. He claims Jhat_ Liebjag,., in disseminating the information concerning Bratt\u2019s medical condition, acted unreasonably and in contravention of express IBM policy., and thus abused his conditional privilege. The defendants maintain that the same .standard for abuse of the conditional privilege should apply when 7h\u00a5 deFamatory material is medical information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> Of particular relevance to this case are two principlas-discussed by the <em>Hoesl </em>court. First, the court recognized that California and other State and Federal courts have \u201crefused to hold defamatory on its face or defamatory at all an imputation of mental disorder which is made in an oblique or hyperbolic manner.\u201d <em>Hoesl </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 1172. See <em>Fram </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., </em>380 F. Supp. 1314, 1329-1330 (W.D. Pa. 1974) (under circumstances of case, statements characterizing-plyntiffitsJlpgranoid\u201d and \u201cschizophrenic\u201d were not capable of defamatory jueaning),; .Corra\u00a3_y. <em>Santos, </em>191 Cal. App. 2d 844, 853 (1961) (statement describing plaintiff as a person who was unreasonable in his actions andJiis demandsmot defamatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">We agree with this reasoning as well as with the important distinction's, made by the <em>Hoesl </em>court for medical opinipns-which YohcTudeYhat an individual is mentally ill. \u201c[I]n a case involving the unambiguous and considered publication to an employer that an employee has a specified mental disorder [which] . . . make[s] him unfit for his job,\u201d the court would.)\u2018hold the publication defamatory on its face.\u201d <em>Hoesl,_supra at </em>1173.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> Certified question 1 under the invasion of privacy claim reads as follows: \u201cCan disclosure of private facts about an employee among other employees of a corporation constitute sufficient publication to infringe the employee\u2019s right of privacy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Bratt claims that the disclosure of confidential medical information to managerial employees of IBM amounts to an unreasonable interference with his right of privacy, in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. The defendants contend that the dissemination of Bratt\u2019s medical condition among only a few IBM employees does not constitute a sufficient disclosure to make out a prima facie claim under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. See note 15, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We note that the assumption of the question, and of the arguments, is that publication is an essential ingredient of the tort of invasion of privacy. While this may not be true in every instance (see, e.g., <em>Cortv. Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 307 &amp; n.9 [1982]; <em>Themo </em>v. <em>New England Newspaper Publishing Co., </em>306 Mass. 54, 57 [1940], and cases cited), we answer the question in the context stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652D, at 383 (1977), defines a category of the tort which is analogous to \u00a7 IB as follows: \u201cPublicity Given to Private Life. One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability . . . for invasion of his privacy . . . .\u201d Comment a to \u00a7 652D states that \u201c \u2018[publicity\u2019 . . . means that the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Because G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, focuses on interference with a person\u2019s privacy right, and our case law speaks of the disclosure of intrusive, personal facts as sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute, we depart somewhat from the Restatement\u2019s concept of the tort. See <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., supra </em>at 302-303; G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. We thus reject the defendants\u2019 contention that communication of personal facts concerning Bratt only among employees of IBM would be an insufficient disclosure under \u00a7 IB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> Questions 2 and 3, certified by the Court of Appeals, read as follows: \u201c2. Is there a conditional privilege for legitimate business communications under the Massachusetts right of privacy statute? 3. If so, what are the standards for abuse of that privilege?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Bratt contends that conditional privileges for an employer\u2019s legitimate business communications should be evaluated by balancing the employer\u2019s need to obtain the personal information against the employees\u2019 privacy rights. The defendants claim that a conditional privilege should exist for valid business communications. The defendants further contend, however, that we should follow case law from other jurisdictions which holds that where publicity of private facts is privileged in a defamation action, there is no actionable invasion of privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b536-5\"> We noted that an employer is prohibited from seeking certain personal data from an employee or prospective employee. See, e.g., G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B (use of lie detector tests by employers prohibited); G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (9) (unlawful practice for employer to seek information, in connection with employing an individual or discharging employee, relating to, inter alla, arrests which never resulted in convictions, first conviction for certain minor crimes); G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (9A) (limitations on discharging employee for failure to furnish information regarding admission to psychiatric hospital). <em>Cort, supra </em>at 306-307 n.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\"> \u201cThe information that a high level or confidential employee should reasonably be expected to disclose is broader in scope and more personal in nature than that which should be expected from an employee who mows grass or empties waste baskets. \u201d <em>Cort v. Bristol-Myers Co., supra </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Courts in other jurisdictions also have decided that the disclosure of personal information, in certain situations, serves a legitimate business interest which outweighs a plaintiff\u2019s privacy right. See, <em>e.g., Harrison </em>v. <em>Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>264 F. Supp. 89, 92 (D.S.C. 1967) (creditor may disclose the existence of an outstanding debt to the debtor\u2019s employer; this reasonable method of persuading payment does not constitute an actionable intrusion on the debtor\u2019s privacy); <em>Yoder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>253 Iowa 505, 510 (1962) (same); <em>Household Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>252 Md. 531, 543-544 (1968) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b537-10\"> While it is arguable that the standard we state may, in some instances, be the same as that involved in a conditional privilege, we prefer to adhere to the language of our cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b537-11\"> Question 4, as certified by the Court of Appeals, states as follows: \u201cAre the same privilege and standards for abuse applicable in the case of medical information?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The question, as phrased, presupposes that we answered affirmatively questions 2 and 3 regarding the existence of a conditional privilege for business communications in an action under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. Although we conclude that no such conditional privilege exists under Massachusetts law, our concern with balancing an employer\u2019s right to disclose personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>data about an employee with the employee\u2019s privacy rights applies with equal force when an employer discloses medical information about an employee. We thus include the following explanation of the balancing approach we would apply in such a factual situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\"> Bratt contends that he entered into a physician-patient relationship with Dr. Nugent when he initially consulted with her and she gave him a routine examination. He thus contends that her disclosure of confidential information concerning his medical condition amounted to a breach of his privacy right under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The defendants claim that we should apply the same conditional privilege and standard for abuse with respect to the right of a physician employed by a company to disclose medical information about an employee to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">When an employer retains a physician to examine employees, generally no physician-patient relationship exists between the employee and the doctor. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Tri-State Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>118 Minn. 217, 219 (1912). See also <em>Hoesl </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 F. Supp. 1170, 1176 (N.D. Cal. 1978) (when physician employed by employer to evaluate fitness of employees, physician\u2019s duties run primarily to employer). Physicians in such a situation, however, must still exercise reasonable care and skill in their relationship with the employees. See <em>Beadling </em>v. <em>Sirotta, </em>41 N.J. 555, 561-562 (1964); <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>130 N.Y. 325, 332 (1891). Cf. <em>Harriott </em>v. <em>Plimpton, </em>166 Mass. 585, 588 (1896) (although no physician-patient relationship existed between plaintiff and defendant doctor, plaintiff could maintain negligence action against doctor who merely examined plaintiff and relayed improper diagnosis of venereal disease to plaintiff\u2019s future father-in-law, which resulted in breaking of plaintiff\u2019s engagement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> There is no evidentiary common law or statutory privilege as to confidential communications between a patient and a physician in Massachusetts. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 186-188 (5th ed. 1981). There is, however, a psychotherapist-patient privilege created by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. Section 20B does not appear applicable to the facts in this case. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the other hand, in many of our statutes, the Legislature implicitly has recognized the patient\u2019s interest in the confidentiality of personal information disclosed to a physician. See, e.g., G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 12G (certain disclosures of medical information about a patient, required in the public interest, will not subject physician to any civil or criminal liability); G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70 (inspection of hospital records available, inter alla, on properjudicial order or by proper authorization from department head with jurisdiction over records); G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 70E (providing for confidentiality of hospital records to extent provided by law); G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 110B (required reports on children afflicted with Reyes syndrome to be released only to authorized persons); G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 11 IB (record of malignant diseases shall be kept confidential in accordance with \u00a7 70); G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 202 (records of fetal deaths to be kept confidential and released only upon request of parent, guardian, or certain designated governmental agencies); G. L. c. 111D, \u00a7 6 (reports of infectious diseases to be kept confidential). Cf. 243 Code Mass.
