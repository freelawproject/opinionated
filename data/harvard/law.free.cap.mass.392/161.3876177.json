The judge had conducted a voir dire examination of the polygraph examiner and had determined that he was qualified and that the test was properly conducted. The judge, concluding that he had wide discretion in the matter, excluded the results of the polygraph examination for two reasons. First, he did so because he had excluded evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a similar crime, offered to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Second, the polygraph evidence was not critical, in the judge\u2019s view, because the defendant, supported by a corroborating witness, was to testify to an alibi. We reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, 430 n.2, 453 (1978), the court held that the results of a polygraph examination could be used to impeach or to corroborate a defendant\u2019s testimony, provided the defendant had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his constitutional right against self-incrimination. In doing so, the court limited the admissibility of polygraph test results to a case in which the defendant testified, clarifying what this court had said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. 421 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 430. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 431, we stated that, when certain essential preliminary findings have been made, a judge \u201cmay then, <em>in his discretion, </em>admit the examiner\u2019s testimony concerning the test results as evidence to be considered with all other evidence\u201d (emphasis added). In the <em>Vitello </em>case, which clearly indicated that the Commonwealth could not introduce unfavorable test results unless the defendant testified, and in our subsequent opinions concerned with the admissibility of polygraph test results, we have not said that, if after preliminary proceedings the judge finds the examiner qualified and the test properly conducted, the judge then has a broad discretion to exclude evidence of the test results offered to corroborate a defendant\u2019s testimony. See the discussion of cases dealing with the admissibility of the results of polygraph examinations set forth in our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, ante </em>152 (1984). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 160-161 (1980) (defendant entitled to reasonably necessary polygraph examination at public expense; no discussion of a discretionary authority to deny motion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>377 Mass. 674, 677 (1979) (adverse polygraph results improperly admitted as part of Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>376 Mass. 468,478-479 (1978) (judge properly admitted polygraph results only to corroborate the defendant\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">We find no support for concluding that polygraph test results may be excluded in a judge\u2019s discretion if in his discretion he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>has also excluded evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. We have noted that the admissibility of favorable test results may aid the fact-finding process by encouraging a defendant to testify in spite of the admissibility of evidence of his prior convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 455. We have never said, however, that polygraph test results favorable, to a defendant are admissible to corroborate his testimony only when evidence of a prior conviction has been admitted to impeach his testimony. Such a rule would benefit only defendants who had been previously convicted of a crime. Nor do we think that a trial judge, having found the examiner qualified and the examination properly conducted, has discretion to exclude the test results because he also excluded evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. Such a conclusion would grant virtually unreviewable discretion to trial judges, would discourage uniformity of treatment of defendants, and should be avoided. As a general proposition, a judge does not have discretion to exclude relevant evidence. See <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 210 (1978); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>369 Mass. 47, 59 (1975). See also Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 401-403 (1980). If there are discretionary circumstances in which a judge may exclude otherwise admissible evidence of the favorable results of a polygraph examination, they are not shown on this record. Certainly, favorable polygraph test results may not be excluded because, in the judge\u2019s opinion, the defendant has \u201ccorroborated\u201d alibi evidence to offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Commonwealth argues that, in any event, the polygraph results were unreliable and hence inadmissible because the defendant had previously been given a polygraph examination concerning the charges on which he was convicted. It is claimed that the prior examination tainted the later examination and its results. This question is one of proof, not argument. The trial judge did not rely on this contention, and the record does not support the Commonwealth\u2019s claim. It is a matter on which expert testimony would seem to be required. See <em>Commonwealth v. A Juvenile (No. 1), </em>370 Mass. 450,452-454(1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We have one collateral comment. A previous trial of the defendant on these same charges had ended in a mistrial when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>because of an inadequately sanitized exhibit, the jury became aware of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a similar crime and, as the judge was advised during jury deliberations, one or more not guilty votes were changed to guilty as a result. In that earlier trial, the question of the admissibility of the results of the polygraph examination had been fully considered and resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. In the absence of new evidence or a change in the law, such a matter need not have been reconsidered at the second trial, although it was within the discretion of the judge to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>390 Mass. 562, 565 n.3 (1983), rev\u2019d per curiam on other grounds, 466 U.S. 727 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Because there was a seriously contested question at trial as to the accuracy of the victim\u2019s identification of the person who kidnapped her at knife point and raped her, we cannot fairly say that the exclusion of the polygraph results was not prejudicial error. The judgments are reversed and the verdicts are set aside. The case is remanded to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
