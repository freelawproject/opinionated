The union filed an action in the Superior Court seeking to enforce the terms of an arbitration award issued in accordance with G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19G. The union alleged that the MBTA had refused to abide by four provisions of the award regarding part-time employees. The MBTA denied that it was bound by the contested provisions. The arbitrator who issued the award then sought to intervene in the union\u2019s action. The first appeal addressed in this case is the arbitrator\u2019s appeal from a ruling by a judge of the Superior Court denying his motion to intervene. The second appeal is by the union from a second judge\u2019s entry of summary judgment sustaining the MBTA\u2019s position. We find no merit in either appeal and affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The background of these appeals is not disputed and may be summarized briefly. A collective bargaining agreement between the union and the MBTA expired on December 31, 1980. In July of 1980, both parties began bargaining on the terms of a new agreement but were unsuccessful. Just prior to the expiration of the contract, in December, 1980, the Legislature enacted St. 1980, c. 581, amending the MBTA\u2019s enabling legislation. G. L. c. 161 A. Section 8 of c. 581, codified at G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19, designated certain matters as inherent management rights and prohibited the board of directors of the MBTA from bargaining collectively with labor organizations representing its employees over any of them. In June, 1982, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>union and the MBTA proceeded to interest arbitration pursuant to G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7\u00a7 19C-19G. The arbitrator held hearings between August and November, 1982. On January 15, 1983, the arbitrator issued his opinion and award. The MBTA refused to abide by four provisions of the award regarding part-time employees, discussed in more detail <em>infra. </em>The union filed an action in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19G, and the arbitrator filed a motion to intervene. A judge of the Superior Court denied the motion to intervene. The union and the MBTA then both filed motions for summary judgment. A second judge entered a summary judgment declaring invalid the challenged provisions of the award, severing them from the remainder of the award, and enforcing the award as severed. The union appealed, and we allowed the union\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">I. The Arbitrator\u2019s Motion to Intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The arbitrator sought to intervene in the union\u2019s action against the MBTA as a matter of right, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (a), 365 Mass. 769 (1974), and alternatively, based on the motion judge\u2019s discretion, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (b), 365 Mass. 769 (1974). The judge denied the motion on both grounds and the arbitrator appealed. -</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">While the denial of a motion to intervene by right, along with the denial of an accompanying request for permissive intervention, may be appealed immediately, <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brockton Agricultural Soc\u2019y, </em>390 Mass. 431, 433 (1983), <em>Mayflower Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 630, 634-635 (1981), we need not reach the merits of the arbitrator\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The basis of the arbitrator\u2019s motion to intervene is G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19G. In relevant part G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19G, inserted by St. 1978, c. 405, \u00a7 2, provides that \u201c[a]ny determination by the arbitrator . . . shall be binding upon the parties . . . and may be enforced at the insistence of either party or by the arbitrator in the superior court.\u201d The arbitrator contends that he has special position under this statute as a guardian of the public interest and therefore should be allowed to intervene. Even if the judge should have allowed him to intervene in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>proceedings, either by right or by discretion, we conclude the arbitrator was not prejudiced by the denial of his motion. The interests of the union and the arbitrator, as evidenced by the pleadings, are virtually identical, and the arbitrator made no allegation or showing that the union\u2019s advocacy of those interests was inadequate. In addition, the judge had before him the arbitrator\u2019s sixty-two page opinion explaining the award. Finally, the arbitrator was allowed to file an amicus curiae brief before this court addressing the merits of the union\u2019s enforcement action against the MBTA. We therefore dismiss the arbitrator\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">II. The Union\u2019s Appeal of the Entry of Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The union contends that the trial judge erred in declaring unenforceable the challenged provisions of the award, severing these provisions, and enforcing the award without them. According to the union, the judge made three different errors. The union first argues that the judge failed properly to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the management rights portion of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19. It next contends that the disputed provisions of the award do not impermissibly infringe upon the MBTA\u2019s inherent management rights under the statute. Finally, it argues that even if the challenged provisions are unenforceable, the judge erred in severing these provisions from the award instead of remanding the entire award to the arbitrator for reconsideration. We treat each argument separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>The union contends that judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s award is limited to whether it is supported by substantial evidence or is \u201cutterly unreasonable.\u201d The arbitrator asserts that we should \u201cDefer to the Arbitrator with Respect to the Interpretation and Application of the Relevant Statutory Provisions.\u201d In the context of the instant case, we reject both of these positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The MBTA makes a jurisdictional challenge. It claims that the contested portions of the arbitrator\u2019s award are unenforceable because they go beyond the arbitrator\u2019s authority. Whether an arbitrator has acted beyond the scope of authority conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>to him is always open to judicial review. See <em>School Comm, of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>369 Mass. 683, 685 (1976); <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>363 Mass. 386, 390-391 (1973). An arbitrator exceeds his authority where his award requires conduct by a public employer beyond that to which the public employer may bind itself or allow itself to be bound. See <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 715 (1978); <em>School Comm, of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, supra. </em>In determining whether an arbitrator exceeded his authority in a provision of an arbitration award, judicial review of the award is independent. See <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 212-213 (1982). Those portions of an arbitrator\u2019s award which exceed the arbitrator\u2019s authority are void and may be vacated by a court. See id.; <em>School Comm, of Braintree </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>369 Mass. 686, 690-691 (1976); <em>J.F. Fitzgerald Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co., </em>304 Mass. 130, 134 (1939). Accordingly, the judge was correct not to defer to the interpretation of the arbitrator in considering whether the challenged portions of the award are void because they extend to issues beyond the power of the arbitrator to consider or to bind the MBTA under G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7\u00a7 19-19G. Similarly, we need not defer to the arbitrator in reviewing the judge\u2019s conclusions that the provisions did exceed the arbitrator\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Challenged provisions. </em>The challenged portions of the arbitrator\u2019s award all purport to restrict the MBTA\u2019s exercise of its discretion in connection with part-time employees: \u201cA. The maximum number of part-time employees shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the number of full-time employees in the classification. B. No full-time employee will lose his regular weekly pay because of a layoff while a part-time employee is actively employed in the same classification. C. Part-time employees shall not . . . work on Saturdays or Sundays. . . . L. All charters, vacation reliefs, and any regular runs left vacant because of the absence of regular full-time operators will be worked only by full-time operators.\u201d The judge agreed with the MBTA that these portions of the arbitrator\u2019s award were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>unenforceable because they exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s ability to bind the MBTA under express provisions of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19. The union contends that the judge erred in his determination. According to the union, the challenged provisions do not improperly restrict the MBTA\u2019s inherent management rights under G. L. c. 161 A, \u00a7 19, and, therefore, do not extend beyond the arbitrator\u2019s authority as to wages, hours, and conditions of employment. We agree with the judge that the challenged provisions of the arbitrator\u2019s award are unenforceable as beyond the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Whether an arbitrator has exceeded his authority by including provisions in an arbitration award depends upon what matters were properly before him for consideration. See <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>supra; <em>Trustees of the Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 391. Cf. <em>J.F. Fitzgerald Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Southbridge Water Supply Co., supra </em>at 135; <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>482 Pa. 263, 270-272 (1978). See generally Graver, The Judicial Enforcement of Public Sector Interest Arbitration, 21 B.C.L. Rev. 557 (1980). Here, the arbitrator acted pursuant to G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7\u00a7 19-19G. Accordingly, whether the challenged provisions of the award are unenforceable as beyond the arbitrator\u2019s authority is a matter of legislative intent. Did the Legislature intend to allow the arbitrator to regulate the MBTA\u2019s conduct in connection with part-time employees in the way that the challenged provisions provide? To the extent that an arbitrator\u2019s award purports to regulate conduct beyond that which the framework of G. L. c. 161, \u00a7\u00a7 19-19G allows, it contravenes legislative intent and cannot be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">General Laws c. 161A, \u00a7\u00a7 19-19G, contain two specific limitations on an arbitrator\u2019s authority to regulate the conduct of the MBTA. The first specifies those matters properly subject to arbitration. General Laws c. 161A, \u00a7 19G, states in relevant part that \u201c[t]he scope of arbitration shall be limited to wages, hours, and conditions of employment. . . .\u201d The second limits the means by which an arbitrator may fashion an award addressing wages, hours, and conditions of employment. In G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>c. 161A, \u00a7 19F,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Legislature withdrew from the scope of an arbitrator\u2019s consideration in fashioning an award matters of \u201cinherent management right,\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These \u201cinherent management right[s]\u201d are certain types <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of employment-related issues which the Legislature has chosen to exclude from the collective bargaining process. \u201c[T]he directors shall have no authority to bargain collectively and shall have no authority to enter into collective bargaining agreements with respect to matters of inherent management right.\u201d G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19. The primary inherent management right relevant to this appeal is the right \u201cto hire part-time employees.\u201d G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19 <em>(viii).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\"><em>To </em>the extent <em>that the </em>challenged provisions of the arbitration award contravene these limitations on the arbitrator\u2019s authority to regulate conduct of the MBTA they are unenforceable as extending beyond those matters the Legislature intended to put before the arbitrator. Accordingly, we must measure each provision against the statutory restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We are guided in our consideration of these restrictions by established principles of statutory construction. See <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>391 Mass. 594, 601 (1984). In determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>challenged provisions of the award intrude on areas of conduct which the Legislature intended to remain independent of the arbitrator\u2019s regulation, we begin with the language of the statute. \u201c[Statutory language is the principal source of insight into legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974). We construe this statutory language under the standard provided in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, that unless a statutory term is \u201ctechnical,\u201d \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to the[ir] common and approved usage.\u201d See <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 601. Where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous and leads to a workable result, we need look no further. <em>See Bronstein v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Whether the arbitrator improperly intruded on the MBTA\u2019s right to hire part-time employees turns on how broadly the Legislature intended the term \u201chire\u201d to sweep. The parties have not argued, nor do we conclude, that the term \u201chire,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19 <em>(viii), </em>was intended to be a technical term. We therefore construe it according to its ordinary meaning. See <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546 (1976). To \u201chire\u201d ordinarily means \u201cto engage the personal services of for a fixed sum.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1072 (1968). Cf. <em>Cardellicchio </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement of Natick, </em>391 Mass. 760, 763 (1984). We think that all the challenged provisions of the award contravene the ordinary meaning of the MBTA\u2019s statutory inherent management right to hire part-time employees. Accordingly, we need look no further than the plain language of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7\u00a7 19-19G, to conclude the judge properly declared the challenged provisions of the award unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The arbitrator\u2019s award purports to regulate the MBTA\u2019s employment practices regarding part-time employees. It provides how many may be hired, in what circumstances they may be actively employed, when they may work, and on what they may work. All these restrictions presumably are means by which the arbitrator sought to carry out his limited statutory duty to set wages, hours, and conditions of employment between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the MBTA and the union. Nonetheless, he acted beyond his authority and in contravention of the plain language of the statute when, as part of determining wages, hours, and conditions of employment, he sought to restrict the MBTA\u2019s discretion to hire and schedule part-time employees. See <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 715 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The MBTA\u2019s inherent management right to \u201chire\u201d part-time employees would be of little practical value if it could be indirectly restricted by limits on the number of part-time employees which can be hired, by arguably punitive consequences attached to their being \u201cactively employed\u201d and by restrictions on the work to which they may be assigned. The ordinary meaning of the term \u201chire\u201d certainly contains no such inherent qualifications, and the words of the statute neither express nor imply any such limits. We believe that construing the MBTA\u2019s right to hire part-time employees as including these qualifications would frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We are supported in this conclusion by other areas of decision making reserved by the Legislature under G. L.c. 161A,\u00a7 19, for the unfettered, reasonable judgment of the MBTA. They are the inherent management rights to \u201cappoint,\u201d \u201cemploy,\u201d \u201cassign,\u201d and \u201cdetermine levels of staffing\u201d of MBTA personnel. These too are not susceptible to collective bargaining and may not be considered by the arbitrator in arriving at his award. Nonetheless, the challenged provisions of the arbitrator\u2019s award interfere with these rights by purporting to regulate the employment and scheduling practices of the MBTA as they relate to part-time employees. The language and general design of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7 19, indicate the Legislature did not intend to provide the arbitrator with such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In another context we have found that the procedures used in layoffs may be subject to collective bargaining, even though the right to determine staff size on an annual basis is an inherent management prerogative not susceptible to collective bargaining. See <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, </em>386 Mass. 197, 212-214 (1982). Cf. <em>School Comm, of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Local 66, </em>378 Mass. 65, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>72-73 (1979). In doing so, however, we were reviewing a school committee\u2019s inherent management prerogative under a different statute. At issue was the extent to which a statute providing that the school committee \u201cshall have general charge of all public schools,\u201d restricts the school committee\u2019s ability to bargain away its control over the size of the teaching staff. <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, supra </em>at 212. General Laws c. 161A, \u00a7 19, defines explicitly the matters of inherent management right with respect to which the MBTA may not bind itself; such explicit statutory restrictions were not present in the teachers\u2019 cases. The Legislature has made clear that it intends the MBTA to act without interference in its hiring of part-time employees. We believe that determining whether and when to lay off part-time employees is included in this hiring process and is not subject to regulation by an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Measuring the challenged provisions of the arbitrator\u2019s award against the plain language of G. L. c. 161A, \u00a7\u00a7 19 and 19F, we conclude that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in framing them and that they are unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Severance. </em>Because we have concluded that the award is partially invalid, a question now arises as to enforcement of the award. The judge concluded that the unenforceable provisions of the award should be severed from the award and the remainder enforced. The MBTA agrees with this determination. The union and the arbitrator challenge it. They contend that the award must be remanded to the arbitrator for further consideration. We agree with the judge. The unenforceable provisions of the award may be severed from it and the remainder enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In considering whether to sever unenforceable provisions of an interest arbitration award and enforce the remainder, we look to the results of such action. We will sever and enforce the remainder of an award where it \u201cwould not do an injustice.\u201d <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, supra </em>at 717. More specifically, we consider two issues. \u201c[V]acation of the entire award could come about because of a functional relationship between the legal and illegal parts such that execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tian of one without the other would produce an untoward or unworkable result. So also the whole award may be threatened where it can be seen that the arbitrator\u2019s decision as to the legal part was influenced by his disposition of the part later found to be illegal.\u201d <em>Marlborough Firefighters, Local 1714 </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>375 Mass. 593, 597-598 (1978), citing <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>54 U.S. (13 How.) 26, 39 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">There is no question that the provisions of the award other than those relating to part-time employees are workable. The provisions of the award which we have declared unenforceable have only an indirect bearing at best on full-time employees. Similarly, we do not find the provisions of the award which do not relate to part-time employees sufficiently influenced by the unenforceable part-time provisions to require reconsideration by the arbitrator. The structure of the arbitrator\u2019s award itself confirms this conclusion. The award was separated into two sections. Part IV is labeled \u201cArbitration Award (for Other than Part-Time Employees)\u201d and Part V is labeled \u201cDiscussion and Award: Part-Time Employees.\u201d These sections contain separate reasoning and conclusions in support of most of their respective award provisions. Where there is overlap, the part-time provision relies on the full-time provision. The judge focused on this division of sections to conclude they represented separate awards. Whether they are in fact separate awards, they do not demonstrate the interdependence required for us to vacate the provisions relating to other than part-time employees based on our conclusions regarding the challenged part-time employee provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We also conclude that enforcing the part-time portion of the award after severing the provisions we have disallowed would not lead to an injustice. The arbitration award indicates that the critical issue before the arbitrator, presumably in connection with both full-time and part-time employees, was wage levels. The arbitrator\u2019s determination for part-time employees, however, evidences no reliance on the provisions of the award we have disallowed. The wage provision provides as follows: \u201cPart-time employees shall be paid at the same rate as full-time employees, subject to the new hire progression. Those hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>prior to the date of this award shall be given credit for such prior service in applying the progression steps. The parties shall determine the number of hours of work necessary to satisfy the progression steps.\u201d We see nothing in this provision to indicate it was influenced by the number of part-time employees hired by the MBTA or when they are assigned to work. The arbitrator relied instead on wage considerations determined in the context of full-time employees. The award demonstrates no intent or need to design a separate wage package for part-time employees simply because the MBTA is not bound by the hiring or scheduling restrictions the arbitrator sought to impose. The other enforceable provisions of the part-time portion of the award evidence equally little influence by the provisions we have disallowed. Accordingly, we agree with the judge that the \u201csevering of the aforementioned sections of the part-time award does not disturb the integrity of the remainder of the part-time award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We dismiss the appeal from the denial of the arbitrator\u2019s motion to intervene.
