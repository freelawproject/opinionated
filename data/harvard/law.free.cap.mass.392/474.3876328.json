Each plaintiff brought an action in the Superior Court seeking judicial review of the decisions of the DPW terminating payments to them on behalf of their children under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). G. L. c. 118. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-610 (1967 &amp; Supp. V 1981). The plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief. G. L. c. 231 A. Five of the cases were consolidated before one Superior Court judge; the sixth case was litigated before another Superior Court judge. Relying on <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 600 (1979), the judges entered judgments that these plaintiffs were entitled to benefits on a prorated basis. We transferred the cases to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">We conclude that, under DPW regulations in effect from August 1, 1978, through August 18, 1983, the plaintiffs whose children were voluntarily placed in residential schools remained eligible to receive AFDC benefits for those children, and that such payments should not be prorated. We also hold that, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>DPW regulations in effect from August 1, 1978, through May 31, 1980, the plaintiff whose children were transferred to the DPW\u2019s temporary custody remained eligible for unprorated benefits. We remand the cases to the Superior Court for the entry of declaratory judgments consistent with our opinion and for further remand to the DPW, which is to calculate the allowable benefits according to the principles generally applicable to eligible recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We describe initially the statutory and regulatory landscape in which these cases are situated. The Massachusetts AFDC program, administered in the Commonwealth by the DPW, provides semi-monthly payments to a parent or other qualifying relative of financially eligible \u201cdependent\u201d children \u201cto enable such parent to bring up such child or children properly in his or her own home.\u201d G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1983, c. 633, \u00a7 5. A \u201cdependent\u201d child is defined as \u201ca needy child who has been deprived of parental support or care . . . and who is living with his father, mother or other parent in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1982, c. 424, \u00a7 1. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a) (Supp. V 1981). A State that adopts a State plan consistent with Federal AFDC requirements qualifies for Federal participation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in payments made on behalf of children meeting the Federal definition of \u201cdependent\u201d children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 603(a), 606(a) (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981). .</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The purpose of the AFDC program is to enable children, one or both of whose parents are absent or unable to provide support, to continue living at home through the provision of funds for their shelter, food, and other necessary items. Under the applicable Federal regulation, a child is deemed to be living at \u201chome\u201d if there is evidence of \u201cassumption and continuation of responsibility for day to day care of the child by the relative with whom the child is living.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(l)(v) (B) (1983). 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.200 (1980). It is clear from the regulations, however, that a parent may retain \u201cresponsibility for day to day care of the child\u201d even though the child is not continuously at home. \u201cA home exists so long as the relative exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child, even though ... the child ... is temporarily absent from the customary family setting.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90 (c)(l)(v)(B)(1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The question common to the cases before us is whether a child who maintains a close relationship with a parent and who returns to the parent\u2019s home for substantial periods of time while placed in a residential school or while in an agency\u2019s temporary legal custody is \u201ctemporarily absent\u201d from the home, but still \u201cliving with\u201d the parent and therefore eligible for AFDC payments to the parent, or is no longer \u201cliving with\u201d the parent and therefore ineligible for such benefits. The applicable Federal regulation provides no guidance as to how long an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>absence may be considered \u201ctemporary,\u201d or as to whether the cause of the absence has any bearing on the child\u2019s eligibility. The DPW, however, has promulgated a regulation, codified at 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> stating that \u201c[t]he child is not considered to be living with the relative <em>if the child has been voluntarily surrendered or court committed into the care and custody </em>of a[n] . . . agency that has physical possession [of] the child, unless the child returns to the home of the relative for a period of more than 30 consecutive days\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The DPW contends that the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>precludes payment to a parent of AFDC benefits on behalf of a child placed by an agency in a residential school through voluntary agreement or removed from the parent by temporary emergency order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contest the applicability, or, in the alternative, the validity, of the DPW regulation in the circumstances of their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">1. <em>Factual Background.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">A. <em>Kathleen Civetti vs. Commissioner of Public Welfare. </em>Prior to March, 1980, the plaintiff received AFDC benefits on behalf of a son and a daughter. On March 7, 1980, after school officials recommended that the son be placed in a residential school to facilitate resolution of his educational and behavioral problems, the plaintiff entered into a voluntary agreement with the DPW under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (A),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> pursuant to which the child was placed in a private, nonprofit residential school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>in Scituate. Under the agreement, the plaintiff delegated to the DPW the right to determine where the child would live, the right to make educational decisions, the right to authorize routine and emergency medical care, and the authority to sub-delegate these rights to the school. The agreement provided that the plaintiff or the DPW could terminate the arrangement with ten days\u2019 notice. On January 27,1982, the plaintiff entered into a similar agreement with the Department of Social Services (DSS), which in the interim had assumed responsibility for residential placements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the latter agreement, the plaintiff delegated to the DSS only the right to authorize routine and emergency medical treatment and to subdelegate that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Pursuant to the two agreements, the child attended residential school until June, 1982.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During this period, he returned home on alternate weekends, during school vacations, and during periods of illness, and was thus at home for over one-third of a calendar year. The plaintiff maintained one room of her apartment specifically for her son\u2019s use on his home visits. Although the DPW and the DSS were financially responsible for the child\u2019s expenses at school, the plaintiff incurred unreimbursed expenses in connection with his food and clothing requirements and transportation costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, under the placement agreement, the plaintiff actively participated in decisions concerning her son\u2019s day-to-day care while at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">On February 18, 1981, the DPW notified the plaintiff that her AFDC benefits would be reduced from $379.20 to $314.20 a month because her son was no longer categorically eligible under 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1978). The plaintiff sought judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of a DPW appeals referee upholding the benefit reduction. On September 20, 1982, a Superior Court judge ruled the DPW regulations inapplicable to the plaintiff and set aside the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">B. <em>The Brunetta, Dever, Repici, and Cooper Cases. </em>Requests for judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of the DPW decisions in these four cases were consolidated, along with the Rutado case (discussed below), in one action before the Superior Court. All four plaintiffs suffered reduction or elimination of AFDC benefits pursuant to 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1978) on behalf of children placed in residential schools under voluntary agreements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As in the Civetti case, the plaintiffs\u2019 children visited the plaintiffs on weekends, holidays, and school vacations, and spent a substantial proportion of the year at home. In addition to paying their school and transportation expenses, the DPW provided the children with monthly clothing and personal allowances. These sums, however, were insufficient to meet the children\u2019s needs while at home, and the plaintiffs incurred expenses in connection with rent for extra bedrooms, food, entertainment, and other incidental expenditures for their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In reviewing the benefit denials, the Superior Court judge assumed, without discussing, that 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1978) rendered the plaintiffs categorically ineligible for AFDC payments on behalf of the voluntarily placed children. The judge ruled, however, that, as applied to these plaintiffs, the DPW regulation conflicted impermissibly with Federal and State statutory law and violated the plaintiffs\u2019 due process and equal protection rights. The judge ordered that the plaintiffs be awarded retroactive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">C. <em>Patricia Furtado </em>vs. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare. </em>Prior to July, 1979, the plaintiff\u2019s four children attended a residential school in Vermont at the expense of the plaintiff with some financial assistance from the school. In July, 1979, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the DPW commenced a care and protection proceeding in a District Court under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, to transfer custody of the children to the DPW on the grounds that the alcoholism and abusive behavior of the plaintiff\u2019s second husband were detrimental to their well-being. On July 24, 1979, a District Court judge entered a temporary order granting custody to the DPW. On July 25, 1979, the plaintiff, who had been receiving AFDC benefits on behalf of the four children, was notified that these benefits were being terminated because the children had been \u201ccourt committed\u201d into the DPW\u2019s \u201ccare and custody\u201d and were therefore no longer \u201cliving with\u201d the plaintiff under 6 Code Human Services Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 300.18 and 301.03 (1978), regulations that preceded 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980). See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">During the pendency of the temporary order,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the children visited the plaintiff on vacations and holidays but were not permitted to stay in the plaintiff\u2019s home overnight, remaining instead with their father. Although the DPW assumed school expenses, the plaintiff paid, in connection with the children\u2019s visits, expenses relating to food, clothing, entertainment, school books and transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In the G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, action for judicial review of the DPW decision to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s AFDC benefits, the Superior Court judge treated the case in conjunction with the voluntary placement cases with which it had been consolidated. After the commissioner filed an appeal from the judgment that the DPW regulation as applied to the consolidated cases was invalid, the Appeals Court decided, in a case presenting facts virtually identical to the Furtado case, that 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980) was inapplicable to a child placed in the custody of the DSS pursuant to an original or extended temporary emergency order under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>missioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 20 (1983). The Commissioner subsequently moved to dismiss the Furtado appeal, but, after the plaintiff decided to cross-appeal on the issue of relief, opted to preserve the appeal, and now argues that the Morin decision should be overruled or distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">2. <em>Effect of Voluntary Residential Placement on AFDC Eligibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The Superior Court judges treated the Appeals Court\u2019s decision in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 600 (1979), as controlling the AFDC eligibility of these plaintiffs. That decision held that a parent may remain eligible for prorated AFDC benefits on behalf of a child voluntarily placed with an agency for residential schooling. The plaintiff in <em>McCarthy </em>was denied benefits on behalf of her voluntarily placed children at a time when the DPW had no consistent policy on AFDC eligibility in such circumstances and had not yet implemented the regulations on which it relies in these cases. <em>Id. </em>at 607-608. As in the cases before us, the McCarthy children visited their mother\u2019s apartment frequently during the school year; the mother maintained an extra bedroom in her apartment to accommodate them on their visits home; and the mother incurred unreimbursed expenses for food, transportation, telephone calls, and sundries in connection with the children\u2019s visits. <em>Id. </em>at 601-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The Appeals Court rejected the contention that a parent\u2019s voluntary agreement to place a child with the DPW for residential schooling by itself removed the child from the category of \u201cdependent\u201d children. The court noted that the voluntarily placed children returned home more frequently than other children not placed with the DPW or DSS, who attend residential schools under special education programs financed by local school committees and whose AFDC eligibility is uncontroverted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court also observed that the children required food, a bedroom, and other services while at home. <em>Id. </em>at 605. Moreover, the court stated that \u201calthough the department had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>placed [the children] with the schools and paid their yearly tuition, it was their mother, and not the department, who was consulted about their day-to-day care by the school staffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607. The Appeals Court concluded, however, that the children in that case \u201cwere actually and legally within the day-today physical care and custody of their mother <em>whenever they returned home,\u201d </em>and that the mother was \u201centitled to [AFDC] benefits <em>on a prorated basis </em>for reasonable expenses incurred on their behalf for the period of their schooling\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 608-609. Emphasizing that the termination of AFDC benefits in the case before it was not required by DPW regulation and did not conform to consistent DPW policy, the Appeals Court held the DPW\u2019s decision that the children were ineligible for any AFDC benefits contravened the policy, manifested in Federal and State statutes and regulations, of making the maintenance of a family environment for children financially feasible. <em>Id. </em>at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The <em>McCarthy </em>court\u2019s conclusion that voluntarily placed children remain intermittently eligible for AFDC benefits, and that such benefits should be dispensed on a prorated basis, has pragmatic appeal, for it is evident that parents of such children shoulder a financial burden in connection with the maintenance of a home environment to which the children can return from school, but that that financial need is somewhat diminished relative to the need of parents whose children reside at home on a full-time basis. Nonetheless, all parties are in agreement that neither intermittent eligibility nor proration of benefits is an available option under the AFDC program, and our reading of the pertinent statutes and regulations persuades us that they are correct in that assessment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the practical solution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>reached by the <em>McCarthy </em>court is not to be followed,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the question of the AFDC eligibility of these children is to be decided as \u201can all or nothing proposition.\u201d <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>16Mass. App. Ct. 20,27n.11 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Relying on the principle that regulations of an administrative agency to which the responsibility of administering a statutory program has been delegated are entitled to deference and should be upheld unless manifestly inconsistent with the governing statutes, see <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019 n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 206-207 (1981), the DPW asserts that 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1983) rendered these voluntarily placed children ineligible for benefits and is dispositive. The plaintiffs counter that the regulation relied on by the DPW contravenes the Federal AFDC statute, as interpreted in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(l)(v)(B) (1983). We do not reach the question of the compatibility of the DPW regulation, if applicable, with Federal AFDC requirements, however, nor do we address the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional arguments, for we are unable to agree with the DPW\u2019s threshold contention that \u00a7 303.230(A) excludes voluntarily placed children from the status of \u201cdependent\u201d children.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The first paragraph of \u00a7 303.230(A) contains a provision, analogous to that in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(l)(v)(B) (1983), stating that a child may be deemed to be living in the home of the parent even though the child is temporarily absent from the home. Section 303.230(A) further states that temporary absence \u201cmay include attendance at educational institutions or specialized schools.\u201d Read together with 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.200 (1980), which, like the Federal regulation, requires that a \u201cdependent\u201d child live with a relative responsible for the child\u2019s day-to-day care, \u00a7 303.230(A) clearly contemplates a situation in which a parent retains responsibility for the day-to-day care of a child attending school, and is consistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions that they are not disqualified from receiving AFDC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>payments for their children during these periods when the children are attending residential schools for educational and behavioral purposes. We do not agree with the DPW\u2019s claim that, because a State agency finances the children\u2019s expenses while at school, contemporaneous AFDC payments to their parents are duplicative. Although a child\u2019s placement in a residential school eliminates the parent\u2019s need to feed or house the child during portions of the year, the additional living space necessary to accommodate the child on visits home is a fixed cost unaffected by the fact that the child does not make constant use of that space.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, although DPW assistance may be available for other out-of-pocket expenses affiliated with the periods during which the child is at home,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the record supports the findings below that a significant proportion of such expenses would go uncompensated in the absence of AFDC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The practical reasons for continued AFDC eligibility of parents of voluntarily placed children are supported by policy considerations. Without AFDC benefits enabling parents to pay expenses connected with providing a home environment for voluntarily placed children, \u201cindigent parent[s] would be well-advised not to have [their] children home . . . simply because of financial reasons, a result which would be inconsistent with the stated purposes of the AFDC program.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 606. Alternatively, a rule eliminating AFDC payments for voluntarily placed children might induce parents to forgo voluntary residential school placements that are in the best interests of children in order to avoid total separation from the children. In the absence of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>plicit language to the contrary, we do not impute to the DPW a rule producing these effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The DPW contends, however, that the language in the third paragraph of \u00a7 303.230(A) declaring ineligible children \u201cvoluntarily surrendered or court committed into the care and custody of a public or licensed private agency\u201d clearly applies to voluntarily placed children. The plaintiffs contest the DPW\u2019s claim that these children were \u201cvoluntarily surrendered\u201d into the \u201ccare and custody\u201d of the DPW. We agree that these voluntarily placed children do not fall within the disqualification created by the third paragraph of \u00a7 303.230(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The phrase \u201cvoluntarily surrendered\u201d must be read in the context of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23, the statute governing substitute care arrangements by the DPW or the DSS. That statute formerly charged the DPW, and currently charges the DSS, with the responsibility of providing substitute care in three situations relevant to our inquiry. Clause A authorizes voluntary placements pursuant to the application of a parent or other person representing a child. Clause B provides that \u201c[t]he department may accept from parents voluntary surrender of custody of their children ... for purposes of giving consent for adoption.\u201d Clause C requires the department to accept responsibility for children committed to the department\u2019s custody by court order. The DPW regulation declaring ineligible for AFDC benefits children \u201cvoluntarily surrendered or court committed into the [department\u2019s] care and custody\u201d by its terms applies to the situations envisaged in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (B) and (C), not to a voluntary placement under \u00a7 23 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We eschew a construction of 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980) that would require us to presume the DPW ignored the language of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23, at the time it promulgated the regulation. Had the DPW intended to incorporate voluntary placements within the scope of the disqualification created by the regulation, it could have done so in unambiguous terms. We see no reason to accept the DPW\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d as used in the regulation should be read in a broader and more general sense than the cognate language in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (B). We note that other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>statutory and regulatory provisions incorporating the term \u201cvoluntary surrender\u201d use the phrase specifically in the context of parental relinquishment of children for purposes of giving consent to adoption. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2. Compare 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.11 (1981) (\u201cvoluntary placements\u201d with the DSS) with 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.13 (1) (1981) (\u201cvoluntary surrenders\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Additionally, the DPW regulation refers to a \u201csurrender\u201d into the \u201ccustody\u201d of the agency, language consistent with the transfer of legal custody (as defined in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21) involved in voluntary surrenders under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (B) (and in court commitments pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 [C]), but inconsistent with G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 (A) voluntary placements, which, under regulations effective during the periods in which the children in these cases were declared AFDC-ineligible, do not entail a transfer of all the rights subsumed in legal custody. 106 Code Mass.

L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, transferring temporary legal custody of the children from the plaintiff to the DPW. The DPW argues that these children were \u201ccourt committed\u201d to its care and custody, and therefore no longer \u201cliving with\u201d the plaintiff under 6 Code Human Services Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 301.03 and 304.202 (1978). We agree with the plaintiff that her children were not \u201ccourt committed\u201d within the meaning of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 182, authorizes the DPW or the DSS, when it appears that a child is not receiving adequate care and protection, to petition a competent Juvenile Court or juvenile session of a District Court for summonses to the child\u2019s parents \u201cto show cause why the child should not be committed to the custody of the department or other appropriate order made.\u201d If, after trial on the merits, the court finds that the department has met its burden of proof<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>with respect to the allegations in the petition, the court may \u201ccommit the child to the custody of the department until he becomes eighteen years of age or until in the opinion of the department the object of his commitment has been accomplished,\u201d or the court may make \u201cany other appropriate order,\u201d including the \u201ctransfer [of] temporary legal custody\u201d to the department. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (2) <em>(Hi), </em>as amended through St. 1983, c. 117. During the interim between the filing of the petition and its adjudication, the court, if \u201csatisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is suffering from ... or is in immediate danger of serious abuse or neglect,\u201d may issue \u201can emergency order transferring custody of a child ... to the department or to a licensed child care agency or individual described in [G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26 (2)].\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. An initial emergency order under \u00a7 24 may not transfer custody for more than seventy-two hours; however, after the child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian have been notified of the filing of the petition and given an opportunity to appear before the court, the court may continue the \u00a7 24 order until the \u00a7 26 adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In light of the clear distinction drawn by \u00a7 24 and \u00a7 26 between a long term <em>commitment </em>of a child to the agency\u2019s custody<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and a temporary <em>transfer </em>of custody to the agency, we are unable to agree with the DPW that the plaintiff\u2019s children were \u201ccourt committed\u201d to the DPW within the meaning of the DPW\u2019s regulations while the \u00a7 24 emergency order was in effect.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This difference between a commitment and a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fer of custody is more than a technicality. Whereas a child committed to the agency\u2019s custody is usually removed from the parent\u2019s home on a long term, if not permanent, basis, and cannot, therefore, be considered \u201ctemporarily absent\u201d from the home, an emergency transfer is by definition temporary and may well eventuate in a return of the child to the parent\u2019s home. The record in this case indicates that the plaintiff continued to sustain expenses on behalf of her children while they were in the DPW\u2019s temporary custody. Further, although the children were not permitted to sleep at the plaintiff \u2019 s apartment, the judge who entered the \u00a7 24 order conditioned a return of the children to the plaintiff\u2019s custody on her obtaining a separate apartment for herself and her children. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>In such circumstances, it would be wholly antithetical to the objectives of the AFDC program to deprive the plaintiff of benefits intended in large part to keep families together by making the costs of sheltering children affordable. Our conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s children remained AFDC-eligible under the applicable DPW regulations is also consistent with indications in the Federal AFDC regulation that the locus of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>custody is not by itself determinative of eligibility. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(1)(v)(B)(2) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We remand the cases to the Superior Court for the entry of judgments awarding appropriate declaratory relief and for remand to the DPW, which should calculate the retroactive benefits due the plaintiffs in light of our conclusion that their children remained categorically eligible during the contested time periods. The records before us disclose no bar to payment of AFDC benefits for the affected periods; on remand, however, evidence bearing on the children\u2019s financial eligibility or the existence of \u201ccountable income\u201d to be deducted from the amounts due may be introduced and considered in the DPW\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-11\"> The Commissioner appeals from the judgments setting aside the DPW\u2019s decisions and remanding the cases to the DPW for payment of retroactive benefits. The plaintiffs cross-appeal from those portions of the judgments setting the manner in which the benefits are to be calculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> The Federal government reimburses the Commonwealth for approximately fifty per cent of payments made to AFDC recipients in compliance with Federal requirements. See <em>ABCD, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>378 Mass. 327, 331 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">To obtain AFDC benefits, a child must be both \u201ccategorically\u201d eligible and \u201cfinancially\u201d eligible. A child is categorically eligible if he or she falls within the definition of a \u201cdependent\u201d child. A State receiving Federal financial participation may not adopt a standard of categorical eligibility narrower than the Federal definition. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Swank, </em>404 U.S. 282, 286 (1971). A categorically eligible child must also meet financial eligibility standards by qualifying as \u201cneedy.\u201d States have considerable discretion in setting standards of need as well as the level of benefits to be paid to those who meet those standards. See, e.g., <em>Rosado </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>397 U.S. 397, 408 (1970); <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 318-319 (1968). Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>DPW concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 children were not categorically eligible for AFDC benefits, it did not reach the question of financial eligibility, and no issues concerning financial eligibility are raised on these appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The full text of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c)(l)(v)(B)(1983) states: \u201cA home is the family setting maintained or in process of being established, as evidenced by assumption and continuation of responsibility for day to day care of the child by the relative with whom the child is living. A home exists so long as the relative exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child, even though either the child or the relative is temporarily absent from the customary family setting. Within this interpretation, the child is considered to be \u2018living with\u2019 his relative even though:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201c(1) He is under the jurisdiction of the court (e.g., receiving probation services or protective supervision); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201c(2) Legal custody is held by an agency that does not have physical possession of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The regulation codified at 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980) was preceded by similar, but not identical, regulations codified at 6 Code Human Services Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 300.18, 301.03, 304.202 (1978). Those regulations were in effect at the time the DPW denied benefits to some of these plaintiffs. The Superior Court judge, however, treated 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980) as the applicable regulation, and all parties focus their arguments on the later regulation on appeal. Although there are semantic differences between the earlier and later regulations, the result in the cases involving voluntary placements is not affected by which regulations applied, because the phrase at issue in these cases (\u201cvoluntarily surrendered . . . into the . . . care and custody [of the department]\u201d) appears in both sets of regulations. See 6 Code Human Services Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 300.18, 304.202 (1978). For purposes of convenience, we direct our discussion in the text concerning the voluntarily placed children to 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1980), in effect through August 18, 1983, but our analysis should be understood as applying equally to the earlier regulations. Thus, our decision today controls the AFDC-eligibility of children placed in residential schools by voluntary agreement during the time period from August 1, 1978, to August 18, 1983. Because (although we do not decide the question) the result in the Furtado case, involving children transferred to the DPW\u2019s temporary custody whose AFDC eligibility was terminated pursuant to the earlier regulations, may differ under 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 303.230(A) (1978), we focus our analysis in that case on the earlier regulations. Our decision therefore addresses the AFDC-eligibility of children in the DPW\u2019s temporary custody during the period extending from August 1, 1978, until May 31, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> 106 Code Mass.
