We conclude that under the current wording of the policy a loss of consortium claimant is a separate \u201cperson\u201d entitled to an independent \u201cper person\u201d recovery within the \u201cper accident\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The facts in both cases are undisputed. Robert Bilodeau vs. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company involves a 1977 standard policy issued by the insurer (Lumbermens) to Richard DeFanti, the owner of an automobile that collided with a vehicle operated by Robert Bilodeau, injuring his wife, Mina Bilodeau. DeFanti\u2019s policy provided optional coverage for bodily injury to others in the amount of $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d and $300,000 \u201cper accident.\u201d The Bilodeaus commenced an action in the Superior Court in which Mina Bilodeau sued to recover for her physical and emotional injuries, and Robert Bilodeau sought compensation for his loss of consortium. Mina Bilodeau\u2019s claim was settled by Lumbermens\u2019 payment to her of $100,000 under DeFanti\u2019s policy. Lumbermens also agreed with Robert Bilodeau to liquidate his claim at $42,500, and to resolve the question of his entitlement to the liquidated amount under the policy through an action for declaratory relief. In compliance with the agreement, Bilodeau brought an action for declaratory relief in the Superior Court. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, the judge reported the question of Lumbermens\u2019 liability to the Appeals Court without decision. We granted Bilodeau\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The second case, Royal Insurance Company of America vj. Stanley J. Jarzembowski &amp; others, arises from a collision in 1981 between an automobile operated by Jarzembowski and a vehicle driven by Catherine Tsoukalas, the insured. The Jarzembowski family filed a currently pending suit in the Superior Court against the insured, seeking compensation for physical injuries sustained by Jarzembowski and for his wife\u2019s loss of consortium and his children\u2019s loss of parental companionship and society (hereinafter, consortium). After the Jarzembowskis rejected the offer of the insurer (Royal) to pay $10,000, the compulsory \u201cper person\u201d coverage under the insured\u2019s 1981 policy, in full settlement of all the claims, including those of the wife and children, Royal initiated an action for a declaratory judgment that its liability under the policy is limited to $10,000 rather than the $20,000 \u201cper accident\u201d compulsory coverage for bodily injury to others. A judge of the Superior Court entered summary judgment in Royal\u2019s favor, and the Jarzembowskis appealed to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The insurers in both cases recognize that a spouse\u2019s or a child\u2019s claim for loss of consortium constitutes a cause of action distinct and independent from the cause of action of a person seeking compensation for physical injury. <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 607-608 (1981). The insurers do not argue that claims for loss of consortium arising from physical injury to a person injured by an insured are excluded under the standard automobile insurance policy. Instead, the insurers assert that under the terms of the policies, the \u201cper person\u201d limit is applicable to all claims, including those of a spouse or child for loss of consortium, flowing from bodily injury to one person. In essence, the insurers argue that \u201cper person,\u201d as the term is used in the standard policy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> means \u201cper bodily-injured person.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We begin our analysis, as we must, with the language of the policy, which parallels language in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, setting forth statutory requirements for compulsory and optional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>coverage. Part 1 of the policy, providing compulsory insurance for \u201cBodily Injury to Others,\u201d reads in pertinent part:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cUnder this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed by your auto in Massachusetts accidents. The damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement. . . . The most we will pay for injuries to any one person as a result of any one accident is [$10,000], The most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as a result of any one accident is a total of [$20,000].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Part 5 of the policy, entitled \u201cOptional Bodily Injury to Others,\u201d reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cUnder this Part, we will pay damages to people injured or killed in accidents if you or a household member is legally responsible for the accident. . . . The damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201cThis Part is similar to Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1). Like the Compulsory Part, this Part pays for accidents involving your auto in Massachusetts....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\"><em>6\u00cd </em>\u201cThe most we will pay for injury to any one person as a result of any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections page. The most we will pay for injuries to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>or more people as a result of any one accident is also shown on the Coverage Selections page.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">As we have indicated, the insured under the Royal policy did not pay for coverage beyond the compulsory minimum, whereas the insured under the Lumbermens policy paid for optional $100,000/$300,000 coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is clear that a prerequisite to recovery under either part 1 or part 5 is the occurrence of a \u201cbodily injury\u201d to a person involved in an accident with the insured. The ambiguity is whether the word \u201cperson\u201d in the sentence in both parts, limiting the insurer\u2019s liability for injuries \u201cto any one person as a result of any one accident,\u201d refers to the person who has sustained the bodily injury or to the person who seeks recovery as a result of the bodily injury. Put another way, the question is whether the \u201cinjured\u201d person to which the \u201cper person\u201d limit applies refers to the bodily-injured person or whether it also refers to the loss of consortium claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Because the language of the standard policy is prescribed by statute and controlled by the Division of Insurance rather than the individual insurer, the rule of construction resolving ambiguities in a policy against the insurer is inapplicable. <em>Mac-Bey </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indent. Co., </em>292 Mass. 105, 108 (1935). <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>284 Mass. 231, 234 (1933). See <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>351 Mass. 113,119-120 (1966). Instead, we must ascertain \u201cthe fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\u201d <em>Save-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 226 (1971), quoting <em>Oakes </em>v. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>131 Mass. 164, 165 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Both policies state that \u201cthe damages we will pay are the amounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury through a court judgment or settlement.\u201d Although loss of consortium is not a \u201cbodily injury,\u201d neither insurer contends that the policy precludes any recovery for loss of consortium. Lumbermens asserts that the phrase \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d includes all damages flowing from a bodily injury, and at oral argument explicitly conceded that loss of consortium claims are covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>by the policy. At oral argument, counsel for Royal adopted Lumbermens\u2019 argument. Further, it is apparent that Royal, which agrees that the policy does not exclude loss of consortium claims within the \u201cper person\u201d limit applicable to the bodily-injured person,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has adopted a similar interpretation of the \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d policy language. See <em>Lumbermens\u2019 Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Yeroyan, </em>90 N.H. 145, 146 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Proceeding from the premise that damages \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d include damages for loss of consortium,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it follows in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>eluctably that a loss of consortium claimant is an \u201cinjured person\u201d under the policy. When the reference to \u201camounts the injured person is entitled to collect for bodily injury\u201d is combined with the observation that it is the spouse or the child of the bodily-injured person, rather than the bodily-injured person, who is \u201centitled\u201d to collect for loss of consortium, see <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 608 (1981); <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>364 Mass. 153, 167-168 (1973), it is clear that the phrase \u201cinjured person\u201d includes a loss of consortium claimant. It follows that, for purposes of applying the limitation of liability \u201cfor injuries to any one person as a result of any one accident,\u201d the loss of consortium claimant must be considered a separate \u201cperson\u201d from the bodily-injured \u201cperson.\u201d A contrary interpretation would require us to attribute different meanings to the same words in the same paragraph, a task we eschew. Cf. <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978). Thus, we agree with the claimants in these cases that a spouse or child bringing an independent claim for a legally distinct injury is a separate \u201cperson\u201d with respect to the \u201cper person\u201d coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The insurers argue that their interpretation of the \u201cper person\u201d limitation is supported by <em>Saltzberg </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>326 Mass. 351 (1950), and by <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 910 (1978). In <em>Saltzberg, </em>this court held that a husband who paid for his wife\u2019s medical expenses did not suffer a distinct injury entitling him to a separate recovery under the automobile liability policy. We stated that \u201cthe financial loss due to the payment of medical and similar expenses is only one item of damage caused by the tortious injury to the [wife].\u201d <em>Saltzberg </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., supra </em>at 354. A claim for loss of consortium stands on different footing, however. \u201cWe believe there is a major difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>between these two causes of action. Unlike loss of consortium, the expense of medical care does not constitute an independent tort against the uninjured spouse, but merely represents one form of damages which flow from the other spouse\u2019s injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., supra </em>at 607 n.6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In <em>Vokey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>381 Mass. 386 (1980), we intimated, although the issue was not directly before us, that a loss of consortium claimant is entitled to separate \u201cper person\u201d coverage, <em>id. </em>at 388-389, and that a contrary interpretation would improperly merge the recovery of the loss of consortium claimant with that of the person sustaining bodily injury, <em>id. </em>at 390 n.5. Because we conclude that the insurers\u2019 interpretation is incompatible with the independent status of the loss of consortium injury as well as with the language of the policy, we hold that additional \u201cper person\u201d coverage exists for the distinct injury suffered by a loss of consortium claimant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Accordingly, we remand Robert Bilodeau vs. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company to the Superior Court for the entry of a declaratory judgment that Lumbermens is liable to Bilodeau in the liquidated amount of $42,500. We reverse the judgment in Royal Insurance Company of America <em>vs. </em>Stanley J. Jarzembowski &amp; others, and remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of a declaratory judgment that the insurer is liable within the $20,000 \u201cper accident\u201d limit for any damages awarded in the primary action to Ann Marie Jarzembowski and the Jarzembowski daughters for loss of consortium.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> The term \u201cper person\u201d appears on the coverage selections page incorporated in each policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\"> The sections we quote in the text are taken from the 1981 standard policy issued by Royal.

L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, sixth par., as amended by St. 1964, c. 517, \u00a7 2. Section 34A was amended by St. 1979, c. 611, \u00a7 2, to require minimum coverage limits of $10,000 \u201cper person\u201d and $20,000 \u201cper accident,\u201d the limits in effect for the insured under Royal\u2019s 1981 policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b558-5\"> As set forth in Royal\u2019s brief in support of its motion for summary judgment, Royal \u201chas offered the sum of $10,000.00 in full settlement of all claims on the basis that the [loss of consortium] claims of the wife and the children fall within the $10,000.00 per person coverage.\u201d Royal relies on the holding of <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 910 (1978), that the \u201cper-person limits apply to the aggregate damage awards recovered by the [loss of consortium plaintiffs] and [the bodily-injured plaintiff] arising out of [the] bodily injuries.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\"> The policy language parallels, and must be construed consistently with, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as amended through St. 1979, c. 611, \u00a7 2, which includes within compulsory coverage \u201cfor bodily injuries\u201d such consequential damages as \u201cexpenses incurred by a husband, wife, parent or guardian for medical, nursing, hospital or surgical services.\u201d Section 34A, like parts 1 and 5 of the standard policy, does not explicitly refer to coverage for loss of consortium claims. Compare parts 3 and 7, which explicitly cover damages to \u201c[a]nyone else . . . entitled to recover because of [bodily] injury to a person covered under [parts 3 or 7],\u201d and part 2, which explicitly limits coverage to medical expenses, lost wages, and replacement services. Because the insurers do not dispute that coverage \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d in the statute and policy includes loss of consortium claims, but argue instead that the \u201cper person\u201d liability limit applies to the aggregate claims of the bodily-injured person and the loss of consortium claimants, we need not today decide the question of coverage under parts 1 and 5 or under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">However, we note that the overwhelming majority of motor vehicle liability policies litigated in other jurisdictions explicitly cover or have been construed to cover loss of consortium claims. See <em>Wohlberg </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>262 F. Supp. 711, 712 (D. Mont. 1967); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Co., </em>245 S.C. 389, 392 (1965); <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gordon, 52 </em>Tenn. App. 1, 25 (1963). Compare <em>Diamond Inf l Corp. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins.

Loss of consortium, by contrast, is not an injury that can be transferred between spouses so as to circumvent policy limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">To the extent that <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., supra, </em>is inconsistent with our holding, we note that it was decided prior to our decision in <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603 (1981), in which we determined that loss of consortium is an independent claim belonging to the spouse (or child) of the physically-injured person. Compare <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Cornelsen, </em>272 Md. 48, 51 (1973), cited by the Appeals Court, in which loss of consortium was characterized as injury to the marital unit. Further, the Appeals Court relied on <em>Saltzberg, </em>which, as we have noted, does not control the question here presented. The Appeals Court in <em>Dunn </em>also found support for its interpretation of the policy before it in cases involving policies that, unlike the policies we review, explicitly incorporated recovery for loss of consortium within the \u201cper person\u201d limit applicable to the bodily-injured party. See <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>9 Ohio App. 2d 265, 268 (1967); <em>Sheffield </em>v. <em>American Indem. Co., </em>245 S.C. 389, 392-393 (1965). See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 252 </em>Ark. 57, 58 (1972); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>127 Cal. App. 3d 568, 570-571 (1981); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>99 N.J. Super. 377, 379 (1968); <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Medi-Cab Inc. of N.Y., </em>114 Misc. 2d 104, 107 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1982); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cassida, </em>403 Pa. 404, 406-407 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b561-5\"> The issue of the appropriate treatment of loss of consortium claims arises in these cases because of the lack of explicit resolution of the question by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, or the standard policy. It may be that the failure of the statute and policy to keep pace with the evolution of the cause of action for loss of consortium has forced insurers into the untenable position that a loss of consortium claimant is within the policy coverage, but not a separate \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of liability limits. Action by the Legislature to amend the statute, or permission of the Commissioner of Insurance to clarify the extent of coverage for consortium claims, would be beneficial to insurers as well as policyholders.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
