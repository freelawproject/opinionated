App. Ct. 622, 623 (1983). We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>with the Appeals Court\u2019s well-reasoned analysis on the issue of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty or, in the alternative, for a required finding of not guilty of so much of the indictment as charged being masked. <em>Id. </em>at 623-627. However, we conclude that the record supports a determination that the judge knew he had discretion to exclude the defendant\u2019s prior convictions but chose to exercise his discretion to permit the prosecutor to use them. We therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the prosecutor informed the judge and defense counsel that, if the defendant elected to testify, the Commonwealth would seek to introduce evidence of prior convictions to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a721. Defense counsel moved to have the convictions excluded on the ground that many of the prior convictions were for armed robbery and hence would be \u201cvery, very prejudicial.\u201d Defense counsel suggested that the jurors would be influenced by them in considering the merits of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The prosecutor stated that \u201cunder the recent case law, the <em>Diaz </em>case, I think it is, . . . even if [the convictions are] similar in nature it\u2019s within the discretion of the judge to let them in.\u201d Defense counsel agreed that use of the convictions to impeach was a ruling within the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">After hearing argument from both counsel, the judge said, \u201cIt is my belief that we are dealing with a statute here, Section 21 of Chapter 233, and until the Legislature decides to change that statute, if they ever do, any attorney may introduce convictions which come under that statute either in a civil or a criminal proceeding. That would apply to the District Attorney or defense counsel . . . .\u201d The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion and noted defense counsel\u2019s objection. The defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In reversing the conviction, the Appeals Court concluded that the judge\u2019s \u201clanguage . . . appears to be a ruling that the judge had no discretion to exclude the convictions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 622, 627 (1983). We agree with the Appeals Court that \u201ca ruling that the court has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>power to allow [a motion], when in truth the allowance is discretionary, is an error of law that can be corrected on [appeal].\u201d <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Cadogan, </em>313 Mass. 133, 134-135 (1943). \u201cIt is one thing to consider that right [to admit or exclude prior convictions] and exercise it either way, but having been given that right, analogous to discretion, it is the duty of the judge to exercise it, and it is error as a matter of law to refuse to exercise it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 571 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Clearly, judges now have discretion to preclude the use of prior convictions to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIn the <em>Chase </em>case, 372 Mass. [736,] 750 [1977], qualifying our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>357 Mass. 245, 249 (1970), and building upon thoughts expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 680-682 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delorey, </em>369 Mass. 323, 331 (1975) (Hennessey, J., concurring), we said that \u2018we would not deny the right of a judge to avoid any question of unfairness by excluding such evidence in a situation where the likely prejudice to the defendant is most intense.\u2019 However, this was not put in terms of reviewable discretion, and we have held that the refusal of a trial judge to exercise the \u2018right\u2019 mentioned in <em>Chase </em>is not a basis for appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass. 73, 80 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McTigue, </em>384 Mass. 814, 815 (1981). Thus, \u201c[a]s long as the judge exercises discretion and there is no unfairness in a due process sense <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750 [1977]), the statutory provisions (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21) concerning the admission of evidence of prior convictions control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>391 Mass. 691, 695 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The narrow question before us is whether the judge knew he had discretion and exercised it, or believed that his decision was compelled by the statute. We believe the record can support a conclusion that the judge knew he had discretion and exercised it in favor of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">During the hearing on the motion, both counsel told the judge that a ruling either way was within his discretion, and each urged the judge to exercise discretion in favor of his position. Thus, this is not a case where the judge was unaware of his right to use discretion. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. McFarland, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 948, 949 (1983) (prosecutor argued that the judge had no discretion; judge stated that he was \u201cbound\u201d by the statute). During the hearing, the judge noted that the Commonwealth would \u201chave to prove this defendant joined that so-called joint enterprise to commit the crime of armed robbery and the only \u2014 the evidence against your defendant was that he was in an automobile which took one of the other defendants away.\u201d He also noted that the Commonwealth had the burden of proof. We think the judge\u2019s comments on the nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and its burden of proof during the proceedings support a conclusion that the judge knew he had discretion and exercised it in favor of the Commonwealth. Compare <em>id. </em>(\u201c[T]he judge denied the motion, noting that \u2018until the Legislature accepts the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s invitation to deal with an amendment to . . . [G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21], I feel that I am bound by the simple terms of that statute\u2019\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Diaz, </em>383 Mass. 73, 80 (1981). The judge\u2019s comment that he would always permit the use of prior convictions to impeach was unfortunate and should not have been made. However, the record viewed as a whole indicates that \u201c[t]he judge was aware that he had discretion to bar the use of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions for impeachment,\u201d <em>Commonwealth s. King, </em>391 Mass. 691, 694 (1984), and considered, albeit less thoroughly than we might wish, the impact of admission of the convictions in the particular case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>We conclude that reversal of the conviction is not required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The defendant also alleges that he was denied due process because he was punished for exercising his right to a jury trial. Specifically, the defendant argues that, because his two codefendants who pleaded guilty were given shorter sentences, we should conclude that his sentence was unconstitutionally imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant has failed to provide us with the records and social histories which the probation department had compiled for the trial judge. Thus, this issue is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We observe, however, that on the limited record before us, it is clear that the judge based his sentences on an assessment of each defendant\u2019s prior record, age, and character. It is also clear that the defendant had the most extensive prior criminal record of the men involved in this robbery. The judge also noted that the disparity in the prosecutor\u2019s sentencing recommendation for Knight \u201chad to do with [the defendant Knight\u2019s] past criminal record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">On the record before us there is no suggestion of vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor or the judge, see <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>693 F.2d 236, 237-238 (1st Cir. 1982), cert, denied, 460 U.S. 1098 (1983). \u201cThe judge is permitted great latitude in sentencing, provided the sentence does not exceed statutory limits. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Latimer, </em>415 F.2d 1288 (6th Cir. [1969]).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Celeste, </em>358 Mass. 307, 310 (1970). \u201cIn addition to the nature of the offense, a wide variety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of factors can be taken into account, such as the defendant\u2019s character, background and prior record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longval, </em>378 Mass. 246, 253 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> Of course, if a defendant moves to exclude evidence of prior convictions for impeachment purposes, the judge may condition such exclusion on the defendant\u2019s agreement not to impeach the credibility of the Commonwealth witnesses by the use of prior convictions. We note, however, that, where a defendant seeks to impeach a witness on the ground of bias, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>368 Mass. 182, 189 (1975), the judge may be required to permit the defendant to impeach the witness with the witness\u2019s prior convictions. <em>See Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 320 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The judge could have concluded that, in light of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, the defendant could have had little, if any, incentive to tell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>truth, and in such circumstances, it would not deny the defendant a fair trial to permit the Commonwealth to impeach the defendant with his prior convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\"> \u201cFor any relief from the alleged severity of the sentences . . . recourse ... is to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 28A-28D.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 664 (1980). \u201cWe express no view as to how the Appellate Division should exercise its discretion in ruling on such an application, if made.\u201d <em>Lena </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 571, 578 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is no suggestion in the defendant\u2019s brief that the sentence exceeded any presumptive sentencing guidelines. Further, the sentence is well within the statute governing masked armed robbery. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
