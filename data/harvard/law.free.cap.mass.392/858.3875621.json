L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, for conduct unbecoming a teacher. In its answer, the town claimed that DES was obliged to give issue-preclusive effect to the discharge proceeding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>had to conclude that the teacher\u2019s discharge was \u201cattributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (&lt;?) (2), as amended by St. 1982, c. 489, \u00a7 5. Thus, the town asserts that the teacher was disqualified from receiving benefits, and that DES is not entitled to any reimbursement under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 15, for benefits paid to the teacher.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The instant appeal puts the cart before the horse because on this record it appears that issues relating to the teacher\u2019s entitlement to benefits are currently the subject of appeals pending in a District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">We summarize the somewhat tortuous procedural background of this case. The teacher, Marjorie Springgate, was discharged on June 21, 1978, following an evidentiary hearing which, the school committee found, substantiated charges that on various occasions from May 15, 1977, through March 24, 1978, she disrupted classes of other teachers, pushed a student, made false statements to administrative officials, behaved in an argumentative and overbearing manner, and, after being warned that further unprofessional conduct would be grounds for termination, made additional false statements and pushed another teacher. The teacher appealed the school committee\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A. During the pendency of that appeal, the teacher applied for and received unemployment benefits from DES in a decision which the town has appealed and which, the town advises us, is currently pending in a District Court awaiting resolution of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">After a trial de nova, a Superior Court judge found that none of the charges against the teacher was substantiated by credible evidence, and that the school committee had failed to establish the teacher\u2019s dismissal for \u201cinefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher . . . insubordination or other good cause.\u201d G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, as amended through St. 1972, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>c. 464, \u00a7 2. The Superior Court judge entered judgment reinstating the teacher. The school committee appealed to the Appeals Court, which, concluding that the Superior Court judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, reversed and remanded for the entry of judgment upholding the discharge. <em>Spring gate </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304(1981).-Following the Appeals Court\u2019s decision, the teacher again applied for, and again obtained, unemployment benefits from DES; the town\u2019s appeal from that decision, according to the town, is currently pending in the District Court along with the appeal of the earlier decision awarding benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">One week after the Appeals Court upheld the discharge, DES filed a complaint under G.L.c. 151A, \u00a7 15, in a District Court to recover from the town amounts paid to the teacher during the period from her discharge until February, 1979, which appears to be the month in which she was reinstated by the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 2, 1982, a District Court judge entered judgment, along with findings and rulings, in favor of DES. The town appealed to the Appellate Division of the District Courts. On April 19, 1983, the Appellate Division, finding no error, affirmed. The town filed a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We note our disapproval of the sequence in which these intertwined cases are being litigated. The general rule is that a judgment may be collaterally attacked only \u201cif other means of obtaining relief from the judgment are unavailable to the applicant or the convenient administration of justice would be served by determining the question of relief in the course of the subsequent action.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 80 (1982). See <em>V\u00f3se </em>v. <em>Morton, 4 </em>Cush. 27, 31 (1849). Issues pertaining to the validity of DES decisions awarding benefits to the teacher are appropriately resolved on the pending direct appeals from those decisions, not by means of collateral attack in the instant litigation. General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 15 <em>(b), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>as amended through St. 1948, c. 603, \u00a7 6, provides that \u201c[ajctions brought under this subsection shall be given precedence over other civil cases <em>except petitions for review arising under </em>[G. <em>L. c. 151A, \u00a7 </em>42]\u201d (emphasis added). The town was therefore remiss in litigating the current action prior to the appeal from the DES decision awarding the benefits in question. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Absent special circumstances, determination of a cause of action entirely contingent on the validity of an appealed judgment in a separate proceeding should be stayed pending resolution of the appellate process unless the detriment to the litigants of delay outweighs the benefits of judicial economy and orderly adjudication. In light of the town\u2019s right to have the \u00a7 42 petition for review adjudicated before an adjudication of the \u00a7 15 action, as well as its alternative right to be credited or reimbursed, after payment, for any amounts determined to have been paid erroneously, see G.L.c. 151A,\u00a7 18, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 489, \u00a7 4, we perceive no such detriment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The record before us is completely bereft of information regarding the substance of the DES decisions. Given this deficiency and the procedural posture of the cases, we think the issue is not properly before us. Nonetheless, to resolve any existing uncertainty, we shall consider whether the adjudication that the teacher\u2019s discharge was authorized under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, precluded DES from determining that the teacher\u2019s discharge is not \u201cattributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the [town\u2019s] interest.\u201d See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943). We answer that question in the negative. We leave open questions concerning the extent, if any, to which specific factual findings in a G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, adjudication are entitled to preclusive effect in any subsequent G. L. c. 151A proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Issue preclusion operates to prevent a party from relitigating an adjudicated issue essential to a valid and final prior judgment binding on that party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Almeida </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>383 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Mass. 226, 229-230 (1981). Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). The findings of the school committee were not, however, entitled to preclusive effect because they were divested of the requisite finality upon the filing of an appeal entitling the teacher to a de nova review in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 0.416[3], at 523 (1983). Compare <em>Almeida </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., supra </em>at 230-231 (findings of administrative tribunal given preclusive effect where court limited to substantial evidence review). The town\u2019s argument that the determination of the Appeals Court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should have been given preclusive effect is unavailing because the Appeals Court had not yet decided the appeal at the time DES adjudicated the teacher\u2019s eligibility for the benefits at issue in this G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 15, action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In addition, the town\u2019s allegation of error founders on the basic requirement for issue preclusion: commonness of issues. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>The standard of \u201cinefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher . . . insubordination or other good cause,\u201d on which discharges under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, must be grounded is substantially less rigorous than the G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), standard of \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest,\u201d pursuant to which a claimant may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Discharge proceedings focus on the needs of the school committee, and a discharge will be upheld upon \u201cany ground which is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, in bad faith, or irrelevant to the committee\u2019s task of running a sound school system.\u201d <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Mattapoisett, supra </em>at 308, and cases cited. In marked contrast, \u201cthe critical issue in determining whether disqualification [for unemployment benefits] is warranted is the claimant\u2019s state of mind in performing the acts that cause [her] discharge.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979). Thus, there is no basis under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), for denying benefits to \u201ca worker [who] is ill-equipped for [her] job or has a good faith lapse in judgment or attention,\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra, </em>conduct which might well support a discharge under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. We think it clear that the requisite element of identity of issues is lacking and that a determination that a tenured teacher was properly discharged does not preclude DES from finding that teacher eligible for benefits. Compare <em>Amador </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., </em>35 Cal. 3d 671 (1984). <em>See Ferris </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>135 Ariz. 329 (Ct. App. 1983). But see <em>In re Claim of Ranni, </em>58 N.Y.2d 715 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The Appeals Court\u2019s decision on which the town mistakenly relies illustrates the difference in the standards under the two statutes. The Appeals Court determined that \u201cthe evidence . . . substantiated a sufficient number of the series of relatively minor incidents to justify the school committee\u2019s determination of <em>incapacity or conduct unbecoming a </em>teacher\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Mattapoisett, supra </em>at 316. The court characterized the teacher\u2019s behavior as an <em>\u201cinability or unwillingness </em>... to eschew displays of rudeness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>and tactlessness in front of students and to work in a cooperative and civil manner with her colleagues\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>The Appeals Court could not conduct an inquiry into whether the teacher\u2019s conduct was \u201cdeliberate,\u201d or whether it was in \u201cwilful disregard\u201d of the school committee\u2019s interests, and it made no such inquiry. \u201cFindings [by the agency] as to both of these issues under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) must be made to warrant disapproval of benefits.\u201d <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206, 208-209 (1984). See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 779-781 (1982). The discharge adjudication had no bearing on \u201c[t]he critical factual issue ... [of the teacher\u2019s] state of mind at the time of [her] misconduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 779, and could not preclude a finding by DES that the teacher\u2019s state of mind was not such as to disqualify her from securing benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 14A, the town has elected to pay into the unemployment compensation fund amounts equal to benefits paid by DES under G. L. c. 151A to employees discharged by the town. Such amounts are paid as an alternative to annual contributions to a general unemployment benefits fund at a rate established by G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The complaint originally sought recovery of $4,805.13 but was subsequently amended to reduce DBS\u2019s request for relief to the amount of $2,586.11, a sum including accrued interest. No reimbursement is sought in this G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 15, action for payments to the teacher by DBS in the period following the Appeals Court\u2019s decision upholding the discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> Although DES is technically, at least on appeal, considered a party to the benefits proceedings, see G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42, the town, correctly, does not seek to invoke issue preclusion against DES (which was not a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>to the discharge proceeding), but argues instead that DES, in its role as adjudicator of the benefits proceedings, erred in not giving the discharge proceeding issue preclusive effect against the teacher.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In addition, because the school committee is a party with an interest adverse to the teacher\u2019s in the DES benefits proceedings, see G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 39, its findings in the discharge proceeding should not have preclusive effect against the teacher before DES. See <em>Marion County School Bd. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 So. 2d 831 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\"> To the extent the town relies on \u201cfindings\u201d by the Appeals Court, such reliance is misplaced. Appellate courts are not fact finders. \u201cThe duty of weighing evidence and of finding facts ... in an action at law is not an appropriate function of [an appellate] court . . . .\u201d <em>Tardiff, petitioner, </em>328 Mass. 265, 267 (1952), quoting <em>Atlantic Maritime Co. </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>228 Mass. 519, 522 (1917). In a \u00a7 42 discharge proceeding appealed to the Superior Court, fact-finding is vested in the Superior Court. Compare benefits proceedings before DES, in which fact-finding is committed to the agency. <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 201, 205 (1983). On this appeal, we need not and do not involve ourselves as to what facts remain adjudicated after the Appeals Court\u2019s decision. That decision set aside the trial judge\u2019s findings and assessment of credibility as \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d See <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 310 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\"> Because of the need for prompt adjudication of eligibility for unemployment benefits, only in exceptional cases would a judicial determination whether a teacher was appropriately discharged under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, precede DES adjudication under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\"> We do not reach DBS\u2019s argument that even if principles of issue preclusion were otherwise applicable, the provision in G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), that a discharge must be <em>\u201cshown to the satisfaction of the [DES] director </em>to be attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard\u201d of the employer\u2019s interest is indicative of a legislative intent to vest initial fact-finding in benefits cases with DES, and that DBS is therefore not obliged to give preclusive effect to adjudications by other tribunals. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 83(4)(b) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
