L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, as amended through St. 1975, c. 123, \u00a7\u00a71,2, c. 377, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 164, and for relief from judgment. We affirm the denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">On September 12, 1977, the plaintiff, Coen Marine Equipment, Inc. (Caen Marine), brought an action of contract in the District Court Department, Barnstable Division, seeking recovery of money it had paid to Kurker to secure the release of its barge which had been docked at Kurker\u2019s marina. It also sought compensation from Kurker for items allegedly stolen from the barge while the barge was docked there. The total amount of the claim against Kurker was $2,870.47 plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On January 25, 1980, after a trial before a judge of the District Court, judgment entered for Coen Marine in the amount of $1,400. On January 31, 1980, Kurker moved for a new trial claiming that the judge had agreed to give the parties until the end of January to submit memoranda of law. Kurker also filed a motion for relief from judgment based on the same ground. Both motions were denied on April 9, 1980, out of the presence of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">On November 12, 1981, approximately nineteen months after the denial of his original posttrial motions, Kurker filed in the District Court an entry fee, a bond, and a claim of jury trial in the Superior Court. He also filed a motion to remove the case to the Superior Court and a second motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 104, as amended through St. 1975, c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, c. 377, \u00a7\u00a7 104, 164, states in pertinent part that \u201c[a] party who would have been entitled to remove the case for trial in the superior court as hereinabove provided but for the fact that the amount of the claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim, as the case may be, does not exceed four thousand dollars [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] shall, if he desires trial by the superior court, file said entry [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] and bond <em>within ten days after notice of the decision or finding. </em>Such filing shall have the same effect as a request for retransfer under section one hundred and two C . . . applicable to retransferred cases\u201d (emphasis added). Kurker contended in the District Court, as he does here, that the time within which a party must make the filings appropriate for removal of the case to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, begins to run from the date of notice of denial of a timely motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the present case there was an uncontroverted affidavit from counsel for Kurker which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>stated that the denial of the motion for a new trial was not discovered until November 4, 1981, when a secretary called the Barnstable District Court clerk\u2019s office to inquire about the case. Kurker concluded that by making the filings required for removal on November 12, 1981, he had met the time requirements prescribed , by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104. Kurker\u2019s motion for relief from judgment was simply a back-up effort to reach the same result. In that motion, Kurker requested that the court vacate the judgment of January 25, 1980, and enter a new judgment in the same amount so that the ten-day period for removing the case to the Superior Court would begin anew. On November 23, 1981, both motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On December 3, 1981, Kurker filed a draft report in the District Court claiming to be aggrieved by the denial of his motion for removal and the denial of his second motion for relief from judgment. A hearing was held on the draft report on January 14, 1982, at which time a District Court judge instructed the parties to work out an agreement on the form of the report. After several attempts, the parties were unable to reach agreement. On May 12, 1982, Coen Marine submitted its own draft report and thereafter Kurker filed an amended draft report.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On September 27, 1982, the judge allowed Coen Marine\u2019s draft report<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but did not explicitly disallow Kurker\u2019s draft report. Kurker then petitioned the Appellate Division pursuant to Dist. Mun. Cts. R. Civ. P. 64 (e) (1975) to establish a report. On July 20, 1983, the Appellate Division, concluding that \u201cthe draft report sought to be established discloses no error prejudicial to the rights of the appellant,\u201d denied the petition. The Appellate Division was not required to determine whether the draft report sought to be established conformed to the facts and was otherwise suitable for allowance by the trial judge, if in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>any event it disclosed no prejudicial error. See <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>387 Mass. 682, 685 (1982). Although our reasoning is not the same as that of the Appellate Division, we agree that if the' draft report were established it would disclose no prejudicial error. We hold that under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, the ten-day period for filing the entry fee and bond required for removal of a case from the District Court to the Superior Court begins to run on notice of the decision or finding on the merits after trial, including review by the Appellate Division if requested, and is unaffected by the filing of a motion for a new trial or by action taken or notice given with respect to such a motion. The judge was correct, therefore, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to remove the case to the Superior Court, and there was no abuse of discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment and for entry of a new judgment, which was grounded on the defendant\u2019s incorrect assertion that he had a right at that time to remove the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Kurker\u2019s reliance on <em>McGloin </em>v. <em>Nilson, </em>348 Mass. 716 (1965), and <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 131 (1974), for the proposition that the time prescribed by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, for removal of a case to the Superior Court does not begin to run until after notice of the disposition of a new trial motion is misplaced. In <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Stores, Inc., </em>342 Mass. 161, 163 (1961), we were concerned with the construction of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, inserted by St. 1958, c. 369, \u00a7 3, which permitted the Superior Court to transfer for trial in a District Court any action of tort or contract in which the Superior Court determined that the likelihood of recovery by a plaintiff, if the plaintiff were to prevail, would not exceed a certain amount. It provided further that \u201c[sjuch action shall be tried by a . . . justice of the district court.... The justice shall file a written decision or finding with the clerk .... Any party . . . aggrieved by the finding or decision may as of right have the case retransferred for determination by the superior court. The request for retransfer shall be filed with the clerk of said district court within ten days after notice of the decision or finding. . . . The action shall thereafter be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>in the superior court. The decision of, and the amount of damages assessed, if any, by a district court shall be prima facie evidence upon such matters as are put in issue by the pleadings, and no other findings of such court shall at any time be admissible as evidence or become part of the pleadings.\u201d In <em>Lubell, </em>we focused on the fact that a District Court judge\u2019s finding for the plaintiff would by itself be evidence in the Superior Court warranting a finding for the plaintiff, although \u201c[h]is decision might be based upon an alleged error of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164. We expressed concern that the defendant\u2019s \u201cright to a jury trial would be affected; and there would be reasonable fear that there might be a denial both of due process and of the equal protection of the laws because of discrimination in according the right of review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Responding to our duty to construe G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, in a manner that would be free from constitutional doubts, if possible, we concluded that \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 102C that a case should be transferred \u2018for trial,\u2019 and \u2018shall be tried,\u2019 prescribe a trial with all the normal incidents of procedure in the District Court,\u201d including a report of questions of law to the Appellate Division. <em>Id. </em>at 165. We concluded that only after review of all questions of law by the Appellate Division, if a report were sought, would a case be ready for retransfer by the District Court to the Superior Court. Then \u201c[t]he \u2018decision\u2019 of the District Court judge could . . . have its effect as prima facie evidence and would be free from reasonable constitutional doubts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Having held in <em>Lubell </em>that a case transferred from the Superior Court to the District Court under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, was not ready for retransfer to the Superior Court until Appellate Division review, if sought, were completed, we held in <em>McGloin </em>v. <em>Nilson, supra </em>at 718-719, that the ten-day removal period provided in \u00a7 102C begins to run on notice of the decision or finding following the final disposition of the case by the Appellate Division. Final disposition in the Appellate Division, we observed, \u201cha[s] the result of giving for the first time full force and effect to the finding. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>In <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 131, 136 (1974), we stated that \u201c[t]he similar provisions of [G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104] for a trial in the District Court and for a subsequent transfer to the Superior Court and its requirement that a case so transferred be treated in the same manner as a retransferred case under \u00a7 102C convinces us that we should also apply the language and the time schedule of the <em>Lubell </em>and <em>McGloin </em>cases to those arising under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104.\u201d We held in that case that the defendant lost its right to remove an action from the District Court to the Superior Court by appealing to the Supreme Judicial Court without taking steps to remove the action within ten days after notice of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 134-140.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Our concern, based upon constitutional principles, about giving prima facie effect in the Superior Court to a decision or finding of a District Court judge without giving the parties an opportunity for review by the Appellate Division, led us to conclude in <em>McGloin </em>and <em>Orasz </em>that the ten-day period for removal provided by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 102C and 104, begins to run only after the judge\u2019s decision or finding has been given full force and effect by Appellate Division review, if requested. The filing of a motion for a new trial, calling for an exercise of discretion by the judge, does not trigger the same concerns. There is no unfairness or constitutional infirmity in giving prima facie effect in the Superior Court to a District Court finding which the parties have had an opportunity to challenge through review in the Appellate Division. We see no reason, therefore, to give other than a literal construction to the requirement of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, that if a party desires a trial by the Superior Court, he must file an entry fee and bond \u201cwithin ten days after notice of the decision or finding.\u201d The statute says nothing about a restarting of the ten-day period on notice of the disposition of a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The decision of the District Court judge in favor of Coen Marine in the amount of $1,400 was rendered on January 25, 1980. No report was requested. Kurker\u2019s motion for a new trial, filed on January 31, 1980, establishes that he had prompt notice of the decision made on January 25. Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>time for removal expired at least within ten days after January 31, 1980. Asa result of Kurker\u2019s failure to take the appropriate steps for removal in timely fashion, he lost his right of removal. <em>H.K.
