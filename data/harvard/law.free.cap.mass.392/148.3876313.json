On appeal a judge of the District Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision. The plaintiff appeals to this court from the action taken by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Because the board denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for re-the decision of the review examiner is to be treated as that of the board. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 41 (c), as appearing in St. 1976, c. 473, \u00a7 14. We summarize the findings of the review examiner. The review examiner found that the plaintiff worked as a \u201cmaterial handler\u201d for Teradyne, Inc., from March, 1978, until his discharge on April 28, 1982. \u201cOn April 27, 1982, the claimant refused a direct order of the group leader to tag certain defective products that needed repair. The claimant refused to follow his superior\u2019s request as the claimant, himself, deemed the distribution work he was performing was of paramount importance. When the supervisor learned of the claimant\u2019s refusal, he terminated the claimant in view of a previous disciplinary warning issued to the claimant. On October 16, 1981, the claimant was given a written warning of his refusal at that time to follow a direct order of management. Said warning specifically noted that any further incidents of similar nature could warrant his termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The review examiner also found \u201cthat the claimant was discharged for refusal to carry out an assignment of tagging defective parts; that the claimant as a material handler was required in the past to perform similar tasks although he considered the distribution of repaired parts his primary work function; that there is no evidence ... to reflect [that] the new tasks assigned to him on April 27, 1982, were unreasonable or not within his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>capabilities; that the claimant had been insubordinate on a prior occasion and had been warned his job was in jeopardy.\u201d On the basis of the recited subsidiary findings, the review examiner concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge was attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u201cWhen a discharged worker seeks compensation, the issue before the board is not whether the employer was justified in discharging the claimant but whether the Legislature intended that benefits should be denied in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 95 (1979). In determining whether a discharged employee is precluded from the benefits of G. L. c. 151A by the application of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), two inquiries are appropriate. \u201cBoth \u2018deliberate misconduct\u2019 and \u2018wilful disregard\u2019 of an employer\u2019s interest by the claimant are required to deny benefits under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).\u201d <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206, 208 (1984). <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 778-779 (1982). <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass. 434, 436 (1978). Whether the employee\u2019s alleged misconduct is deliberate and in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest depends on the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misconduct. <em>Jean, supra </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">A review examiner\u2019s decision must contain sufficient subsidiary findings to demonstrate that correct legal principles were applied. <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 626-627 (1984). <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>376 Mass. 563, 565-566 (1978). The decision here fails to demonstrate that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to comply with the group leader\u2019s order to tag defective products was in wilful disregard of the interests of Teradyne, Inc. The fact that the plaintiff had been insubordinate on an occasion six months earlier and had been warned that further incidents \u201cof similar nature could warrant his termination\u201d says little, if anything, about the plaintiff\u2019s attitude concerning his employer\u2019s interest when he disobeyed his group leader\u2019s order on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>April 27,1982, and is not enough to sustain his disqualification from benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Ordinarily in such circumstances we would reverse the decision of the District Court and order that the District Court judge remand the case to the division for further findings. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 782. However, we are presented here with a review examiner\u2019s decision which not only fails to recite subsidiary findings in support of the review examiner\u2019s conclusion, but which also affirmatively sets forth a subsidiary finding which compels the opposite conclusion. The review examiner found that \u201c[t]he claimant refused to follow his superior\u2019s request <em>as the claimant, himself, deemed the distribution work he was performing was of paramount </em>importance\u201d (emphasis supplied). That finding was clearly warranted by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he refused to carry out the group leader\u2019s order, which was given about 10 a.m., because he was \u201cdoing the weekly distributions\u201d on which there was a time limit of 11 a.m. in order to meet certain shipping schedules. The plaintiff testified that from 11:30 a.m. until the end of the day he did the tagging that he had been ordered to do earlier. Since the review examiner made a subsidiary finding, well warranted by the evidence, which compels the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge was not attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest, no good purpose would be served by remanding the case to the division for further findings. Instead, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and judgment shall be entered in the District Court remanding this case to the Division of Employment Security for entry of an order awarding the plaintiff his unemployment compensation benefits in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2), as amended through St. 1982, c. 489, \u00a7 5, states in part that \u201cno benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter ...(e) [f]or the period of unemployment next ensuing and until the individual has had at least four weeks of work and in each of said weeks has earned an amount equivalent to or in excess of his weekly benefit amount after he has left his work ...
