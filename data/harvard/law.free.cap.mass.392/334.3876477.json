J), </em>we concluded that USM Corporation (USM) had taken sufficient, reasonable steps to preserve the secrecy of trade secret information contained in a machine used in the manufacture of blind rivets so that the trade secret was entitled to protection. We remanded the case for further proceedings which appeared likely to involve (a) consideration of the master\u2019s accounting of profits as to the defendants\u2019 operations in Massachusetts from January 1,1964, to December 31, 1972, and (b) consideration of the defendants\u2019 Massachusetts operations subsequent to the period covered by the master\u2019s report and out-of-State operations not covered by his report. <em>Id. </em>at 105 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">A judge of the Superior Court modified and confirmed the master\u2019s report and, following twenty-four days of hearings in March and April, 1981, he made findings and rulings and entered an order for judgment in August, 1981. The judgment, as amended, (a) assessed liability on the Marson defendants in the approximate amount of $4,362,000, representing the corporate defendants\u2019 accountable profits from all their blind rivet manufacturing operations through December 31, 1979 (in Australia through June 30, 1980), (b) required the parties to determine accountable profits from those dates to the date of the judgment, (c) assessed punitive damages against the Marson defendants in the approximate amount of $2,181,000 (50% of the accountable profits), and (d) assessed liability in the amount of approximately $15,800 against the defendant Lahnston, based on the proportion of the accountable profits accruing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>through the date on which his employment by the Marson defendants terminated in February, 1965, and assessed punitive damages against Lahnston at 50% of his liability. The judgment also enjoined all defendants, including Lahnston, from the use or communication of USM\u2019s trade secret for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The defendants have appealed from this judgment challenging various aspects of the determination of the accountable profits and challenging the issuance of the injunction. Lahnston by his appeal argues that, because (as the judge found) he earned no profits from the misappropriation of USM\u2019s trade secret, USM is not entitled to a money judgment against him. USM in turn has appealed challenging the judge\u2019s failure to award it prejudgment interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. USM also argues on appeal that Lahnston should be held jointly and severally liable with the Marson defendants for all the accountable profits. We allowed applications for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment except that the award of punitive damages against all defendants and the assessment of damages against Lahnston should be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The facts supporting liability can be stated briefly. The Mar-son defendants undertook in 1961 to manufacture blind rivets in competition with USM. Dissatisfied with the performance of their own blind rivet assembly machines, they undertook to construct an assembly machine like the USM machine using improperly obtained USM drawings and the services of Lahnston, a former USM junior engineer, who was acquainted with the USM trade secret, a unique and effective combination of features incorporated in the USM machine. The Marson defendants made use of the trade secret in manufacturing blind rivets in Massachusetts, Canada, and Australia and earned profits from the sale of blind rivets from 1965 to 1980, inclusive, as set forth in the master\u2019s report (as modified) or as found by the judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only by use of the trade secret were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Marson defendants able to engage in the profitable manufacture and sale of blind rivets.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">General Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Because all the issues argued on appeal concern the relief to which USM is entitled, we first set forth the general principles that guide the determination of the money judgment in favor of USM. USM has waived any damage claim based on its losses, if any, from the trade secret violation and claims instead the profits the defendants realized from their tortious conduct. See <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>377 Mass. 159, 169-170 (1979) <em>(Jet Spray II). </em>Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a defendant made a profit from the sale of products produced by improper use of a trade secret, the burden shifts-to the defendant to demonstrate those costs properly to be offset against its profit and the portion of its profit attributable to factors other than the trade secret. <em>Id. </em>at 174 n.14. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(b) (1982) (copyright act). If a defendant cannot meet its burden as to costs and profits, the defendant must suffer the consequences. <em>Jet Spray II, supra </em>at 183. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>over-all object is to render \u201cthe ultimate recovery a sound reflection of [the defendants\u2019] unjust enrichment due to the exploitation of the secret, and no more.\u201d See <em>USM Corp. I, supra </em>at 105 n. 17; <em>Jet Spray II, supra </em>at 183 n.22. Of course, such a process may result in the plaintiff\u2019s recovering far more than its actual loss. <em>Id. </em>at 182-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to several arguments the defendants advance, challenging the determination of the profits allocable to the use of the trade secret. The fact that the trade secret may have been, as the defendants argue, only a \u201cminor improvement\u201d and one made by USM at a low cost of development is irrelevant. It was this improvement alone, even if it was \u201cminor,\u201d that, as the master and the judge warrantably found, permitted the defendants to make a profit from the manufacture of blind rivets. Although the defendants\u2019 use of the trade secret was involved in only a portion of the entire process of manufacturing and selling blind rivets, the defendants failed to prove a contribution to profits from any element other than the use of the trade secret, such as management skill or capital investment. See <em>USM Corp. I, supra </em>at 105 n.17; <em>Jet Spray II, supra </em>at 183 n.23. The availability of other machines to manufacture blind rivets without the use of the trade secret cannot aid the defendants because the use of the trade secret alone was the reason for the defendants\u2019 profitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The fact that use of the trade secret was the sole reason for the defendants\u2019 profitability makes it appropriate to measure USM\u2019s recovery by consideration of the defendants\u2019 profits from the manufacture and sale of blind rivets and inappropriate to consider only the value, or cost saving, to the defendants arising from the use of the trade secret. See <em>Jet Spray II, supra </em>at 172. Obviously, in some other situation, the use of a trade secret might well not be the sole source of a defendant\u2019s profits and thus the defendant\u2019s entire profits from the sale of a product manufactured by use of the trade secret would not be a just measure of the restitution owed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The guiding principle is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>order the wrongdoing defendant to give up all gain attributable to the misuse of the trade secret and to measure that gain as accurately as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Lahnston\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The defendant Lahnston makes a straightforward, unassailable argument that, because he received no profit from the sale of blind rivets manufactured by use of USM\u2019s trade secret, he is not liable in damages. If USM were making a claim of its lost profits because of the tortious appropriation and use of its trade secret, Lahnston could well be viewed as jointly and severally liable with the other defendants. Here, however, Lahnston has not been unjustly enriched by the use of USM\u2019s trade secret. He was not a corporate insider who, with others, might be obliged to pay damages because of \u201ctheir mutual enjoyment of the benefits of those secrets as stockholders, officers and directors.\u201d <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>361 Mass. 835, 844 (1972). See <em>Jet Spray II, </em>377 Mass, at 181; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>453 F.2d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no showing that Lahnston received any gain from the misappropriation and use of USM\u2019s trade secret or that he was in a position with others to decide how to divide the spoils. Thus, although Lahnston is a tortfeasor because of his misappropriation of USM\u2019s trade secret and is, as he concedes, subject to the injunction contained in the judgment, he is not liable for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Allocation of Expenses: The Incremental Cost Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Turning then to USM\u2019s recovery of monetary relief against the Marson defendants, we consider first whether the judge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>correct, as a matter of law, in allowing as deductions from gross profit only those costs that were shown to have been incurred because of the production and sale of blind rivets. Certainly the cost of labor and materials directly related to the manufacture of blind rivets was allowable, and there is no dispute about the recognition of such items of cost in measuring the defendants\u2019 net profits. The defendants argue that selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses should have been allocated on the basis of the sales ratios of tainted and untainted products. The master accepted this approach. USM argues, on the contrary, that SG&amp;A expenses should be determined on an incremental cost approach so that only those items of SG&amp;A expense that were increased by the production and sale of blind rivets may be deducted from gross profit. In this process all the defendants\u2019 expenses that would have been incurred if they had manufactured no blind rivets would be disregarded. This approach, which has also been called the \u201cdifferential cost or marginal profit theory\u201d <em>(Century Distilling Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Distilling Corp., </em>205 F.2d 140, 147 [3d Cir.], cert, denied, 346 U.S. 900 [1953]), measures the profit derived from the defendants\u2019 offending conduct. The burden is on a defendant to prove those costs that were variable and were incurred in the offending operation. <em>Jet Spray II, supra </em>at 174 n.14. The judge was correct in concluding that the defendants were not entitled to allocate their SG&amp;A expenses on the basis of sales ratios.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Although our cases have not recognized the incremental cost approach as such, they are consistent with its use. In <em>Regis </em>v. <em>H.A. Jaynes &amp; Co., </em>191 Mass. 245, 252 (1906), a trademark violation case, the defendants did not offer to show that their general expenses had been increased at all by their sale of the goods unlawfully having the plaintiff\u2019s trademark, and we denied the defendants the right to deduct the amount of any expenses not shown to be properly chargeable to the infringing goods. We followed this same approach in <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Page Co., </em>264 Mass. 199, 206-207 (1928), and in <em>Eno </em>v. <em>Prime Mfg. Co., </em>314 Mass. 686, 692-693 (1943). In another trademark case, the defendant\u2019s dealings in goods bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s trademark was a substantial and integral part of its business and, because we concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s general expenses have been at least proportionately increased\u201d by the manufacture and sale of the offending goods, we allowed general expenses to be apportioned on the basis of sales ratios. <em>C.A. Briggs Co. </em>v. <em>National Wafer Co., </em>215 Mass. 100, 110 (1913). The principle we apply is recognized in Restatement of Torts \u00a7 748 comment i (1938),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was applied in <em>Carter Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>214 F. Supp. 383, 403 (D. Md. 1963), <em>andSheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., </em>106 F.2d 45, 54 (2d Cir. 1939), aff\u2019d, 309 U.S. 390 (1940). The result of this approach is that, where proof is impossible (perhaps because of the unavailability of precise data), the offending defendant takes the consequences. See <em>Jet Spray, II, supra </em>at 174 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">One other aspect of the allocation of SG&amp;A expenses relates to the defendants\u2019 claim that the judge should have considered the combined SG&amp;A expenses of Marson Fastener Corporation (Fastener), which only assembled rivets and manufactured rivet setting guns, and of Marson Corporation (Marson), which sold rivets purchased from Fastener and handled a variety of products. Their books were separately maintained until their merger in 1979. The judge was not required as a matter of law to disregard the expenses separately allocated and was warranted in finding, both on the evidence before him and as an ultimate conclusion on the master\u2019s subsidiary findings, that only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Fastener\u2019s SG&amp;A expenses were properly allocable to the offending operation. If, in fact, any SG&amp;A expense of Marson was incremental and attributable to the offending operation, the burden was on the defendants to prove it. To the extent that the allocation on the defendants\u2019 books of costs between Fastener and Marson was haphazard or arbitrary, the solution was not to merge all their SG&amp;A expenses but to place on the defendants the consequences of their failure of proof. See <em>USM Corp. </em>/, 379 Mass, at 92 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Deduction of Income Taxes</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The defendants argue that, in determining the profits payable to USM, they should be allowed to deduct income taxes paid on any profits found to be attributed to their improper use of the trade secret.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In our prior opinion in this case, a minority of the court (with the majority taking no position) suggested that \u201callocable taxes\u201d were properly allowable. See <em>USM Corp. I, supra </em>at 105 n.17. Because the object is to determine as precisely as possible the gain derived from the wrongful use of a trade secret and to take that gain away from the wrongdoer, an allowance of a deduction for income-based taxes seems theoretically appropriate. The goal is to determine the defendants\u2019 net profit, not its gross profit. Taxes, therefore, are as much a proper allowance against the gross profit as is any other cost obligation incurred in generating that profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In spite of the apparent reasonableness of allowing a credit for income taxes paid or payable because of any trade secret profit, the great weight of authority in recent decades in Federal trademark, copyright, and patent cases is to deny a deduction for income taxes paid if the infringing or wrongdoing defendant was a wilful violator of the plaintiff\u2019s trade secret right or some other right. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>National Lead Co., </em>272 F.2d 867, 873 (9th Cir. 1959), cert, denied, 362 U.S. 950 (1960) (trademark infringement); <em>Century Distilling Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Distilling Corp., </em>205 F.2d 140, 148 (3d Cir. 1953) (trademark infringement); <em>Alfred Bell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Catalda Fine Arts, Inc. </em>191 F.2d 99, 106 (2d Cir. 1951) (copyright infringement); <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., </em>106 F.2d 45, 53 (2d Cir. 1939) (copyright infringement); <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Overman Cushion Tire Co., </em>95 F.2d 978, 985 (6th Cir. 1937), dismissed on motion of counsel, 306 U.S. 665 (1939) (patent infringement). Contra <em>W.E. Bassett Co. </em>v. <em>Revlon, Inc. </em>435 F.2d 656, 665 (2d Cir. 1970) (trademark infringement, no discussion of the issue, no authority cited).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The pattern of disallowing a deduction for income taxes has been substantially dictated by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, written by Justice Holmes, in <em>L.P. Larson, Jr., Co. </em>v. <em>Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co., </em>277 U.S. 97 (1928). The Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>concluded that, when a defendant is a conscious and deliberate wrongdoer and the plaintiff has to pay a tax on its recovery, it is \u201cjust that the further deduction [for taxes] should not be allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The reasoning in the <em>Larson </em>opinion in support of denying a deduction of income taxes is unpersuasive. The fact that a plaintiff may be subject to income tax liability on its recovery has nothing to do with measuring a defendant\u2019s gain from its wrongdoing. We simply disagree with the statement in <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>National Lead Co., </em>156 F. Supp. 883, 892 (N.D. Cal. 1957), aff\u2019d, 272 F.2d 867 (9th Cir. 1959), cert, denied, 362 U.S. 950 (1960), allowing a deduction for State franchise taxes, that the justification for denying a deduction for income taxes is the taxability to the plaintiff of its recovery. The further fact that the defendant was a knowing and intentional tortfeasor may justify rendering judgment and resolving unanswerable damages questions against it but it cannot justify ignoring an ascertainable expense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no sound reason for treating income taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>paid as different from all the other expenses involved in generating the gain that must be extracted from a defendant. Judge Learned Hand recognized the illogic of the distinction made in the <em>Larson </em>case but thought it acceptable because the defendant was a wilful bad actor. <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., </em>106F.2d45 (2dCir. 1939), affd, 309U.S. 390(1940). \u201cIt does indeed seem somewhat arbitrary to distinguish this from other expenses necessary to the business; yet on the other hand the distinction illustrates that in dealing with a conscious wrong-doer, courts do not feel obliged for consistency\u2019s sake to take one extreme or the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In a recent case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit undertook to justify the denial of a deduction for income taxes in a design patent case in which the patent holder was entitled to recover the infringer\u2019s \u201ctotal profit.\u201d See <em>Schnadig Corp. </em>v. <em>Gaines Mfg. Co., </em>620F.2d 1166,1169-1171 (6th Cir. 1980); 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 289 (1982). That court concluded that, because the infringer would be entitled to a tax deduction on the amounts it paid, the infringer would obtain a benefit from the allowance of that deduction, while the plaintiff would be taxable on the amount recovered. <em>Id. </em>at 1169. The Sixth Circuit opinion raised a valid point, as far as it went, because, if the amounts paid are deductible and consist of only after-tax profits, the wrongdoer will obtain a tax benefit from its improper use of the trade secret.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The cure, however, for the problem the Sixth Circuit opinion raises is not to disallow tax deductions but to assure that any tax benefit from the defendant\u2019s payment of after-tax profits to the plaintiff will also be taken from the defendant. This can be done by assuring that, as the tax benefit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>if any, of such a payment is determined, the defendant makes further payment to the plaintiff. Such a process was proposed by the court in <em>W.W. Sly Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Pangborn Corp., </em>276 F. 971, 977 (D. Md. 1921), aff\u2019d, 284 F. 217, 220 (4th Cir. 1922), cert, denied, 260 U.S. 749 (1923), and endorsed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>Macbeth-Evans Glass Co. </em>v. <em>L.E. Smith Glass Co., 23 </em>F.2d 459, 463 (3d Cir. 1927).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the process of paying damages could be drawn out over several years, as each payment to the plaintiff of a tax benefit derived from the payment of damages itself may generate a tax benefit, we would not reject such a resolution if a defendant presented the necessary data to support the entry of such a judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The defendants have made no extended argument along the lines suggested in this opinion. They ignore the great weight of authority against their position and do not attempt to distinguish it. Record references to the impact of taxes on the defendants\u2019 profits do not permit the kind of analysis this opinion suggests. The defendants make no acknowledgment that any tax benefit arising from the payment of damages has to be reflected in the process of determining damages. Moreover, if one were to engage in the fine tuning of the appropriate monetary recovery that this opinion suggests might be done in order to measure the defendants\u2019 true gain, recognition would have to be given to the value of that gain to the defendants between the time it was earned and the time the judgment is satisfied. The defendants do not acknowledge that fact and resist any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>award of additional recovery because of the value to them (at least in theory) of holding their improperly earned profits over a period of years. In these circumstances, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion to deny the defendants a deduction for income taxes paid was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Recovery of Prejudgment Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In the midst of our consideration of the defendants\u2019 claims of error by the trial judge, we turn to an issue on which USM claims the judge erred \u2014 the denial to USM of prejudgment interest. We consider the interest issue at this point because its resolution is related in part to the answers just given to the questions of the disallowance of a deduction of income taxes and the allocation of expenses to offset gross profit. USM argues that the judge should have awarded prejudgment interest, relying both on statutory provisions and on common law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In <em>Jet Spray II, </em>377 Mass, at 182 n.21, a case involving recovery of the defendants\u2019 profits and the misappropriation of trade secrets, we rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that it was entitled to interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, from the date of the commencement of the action. USM urges us to reconsider that holding because, it is claimed, that holding is inconsistent with our treatment of other tort awards under \u00a7 6B.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Section 6B awards interest on a tort judgment \u201cfor damage to property\u201d from the date of the commencement of the action, and the judgment thus undertakes in a general way to make the plaintiff whole. This trade secret case is different because the monetary award based on the defendants\u2019 profits is not designed to make the plaintiff whole and because here the defendants\u2019 monetary gain accmed after the commencement of this action (see <em>Jet Spray II, supra), </em>unlike the typical tort action where damages accme at the time of the tortious injury. Thus we have allowed interest under \u00a7 6B on that portion of a tort award represented by the loss of earning capacity (lost future earnings discounted to present value). <em>Carey </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>377 Mass. 736, 746 (1979). Trade secret cases of this character are, however, significantly different from the tort cases with which \u00a7 6B is concerned, as was noted in <em>Jet Spray II, supra, </em>and .in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Charles D. Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>550 F. Supp. 231, 247 n.2 (D. Mass. 1982), aff\u2019d on this issue, 708 F.2d 1,12 (1st Cir. 1983). It makes no sense, for example, for USM to receive interest under \u00a7 6B from the date of the commencement of the action in 1964 on the defendants\u2019 accountable profits in years from 1965 to 1981.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">USM argues that it is at least entitled to interest under G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, on the amount of monetary relief found by the master. Under G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 652, \u00a7 2, \u201c[w]hen a judgment is rendered . . . upon the report of . . . [a] master,\u201d interest is to be computed on the amount of the damages found in the report from the time of the report to the time judgment is entered. The master\u2019s report recommended that judgment be entered for all the defendants on the ground that USM did not take adequate measures to protect its trade secret. He made conditional findings concerning the defendants\u2019 profits. Our earlier opinion in this case held that USM had an adequately protected trade secret. <em>USM Corp. I, </em>379 Mass, at 103. When the judge considered the matter on remand, he modified and confirmed the master\u2019s report. He did not, however, make any finding as to the defendants\u2019 gains during the years covered by the master\u2019s report. He heard further evidence, some of it relating to the years covered by the master\u2019s report, and made his own findings as to the defendants\u2019 profits for all years for which data were then available.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We have allowed interest from the date of the filing of a master\u2019s report even though some modifications in the master\u2019s computation of damages were made. See <em>Jet Spray. II, </em>377 Mass, at 181-182; <em>Coyne Indus. Laundry of Schenectady, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>359 Mass. 269, 278-279 (1971); <em>Buckley &amp; Scott Utils., Inc. </em>v. <em>Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>313 Mass. 498, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>510 (1943). It may be, and we do not decide, that judgment can be fairly said to be rendered on a master\u2019s report when, after the master rules in favor of a defendant on liability but makes conditional damage findings, a court decides that there was liability and relies solely on the master\u2019s conditional damage findings in rendering judgment. Here, the judge did not render judgment on the master\u2019s report when he modified and confirmed that report and then, after further hearings on the defendants\u2019 profits and other matters, entered a judgment covering the entire damage period.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">USM properly contends that, quite apart from any specific statutory direction concerning the allowance of interest, an award of prejudgment interest properly could be made by application of common law principles. See G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 3. In the process of extracting from the defendants the gain they derived from the trade secret violation, one should not ignore the fact that the defendants have had the use of the allocable profits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The matter of awarding prejudgment interest is, however, one of balancing equities. <em>Jet Spray II, </em>377 Mass, at 183-184, and cases cited. The judge expressly declined to assess blame for the delay in the resolution of this dispute. He noted and applied the standards we stated in <em>Jet Spray II </em>where we concluded that the defendants would not be unjustly enriched if they are not required to pay interest on the total profits awarded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The allocable profits in this case have been enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>because the defendants were unable to produce financial data to prove their claim that certain expenses should have been deducted in determining those profits. Any award of prejudgment interest would have to be based on after-tax profits because it is only those amounts which the defendants could have used to their advantage. However, as was true as to the plaintiff in <em>Jet Spray II </em>(see 377 Mass, at 176 n.16), the allocable profits awarded to USM are the defendants\u2019 pretax profits. The judge\u2019s determination not to award prejudgment interest was proper in the circumstances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Other Machines</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The defendants argue that they used certain machines to manufacture blind rivets that did not incorporate USM\u2019s trade secret. The defendants did make certain design changes in some types of machines they used. All changes were developed by persons who had knowledge of USM\u2019s trade secret. The master found that those redesigned machines considered by him used substantially the process embodied in the USM machine. The judge considered circumstances during the years not covered by the master\u2019s report and came to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Where a defendant constmcts and uses a machine which is \u201csubstantially a replica of the plaintiff\u2019s machine\u201d incorporating a protected trade secret, the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See <em>Junker </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>320 Mass. 76,79 (1946). If the defendant\u2019s machine is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to, or in \u201cessential conformity\u201d with, the machine incorporating a protected trade secret, the plaintiff is entitled to relief. See <em>id.; Atlantic Wool Combing Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk Mills, Inc., </em>357 F.2d 866, 868-870 (1st Cir. 1966). Modifications in the process do not relieve a defendant of responsibility if the defendant\u2019s process is substantially derived from the trade secret. See <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>v. <em>Technical Tape Corp., </em>221 N.Y.S.2d 58, 60-63 (Sup. Ct. 1961), aff\u2019d, 18 A.D.2d 679 (N. Y. 1962); <em>Forest Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury Co., </em>452 F.2d 621, 625 (7th Cir. 1971); <em>Mycalex Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Pemco Corp., </em>64 F. Supp. 420, 425 (D. Md. 1946), aff\u2019d, 159 F.2d 907 (4th Cir. 1947); Restatement of Torts \u00a7 757 comment c (1939). Where modifications in the process are made by persons cognizant of the trade secret, as here, proof of the independent derivation of the differing process is more difficult than would be the case if an apparent \u201cmodification\u201d were made by a person untainted with knowledge of the trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The defendants have presented no basis for rejecting the judge\u2019s conclusion, on the facts before him and on the master\u2019s findings, that the modifications in certain machines were not significant and that those machines incorporated USM\u2019s trade secret, substantially although not identically. There is simply no support for the defendants\u2019 claim that the processes in their redesigned machines were derived from some source other than USM\u2019s trade secret.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The judge concluded that, because of the defendants\u2019 flagrant misconduct in misappropriating the trade secret, an award of punitive damages was appropriate, and he assessed exemplary damages in the amount of 50% of actual damages. He made his ruling on common law principles, apparently taking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>view that G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 42, inserted by St. 1967, c. 817, \u00a7 3, did not apply because it was enacted after the defendants misappropriated USM\u2019s trade secret.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We conclude that an award of punitive damages was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">We have consistently maintained that punitive damages are not to be allowed in the absence of statutory authorization. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1, 13 (1984); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 257, 269 (1943); <em>Boott Mills </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>218 Mass. 582, 589 (1914). There is nothing inherent in the misappropriation of trade secrets, compared with other intentional torts, that would suggest a special rule in trade secret cases, and particularly so in a case in which monetary relief is measured by a defendant\u2019s profits and not by a plaintiff\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">USM argues that an award of punitive damages is justified pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 42, even though it was enacted in 1967, a few years after the misappropriation of the trade secret. In <em>Jet Spray II, </em>377 Mass, at 166 n.8, we considered a similar factual pattern but did not have to decide whether punitive damages could be awarded under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 42. We cited cases that held that statutes changing the measure of damages after a tort had been committed were not applicable retroactively, but we also cited a case holding that a statutory change in allowable interest on judgments could be implemented prospectively from the effective date of the change. <em>Id. </em>Here, unlike many torts, the defendants\u2019 continuing conduct affected the monetary relief recoverable. Indeed, most of the defendants\u2019 allocable profits were earned after the 1967 statute became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">We construe G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 42, even if it should be applied at least to post-1967 damages arising from a pre-1967 tort, as inapplicable to the monetary relief recoverable in this case. That statute allows the judge to award up to double the amount of all damages resulting from the tortious conversion of a trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>secret. The reference to damages \u201cresulting from\u201d a defendant\u2019s tortious act concerns the trade secret holders\u2019 loss of profit, and not, as here, a defendant\u2019s profit at a plaintiff\u2019s expense. If \u00a7 42 had referred to the damages or monetary relief recovered, as it might have, the result might be different. We decline to give \u00a7 42, a statute imposing a penalty, an expansive interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Damage Period</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The defendants argue that the damage period is too long. They contend that it should have been cut off in 1970 (five years after the misappropriation) because, as the master found, the trade secret could have been duplicated independently in five years. Further, they argue, in any event, that the damage period should have been terminated when, in 1975, alternative machines became commercially available. This latter argument needs no extended discussion. There was no finding that the defendants could have made a profit using the machines that became alternatively available.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">There is no merit to the claim that, because the trade secret could have been produced independently in five years, monetary relief should be limited to the defendants\u2019 profits from the use of the trade secret only for the first five years after the wrongful appropriation of the trade secret. Here the evidence showed the defendants\u2019 profitable use of the trade secret in each year from 1965 to 1980. The trade secret was a trade secret throughout this period and did not become lawfully known and available through legitimate procedures. The so called \u201chead start rule\u201d has no application here, so as to limit the damage period, at least for the reason that USM\u2019s trade secret, incorporated in the machine that made blind rivets, has never appeared in any marketed product or otherwise lawfully been made publicly accessible. See <em>Jet Spray II, </em>377 Mass, at 171-172 n.ll.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Injunctive Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The injunction against the defendants was fully warranted, and it is of a reasonable duration. See <em>id.; Eastern Marble Prods.

If the manufacture and marketing of the infringing goods causes no increase in the general expense, no part of it is to be allocated to them, even though such a practice would be bad from the point of view of cost accounting or business policy.\u201d The subject of unfair competition was deleted from the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1978) because it was concluded that the law of unfair competition and trade regulation was no more dependent on tort law than on many other fields of law and because broad statutory developments, particularly at the Federal level, had become significant. See Restatement (Second) of Torts Introductory Note to Division Nine, at 1-2 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\"> It appears that below the defendants claimed as a deduction not only the Federal income taxes paid on any demonstrated profits but also that portion of the corporation\u2019s corporate excise attributable to its trade secret income. The defendants have given us no indication in their brief or in the record appendix as to how the income taxes attributable to Marson\u2019s profit should be calculated. Of course, precise calculations cannot be made until the recoverable profits are determined, and, even then, the question would remain whether the taxes should be allocated among the corporations\u2019 activities on some proportional basis or whether the recoverable profits should be treated as derived from the last dollars earned in each year for which recovery was allowed. That question might be answered by the way in which the recoverable profits themselves are determined. See <em>Alfred Bell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Catalda Fine Arts, Inc., </em>86 F.

Larson, Jr., Co. </em>v. <em>Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co., 211 </em>U.S. 97 (1928). The Holmesian pronouncement as to Federal law has been often accepted in the common law area. In the Restatement of Torts \u00a7 748 comment g (1938), in words taken in part directly from the <em>Larson </em>opinion, it is said that income taxes \u201care payments for the opportunity to make the income and it is deemed anomalous that the defendant should be allowed what he paid for the chance to do what he knew that he had no right to do.\u201d No similar provision appears in Restatement (Second) of Torts (1978).
