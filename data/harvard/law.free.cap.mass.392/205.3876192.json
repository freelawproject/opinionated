We allowed Stock\u2019s motion for direct appellate review. We hold that allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was error, and we remand the case to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">1. <em>Factual background and prior proceedings. </em>Richard Stock, age 21, suffers from multiple cognitive and motor disabilities which are the result of a brain tumor and chemotherapy-radiation treatments received for that tumor at the age of ten. He also manifests emotional and behavioral difficulties which are concomitant with his physical condition. For the most part, he is confined to a wheelchair. At times he has demonstrated academic abilities ranging from the fourth through the ninth grade level. At the time he was awarded a high school diploma, a psychologist\u2019s evaluation indicated that his abilities were consistently below the norm for his age group and were consonant with brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">At the age of fourteen, Stock entered the Massachusetts Hospital School, where he received special education services at the Brayton High School.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the fall of 1980, Stock\u2019s teachers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>met to formulate his Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) for the 1980-81 school year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The teachers intended that Stock be graduated at the end of the academic year. Neither Stock nor his parents were invited to this meeting. In the early part of the winter of 1981, Stock signed the IEP. The IEP does not show a parental signature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The IEP does not mention gradua-</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tian. At no time were his parents provided formal, written notice of their right to challenge the IEP or of the procedural avenues open to them to make that challenge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither were they told that graduation would terminate their son\u2019s eligibility for special education services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In June, 1981, Stock was presented with a high school diploma. His eligibility for special education services was thereby terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">In the months following graduation, Stock remained at the hospital school. Although the record is unclear as to whether additional special education services were offered to him, or offered and refused, in the time between graduation and the commencement of this action, there is no question that Stock has received no further special education services since his graduation. He has failed to adapt either to sheltered workshop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>or to independent living settings. At the time appellate briefs were filed, he was hospitalized in a chronic care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"AG_\">In December, 1981, Stock\u2019s parents sought legal counsel. In the proceeding below, Stock challenged the award of his diploma on procedural and substantive grounds, alleging violotions of both State and Federal law. The defendants asserted that Stock had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. On March 29, 1983, a judge of the Superior Court issued a memorandum and order on cross-motions for summary judgment. In his memorandum, the judge ruled that Stock could not acquire the academic skills necessary for a regular high school education before reaching age twenty-two, the age at which special education entitlements terminate. The judge then concluded that Stock had not met the \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies, ordered the entry of summary judgment in favor of all defendants, and dismissed Stock\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"A5t6\">After judgment, Stock\u2019s counsel wrote to the Bureau of Special Education Appeals urging consideration of his client\u2019s appeal. The assistant director of the Bureau of Special Educatian Appeals took the position that, because Stock had received a high school diploma, the bureau no longer had jurisdiction of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"AAC\">On appeal, Stock raises the following issues: (1) whether the defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice and procedural protectians before terminating special education services violated his rights under State and Federal law; (2) whether presentation of a high school diploma to Stock in the absence of his attaining sufficient skills to warrant such presentation violated his rights under State and Federal law; and (3) whether the Superior Court judge erred in his conclusion that court proceedings were inappropriate in the absence of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Stock requests a determination from this court that he had not acquired sufficient skills to graduate from high school without his express consent. He requests relief in the form of an order rescinding his diploma and directing the department to arrange for and fund appropriate special educatian services for him. Further, Stock urges this court to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>lish procedural and substantive standards for graduation of special needs students.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The defendants argue that the judgment of the Superior Court should be affirmed on the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, and further urge that Stock\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to join a necessary party under Mass. R. Civ. P. 19 (a), 365 Mass. 765 (1974), and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we agree that Stock\u2019s graduation was procedurally and substantively defective and that exhaustion of administrative remedies would have been futile in his case. However, because it is inappropriate for this court to arrogate to itself the powers delegated to the department, we decline to establish substantive educational standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">2. <em>Procedural safeguards. </em>The focus of Stock\u2019s argument is that the decision to graduate a child with special education needs is a \u201cchange in placement,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 (b) (1) (C) (i) (1982), triggering the mandatory procedural safeguards ofEAHCA, described in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 (1982). The plaintiff cites no judicial discussion of this issue, nor have we found any.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It seems obvious, however, that graduation, because it will cause the termination of a student\u2019s participation in special education programs, can hardly be characterized as anything other than a change in placement. This view accords with Federal law, which requires that States qualifying for Federal assistance provide special needs children with \u201ca free appropriate public education.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1)(1982). It also accords <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>with the law of this Commonwealth, which mandates that the department administer special education programs so as \u201cto assure the maximum possible development of a child with special needs.\u201d G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1978, c. 552, \u00a7 19. No change in placement seems quite so serious nor as worthy of parental involvement and procedural protectians as the termination of placement in special education programs. Under the Federal scheme, a change in placement requires formal, written notice of the decision to graduate a child, as well as notice of a parent\u2019s right to protest that decision, a description of the administrative remedies and procedures to be followed, and a description of any alternative services which may be available. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 (1982). To ensure conformity with Federal policy, the State must adhere to these notice and procedural requirements. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1412 (5)(A), 1415(a), 1416 (1982). This change requires significant parental involvement in the decision-making process, as this is contemplated by 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(a)(C)(iii) (1982), and by G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 3. It is not enough, contrary to the defendants\u2019 argument, that Stock\u2019s parents received actual notice of the graduation or that they participated to a limited extent in the transitional planning surrounding the graduation. From all appearances, the Stocks received actual notice of a fait accompli, without any notice that they might challenge the decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is difficult to find justification for permitting a young man with Stock\u2019s handicaps to pass through and out of the special education system by virtue of his signature on an IEP \u2014 which did not even mention the graduation decision \u2014 without some evidence that he or his parents were aware of the consequences of doing so and the alternatives available to them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the conduct of which Stock complains was in direct violation of the department\u2019s special education regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Failure to provide to Stock\u2019s parents formal, written notice concerning the graduation decision, failure to provide such notice regarding their rights to involvement in that decision, and failure to notify them as to rights to a hearing and administrative review, violate State and Federal statutory law. As a result, we need not reach the issues raised concerning violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, nor claims asserted under 42U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">3. <em>Primary jurisdiction. </em>It is well established that resort to the administrative process is generally a prerequisite to in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>voting the jurisdiction of a court. <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444 (1973). However, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is limited by- several exceptions. Exhaustion is not required where it would prove futile, or where only questions of law are presented to the court, or where irreparable harm would result if judicial action were delayed by the implementation of the administrative process. See <em>Ezratty </em>v. <em>Puerto Rico, </em>648 F.2d 770, 774-775 n.5 (1st Cir. 1981) (futility); <em>School Comm. of Greenfield, </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 75-76 (1982) (questions of law); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979) (questions of law). Here, not only were questions of law involved in construing graduation as a \u201cchange in placement,\u201d but the record reveals that invocation of the administrative procedures was virtually impossible, and thus, of course, futile.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">4. <em>Standards. </em>Stock urges this court to set standards for the attainment of a \u201chigh school diploma or its equivalent,\u201d the achievement of which terminates eligibility for special education services under G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 3. This we cannot do. Academic standards are matters peculiarly within the expertise of the department and of local educational authorities, and are at present regulated. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 40.00 (1979). It is sufficient that the trial judge found, and the record supports, that Stock would be incapable of attaining, by age twenty-two, sufficient learning and skills to merit the award of a high school diploma under existing standards. From this it follows inescapably that conferring a diploma upon the plaintiff at the age of eighteen was substantively inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>5. <em>Failure to join a necessary party. </em>The defendants argue that this action must be dismissed under Mass. R. Civ. P. 19 (a), for failure to join an indispensable party, the King Philip Regional School District, the local educational agency for the district where Richard Stock\u2019s parents reside. There exists some question as to which local agency will be responsible, both academically and financially, in assisting Stock.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In view of our decision to order the case remanded to the department the question whether a local agency will or which local agency need be joined will be best resolved by the department itself, in construing its own regulations. Additionally, the defendants \u2019 assertion of error as to failure to join a local agency is not sufficient to require dismissal of this action either under Mass. R. Civ. P. 19 (a), or Mass. R. Civ. P. 21, 365 Mass. 767 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">6. <em>Relief to be granted. </em>In view of our determination that the defendants\u2019 failure to adhere to procedural safeguards rendered exhaustion of administrative remedies futile, the trial judge\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants must be reversed. Further, because the award of a diploma was both procedurally and substantively deficient, the diploma must be rescinded. This case is remanded to the Superior Court with directions that it order the department to take jurisdiction and to hold a hearing on the matter of providing special education services to Stock. Should it determine that further services are appropriate, the department shall take into account the period of about three years which has elapsed since the initial graduation in June, 1981. This is to be added to Stock\u2019s period of eligibility for special education services. Thus, he may receive such services beyond the normal termination age of twenty-two, see G. L. c. 7IB, \u00a7 1, although the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>is not necessarily precluded from terminating Stock\u2019s special education services on some basis other than age. Finally, the department may consider plans for services to which Stock may be entitled under G. L.c. 71B,\u00a7\u00a7 12A-12C, inserted by St. 1983, c. 688. The Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-13\">The Massachusetts Hospital School, operated by the Department of Public Health, is an institution for disabled children. Among its programs is the Brayton High School, located at the hospital. Brayton High School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>employees are under contract with the Department of Education. The department is the State education agency charged with implementing G. L. c. 71B, concerning children with special needs. G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 2. There must also be compliance with 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 et seq. (1982), the Assistance for Education of All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA), in order to qualify the Commonwealth\u2019s special education programs for receipt of Federal funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AaV\"> The IEP or Program is the backbone for development of special education services under both State and Federal law. Under G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 3, local school committees are charged with diagnosing and evaluating all children with special needs within the school district. Provision is made in \u00a7 3 for the annual evaluation of the child\u2019s special needs by a representative of the local school department, a teacher familiar with the child, a physician, a psychologist, a nurse, social worker or guidance counselor, and other medical and educational specialists if necessary. Those evaluating the child must develop a suggested course of special education \u201cbest suited to the child\u2019s needs, [including] the specific benefits expected from such action.\u201d G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 3, eighth par., inserted by St. 1972, c. 766, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"AMf\">General Laws c. 71B, \u00a7 3, mandates that such evaluations be made available to parents. Further, provision is made for hearings by the department in accordance with G. L. c. 30A. Parents may refuse the suggested plan and request a hearing before the department, through the Bureau of Special Education Appeals. Parents may consent to or reject alternative placements suggested there. If the parents reject them, the matter is then referred to the State advisory commission on special education. Parents aggrieved by the commission\u2019s decision may then \u201cappeal\u201d to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AG6\">Additionally, under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(a) (5) (1982), States must, in order to qualify for Federal educational assistance, provide assurance to Federal authorities that annual individual education programs are developed for each special needs student. The IEP is defined in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(19) (1982) to include the child\u2019s present educational performance, a statement of annual goals and objectives, the services to be provided, the dates of initiation and duration of services, and objective evaluation criteria for annual review of the achievement of educational goals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AqO\"> We wish to point out that although this case concerns parental involvement in the child\u2019s special education services, our decision applies with equal force to a guardian, custodian, or any person or entity responsible for a child in need of special education services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b224-17\">General Laws c. 71B, \u00a7 3, requires written notice to parents when children are referred from regular education to special education programs.

L. c. 71B, \u00a7 3, is not specific concerning the precise type of notice required to be given parents, the Commonwealth\u2019s federally assisted special education programs must comply with the procedural safeguards described in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 (1982) to continue to qualify for receipt of Federal funds. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-28\">Most important for this action is the requirement of \u00a7 1415(b)(1)(C) (1982) that the State educational unit provide <em>\u201cwritten prior notice </em>to the parents . . . <em>whenever </em>such agency or unit \u2014 (i) proposes to initiate or change, or (ii) refuses to initiate or change, the identification, evaluation, or <em>educational placement </em>of the child or the <em>provision </em>of a free appropriate public education to the child\u201d (emphasis added).
