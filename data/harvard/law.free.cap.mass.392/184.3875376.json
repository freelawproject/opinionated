They also challenge certain rulings of the judge. At the heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is their objection to the arbitrator\u2019s decision that, under the relevant collective bargaining agreement, layoffs of teachers in Worcester should have been conducted on the basis of seniority without any consideration (except perhaps in the case of any tie) of language in the collective bargaining agreement that, the plaintiffs argue, also required consideration of affirmative action goals in determining which teachers should be laid off. There was no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">The significant language in the collective bargaining agreement covering the period January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1981, is stated in Article XI, entitled Reduction in Force. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>It provides, as to teachers, in \u00a7 A 7, under the heading Affirmative Action: \u201cThe lay-off of any tenured teacher or administrator will be governed by the Reduction in Force Policy and the intent expressed by the School Committee in the Affirmative Action Plan adopted on January 18, 1979 and the Affirmative Action Policy Statement adopted by the School Committee on June 26, 1978.\u201d On April 30, 1981, the school committee, faced with the need to lay off teachers, voted that any reduction in force would use \u201cseniority as the main vehicle for all reductions\u201d with affirmative action to \u201cbe considered when all other matters are equal.\u201d In June, 1978, the school committee had adopted an Affirmative Action Policy Statement that spoke specifically of recruiting practices but made no reference to layoffs. The question of how reductions in force should be handled was the subject of subsequent discussion. However, when, in January, 1979, the school committee adopted an Affirmative Action Plan designed to increase the percentage of minority faculty to 5% by 1984, it made no reference to minority teachers with regard to layoffs or reductions in force and only mentioned \u201crecruiting, hiring, assigning and promoting qualified persons without regard to race, religion, sex, national origin, handicap or age.\u201d In 1981, the school committee laid off 146 teachers of whom 18 were minority teachers. It is uncontested that the layoffs had a disproportionate impact on minority teachers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">The plaintiffs filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement, but the defendant union refused to process it. In July, 1981, the plaintiffs filed a civil rights action raising various challenges to the laying-off of the individual plaintiffs and also seeking an order that the defendant union proceed to arbitration with the school committee on the question of the propriety of the layoffs. A judge of the Superior Court granted the request for an order that arbitration proceed and further ordered that the plaintiffs should be permitted to participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the arbitration. Another judge of the Superior Court enjoined any layoffs of the plaintiffs pending the final outcome of the arbitration proceeding. On September 10, 1982, the arbitrator issued his award in which he concluded that the \u201cdismissals of the named grievants . . . were <em>not </em>in violation of Article XI of the parties\u2019 current collective bargaining agreement\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"AqR\">In October, 1982, the plaintiffs commenced this action to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. The defendant union moved to confirm the award. This proceeding was consolidated with the plaintiffs \u2019 earlier civil rights action. After hearing, a third judge of the Superior Court entered judgment confirming the award but staying the lay off of certain plaintiffs. It appears from the record that certain aspects of the civil rights action remain unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"AnG\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. The arbitrator appropriately identified the issue referred to him, and he undertook to interpret the relevant language in the collective bargaining agreement. His conclusion that seniority alone (at least ip the absence of a tie) was the appropriate measure of the order of layoffs, of course, gives no substantial effect to the language in art. XI, \u00a7 A 7, concerning the January, 1979, Affirmative Action Plan and the June, 1978, Affirmative Action Policy Statement. The plaintiffs make a strong argument that the arbitrator was in error in construing art. XI, \u00a7 A 7, to provide that seniority was the sole criterion in determining the order in which layoffs should be made (except in the case of a tie).</p>\n<p id=\"ALf\">The role of courts in reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s award is limited. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. We do not, and cannot, pass on an arbitrator\u2019s alleged errors of law and, absent fraud, we have no business overruling an arbitrator because we give a contract a different interpretation. See <em>School Comm. of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 792 (1977); <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 115 (1977); <em>Trustees of Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>363 Mass. 386, 390 (1973); <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Mari &amp; Sons Flooring Co., </em>362 Mass. 560, 562-563 (1972). The fact that an arbitrator has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>committed an error of law does not alone mean that he has exceeded his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">Courts do consider whether an arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Service Employees Inf l Union, Local 254, </em>383 Mass. 791, 794 (1981); <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-Nat'l Batteries, Inc., </em>344 Mass. 120, 124-125 (1962). The arbitrator\u2019s opinion shows that he was faithful to his obligations, even if he may have been in error in his interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. His conclusion is not so implausible as to justify our overturning it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of the ambiguous language in the January, 1979, Affirmative Action Plan and the June ,1978, Affirmative Action Policy Statement, which did not focus on the matter of layoffs, the application of seniority principles is not so implausible as to justify this court in concluding that the award had no basis in the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiffs may well be justified in concluding that their interests were inadequately protected by the collective bargaining agreement and that the arbitrator was wrong in his decision, but we do not see the arbitrator\u2019s action as so irrational as to permit our intervention to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"A4M\">The plaintiffs argue that the award should be vacated because it was procured by fraud. G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (1). The claim is that the union and the school committee acted fraudulently toward the plaintiffs in approving art. XI, \u00a7 A 7, because they did not intend \u00a7 A 7 to require any special consideration of minorities in making layoffs. This claim, which was not explicitly asserted as a ground for the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the award, is not supported by the arbitrator\u2019s findings. He concluded that the evidence did not establish that minority teachers were misled into believing that \u00a7 A 7 included an override of the strict use of seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"AhS\">The plaintiffs, supported by the amicus curiae brief of the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, argue further that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>law of the Commonwealth requires recognition of the interests of the minority teachers, who were disproportionately affected as a group by the use of seniority as the sole determinant of who would be laid off.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3), an award must be vacated if the arbitrator by his award required a person to engage in conduct prohibited by State law. The issue is whether on this record a requirement that teachers be discharged strictly on the basis of seniority has been shown to violate State law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the seniority discharge system involved in this case would violate G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), as amended through St. 1965, c. 397, \u00a7 4, which makes unlawful discrimination in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment \u201cbecause of the race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, age, or ancestry of any individual.\u201d The fact that a bona fide strict seniority system is permissible under Federal law does not foreclose a different result under State law. See <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 167 (1978); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-7 &amp; 2000h-4 (1976). The Massachusetts statutes, for example, contain no explicit approval of the use of a bona fide seniority system such as appears in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (h) (1976) (\u00a7 703 [h] of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The plaintiffs point out that we have recognized that practices neutral in form but discriminatory in impact are proscribed by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4. <em>School Comm, of Braintree </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, </em>377 Mass. 424, 429 (1979). Certainly a voluntary program for determining layoffs containing an affirmative action component <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>overriding a seniority component, in whole or in part, would not violate State law and is not prohibited by Federal law. See <em>Boston Chapter, NAACP, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>504 F.2d 1017, 1028 (1st Cir. 1974), cert, denied, 421 U.S. 910 (1975). However, G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1966, c. 361, provides that nothing in G. L. c. 15IB \u201cshall be interpreted as requiring any employer ... to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of . . . [racial] imbalance.\u201d This language indicates that it is not unlawful under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, to make layoffs pursuant to \u00e1 bona fide seniority system, even when to do so will work to the disadvantage of a particular group generally protected by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, and that an affirmative action component in the determination of layoffs was not required in the arbitrator\u2019s award. We conclude, therefore, that the arbitrator\u2019s award does not require the school committee to engage in conduct prohibited by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (\u00ab) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the allowance of the defendant union\u2019s motion to strike certain paragraphs and exhibits from the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. The judge ruled on the motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award without admitting in evidence before him, and then examining, the record before the arbitrator. Although the occasions in which an arbitrator\u2019s award will be vacated because of what did or did not appear in the record before him are rare, the record before the arbitrator may be relevant to particular challenges to an award, such as a claim that the record before the arbitrator shows no support whatever for his determination. See <em>United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers, Local 1139 </em>v. <em>Litton Microwave Cooking Prods., </em>704 F.2d 393, 396-397 (8th Cir. 1983); <em>Storer Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of Television &amp; Radio Artists, Cleveland Local, </em>600 F.2d 45, 47-48 (6th Cir. 1979), and cases cited. The plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the judge\u2019s failure to examine the record before the arbitrator. We have examined it and conclude that that record was not wholly lacking in support for his award.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>We affirm the judgment denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award and allowing the motion to confirm that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-21\"> Evidence before the arbitrator showed that before the layoffs 4.1% of the tenured teachers in Worcester were minority teachers and that after the layoffs 3.3% were minority teachers. Twenty-five percent of the tenured minority teachers and 7.6% of the tenured nonminority teachers were laid off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-36\"> Our function does not include ruling on the appropriateness of the arbitrator\u2019s admission of and reliance on particular evidence. Thus we have not considered evidence before the arbitrator in this respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The plaintiffs rightly grant that the use of a bona fide strict seniority system for layoffs would not violate Federal law. See <em>American Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>456 U.S. 63, 68 <em>(1982); International Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 348 n.30 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\">We understand from the plaintiffs\u2019 brief that in their civil rights action they assert that, because a disproportionate number of minority teachers were laid off, the use of strict seniority would violate G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, and art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. In this case, although the plaintiffs refer to art. 1, they make no argument based on art. 1, and we do not consider the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
