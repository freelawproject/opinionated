J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGq\">The plaintiff, Lovan C., appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing her administrative appeal from the decision of the administrative hearings unit of the defendant, the department of children and families (department), affirming the department\u2019s substantiation of an allegation of physical abuse. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) found that she had failed to challenge the definition of \u201cabuse,\u201d (2) concluded that her conduct constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>physical abuse and (3) found that she had abandoned her constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We disagree with the legal conclusions drawn in this case. The hearing officer\u2019s failure to hold a hearing regarding the reasonableness of the corporal punishment at issue undermines the integrity of the judgment. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal, and remand the case with direction that judgment be rendered sustaining the plaintiffs appeal and ordering the defendant to reverse the substantiation of the allegation of physical abuse for lack of substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The following undisputed facts are relevant to our review. On September 11,1999, the plaintiff, responding to a commotion coming from her five year old daughter\u2019s room, found her daughter swinging and jumping on her canopy bed. Although the plaintiff rarely used physical discipline, she picked up a child\u2019s belt and spanked her daughter three times with a portion of the strap, which left a bruise approximately one inch in diameter on her thigh.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The incident was investigated by a police officer, who had received a complaint from the child\u2019s father. The officer determined that the plaintiffs actions \u201cdid not rise to the level of child abuse</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">On September 13, 1999, the department received a referral from the family relations unit of the Superior Court. After investigating the circumstances surrounding the spanking, the department substantiated the allegation that the plaintiff had abused her child physically because the child received an injury other than by accidental means. The plaintiff subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>was placed on the child abuse and neglect registry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She appealed from that decision to the administrative hearings unit of the department, which affirmed the department\u2019s substantiation of physical abuse. She then appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed her appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We begin by articulating the standard of review for an appeal from the decision of an administrative agency. \u201cJudicial review of [an administrative agency\u2019s] action is governed by the [Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.] . . . and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . With regard to questions of fact, it is neither the function of the trial court nor of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. . . . Judicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited. The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Unified School District No. 1 </em>v. <em>Dept. of Education, </em>64 Conn. App. 273, 282-83, 780 A.2d 154, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 910, 782 A.2d 1253 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j), which describes the scope of judicial review of administrative decisions, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and <em>substantial evidence </em>on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. If the court finds such prejudice, it shall sustain the appeal and, if appropriate, may render a judgment under subsection (k)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of this section or remand the case for further proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 defines an \u201cabused\u201d child as, inter alia, one who \u201chas been inflicted with physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>injury or injuries other than by accidental means . . . .\u201d The definitions of an \u201cabused\u201d child found in both \u00a7 17a-101 (e)-2(c) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies and \u00a7 22-12-2 of the department\u2019s policy manual mirror the statutory definition. The phrase \u201cphysical injury\u201d is not defined in the General Statutes or the regulations;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> however, \u00a7 34-2-7 of the department\u2019s policy manual provides examples of \u201cphysical injury,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cdeath, head injuries, bruises, scratches, lacerations, internal injuries, bums, scalds . . . injuries to bone, muscle, cartilage, ligaments [and] misuse of medical treatments or therapies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Applying those definitions, the department substantiated the abuse allegation on the ground that the plaintiffs discipline of her daughter resulted in a one inch bruise on the child\u2019s leg. In upholding the substantiation of the allegation of abuse, the hearing officer believed that although her decision would set a dangerous precedent for future cases, she nevertheless was bound by the technical definition of \u201cabuse\u201d as an injury to a child by nonaccidental means. In her decision, the hearing officer stated: \u201cWhile [the plaintiffs] actions fit within the definition of physical abuse, this case raises a concerning issue. It was clear from the testimony presented at the hearing and in the Protocol that this was a one time occurrence of physical discipline. Both [the daughter] and her older brother reported to the investigator that their mother does not strike them for discipline. They both reported that [the plaintiff] generally talks to them to discipline. This information was confirmed by [the plaintiff and her husband] and other collaterals contacted during the investigation. In fact, after contacting other professionals involved with the family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>there were no concerns regarding [the plaintiffs] care of her children. Even [the plaintiffs husband], who admitted to making the initial disclosure out of spite, reported that [the plaintiff] does not strike the children and [that] he has no concerns regarding her disciplining techniques. Unfortunately, the maintenance of [the plaintiffs] name on the department\u2019s registry for this one incident may negatively impact her career opportunities<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for years to come although the reports from her children and the professionals who are involved with the family indicate [the plaintiff] presents no threat to children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On appeal from the hearing officer\u2019s determination, the court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. It found that the hearing officer had made a correct determination and that even though the plaintiff did not intend to harm her child, \u201c[t]he statutes and regulations clearly proscribe nonaccidental means rather than unintended consequences.\u201d We conclude that the court improperly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We are troubled by the hearing officer\u2019s substantiation of the abuse allegation, especially in light of the language in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-18. That section provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he use of physical force upon another person which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal under any of the following circumstances: (1) A parent, guardian or other person entrusted with the care and supervision of a minor . . . may use reasonable physical force upon such minor .... when and to the extent that he reasonably believes such to be necessary to maintain discipline or to promote the welfare of such minor . . . .\u201d Although \u00a7 53a-18 is a criminal statute, it \u201cdemonstrates the public recognition of the parental right to punish children for their own welfare. ... It is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that [a] parent, being charged with the training and education of his child, has the right to exercise such control and restraint and to adopt such disciplinary measures for the child as will enable him to discharge his parental duty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>8 Conn. App. 517, 522, 513 A.2d 744, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 810, 516 A.2d 886 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Section 53a-18 was not specifically mentioned during the appeal to the trial court, but the plaintiff did mention our state\u2019s policy of allowing reasonable corporal punishment. Counsel for the plaintiff stated: \u201cWhat\u2019s troubling about that is [that] there\u2019s an inconsistency between that concept and the notion of corporal punishment, which heretofore has not been deemed inappropriate either by statute or by judicial decision. Obviously, there are instances where you can go over the line in terms of corporal punishment, but corporal punishment in and of itself is not something that the legislature has deemed to prohibit, nor am I aware of any decision which has outright ruled that that would be inappropriate in all circumstances.\u201d The court clearly understood that argument and stated in relevant part: \u201cSo, one is to say that by statute, I have the right to impose corporal punishment and I did . . . and in doing this, I did not impose any form of abuse.\u201d The court failed to discuss or even to mention that argument in its memorandum of decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In light of our clear policy authorizing reasonable corporal punishment, the court improperly upheld the substantiation of the physical abuse allegation in this case. The hearing officer found that the plaintiffs action was a form of corporal punishment, but failed to hold a hearing regarding the reasonableness of the plaintiffs discipline of the child before substantiating the allegation of physical abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Neither party directly advanced that rationale at oral argument. The plaintiff did claim that the court improperly concluded that her conduct constituted physical abuse. She maintains that corporal punishment is not prohibited by the state and that evidence of maltreatment must be shown for a finding of physical abuse. This court, sua sponte, raised the issues of the state\u2019s explicit protection of a parent\u2019s right to use reasonable physical force to discipline a child and the conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 46b-120 and 53a-18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The department\u2019s position in this case, that all injuries caused to a child by his or her parent through nonaccidental means qualify as physical abuse of a child, creates considerable tension with the state\u2019s policy of allowing parents to discipline their children physically. It places at risk any parent who administers corporal punishment that potentially leaves marks on a child. If we were to adopt the statutory interpretation urged by the department, the mere application of a parent\u2019s hand to a child\u2019s backside that results in even minimal bruising would, as a matter of law, require a finding of physical abuse. Such a result would preclude any explanation or consideration of the reasonableness of the act that caused the injury. Even more alarming is that this interpretation requires a finding of physical abuse when a parent attempts to save a child from harm but, in doing so, bruises or injures the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We do not believe that the legislature intended such a result. It is a \u201cwell-settled principle of [statutory] construction that specific terms covering [a] given subject matter will prevail over general language of . . . another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 346, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996). Additionally, \u201c[t]here is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, does so with regard to existing relevant statutes so as to make one consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Starks </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>270 Conn. 1, 31, 850 A.2d 1013 (2004). \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>268 Conn. 541, 550, 848 A.2d 352 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Our ruling in this case is consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent to protect parents from reprisal for physically disciplining their children. \u201c[T]here exists a parental right to punish children for their own welfare, to control and restrain them and to adopt disciplinary measures in the exercise of that right . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brocuglio, </em>56 Conn. App. 514, 518, 744 A.2d 448, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 950, 748 A.2d 874 (2000). \u201cLimits on the right of parents to punish their children do, however, exist. The common law rule and the provisions of \u00a7 53a-18 (1) require that the use of physical force administered upon a minor child be \u2018reasonable.\u2019 . . . Whether that limit has been reached in any particular case is a factual determination to be made by the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Thus, we hold as follows: In a substantiation of abuse hearing, if it is shown that a child has sustained a nonaccidental injury as a result of parent administered corporal punishment, the hearing officer must determine whether the punishment was reasonable and whether the parent believed the punishment was necessary to maintain discipline or to promote the child\u2019s welfare. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brocuglio, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 517-18 (discussing fact finder\u2019s obligation regarding reasonableness standard in criminal context). To aid in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>determination, we find the decisions of our sister states persuasive. \u201c[T]he great preponderance of authority is to the effect that a parent has a right to punish a child within the bounds of moderation and reason, so long as he does it for the welfare of the child . . . .\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 851, 861, 44 S.E.2d 419 (1947). The hearing officer must assess the reasonableness of the punishment in light of the child\u2019s misbehavior and the surrounding circumstances, including the parent\u2019s motive, the type of punishment administered, the amount of force used and the child\u2019s age, size and ability to understand the punishment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>41 Wash. App. 721, 724, 705 P.2d 825 (1985); <em>Harbaugh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 695, 698, 167 S.E.2d 329 (1969). In other words, the punishment must be reasonable in manner and moderate in degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If it is determined that the parent used reasonable physical force on the child in order to maintain discipline or to promote the child\u2019s welfare, a substantiation of physical abuse cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In this case, the substantiation of the allegation of physical abuse must be reversed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The hearing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>found that the plaintiff posed no risk to either of her children. The act at issue was a one time occurrence, not part of a pattern of physical punishment. The child was struck three times on the backside with the strap of a child\u2019s belt, resulting in a bruise. The plaintiff did not intend to hurt or to injure the child, but rather to discipline her for her misbehavior. There was no finding by the hearing officer of any apparent malice or ill motive behind the plaintiffs actions, and the child sustained only a minor injury. Therefore, we conclude that the substantiation must be reversed for lack of substantial evidence that the plaintiffs discipline was unreasonable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal and to order the defendant to reverse the substantiation of physical abuse and to remove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>plaintiffs name from the child abuse and neglect registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> Although the parties disagree as to whether the injury to the child was a bruise or a mark, we find that the distinction would not change the result in this case. Thus, we will refer to the injury as a bruise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> Once placed in the registry, the following are the only ways that the information is expunged: \u201c(1) Expungement occurs under the following set [of] circumstances; (A) The report is found to be unconfirmed. (B) The report is determined to be at risk and not one of confirmed abuse or neglect. (C) The information entered was found upon investigation to be on child(ren) who legally reside in another state and two years have elapsed since the date of the entry of such information (prior to expungement, information will be forwarded to state of residence, if known). (D) If a family moves out of state before the investigation is complete, the information in the report will be kept on the registry for one year and then expunged unless substantiated by the state to which the family moved. (E) If a family moves out of state after the investigation is completed and the report is confirmed, the information will be kept in the registry until the child reaches the age of 18 at which time it will be sealed. A yearly audit will be conducted to determine which subjects of reports have turned 18 or are known to have moved from the state and the appropriate sealing action will be taken at that time. (2) A child turns 18. All information will be sealed and retained seven years and then expunged. After sealing, the information will be made available only if a sibling or offspring of the subject of the report is being inquired about thereafter.\u201d Regs., Conn.

A long line of cases by this court has recognized that this type of \u2018discipline\u2019 is unacceptable.\u201d After a careful review of the cases cited, we find that they all involved excessive corporal punishment, physical or sexual abuse and that the use of a belt in discipline, in and of itself, was not what made the punishment unreasonable. See <em>In re Shamika F., </em>256 Conn. 383, 392 n.10, 773 A.2d 347 (2001) (respondents found to have substance abuse problems, to have sexually, physically abused children, including grabbing children so hard they bruised, hitting children with belts, leaving children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>without food or necessities, making children go to bathroom on floor); <em>In re Sheena I, </em>63 Conn.
