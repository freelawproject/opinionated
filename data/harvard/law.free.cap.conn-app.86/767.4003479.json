On appeal, the defendant claims that the court failed to award her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>(1) compensation on her counterclaim for damage to the interior of her home and (2) attorney\u2019s fees. On cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly denied its claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-249.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the claims raised by both parties and reverse the judgment of the trial court in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The court found the following facts. On September 11, 2000, the parties entered into a written contract in which the plaintiff agreed to replace the roofs on the defendant\u2019s house and garage for the sum of $18,000. While the work was in progress, the defendant orally agreed to pay the plaintiff an additional $1040 for the replacement of additional underlying plywood. When the work was completed, the defendant gave the plaintiff a check for $18,000. The defendant withheld $1040 to ensure payment to her neighbor for the ice and water shields the plaintiff borrowed to complete the work on her roofs. Rain fell the day after the roofs were completed. Due to the improper installation of the roof, a substantial amount of water entered the defendant\u2019s house. The defendant stopped payment on the check that she had given to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The plaintiff subsequently filed a mechanic\u2019s lien on the defendant\u2019s property, seeking the $19,040 it claims to be the value of the materials and labor it furnished. The plaintiff then brought this action, seeking to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien. The defendant filed an answer, special defenses and a two count counterclaim, alleging that she was harmed because (1) the plaintiffs work was improperly performed and (2) as a result of the faulty work, the interior of her house was damaged. The parties agreed to have the court first decide the issues of liability and damages. The court would then decide the issues of attorney\u2019s fees and foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>In the first of two memoranda of decision, the court initially found that the contract price of $18,000, along with the oral agreement between the parties for an additional $1040, was the maximum that the plaintiff could recover under the mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then found that the repair work that needed to be done on the defendant\u2019s roofs was due to the \u201cunworkmanlike manner in which the plaintiff replaced the roof.\u201d On the basis of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert witness, the court found that the reasonable cost to repair or replace the roof was $15,974. The court awarded a net sum of $3066 to the plaintiff, which represented the difference between $19,040, the amount that the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff for replacing the roof, and $15,974, the cost to repair the plaintiffs work. The court did not award the defendant any compensation for the damage to the interior of her house because it ruled that her claim was pleaded improperly in the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">At the bifurcated trial, the plaintiff claimed that it was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 52-249<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that if the defendant was awarded attorney\u2019s fees, such an award would be governed by General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant agreed that the amount of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees should be governed by \u00a7 42-150bb. The defendant, however, claimed that \u00a7 52-249 did not apply to the plaintiff and that an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff should be governed by General Statutes \u00a7 42-150aa.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In its second memorandum of decision, the court ruled that \u00a7 42-150aa controlled the plaintiffs recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and awarded the plaintiff $459.90. The court then determined that \u00a7 42-150bb controlled the defendant\u2019s recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, but because the defendant had failed to prosecute her counterclaim successfully, she was not entitled to any recovery. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly failed to award her compensation on her counterclaim for the damage to the interior of her house because such damage was not alleged in her counterclaim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The court, while acknowledging that the plaintiff did not object to the introduction of the evidence concerning the damage to the interior of the defendant\u2019s house, ruled that it was not awarding the defendant compensation for the damage because \u201c[n]owhere in the defendant\u2019s answer, special defenses or counterclaims has any interior damage to the structure been pleaded.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Therefore, the court concluded that the plaintiff was not on notice that the defendant was claiming that the water that entered her house had damaged the interior of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">It is clear that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim sought compensation for the damage to the interior of her house. Therefore, the court improperly found that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim did not put the plaintiff on notice that she was seeking compensation for the damage to the interior of her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\u201c[T]he inteipretation of pleadings is always a question of law for the court . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiLieto </em>v. <em>County Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group, P.C., </em>265 Conn. 79, 104, 828 A.2d 31 (2003). Therefore, our review of the trial court\u2019s inteipretation of the pleadings is plenary. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\u201cThe modem trend, which is followed in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically. . . . <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <em>Town Oil Co., </em>207 Conn. 575, 587-88, 542 A.2d 1124 (1988), and cases cited therein. Although essential allegations may not be supplied by conjecture or remote implication; Cah<em>ill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>[198 Conn. 229, 236, 502 A.2d 410 (1985)] the [counterclaim] must be read in its entirety in such a way as to give effect to the pleading with reference to the general theory upon which it proceeded, and do substantial justice between the parties. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Bouteiller, </em>79 Conn. 255, 257, 64 A. 227 (1906). As long as the pleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or prejudice the opposing party, we will not conclude that the [counterclaim] is insufficient to allow recovery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Namerow, </em>261 Conn. 784, 795, 807 A.2d 467 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>The court found that although the defendant pleaded that water entered her house, \u201cthe counterclaims only provide that [a]s a result of the aforesaid, the defendant has been required to procure the services of other workmen to temporarily repair the roof, and will be required in the future to further repair and/or replace the work performed by [the] plaintiff. As a result of the aforesaid, [the] defendant has been damaged.\u201d The court, therefore, found that the pleading did not allege damage to the interior of the defendant\u2019s house. That reading of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim is unduly narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In construing the allegations liberally, as we must, a broad and realistic interpretation of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, read in its entirety, put the plaintiff on notice that the defendant was seeking compensation for the damage to the interior of her house. Paragraph six of the second count of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim states: \u201cAt that time, [the] defendant discovered water cascading down the first floor center stairway (of a three-story house), and upon further inspection discovered other areas where water was flowing into the house.\u201d Paragraph seven states: \u201cThe infiltration of water into the house would not have occurred if [the] plaintiff had properly installed the new roof.\u201d Finally, paragraph nine of the second count of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim states: \u201cAs a result of the aforesaid, [the] defendant has been damaged.\u201d Reading paragraphs six, seven and nine of the second count of the counterclaim together, we conclude that the counterclaim clearly alleged that the defendant was seeking compensation for the damage to the interior of her house. Therefore, the plaintiff was on notice of the defendant\u2019s claim of compensation for the damage to the interior of her house. Accordingly, because the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, when read as a whole, cannot be said to have caused the plaintiff surprise or prejudice, the court\u2019s decision not to address the counterclaim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>improper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On remand, the court should calculate the additional amount of damages owed to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The defendant next claims that the court failed to award her attorney\u2019s fees on her counterclaim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The defendant sought to recover attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. The court found that the defendant was not entitled to any attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb because \u201cthe defendant did not successfully prosecute her counterclaim or defend an action based upon the contract.\u201d The court\u2019s ruling was based on its earlier ruling that the defendant owed the plaintiff $3066 under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">\u201cThe common law rule in Connecticut, also known as the American Rule, is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>267 Conn. 524, 532, 839 A.2d 1250 (2004). Section 42-150bb, however, provides in relevant part that whenever a contract \u201cto which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney\u2019s fee <em>shall </em>be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant successfully prosecuted her counterclaim, and the court awarded her damages in the amount of $15,974. The court, therefore, improperly failed to award the defendant attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb based on her counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In its cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly denied its claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 52-249. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The court rejected the plaintiffs claim that it was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 52-249. The court stated that because the contract provided for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, it did not have to address the applicability of \u00a7 52-249.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, relying on our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997), the trial court awarded the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 42-150aa (b), $459.90 in attorney\u2019s fees, 15 percent of the amount the defendant owed the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">\u201cThe question of whether a particular statute . . . applies to a given state of facts is a question of statutory interpretation .... Statutoiy interpretation presents a question of law for the court. . . . Our review is, therefore, plenary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Original Grasso Construction Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>70 Conn. App. 404, 418, 799 A.2d 1083, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 932, 806 A.2d 1065 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Section 42-150aa (b), which applies to attorney\u2019s fees in actions based on consumer contracts, provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a lawsuit in which money damages are claimed is commenced by an attorney who is not a salaried employee of the holder of a contract . . . such holder may receive or collect attorney\u2019s fees, if not otherwise prohibited by law, of <em>not more than fifteen per cent of the amount of any judgment which is </em>entered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, the plaintiffs attorney, who was not a salaried employee, initiated the underlying proceedings. Accordingly, under \u00a7 42-150aa (b), the plaintiffs recovery of attorney\u2019s fees was limited to 15 percent of the amount of the judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Section 52-249 (a), however, which applies to an action of foreclosure of a lien, \u201cmandates that the plaintiff in a foreclosure action shall be allowed reasonable attorney\u2019s fees when there has been a hearing as to the form of judgment during the foreclosure action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 419. Accordingly, under \u00a7 52-249 (a), the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees on the foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">A literal interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 42-150aa and 52-249 would award the plaintiff duplicate attorney\u2019s fees. That, however, is not this case. Attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150aa would be for the contract aspects of the action, and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 52-249 would be for the foreclosure aspects of the action. \u201c[A] foreclosure action constitutes an equitable proceeding. ... In an equitable proceeding, the trial court may examine all relevant factors to ensure that complete justice is done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moasser </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>78 Conn. App. 305, 324, 828 A.2d 116, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 910, 832 A.2d 70 (2003). On remand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>therefore, the court should take into account the attorney\u2019s fees that it awards the plaintiff under \u00a7 42-150aa in fashioning its award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 52-249.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The judgment is reversed only as to the limitation on the defendant\u2019s damages and the award of attorney\u2019s fees, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> See footnote 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-36 (a) provides: \u201cNo mechanic\u2019s lien may attach to any building or its appurtenances, or to the land on which the same stands, or any lot, or any plot of land, in favor of any person, to a greater amount in the whole than the price which the owner agreed to pay for the building and its appurtenances or the development of any such lot, or the development of any such plot of land.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-249 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe plaintiff in any action of foreclosure of a mortgage or lien, upon obtaining judgment of foreclosure, when there has been a hearing as to the form of judgment or the limitation of time for redemption, shall be allowed the same costs, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, as if there had been a hearing on an issue of fact. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever any contract . . . entered into on or after October 1,1979, to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney\u2019s fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney\u2019s fees shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>counterclaim based upon the contract .... Except as herein provided, the size of the attorney\u2019s fee awarded to the consumer shall be based as far as practicable upon the terms governing the size of the fee for the commercial party. . . .

As the court noted in its memorandum of decision, the plaintiff never objected during the trial as to the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim or the admissibility of the evidence regarding the damage to the interior of the defendant\u2019s house because it was not properly pleaded. \u201c[T]he proper way to attack a variance between pleadings and proof is by objection at the trial to the admissibility of that evidence which varies from the pleadings, and failure to do so at the trial constitutes a waiver of any objection to such variance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 461, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990), on remand, 24 Conn.

Because the plaintiff never raised an objection as to a variance between the pleadings and the evidence, any insufficiency in the pleading was waived, and the court should have addressed the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\"> Under the terms of the contract, the defendant agreed to \u201cpay all accrued interest, collection costs and <em>reasonable attorney fees </em>in the event of nonpayment of this contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\"> In <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 77 n.18, our Supreme Court stated: \u201c[WJhenever there is an attorney\u2019s fees clause in the commercial party\u2019s contract, that clause is subject to [General Statutes] \u00a7 42-150aa, and the contract must be read as incorporating that provision\u2019s 15 percent limitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
