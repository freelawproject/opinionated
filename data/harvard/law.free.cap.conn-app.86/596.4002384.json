Lewis, Jr., appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered after it granted the motion for summary judgment filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>by the defendant, Chelsea G.C.A. Realty Partnership, L.P. The plaintiff claims that the court (1) incorrectly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over counts two and three of his complaint, and (2) improperly applied the Noerr-Pennington<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine to count one of his complaint. We reverse the judgment of the trial court rendered following the granting of the motion for summary judgment and remand the case with direction to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">This case is one of a series arising out of the defendant\u2019s development of an outlet mall, Clinton Crossing Factory Stores (Clinton Crossing), in Clinton. The parties first came into conflict in August, 1994, when the plaintiff, a real estate developer and resident of Clinton, joined the Clinton Organization for Responsible Development (citizen group), a citizen group concerned by the defendant\u2019s development plans. Although not himself a party, the plaintiff provided funding for the citizen group to appeal, in March, 1995, after the Clinton planning and zoning commission\u2019s approval to build Clinton Crossing and, in May, 1995, after the commission\u2019s grant of a variance to erect a sign and to permit parking in the surrounding residential areas (zoning appeals). The plaintiff also recommended to the citizen group an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ney, Paul R. Kraus, who had worked for him in the past, to handle the appeals. The Superior Court dismissed both zoning appeals, finding that the plaintiffs named in the appeals lacked standing because none of them owned land that abutted or was within 100 feet of the development. This court granted certification to appeal in both cases. The appeals were subsequently withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Concerned by the plaintiffs interference with the development of Clinton Crossing, the defendant sought legal advice in October, 1995, to determine whether the plaintiffs actions violated federal or state law. Once counsel discovered that the plaintiff had filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut in September, 1995, counsel recommended that the defendant file a claim therein, alleging violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. In January, 1996, the defendant filed an adversary proceeding under \u00a7 523 (a) (6) of the Bankruptcy Code, objecting to the bankruptcy discharge of the debt allegedly owed by the plaintiff to the defendant as a result of the plaintiffs CUTPA violations (adversary proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">While the adversary proceeding was pending, the plaintiff filed this action in July, 1996. The plaintiff alleged violations of CUTPA in that the defendant\u2019s adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court and other activities deprived him of his counsel, Kraus, impaired his ability to work as a developer in Clinton, and prevented him from exercising his rights as a resident of Clinton to ensure that the zoning regulations and wetlands laws were followed (count one). During the pendency of this case, the defendant withdrew its adversary proceeding with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>amended his complaint in November, 1998, adding a second count alleging a vexatious litigation claim under General Statutes \u00a7 52-568 and a third count alleging a violation of CUTPA, both based on the adversary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">At the close of pleadings, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the activities alleged in all three counts of the complaint were protected by the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, that the defendant had established an advice of counsel defense to counts two and three, and that counts two and three were preempted by bankruptcy law. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine barred count one and that bankruptcy law preempted counts two and three. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to counts two and three on federal preemption grounds because the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure are directed at disciplining attorneys who bring frivolous actions, but not at compensating the victims of such actions. The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly applied the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine in rendering summary judgment as to count one because the activities of the plaintiff, himself, related to the zoning appeals were protected by the doctrine. As alternative grounds for affirmance, the defendant argues that the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine bars all three claims, and that counts two and three are barred because it filed the adversary proceeding in reliance on counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cOur review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ryan Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>M &amp; G Associates, </em>266 Conn. 520, 525, 832 A.2d 1180 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly determined that counts two and three of his complaint, which alleged vexatious litigation and violation of CUTPA, were preempted by bankruptcy law. Federal preemption implicates the court\u2019s jurisdiction. See <em>Cox Cable Advisory Councilor. Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>259 Conn. 56, 62, 788 A.2d 29, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 819, 123 S. Ct. 95, 154 L. Ed. 2d 25 (2002). \u201cThe question of preemption is one of federal law, arising under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution. . . . Determining whether Congress has exercised its power to preempt state law is a question of legislative intent. . . . [A]bsent an explicit statement that Congress intends to preempt state law, courts should infer such intent where Congress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law ... or where the state law at issue conflicts with federal law, either because it is impossible to comply with both ... or because the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of congressional objectives . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barbieri </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>255 Conn. 708, 717, 771 A.2d 915 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The United States constitution grants to Congress the power to establish \u201cuniform Laws on the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>of Bankruptcies throughout the United States . . . .\u201d U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. Congress has given the United States district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters arising under title 11 of the United States Code. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334 (a). Through the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et. seq., Congress has provided \u201ca comprehensive federal system of penalties and protection to govern the orderly conduct of debtors\u2019 affairs and creditors\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>Eastern Equipment &amp; Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Factory Point National Bank, </em>236 F.3d 117, 120 (2d Cir. 2001). The code \u201ccontains remedies for the misuse of the [bankruptcy] process more generally . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Astor Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roski, </em>325 F. Sup. 2d 251, 262 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303 (i) (2) (creditors who file involuntary bankruptcy petition in bad faith are liable for damages); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 (h) (persons who wilfully violate bankruptcy stay are liable for damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Significantly for the plaintiffs claim before this court, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, promulgated under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2075, provide a remedy for the bad faith filing of an adversary proceeding. Rule 9011 provides that every filing with the Bankruptcy Court shall be signed by either an attorney or unrepresented party, and that such signature certifies that the filing is made in good faith and not for the purpose of needlessly increasing the cost of litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sanctions for viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tions of the rule \u201cshall [be] impose[d] on the person who signed [the submission], the represented party, or both [and] may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the document, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011 (a) (1994). The plaintiff argues that the purpose of rule 9011 is to punish attorneys who bring frivolous lawsuits, not to compensate victims injured by such bad behavior. It may be true that the rule is punitive in nature, but the language of the rule as it existed at the time of the adversary proceeding makes it clear that the plaintiff could have sought in Bankruptcy Court, based on the defendant\u2019s alleged bad faith filing of the adversary proceeding, to impose sanctions on the defendant directing payment of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, the plaintiff could have sought damages under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, which provides that any attorney who \u201cso multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\u201d The plaintiff, thus, was not without a remedy in Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Although it is true that the federal remedies provided for in the bankruptcy context do not offer the substantial damages available under Connecticut\u2019s vexatious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>litigation statute and CUTPA, that is an insufficient basis on which to preclude preemption. The threat of such tort actions and the potential for a large recovery may itself deter individuals from exercising their rights in bankruptcy, thereby frustrating the purpose of the bankruptcy process. See <em>MSR Exploration, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Meridian Oil, Inc., </em>74 F.3d 910, 916 (9th Cir. 1996). It is, thus, \u201cfor Congress and the federal courts, not the state courts, to decide what . . . penalties are appropriate for use in connection with the bankruptcy process and when those . . . penalties shall be utilized.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We note that a majority of courts that have considered the preemptive nature of bankruptcy law in the context of state tort claims alleging violations of the bankruptcy process have found such claims to be preempted. See, e.g., <em>Eastern Equipment &amp; Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Factory Point National Bank, </em>supra, 236 F.3d 121 (District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear state law tort claims alleging violations of automatic stay); <em>MSR Exploration, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Meridian Oil, Inc., </em>supra, 74 F.3d 916 (malicious prosecution action in District Court for bad faith filing of creditor\u2019s claim in bankruptcy proceeding preempted by Bankruptcy Code); <em>Astor Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roski, </em>supra, 325 F. Sup. 2d 263 (claims sounding in state law that defendant filed bankruptcy petition, certain papers with Bankruptcy Court in bad faith cannot be brought in federal District Court due to preemption by Bankruptcy Code); <em>Idell </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>224 Cal. App. 3d 262, 270-71, 273 Cal. Rptr. 605 (1990) (claim brought in state court alleging malicious prosecution for bad faith filing of adversary proceeding in Bankruptcy Court preempted by rule 9011 of Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The exclusivity of federal jurisdiction over bankruptcy proceedings, the complexity and comprehensiveness of Congress\u2019 regulation in the area of bankruptcy law and the existence of federal sanctions for the filing of frivolous and malicious pleadings in bankruptcy must be read as Congress\u2019 implicit rejection of alternative remedies such as those the plaintiff seeks. Accordingly, we determine that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over counts two and three of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly determined that count one of his complaint was barred under <em>the Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. We do not reach the issue of <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>because we determine that count one is preempted by bankruptcy law as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The issue of whether bankruptcy law preempted the court\u2019s jurisdiction over count one was not raised before either the trial court or this court on appeal. Count one, like counts two and three, appears to be premised entirely on the adversary proceeding brought by the defendant in the Bankruptcy Court. In light of the apparent similarity between the three counts, we raised the issue sua sponte. \u201c[T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction, because it addresses the basic competency of the court, can be raised by any of the parties, or by the court sua sponte, at any time.\u201d (Internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>Beneduci </em>v. <em>Valadares, </em>73 Conn. App. 795, 805, 812 A.2d 41 (2002). Federal preemption implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Cox Cable Advisory Council </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility </em>Control, supra, 259 Conn. 62. Following oral argument, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs simultaneously, addressing whether count one of the amended complaint was barred by federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In count one, the plaintiff first alleged that the defendant brought the adversary proceeding in order to harass the plaintiff and his attorney, Kraus, and that, as a result, the plaintiff incurred expenses and attorney\u2019s fees. The complaint also alleged in relevant part that \u201c[a]s a result of the Defendant\u2019s activities, statements, conversations with town officials, commentaries, correspondence, and other activities, the Plaintiffs ability to function in the Town of Clinton as a builder and developer has been severely impaired and damaged . . . [and he] has incurred and will continue to incur loss of business, reputation, and good will . . . .\u201d Other than making those general allegations in the complaint, however, the plaintiff did not allege facts as to the defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities\u201d or otherwise treat count one as founded on anything other than the adversary proceeding. The court\u2019s understanding, as made evident in its memorandum of decision, was that count one was in fact premised only on the adversary proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In his supplemental brief, the plaintiff failed to provide this court with any reason why count one raised a claim in any way distinct from counts two and three. Count one, in all relevant respects, is, thus, identical to those claims brought in counts two and three, which the court determined were precluded by federal law. We hold, therefore, that count one of the plaintiffs complaint alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>CUTPA violations is preempted by bankruptcy law for the same reasons we discussed in part I. Accordingly, we determine that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The form of the judgment is improper, the judgment for the defendant is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\"> <em>Thz Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine, which originates from a \u201ctrio of federal antitrust cases, <em>California Motor Transport Co. </em>v. <em>Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 92 S.

A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign all papers and state the party\u2019s address and telephone number. The signature of an attorney or a party constitutes a certificate that the attorney or a party has read the document; that to the best of the attorney\u2019s or party\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation or administration of the case.
