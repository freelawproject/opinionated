The charges in this case arose out of a confrontation between the defendant and his friends and another group of people, during which the victim\u2019s leg was broken in two places. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) he was denied the right to due process because he was the victim of a vindictive prosecution, and (2) the court improperly refused to allow him to discharge his privately retained counsel and to substitute a public defender as his attorney. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The defendant first claims that he was denied the right to due process because he was the victim of a vindictive prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He maintains that the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tor filed additional charges against him in retaliation for his filing a motion for a bill of particulars, a motion that he had a legal right to make. We disagree.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201cActual vindictiveness must play no part in a prosecutorial or sentencing decision and, since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of his rights, the appearance of vindictiveness must also be avoided.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>221 F.3d 83, 94 (2d Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 953, 121 S. Ct. 2599, 150 L. Ed. 2d 757 (2001). \u201cA . . . court\u2019s factual findings on prosecutorial vindictiveness are reviewed for clear error and the legal principles which guide the . . . court are reviewed de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>171 F.3d 139, 140 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u201cBefore the commencement of trial, a prosecutor has broad authority to amend an information under Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Book \u00a7 623 [now \u00a7 36-17]. Once the trial has started, however, the prosecutor is constrained by the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 624 [now \u00a7 36-18]. . . . This court has held that for purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 \u00a7 623 [now \u00a7 36-17] and 624 [now \u00a7 36-18], a criminal trial begins with the voir dire of the prospective jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Phillips, 67 Conn. App. 535, 539, 787 A.2d 616 (2002). Because of the constraints imposed on a prosecutor\u2019s ability to add charges to the information depending on their timing, we must conduct a separate analysis for the charge added before the commencement of trial and for the charges added after the voir dire of the prospective jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The prosecutor added the charge of interfering with an officer before the trial commenced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA presumption of vindictiveness generally does not arise in a pretrial setting.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>211 F.3d 711, 717 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1015, 121 S. Ct. 574, 148 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2000). Therefore, the defendant must show actual vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor. \u201cTo establish an actual vindictive motive, a defendant must prove objectively that the prosecutor\u2019s charging decision was a direct and unjustifiable penalty . . . that resulted solely from the defendant\u2019s exercise of a protected legal right .... Put another way, the defendant must show that (1) the prosecutor harbored genuine animus toward the defendant, or was prevailed upon to bring the charges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a stalking horse, and (2) [the defendant] would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 716-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The defendant argues that the charge of interfering with an officer was added to the information in retaliation for his filing a motion for a bill of particulars. After reviewing the record, we do not believe this to be a case of vindictive prosecution. The charge was added a short time before the voir dire of the prospective jury began. That timing was not unusual insofar as it was the last opportunity the prosecutor had to add charges before the trial commenced, and all future substitutions had to meet the stricter requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 36-18. Additionally, as explained by the prosecutor, when a bill of particulars is requested, the state typically must go over the file and, as a result, may add new charges that come to light. Because the prosecutor was not informed of jury selection and only received notice of the bill of particulars moments before the commencement of trial, in keeping with the usual practice, the prosecutor added a charge she thought was appropriate and that would have emerged had she had the time and opportunity to review the case file. That the charge was warranted is evidenced by the jury\u2019s finding the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant of it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>We conclude that the charge of interfering with a police officer was filed in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 36-17 and therefore was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">After the trial had commenced, the state filed another substitute information, adding the charges of assault in the second degree, assault in the third degree and carrying a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAfter commencement of the trial for good cause shown, the judicial authority may permit the prosecuting authority to amend the information at any time before a verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and no substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced. ...\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 36-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The defendant already had been charged with assault in the second degree as a principal. The added charge of assault in the second degree was as an accessory. The court stated that \u201caccessory liability is not a substantive offense under our statutes.\u201d The court also found that the charge of assault in the third degree merely was a lesser offense included within the existing charge of assault in the second degree. Therefore, the court determined that the new charges were not additional offenses or different from those originally charged and that no substantive rights of the defendant were being prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">When charged with a given offense, defendants are on notice that they may be convicted as an accessory or of a lesser included offense, neither of which constitutes an additional offense or one that is different from those charged for the purposes of trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>76 Conn. App. 779, 795, 821 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 918, 826 A.2d 1160 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>68 Conn. App. 194, 215, 792 A.2d 856 (2002). Therefore, charges concerning lesser included offenses or accessory liability may be added by substitute information without there being a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 36-18. Nothing in the record suggests that the defendant did not have adequate notice of the charges against which he had to defend. He did not show that he was unfairly surprised. His only argument is that he was deprived of a substantive right because of vindictive prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">During argument regarding the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, the prosecutor stated that she normally adds accessory liability and lesser included offenses when she is required to create a bill of particulars. That was not in retaliation for the filing of the motion, but rather a manifestation of her belief that without the addition of those charges, the defendant would not have notice of them and the state would be precluded from arguing them to the jury. We believe the prosecutor was attempting to abide by the holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Steve, </em>11 Conn. App. 699, 529 A.2d 229 (1987), aff'd, 208 Conn. 38, 544 A.2d 1179 (1988), in which this court determined that \u201c[i]n light of the state\u2019s particularization of the offenses, both in its bill of particulars and in its representation up until the close of the evidence, the defendant was justified in believing that the state was not proceeding upon the theory of accessory liability and in relying upon the prior expressed particularization of the two charges.\u201d Id., 706-707. The court held that the defendant\u2019s conviction on a theory of accessory liability could not stand. Id., 707-708.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tor merely gave explicit notice of the theories of liability and lesser included offenses she would be pursuing at trial. In light of that explanation by the prosecutor, the defendant has failed to show that the prosecutor added the charges in retaliation for his having filed a motion for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly refused to allow him to discharge his privately retained counsel and substitute a public defender as his attorney. The defendant argues that this violated his sixth amendment right to assistance of counsel because he had' advised the court of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. We conclude that the defendant waived any claim that the court should have allowed him to discharge his counsel and, therefore, decline to review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201cWaiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. ... It involves the idea of assent, and assent is an act of understanding. . . . The rule is applicable that no one shall be permitted to deny that he intended the natural consequences of his acts and conduct. ... In order to waive a claim of law it is not necessary . . . that a party be certain of the correctness of the claim and its legal efficacy. It is enough if he knows of the existence of the claim and of its reasonably possible efficacy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Vaccaro, </em>80 Conn. App. 436, 445-46, 835 A.2d 491 (2003), cert. denied, 268 Conn. 920, 846 A.2d 881 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Although the defendant asked the court to discharge and to substitute counsel, he later retracted his request. The defendant first stated to the court: \u201c[I]n light of yesterday, speaking with my lawyer, I would, I need to fire my lawyer, under a conflict of interest. . . . I\u2019ve spoken with him ... I met up with him in a grocery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>store yesterday and, uh, he\u2019s done, he told me new charges had also been brought that I wasn\u2019t aware of. And, he says, he\u2019s not getting paid, and I tried to fire him before, and he said he had to defend me. And I told him I can\u2019t afford him no more. ... I feel that he\u2019s not, he told me several times that I\u2019m holding up his practice. . . . [H]e says he doesn\u2019t believe me. I feel that\u2019s someone that can\u2019t represent me to my best ability, to best ability.\u201d When the defendant\u2019s counsel entered the courtroom, he was informed by the court that the defendant \u201chas indicated that he wants to discharge you as his attorney.\u201d After the court considered the issues involving the substitute information, counsel for the defendant asked for the opportunity to confer with his client. The defendant and his counsel left the courtroom. Upon their return, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Lee, was there anything you wanted to say before\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: Well, I, can I?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. You don\u2019t have to say anything if you don\u2019t want to. I mean, you expressed some concerns to me before [your attorney] came in the door. If you don\u2019t have those concerns anymore after speaking to him this morning or if something else has changed, that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to say anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Well, with the first, the first time I addressed the court, I talked with my attorney, and I\u2019d like to stop going forward with that.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m sorry?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019d like to stop going forward with what we spoke with about earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>We conclude that the defendant manifested a desire to retain his current attorney when the court inquired as to his concerns regarding his counsel\u2019s representation. Because the defendant withdrew his previous request, the court did not have an opportunity to rule on his motion to discharge and to substitute counsel. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim because the defendant expressly waived his objection to the representation by his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> Upon agreement of the parties, the defendant\u2019s conviction of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) was merged with the conviction of assault in the second degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> The state argues that the defendant\u2019s claim of vindictive prosecution is unpreserved. We disagree. The defendant repeatedly objected to the addition of charges and specifically stated to the court in relevant part: \u201cI\u2019m not filing this [motion for a bill of particulars] to induce more charges, Judge. I, I just want to know what the charges are.\u201d During the hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the additional charges, defense counsel argued: \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the state\u2019s position that my filing a bill of particulars is to invite further charges against my client. I\u2019d find that very troubling. Filing a bill of particulars is to get information to be informed as to what the charge, what the state intends to charge. I\u2019d . . . consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>it a veiy upsetting prospect that just by filing a motion for further specificity, that thereby I\u2019m asking that more charges be filed against my client. I think that would be outrageous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Woven into the facts of the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding vindictive prosecution were objections to actions taken by the court prior to trial. At the time the defendant rejected the prosecutor\u2019s plea offer, the court stated: \u201cAll right. That\u2019s fine. Mr. Lee, I think that it\u2019s appropriate that you go to trial on these matters. I think it\u2019s appropriate that you be given the opportunity to prove that you\u2019re innocent of these particular charges. <em>I also think it\u2019s appropriate, if you\u2019re found guilty, that you receive a much more severe sentence than what I offered to resolve the case here today. </em>I also want you to understand that if you begin picking \u2014 once you leave here today and you come back and say, gee, I made a mistake. I think I better take that before I go to trial, that offer is gone. All right. You\u2019re looking at a much more severe sentence even from me. I want that understood.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">It is appropriate for the court to ensure that a defendant understands the penalties he is facing if he elects to go to trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 39-19. It is not, however, appropriate to threaten the defendant with a more severe sentence. Rather, it is appropriate to inform him only that he potentially faces such a sentence. Although we note that impropriety, we conclude that the court\u2019s statements were harmless given that the defendant maintained his rejection of the offer, and that a different judge presided over the trial and at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 36-17 provides that \u201c[i]f the trial has not commenced, the prosecuting authority may amend the information, or add additional counts, or file a substitute information. Upon motion of the defendant, the judicial authority, in its discretion, may strike the amendment or added counts or substitute information, if the trial or the cause would be unduly delayed or the substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Practice Book \u00a7 36-18 provides that \u201c[a]fter commencement of the trial for good cause shown, the judicial authority may permit the prosecuting authority to amend the information at any time before a verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and no substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced. An amendment may charge an additional or different offense with the express consent of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> The defendant suggests that it is not known whether the charge was added before the voir dire of the prospective jurors. A review of the record shows that the discussion of the charge happened before the prospective jurors entered the courtroom, and the court included the charge in its opening statement to the potential jurors. The court, itself, later stated: \u201cThe state filed a substitute information Tuesday morning, before we started picking the first jury, adding a count of [interfering with a police officer], isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d The charge of interfering with an officer, therefore, was added before the commencement of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> The court found that the charge of carrying a dangerous weapon was a new and different offense added after the commencement of trial. Therefore, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> We note that defendants axe on notice that they may be convicted of lessex included offenses when changed with a greater offense; <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>187 Conn. 216, 219, 445 A.2d 585 (1982); or convicted as an accessory when charged as a principal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>84 Conn. App. 283, 290-91, 853 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 928, 859 A.2d 584 (2004). Thus, aprosecutor will not be precluded from attempting to obtain a conviction on those charges even if they axe not described as separate charges in the bill of particulars and added in a subsequent substitute information as long as the evidence at trial and the charging documents do not specify particularly that those avenues will not be pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
