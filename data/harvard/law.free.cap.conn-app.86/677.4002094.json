To enforce this assessment, No. 01-129 of the 2001 Public Acts (now codified at \u00a7 18-85b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the General Statutes), and \u00a7 18-85a-2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies authorize the state to place a lien on an inheritance received by an inmate. The principal issue in this case is whether, as applied under the circumstances of this case, the statute is unconstitutional because it violates an inmate\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws. We agree with the trial court that the defendant has not alleged facts that, if proven, would establish that his constitutional rights have been impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The plaintiffs, Gary Alexander (inmate) and Sallie Alexander, the executrix of the estate of Alfred Joseph Alexander (executrix), brought an action to contest the validity of a lien asserted by the defendants, the commissioner of administrative services and the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>missioner of correction, on one half of the inmate\u2019s share in the Alexander estate. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the plaintiffs filed suit for an injunction to prevent the defendants from seizing any of the inmate\u2019s inherited funds. In response to the judgment of the trial court granting the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint, the plaintiffs filed a substitute complaint. The defendants again filed a motion to strike. The plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the trial court striking their substitute complaint. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The facts are undisputed. The inmate has been incarcerated for thirty years in accordance with consecutive sentences that he began serving in 1975. After the death of his father in 2001, a Probate Court ruled that the inmate\u2019s share in the father\u2019s estate was $27,800. The defendants have placed a lien of $13,900 on these inherited funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The plaintiffs appeal, on two grounds, from the judgment of the trial court striking their complaint. In their view, they had a right to be heard on the merits of their claims that the defendants\u2019 hen violated their rights to substantive due process and to equal protection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because their claims raise issues of law, they are entitled to plenary review by this court. <em>Kroll </em>v. <em>Steere, </em>60 Conn. App. 376, 384, 759 A.2d 541, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 909, 763 A.2d 1035 (2000). We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">SCOPE OF APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The scope of our review of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is limited by the fact that, when the trial court struck the plaintiffs\u2019 first complaint, the plaintiffs elected to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>substitute complaint rather than to take an immediate appeal. \u201cAs a general rule, [t]he filing of an amended pleading operates as a waiver of the right to claim that there was error in the sustaining of the [motion to strike] the original pleading.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>243 Conn. 66, 74, 700 A.2d 655 (1997); <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>52 Conn. App. 724, 733, 737 A.2d 456, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 929, 738 A.2d 653, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>528 U.S. 1005, 120 S. Ct. 500, 145 L. Ed. 2d 386 (1999). Accordingly, the plaintiffs are precluded from appealing from the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling striking the claims in their substitute complaint unless the allegations set forth therein differ materially from those asserted in their original complaint. <em>See Parsons v. United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 74; <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>supra, 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Our review of the plaintiffs\u2019 appellate claims must start, therefore, with an examination of the allegations contained in their original complaint. There, they claimed that the defendants, in deciding to impose the lien, had violated their rights (1) to procedural due process, (2) under the takings clause of the fifth amendment, (3) to substantive due process and (4) under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In their substitute complaint, the plaintiffs set forth additional grounds in support of their prior equal protection claim. They did not, however, amend any other counts of their complaint. Indeed, at oral argument in this court, they characterized the substantive due process argument that they were continuing to pursue as an equal protection claim. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs do not have the right to appeal from the court\u2019s decision to strike their claims alleging violations of procedural due process, substantive due process and the takings clause of the fifth amendment. Specifically, we will not address that part of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim that alleged unfairness in imposing a lien on the inmate\u2019s inheritance because the lien statute was not yet in force at the time of his sentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim stands on a different footing. On that issue, the plaintiffs alleged in their original complaint that \u201c[t]he defendants have not uniformly taxed all sentenced inmates the cost of their incarceration as permitted by the aforesaid laws and regulations, and in attempting to seize the assets of the [inmate] as aforesaid they have acted arbitrarily and irrationally and have intentionally subjected him to disparate treatment in violation of the equal protection clause of the [fourteenth [ajmendment.\u201d In their substitute complaint, the plaintiffs again alleged this paragraph, verbatim, as paragraph 7 (A). They also, however, included new allegations in support of their equal protection claim. In particular, they asserted that:</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\u201c(C) The defendants\u2019 seizure of the [inmate\u2019s] property in this case is arbitrary, and unbounded by any discemable standard in that the defendants have no policy or procedure in place permitting them to identify which inmates have assets, and which inmates do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\u201c(D) The defendants\u2019 seizure of the [inmate\u2019s] property in this case is not the result of any audit, or the product of any policy adopted or followed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201c(E) The manner in which the defendants choose to seize property is a function of the notoriety of the inmate or the perceived need of the defendants to make a public statement about being \u2018tough\u2019 on crime and those convicted of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201c(F) The decision to seize the [inmate\u2019s] property in this case is inspired by malice in that it is not the product of any systemic policy, but is, instead, a function of the defendants\u2019 political and policy objectives of appearing to be tough on crime and its consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201c(G) In the alternative, the decision to seize the [inmate\u2019s] property is entirely random and unguided by any discemable principle recognized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">In effect, the plaintiffs\u2019 substitute complaint included new allegations that transformed their previous, generic equal protection claim into a colorable claim of selective enforcement. In particular, the plaintiffs alleged that the state unfairly targeted this inmate to the exclusion of other inmates who were similarly situated. We conclude, therefore, that the additional allegations set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 substitute complaint differ materially from the equal protection allegation contained in their original complaint. Accordingly, in this appeal, the plaintiffs are not precluded from challenging the court\u2019s ruling striking their equal protection claim from the substitute complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">We turn then to the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim. The plaintiffs\u2019 argue that the substitute complaint adequately alleged an equal protection violation in its claims of difference of treatment between this inmate and other inmates. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants lacked a rational basis for this differential treatment. We do not agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that these allegations were sufficiently fact based to withstand a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In effect, the plaintiffs claim that, as applied to them, \u00a7 18-85b<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is unconstitutional. The plaintiffs bear a heavy burden when they challenge the constitutionality of a statute. \u201c[B]ecause a validly enacted statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, those who challenge its constitutionality must sustain the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In construing a statute, moreover, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 291, 833 A.2d 363 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike. <em>City of Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985) (citing <em>Plyler </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 2394, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 [1982]). . . . <em>Zahra </em>v. <em>Southold, </em>48 F.3d 674, 683 (2d Cir. 1995). A violation of equal protection by selective [treatment] arises if: (1) the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated; and (2) . . . such selective treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person. <em>LaTrieste Restaurant &amp; Cabaret, Inc. </em>v. <em>Village of Port Chester, </em>40 F.3d 587, 590 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>627 F.2d 606, 609-10 [2d Cir. 1980], cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1418, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 [1981]).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>249 Conn. 385, 392-93, 734 A.2d 535 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>(1999) , cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1187, 120 S. Ct. 1239, 146 L. Ed. 2d 99 (2000). The burden of proving a selective enforcement claim is on the plaintiffs. See id., 391-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">In their substitute complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that \u201c[t]he defendants have not uniformly taxed all sentenced inmates the cost of their incarceration as permitted by the aforesaid laws and regulations, and in attempting to seize the assets of the [inmate] as aforesaid they have acted arbitrarily and irrationally and have intentionally subjected him to disparate treatment in violation of the equal protection clause of the [fourteenth [a]mendment.\u201d The trial court concluded that this claim was legally insufficient because the plaintiffs failed to allege specific instances of discrimination among the members of the class of eligible inmates. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\u201c[T]he requirement imposed upon [p]laintiffs claiming an equal protection violation [is that they] identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly in all <em>relevant </em>aspects were treated differently .... <em>Dartmouth Review </em>v. <em>Dartmouth College, </em>889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989). . . . <em>Rubinovitz </em>v. <em>Rogato, </em>60 F.3d 906, 910 (1st Cir. 1995).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>253 Conn. 661, 672, 757 A.2d 1 (2000) , cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1148, 121 S. Ct. 1089, 148 L. Ed. 2d 963 (2001). The plaintiffs\u2019 substitute complaint is devoid of any comparison between this inmate and other inmates who also received inheritances but against whom the state chose not to impose liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">At oral argument, the plaintiffs explained that they chose to forgo specific allegations in their complaint lest such disclosures inform the defendants of the identity of other inmates with potentially lienable inheritances. However understandable these considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>may be, they do not excuse the plaintiffs\u2019 obligation under the law of this state<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to provide the trial court with pleadings that contain \u201ca plain and concise statement of the material facts on which the pleader relies . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 10-1. See, e.g., <em>Dornfried </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 622, 629, 646 A.2d 772 (1994); <em>Hendel\u2019s Investors Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>62 Conn. App. 263, 274, 771 A.2d 182 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On the record in this case, we agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to support their equal protection claim. We conclude, therefore, that the court properly struck the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-85a provides: \u201cThe Commissioner of Correction shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 concerning the assessment of inmates of correctional institutions or facilities for the costs of their incarceration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-85b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) In the case of causes of action of any person obligated to pay the costs of such person\u2019s incarceration under section 18-85a and regulations adopted in accordance with said section, the claim of the state shall be a lien against the proceeds therefrom in the amount of the costs of incarceration or fifty per cent of the proceeds received by such person after payment of all expenses connected with the cause of action, whichever is less, for repayment under said section ....

The Court of Probate shall accept any such lien notice filed by the commissioner or the commissioner\u2019s designee with the court prior to the distribution of such inheritance, and to the extent of such inheritance not already distributed, the court shall order distribution in accordance therewith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> Section 18-85a-2 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u201cOn or after October 1, 1997, inmates shall be charged for and shall be responsible to pay the assessed cost of incarceration, as defined in 18-85a-l (a).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> The plaintiffs conceded their inability to pursue their procedural due process claim at oral argument in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"> In their substitute complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that \u201c[t]he aforesaid seizure of the [inmate\u2019s] assets is not a \u2018tax\u2019 within the meaning of any tax code arising under the laws of the [s]tate of Connecticut, but [is], instead, a consequence of incarceration as an inmate.\u201d This claim differs from the plaintiffs\u2019 earlier substantive due process-ex post facto claim in form alone. Both claims are identical in their allegation that the state unfairly \u201cpunished\u201d the inmate when, after he had been incarcerated, it imposed a lien on his inheritance.
