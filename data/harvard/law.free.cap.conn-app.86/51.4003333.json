In order to deal with the severe risk of injury to the public that is caused by intoxicated drivers, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ture has enacted two basic statutes. It is undisputed that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a, an adult who is determined to have been operating a motor vehicle with an elevated blood alcohol content of 0.08 of a percent or more may be arrested for the crime of \u201coperating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d and risks suspension of his operator\u2019s license under General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is equally undisputed that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227g, no person under twenty-one years of age \u201cshall operate a motor vehicle on a public highway\u201d with an elevated blood alcohol content of 0.02 of a percent or more.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue that we must decide is whether a driver under the age of twenty-one risks suspension of his operator\u2019s license even though \u00a7 14-227g does not contain the phrase \u201coperating. . . . under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d The driver maintains that, because of this omission, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>commissioner of motor vehicles had no authority to suspend his operator\u2019s license and was limited to pursuit of a criminal prosecution. The trial court nonetheless dismissed the driver\u2019s appeal from the administrative decision suspending his license. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The parties agree about the underlying facts. On May 17, 2003, a police officer stopped the plaintiff for operating a motor vehicle without functioning taillights, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff was then eighteen years old. While talking to the plaintiff, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol on the plaintiffs breath. The plaintiff agreed to take standard field sobriety tests, which he was unable to pass. The officer then drove the plaintiff to police headquarters where the plaintiff agreed to a breath test, which showed elevated blood alcohol content levels of 0.251 of a percent and 0.232 of a percent, sufficient to support an arrest under either \u00a7 14-227a or \u00a7 14-227g. He was arrested for driving without functioning taillights in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96c (d) and for operating a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-227g.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The defendant commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner) initiated license suspension proceedings against the plaintiff on the basis of the plaintiffs failing to pass a chemical alcohol test. At the request of the plaintiff, a hearing officer was appointed by the commissioner to consider whether license suspension was warranted. The hearing officer stated: \u201cThe record reflects that the [plaintiff], a minor, was arrested for violation of [\u00a7] 14-227g .... The hearing proceeded under [\u00a7] 14-227b, which requires a higher [blood alcohol content] reading to produce a violation. Accordingly, there is no prejudice to the [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The plaintiff appealed to the trial court. The court dismissed the appeal on grounds differing from those on which the hearing officer had relied. The court acknowledged the plaintiffs claim that, having been issued a summons for violating \u00a7 14-227g, he had not been arrested for \u201coperating . . . under the influence\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 14-227b (g). The court nonetheless found this claim unpersuasive because, in its view, it was improper for the plaintiff to assume that \u201can offense charged at a police station (as specified in a summons) establishes the offense for which a person was arrested (taken into custody) outside the police station.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, the fact that the plaintiff ultimately was charged under \u00a7 14-227g did not alter the fact that the police officer had arrested him for \u201coperating under the influence\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as that phrase is defined in \u00a7 14-227a (a) and used in \u00a7 14-227b.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">In the plaintiffs appeal to this court, he has raised three issues. He claims that the trial court (1) misconstrued \u00a7 14-227b, (2) improperly substituted its own finding that the plaintiff had been arrested under \u00a7 14-227a for the hearing officer\u2019s finding that he had been arrested under \u00a7 14-227g and (3) improperly found that the plaintiff had not been arrested for violating \u00a7 14-227g. The latter two contentions assume that the legislature did not intend to authorize license suspensions for violations of \u00a7 14-227g. The principal issue in this case, therefore, is whether the plaintiffs assumption about the interrelationship between \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a, 14-227b and 14-227g is justified. Because we conclude that it is not, we affirm the judgment of the trial court upholding the suspension of the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The gravamen of the plaintiffs appeal is that, properly construed, \u00a7 14-227b is inapplicable in his case because the license suspension authorized by that section is triggered only by an arrest for violation of \u00a7 14-227a. It is undisputed that a question of statutory interpretation is a question of law that is entitled to plenary review by this court. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 686, 855 A.2d 212 (2004). As far as we can tell, until this case, no appellate court has had the occasion to interpret \u00a7 14-227g.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u201cWe begin with our well established principles of statutory interpretation in analyzing the [plaintiffs] claim. Our legislature recently has enacted No. 03-154, \u00a7 1, of the 2003 Public Acts, which provides: \u2018The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bergeson </em>v. <em>New London, </em>269 Conn. 763, 769-70, 850 A.2d 184 (2004). The relationship between \u00a7 14-227b and \u00a7 14-227g is <em>not </em>plain and unambiguous. Accordingly, in ascertaining the meaning of these statutes, we will \u201clook to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>267 Conn. 336, 343, 838 A.2d 170 (2004); see <em>also Promoting Enduring Peace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>83 Conn. App. 124, 129, 847 A.2d 1110, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 914, 853 A.2d 528 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The plaintiffs statutory interpretation argument focuses on the fact that, in relevant part, \u00a7 14-227b (g) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>provides that a motor vehicle license suspension hearing must determine, among other things, \u201c(1) [whether] the [arresting] police officer [had] probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle <em>while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . </em>. [and] (2) [whether] <em>such </em>person [was] placed under arrest . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to the plaintiff, the use of the word \u201csuch\u201d establishes that the operator has to have been arrested for violating \u00a7 14-227a rather than for violating \u00a7 14-227g. In further support of this argument, the plaintiff notes that although subsections (b) and (g) of \u00a7 14-227b cross reference several related statutes, these subsections do not refer to \u00a7 14-227g.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 14-227g, in turn, does not use the words operating \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d in describing the conduct that it penalizes. To put it precisely, the plaintiff maintains that only an arrest under a statute that expressly penalizes the operation of a motor vehicle \u201cwhile under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d subjects a driver to the risk of suspension of his driving license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The plaintiffs argument fails to take into account a number of other relevant provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a, 14-227b and 14-227g. Starting with the text of \u00a7 14-227g, we note that subsection (c) states: \u201cThe provisions of subsections (b), (d), (1), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>14-227a, adapted accordingly, shall be applicable to a violation of subsection (a) of this section.\u201d Subsection 14-227a (h) authorizes the suspension of any operator\u2019s license after conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.* *****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is apparent, therefore, that under some circumstances, an arrest under \u00a7 14-227g authorizes suspension of the operator\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Section 14-227b authorizes the commissioner to pursue the civil remedy of license suspension as a sanction for intoxicated operators that is independent of the criminal remedy provided by \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Each statute was enacted in order jointly and severally \u201cto protect the public by removing potentially dangerous drivers from the state\u2019s roadways with all dispatch compatible with due process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>235 Conn. 614, 624, 668 A.2d 1321 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1221, 116 S. Ct. 1851, 134 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1996), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, 257 </em>Conn. 769, 779-80 &amp; n.7, 778 A.2d 947 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1138, 122 S. Ct. 1086, 151 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2002). Indeed, to implement this public policy, our Supreme Court has held that an administrative suspension does not foreclose a subsequent criminal action. Id. In sum, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>authority to suspend an operator\u2019s license is determined by the terms of \u00a7 14-227b and not those of \u00a7 14-227a.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">It is common ground that \u00a7 14-227b authorizes the suspension of the license of any person who was \u201cplaced under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b). What does the term \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d mean? The plaintiff argues that the meaning of the term is established by \u00a7 14-227a (a), which describes it as \u201can elevated blood alcohol content [of] eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a). Because the intoxicated operator\u2019s statutes contain no other definition of \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d the plaintiff would read only the \u00a7 14-227a (a) definition into \u00a7 14-227b (g). It is undeniable that \u00a7 14-227g does not use the magic words \u201cunder the influence\u201d in describing the conduct that it proscribes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs linguistic argument in light of subsection (n) of \u00a7 14-227b. Subsection (n) of \u00a7 14-227b defines \u201celevated blood alcohol con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tent,\u201d which is the determinant of intoxication under both \u00a7 14-227a and \u00a7 14-227g.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It states that, \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section, \u2018elevated blood alcohol content\u2019 means (1) a ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, or (2) <em>if such person is under twenty-one years of age, a ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is two-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (n). It would be illogical for the legislature to have placed subsection (n) in \u201cthis section,\u201d i.e., \u00a7 14-227b, if \u201cthis section\u201d did not include arrests under \u00a7 14-227g. The canons of statutory construction instruct us to inteipret statutes using our common sense to avoid absurd results. <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>260 Conn. 167, 177, 793 A.2d 1076 (2002); <em>Modern Cigarette, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 105, 120, 774 A.2d 969 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the texts of the applicable statutes demonstrate the intent of the legislature for linkage between the statutes governing driving while under the influence of liquor. We conclude that the legislature manifested its intent that persons arrested for violation of \u00a7 14-227g fall within the regulatory authority for license suspension contained in \u00a7 14-227b.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Our construction of the applicability of \u00a714-227b to arrests under \u00a7 14-227g finds support in the public policy behind these statutes. Connecticut case law establishes that our legislature has promulgated \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>unambiguous policy aimed at ensuring that our highways are safe from the carnage associated with drunken drivers.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>224 Conn. 730, 739, 620 A.2d 789 (1993). License suspension furthers that policy by keeping intoxicated operators from injuring other users of our public roads. It would be anomalous, to say the least, to permit the suspension of the driver\u2019s licenses of adult drivers and to forbid the suspension of licenses for younger drivers. Indeed, the inclusion of 0.02 within the definition of \u201celevated blood alcohol content\u201d indicates the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 14-227g documents the legislature\u2019s concern that young drivers should not be allowed to drink and drive. To this end, Representative Michael P. Lawlor explained that, if a person under the age of twenty-one is placed under arrest and tests positive for a blood alcohol level of 0.02 of a percent or above, he should lose his or her license temporarily even though the intoxication does not reach the 0.08 level that applies to adult drivers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Interestingly, Representative Lawlor further opined that a violation of \u00a7 14-227g \u201cis not even a crime. It is simply a loss of license under these circumstances.\u201d 38 II.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1995 Sess., p. 6834.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner properly suspended the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license for violation of \u00a7 14-227g. It is irrelevant that, under the circumstances of this case, the high level of alcohol in the plaintiffs blood also would have warranted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>arrest for violating \u00a7 14-227a. The judgment of the trial court was therefore proper, even though it was based on reasoning that differs from the basis for our decision on this appeal. See <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978) (stating that, \u201c[wjhere the trial court reaches a correct decision but on mistaken grounds, this court has repeatedly sustained the trial court\u2019s action if proper grounds exist to support it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person corn-mils the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both if such person operates a motor vehicle on a public highway of this state or on any road of a district organized under the provisions of chapter 105 . . . while such person has an elevated blood alcohol content. For the purposes of this section, \u2018elevated blood alcohol content\u2019 means a ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d See also, General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b) (stating that person placed under arrest for operating motor vehicle while under influence of intoxicating liquor must be informed \u201cthat such person\u2019s license or nonresident operating privilege may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this section\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (c) (describing circumstances under which police officer may revoke and take possession of license of person arrested for operating motor vehicle while under influence of intoxicating liquor); General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (d) (referencing procedures set forth in subsection [c] for revoking license of person arrested for operating motor vehicle while intoxicated); General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (e) (setting forth criteria for determining date on which commissioner of motor vehicles may suspend license of person arrested for operating motor vehicle while intoxicated).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227g (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person under twenty-one years of age shall operate a motor vehicle on a public highway . . . while the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person is two-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-96c requires that all motor vehicles manufactured after October 1, 1957, have at least two functioning tail lamps.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-5\"> In view of our disposition of the plaintiffs appeal, we need not address the merits of the court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\"> We note that the plaintiff has not challenged the validity of his arrest for violating General Statutes \u00a7 14-96c (d).
