Wright, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 and illegal possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) deprived him of his right to challenge jurors peremptorily and (2) unduly limited his closing argument to the jury. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The charges against the defendant arose from an incident that occurred on the evening of October 15, 2000, in Bridgeport, and resulted in the death of one man and the wounding of a second man, both by gunshot. During jury selection, the defendant attempted to exercise a peremptory challenge following the voir dire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>examination of jurors J and D.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state objected to these attempts and, in each instance, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection and seated the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Immediately following the voir dire examination of J, the following colloquy in relevant part occurred between the court, defense counsel, William Schipul, and the prosecutor, C. Robert Satti, Jr.:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201cThe Court: Thank you. Mr. Satti?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u201cThe Court: Your choice, Mr. Schipul?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I\u2019d ask to be heard on the excuse then, please, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">\u201cThe Court: What\u2019s that?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Nonneutral reason or a neutral reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have a reason, Mr. Schipul? I think it goes to both sides, doesn\u2019t it, after the recent cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">\u201cThe Court: What would be your reason?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, it \u2014 it appeared that the\u2014 that the juror didn\u2019t really want to be here, that there\u2019s something about the body language that \u2014 that suggested that.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">\u201cThe Court: We\u2019re supposed to talk about a race neutral statement that you find some other reason to exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>cise. Now, this \u2014 you know, who knows what\u2019s going to happen down the road here, but I think you\u2019re going to lose your peremptoiy challenges unless you explain them, everybody is, they\u2019re tired of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u201cThe Court: It doesn\u2019t make any sense. What\u2019s \u2014 this man is fair. Will you want to step outside a minute please, [J]?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u201c[J]: There?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u201cThe Court: I think you should go out there. My clerk will be out to get some information.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">[J exited the courtroom.]</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes? You may proceed. What is the rest of your reasoning?</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, he also said at one time that he thinks he can be fair. He wasn\u2019t 100 percent positive about that statement. I agree it was a close call in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">\u201cThe Court: It is? I don\u2019t see anything that shows me any unfairness here. His background doesn\u2019t indicate that, either education or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: We\u2019re looking for somebody that had a little more knowledge about the Bridgeport area, about the areas involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And he apparently doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience with the \u2014 with the area. It . . . seems as if he was \u2014 based upon what he said, the way he was \u2014 the way he was addressing\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">\u201cThe Court: We should have a videotape here so the Appellate Court can look at it. I didn\u2019t see any body language. The man never moved from his chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, he seemed to be looking down a lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Toward the floor, which suggests that a person is not really interested really in\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: \u2014in being here.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u201cThe Court: What\u2019s your position, Mr. Satti?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">\u201c [The Prosecutor]: My position is that I\u2019ve heard nothing that is a race neutral reason for excusing. I move that he be seated as we did . . . earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">\u201cThe Court: Do you think that\u2019s the only issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">\u201cThe Court: What if you had a race neutral issue, but the man said I\u2019d believe every cop I ever saw, coming in to be a witness they would have a strong edge in my mind.' Of course, that would justify a use of a challenge, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: It would be a neutral reason for excusing, correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">\u201cThe Court: But not race oriented?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Correct. What I meant was a neutral reason for \u2014 it\u2019s usually called race neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t see any here. Now, is this the case we want to seat people? Have you got authority? Have you seen other people seated because they have not exhibited anything that would be harmful in any way as a threshold issue for any party on trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-19\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, the \u2014 I make a habit of talking to my client\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I understand that, but your client doesn\u2019t control the selection of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And he doesn\u2019t, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m here to get a fair minded juiy, not a hand chosen selected jury for some nebulous reason. These citizens have a right to serve. And if they\u2019re neutral and they have no ax to grind, they\u2019re more than welcome in this courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, race was not an issue as far as this\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u201cThe Court: And I see no other issue. I\u2019ll seat him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Immediately after the voir dire examination of D, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: It\u2019s my choice. Acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I move to excuse for cause, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">\u201cThe Court: What would that be?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The juror has expressed that his way of coming to a decision very possibly could \u2014 he could make a decision before we get to the end of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">\u201cThe Court: No, he didn\u2019t say that. Go ahead. What else?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And if that were to happen, then he may have missed some of the evidence from coming from the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">\u201cThe Court: That is nowhere within the context of the answers given to your questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">\u201c [Defense Counsel]: I think that\u2019s a fair interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that\u2019s yours, it\u2019s not mine. Your motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I would excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, at this time I would like to take up a motion outside the presence of this\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Would you step outside?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">[D exited the courtroom.]</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u201cThe Court: Yes?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I\u2019m moving that he\u2019s seated, but I think there\u2019s an issue regarding [a] neutral reason, but also the last three challenges were to three white males, roughly the same age with what I \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if any\u2014 I\u2019m concerned about a pattern now. This is four challenges, I believe, that all white males of roughly the same age, and I would ask that he be required to place a neutral reason for this excuse. So, it\u2019s not just the issue of neutral reason, but now I\u2019m suggesting there might be an issue of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: We do have a white male on the \u2014 at least one, possibly more, that was seated early on, one of the first few jurors. It\u2019s got nothing to do with race, Your Honor. It has got everything to do with the way in which he kept insisting on the way in which he came to a decision. And that\u2019s \u2014 causes a great worry for the defense when the defense goes second, knowing that the burden is on the state [and] the juror was candid enough to indicate that he often \u2014 his pattern is to come to a decision as soon as he gets enough information.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\u201cAnd he did not assure us that would be necessarily at the end of the case. He said he comes to a decision very \u2014 as soon as he possibly can because that\u2019s the nature of his business. And I think he was fair enough to indicate that because it\u2019s obviously a concern to him, and it\u2019s a concern to the defense because he \u2014 if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>doesn\u2019t wait until the end of all of the evidence, until the arguments by the attorneys and until the instructions of the law to decide the case, that he will not have had the benefit of hearing all of that and the benefit of exchanging views with his fellow jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u201cThe Court: Anything else? You discount race altogether, is that it?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u201cThe Court: Good. What else do you have?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: What\u2019s that, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u201cThe Court: Those are the two issues. Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, Your Honor, that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">\u201cThe Court: Okay, anything further, Mr. Satti?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">\u201cThe Court: I view the matter as one of semantics and one to be created by your questioning solely for the purpose of looking for an excuse not to accept a juror, any juror whatsoever. This man is a citizen of the United States. He\u2019s here in response to a duly authorized summons to be here as a juror. He\u2019s entitled to serve if he\u2019s qualified. He gave no answer here that would indicate to me that he\u2019s unqualified to be a juror in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">\u201cYou would like to have it believed that he was going to decide, by his answers, to decide this case during the evidence. He nowhere has said that. He made it clear through my questions alone that you cannot decide the case until you\u2019re given the opportunity to do so with fellow jurors. The speed with which a juror reaches a decision after that point is not subject to any inquiry. The deliberative process has to spin out in its own pace. And no question by me or you or the state will intrude on that because there\u2019s no way of knowing until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>case is over and in their hands. I order him seated. Your arbitrary use of a peremptory on this basis is unacceptable. Next.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor \u2014 Your Honor, the pattern\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019ve already \u2014 there\u2019s nothing before me, Mr. Schipul.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The defendant argues that the court\u2019s denial of his right to exercise peremptory challenges with regard to J and D deprived him of his rights to due process, the assistance of counsel and the right to a jury trial in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of the constitution of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Article first, \u00a7 19, of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by article four of the amendments, provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n all civil and criminal actions tried by a jury, the parties shall have the right to challenge jurors peremptorily, the number of such challenges to be established by law. . . .\u201d \u201cPeremptory challenges are deeply rooted in our nation\u2019s jurisprudence and serve as one state-created means to the constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial. . . . Although such challenges generally may be based on subjective as well as objective criteria . . . they may not be used to exclude a prospective juror because of his or her race or gender.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 217, 726 A.2d 531, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 969, 120 S. Ct. 409, 145 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\u201cIn <em>Batson </em>[v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986)] the United States Supreme Court recognized that a claim of purposeful racial discrimination on the part of the prosecution in selecting a jury raises constitutional questions of the utmost seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The court concluded that [although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as long as that reason is related to his [or her] view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried . . . the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 283, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000). In <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 49-50, 112 S. Ct. 2348, 120 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1992), the United States Supreme Court extended the prohibition against race based peremptory challenges to criminal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cUnder Connecticut law, [o]nce a [party] asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the [opposing party] must advance a neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] is then afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the [opposing party\u2019s] articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. . . . [T]he trial court then [has] the duty to determine if the [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] has established purposeful discrimination. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury selection process in his or her particular case was tainted by purposeful discrimination. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that [a party\u2019s removal] of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was . . . motivated [by race or gender]. These include, but are not limited to: (1) [t]he reasons given for the challenge were not related to the trial of the case ... (2) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race [or gender] were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors ... (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race [or gender] as the challenged juror were not struck ... (5) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude members of one race [or gender].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 283-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Here, the defendant attempted to exercise peremptory challenges to exclude J and D from the jury. The state raised a <em>Batson </em>claim in both instances and, in both instances, the defendant advanced a race neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. The record reflects, however, that the state, as the party asserting the claim, did not sustain its burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the articulated reasons for removal were pretextual and that the defendant was tainting the jury selection process by purposeful discrimination. In fact, the state\u2019s failure in each instance to provide the court with any reasons why the defendant\u2019s race neutral explanation was pretextual may be treated as an \u201cacquiescence in the validity\u201d of the defendant\u2019s explanation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>71 Conn. App. 790, 804, 804 A.2d 902, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 902, 810 A.2d 270 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Here, the court did not make any findings with regard to discriminatory intent. In its brief, the state concedes, and we agree, that the defendant set forth race neutral reasons to justify his attempts to exercise peremptory challenges with regard to those jurors. In each instance, the court disallowed the use of the peremptory chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>lenge on the ground that it simply disagreed with the defendant\u2019s unfavorable assessment of the venireperson\u2019s ability to be a fair and impartial juror. The court also repeatedly expressed its views, which were aimed toward restricting or curtailing the parties\u2019 use of peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s rulings unjustly deprived the defendant of his right to exercise his peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-12\"> The defendant was found not guilty of assault in the first degree and not guilty of murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-13\"> Because we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for a new trial on the basis of our resolution of the defendant\u2019s first claim, it is unnecessary for us to address the defendant\u2019s second claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-20\"> References to individual jurors will be made by use of initials so as to protect their legitimate privacy interests.

I think it\u2019s time we have to address this voir dire. This is insatiable, and it\u2019s not getting anywhere. Most of the \u2014 a good 30 percent of the questions asked are totally irrelevant to this. And I know that you don\u2019t care. I know lawyers don\u2019t care, but I can tell you this is going to be cut back and the voir dire is going to go, so are peremptory challenges. Everything will be cause or you\u2019re going to have [to] stand up for your peremptories. It\u2019s changing and everyone knows it\u2019s coming except people on the floor. This is stupid. We should have a jury here of fair minded people. You had plenty today you could take. There were a lot of strange ones, too.\u201d The court later commented: \u201cI\u2019d like the Supreme Court to address the issue of peremptory challenges, and I\u2019d like to have them deal with the race neutral issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> In one instance, the court did not allow the state to exercise a peremptory challenge on the ground that it believed the venireperson would be a fair and impartial juror. The state sought to exercise a peremptory challenge with regard to juror L, who had been acceptable to the defendant. The court, sua sponte, inquired of the prosecutor with regard to his decision to exercise a peremptory challenge. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\u201cThe Court: What\u2019s the reason \u2014 give me a reason why you\u2019re not seating this woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: The evidence in this case that I expected to present is that this club [where the incident at issue occurred] was run by the defendant and his family by the name of Wright, who were Jamaicans. The night in question, there was a party for ostensibly a drug dealer who was going away to jail. All of the non-Jamaican individuals are searched at the door. The Jamaicans are not searched at the door, which would include this defendant and his brother, who were eventually found to be armed inside the club. The only people with guns was the owner, a Patrick Wright, who is Jamaican.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\u201cAnd the witnesses are going to testify that because of their treatment, and they were mostly black males that went in, there was one Hispanic who was the victim of the homicide, they were treated differently on the issue of ancestry of Jamaican background.
