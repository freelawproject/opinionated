Kelman, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dissolving his marriage to the plaintiff, Charlotte L. Kelman. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court (1) improperly relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes rather than on their net incomes in fashioning its financial orders and (2) exceeded its authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c in fashioning its educational support orders. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s first claim and agree with his second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The parties were married on June 23, 1991. Two children were bom of the marriage. On July 31, 2001, the plaintiff initiated the underlying proceeding seeking the dissolution of the parties\u2019 marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown. The parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved on October 27, 2003. The court, as part of the dissolution decree, ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $250<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> per week for child support and to pay for the postsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ondary education of the parties\u2019 children to the extent that the parties\u2019 education account was insufficient to pay for the children\u2019s bachelor\u2019s degrees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes rather than on their net incomes in fashioning its financial orders. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u201cWe review financial awards in dissolution actions under an abuse of discretion standard. ... In order to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we must find that the court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did. ... In making those determinations, we allow every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the correctness of [the trial court\u2019s] action.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>82 Conn. App. 768, 772-73, 847 A.2d 1017, cert. granted on other grounds, 270 Conn. 907, 853 A.2d 524 (2004). Mindful of those principles, we now turn to the issue of whether the court incorrectly applied the law by basing its financial orders on the parties\u2019 gross incomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\u201cIt is well settled that a court must base child support and alimony orders on the available net income of the parties, not gross income.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>262 Conn. 299, 306, 811 A.2d 1283 (2003). In support of his claim, the defendant relies primarily on <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 299, and <em>Ludgin </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>64 Conn. App. 355, 780 A.2d 198 (2001). The defendant\u2019s reliance on these cases, however, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">In <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 299, our Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the court relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes in modifying the defendant\u2019s child support obligation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Id., 305. In reversing the judgment, the court relied on the trial court\u2019s statement that it was \u201cexpressly and affirmatively\u201d relying on the parties\u2019 gross incomes. Id., 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Similarly, in <em>Ludgin </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 355, this court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the court fashioned its financial orders based on the parties\u2019 gross incomes. In reversing the court\u2019s decision, we stated: \u201c[T]he court repeatedly referred to and compared the parties\u2019 gross incomes. . . . [Although the court had before it evidence of the parties\u2019 net incomes, it appears that the court chose not to rely on such information. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is devoid of any mention of the parties\u2019 net incomes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">While <em>Morris </em>and <em>Ludgin </em>were cases in which the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision was based solely on the parties\u2019 gross incomes as opposed to their net incomes, in this case, the court\u2019s memorandum of decision specifically stated that it was relying on \u201call of the relevant information,\u201d including the parties\u2019 financial affidavits and their child support guideline worksheets, both of which included the parties\u2019 net incomes, as well as the testimony of the parties. The court also stated that it had considered \u201call of the factors in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81, 46b-82 and 46b-62 and other pertinent statutes, earning and earning capacity differentials, causes for the breakdown of the marriage and the consequences of the financial orders . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Although the court referenced the parties\u2019 gross incomes in its memorandum of decision, it never stated, unlike in <em>Morris </em>and <em>Ludgin, </em>that it was relying solely on their gross incomes in fashioning its financial orders. On the contrary, the court specifically stated that it took into account the relevant statutes, the parties\u2019 testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>mony, the financial affidavits and the child support guideline worksheets, which included the parties\u2019 net incomes. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in fashioning its financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The defendant next claims that the court exceeded its authority pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56c in fashioning its educational support orders. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Because the defendant\u2019s claim requires us to interpret \u00a7 46b-56c, our review is plenary. <em>Falkenstein </em>v. <em>Falkenstein, </em>84 Conn. App. 495, 501, 854 A.2d 749, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 928, 859 A.2d 581 (2004). \u201cWhen construing a statute, we first look to its text, as directed by Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154). Public Act 03-154, \u00a7 1, provides: The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tele Tech of Connecticut Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>270 Conn. 778, 796-97, 855 A.2d 174 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The text of \u00a7 46b-56c is clear and unambiguous. Section 46b-56c provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) For purposes of this section, an educational support order is an order entered by a court requiring a parent to provide support for a child or children to attend Jw <em>up to a total of four full academic years </em>an institution of higher education or a private occupational school for the purpose of attaining a bachelor\u2019s or other undergraduate degree, or other appropriate vocational instruction. An educational support order may be entered with respect to any child who has not attained twenty-three years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>age <em>and shall terminate not later than the date on which the child attains twenty-three years of age.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u201c(f) The educational support order may include support for any necessary educational expense, including room, board, dues, tuition, fees, registration and application costs, <em>but such expenses shall not be more than the amount charged by The University of Connecticut for a full-time in-state student at the time the child for whom educational support is being ordered matriculates, </em>except this limit may be exceeded by agreement of the parents. An educational support order may also include the cost of books and medical insurance for such child.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In its financial orders relating to the education of the parties\u2019 children, the court stated: \u201cThe plaintiff shall have sole custodial control of the current accounts currently held for the benefit of the children. She shall seek professional advice as to the investing of the accounts consistent with the preservation of the principal. Said accounts shall be used solely for the post-secondary education of the children. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to enable the children to achieve a bachelor\u2019s degree, the defendant shall pay for such costs which shall include tuition, room and board either on or off campus, books, incidental expenses and transportation to and from the educational institution and the parents\u2019 residence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The court\u2019s order runs afoul of \u00a7 46b-56c in several respects. The order is not limited to when the parties\u2019 children reach the age of twenty-three. The order fails to limit the defendant\u2019s obligations to a total of four full academic years. The order does not specify that the defendant\u2019s obligations shall not be more than the amount charged by the University of Connecticut for a full-time in-state student. Finally, the order requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the defendant to pay for the cMLdren\u2019s incidental expenses and for their transportation to and from the school and the parents\u2019 residence, neither of which is mentioned in \u00a7 46b-56c. The educational support order was therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The judgment is reversed only as to the educational support order and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment limiting that order in accordance with \u00a7 46b-56c. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> Although the award was $10 less than that computed on the child support guideline worksheet, it was not a deviation therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
