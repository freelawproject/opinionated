Anderson, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial to the jury, of one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) his conviction of risk of injury to a child should be reversed and remanded for a new trial because it was based on a general verdict and the allegations comprising two of the three bases for conviction were insufficient as a matter of law, (2) the court improperly admitted hearsay statements of the victim, (3) the medical exception to the hearsay rule should be modified in cases in which a child claims that she or he was sexually assaulted and (4) the court improperly instructed the jury by failing to inform it of the evidence it could consider with respect to the charge of risk of injury to a child. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 1997, the defendant and the victim\u2019s mother met at their place of employment and became romantically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, when the victim was seven years old, the defendant moved into the mother\u2019s household. The mother worked the second shift and was not at home when the victim returned from school. The defendant, who worked a different shift, was there. At first the victim and the defendant had a good relationship, but later the victim told people she did not like the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The defendant punished the victim. The defendant struck her face with his hand when he was angry because she had not done her homework correctly. She did not tell her mother about this because she was afraid of what the defendant might do. On one occasion, the defendant hit her so hard her nose bled. The defendant also compelled her to hold a book bag filled with tapes and clothes on a stick over her head for long periods of time. On another occasion, he made her kneel on grains of rice. Although the victim did not tell her mother about these events, she confided in her best friend. The friend\u2019s mother testified that she noticed behavioral changes in the victim beginning in 1998. The victim, who had been carefree, had become quiet and withdrawn. The victim\u2019s grades suffered, and she exhibited a poor attitude at school. After school one day, the victim was terrified to go home on the school bus. Her teacher and school principal conferred with her mother. The victim, however, had not told anyone other than her friend that she was afraid of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The victim also testified that the defendant made her rub his back or his feet while he was wearing only his underwear. In addition, he called her into the bedroom and asked her to rub his private parts. One night she woke up and the defendant was attempting to put his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>penis in her mouth. She reported this to her mother who told her that she must have been dreaming. The victim testified that the defendant had sexual intercourse with her by putting \u201chis private into [her] butt.\u201d When she was nine and in the fourth grade, the defendant had intercourse with her almost \u201cevery other night or twice a week.\u201d The defendant forced the victim to have oral, anal and vaginal intercourse with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The victim did not tell her mother about the incidents of sexual abuse until shortly after a fire occurred in their home, the day after Thanksgiving, 2000. The victim was spending time with her grandmother who overheard her talking to herself. The grandmother insisted that the victim tell her what she was talking about. The victim told her grandmother of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse. The grandmother informed the mother and immediately took the victim to the police station. The victim gave a statement to the police in which she related the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse. The police advised the victim\u2019s mother to take her to a hospital that specialized in assessing children who are victims of sexual abuse. The mother followed the advice of the police. The victim was examined by Judith Kanz, a certified pediatric nurse practitioner, who specializes in child forensic medical examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The defendant testified that the victim did not like him because she felt that he was replacing her father and because he planned to marry her mother. He admitted that he disciplined the victim for not doing her homework or her chores. As punishment, he took away the victim\u2019s privileges or gave her \u201ctime outs.\u201d He also testified that he made the victim hold a stick on which an empty book bag was suspended for five minutes. The defendant denied that he had sexually assaulted the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the court denied. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>defendant was given an effective sentence of eighteen years in prison, ten years of probation and special conditions of probation as a sex offender. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Because the defendant\u2019s first and last claims are interrelated, we will address them together. The defendant claims that the judgment of conviction of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1), rendered pursuant to a general verdict, must be reversed because two of the factual bases argued by the prosecutor are insufficient as a matter of law, and the court improperly failed to tell the jury what evidence it properly could consider with respect to the count of risk of injury to a child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant failed to raise these claims at trial and now seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we conclude that a constitutional violation did not clearly exist and that the defendant was not clearly deprived of a fair trial, he cannot prevail on either of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. The amended substitute information alleged in count two that the defendant \u201cdid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>commit the crime of risk of injury to a [child], in violation of . . . General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1), in that on divers dates between January 1, 1998, and October 31, 2000 . . . the said [defendant] <em>did an act </em>likely to impair the health of a child who was under the age of sixteen.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) During the state\u2019s final argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued that the state had presented evidence that the defendant struck the victim\u2019s face causing her nose to bleed, made her kneel on grains of rice and, at other times, made her hold a book bag over her head for long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">With respect to the count of risk of injury to a child, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIn count two, the defendant is charged with the crime of risk of injury to a [child] in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) of the General Statutes. The pertinent parts of that statute on which the defendant has been charged are as follows. Any person who does an act likely to impair the health of any child under the age of sixteen years shall be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\u201cTherefore, with respect to this offense to find the defendant guilty, the state must prove beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>able doubt the following elements as contained in the information. One, that at the time of the incident, the alleged victim was under the age of sixteen years; two, that the defendant <em>committed an act </em>that was likely to impair the health of a child; and, three, that the defendant had the general intent to perform such an act. The conduct to be punished must involve a child under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">\u201cThe statute next requires that the defendant <em>did an act </em>likely to impair the health of the child. Health is defined as the state of being hale, sound or whole in mind or soul, well-being. Freedom from pain or sickness. To establish that the defendant committed an act likely to impair the health of a [child], the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the <em>defendant committed blatant physical abuse </em>that endangered the child\u2019s physical well-being. Finally, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the general intent to perform the act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Save for his claim that the court did not marshal the evidence with respect to this charge, the defendant does not claim that the court\u2019s instruction on the law was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">At oral argument before us, the defendant conceded that striking the victim and causing her nose to bleed is legally sufficient evidence of risk of injury to a child. He claims, however, that compelling a child to kneel on grains of rice or to hold a book bag in the air do not, as a matter of law, constitute risk of injury to a child as they are not blatant acts of abuse or even acts perpetrated by him. He claims therefore that it was improper for the court to submit the evidence concerning the incidents with the rice and the book bag to the jury. Furthermore, he argues that because the jury rendered a general verdict, it is not possible to know the factual basis on which the jury convicted him of risk of injury to a child, including whether the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>considered his acts of sexual abuse, which he argues, without legal citation, the jury could not consider. In support of his claim for reversal, the defendant relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>992 F.2d 409 (2d Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that he was convicted on the basis of insufficient evidence as a matter of law and that <em>Garcia </em>supports his claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[W]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive . . . the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>502 U.S. 46, 56, 112 S. Ct. 466, 116 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1991), citing <em>Turner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S. Ct. 642, 24 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1970). \u201cIt was settled law in England before the Declaration of Independence, and in this country long afterwards, that a general verdict was valid so long as it was legally supportable on one of the submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>grounds \u2014 even though that gave no assurance that a valid ground, rather than an invalid one, was actually the basis for the jury\u2019s action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>227 Conn. 616, 625 n.6, 632 A.2d 674 (1993), citing <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 502 U.S. 469. On reargument, <em>Chapman </em>was affirmed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In <em>Garcia, </em>the problem lay in the jury instruction, not the evidence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 992 F.2d 414 (court\u2019s failure to give instruction on quid pro quo was error).* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is not the circumstance before us now. In this case, the jury had to determine whether the state presented evidence that the defendant committed blatant physical abuse that endangered the victim\u2019s physical health.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We need not decide whether forcing a child to kneel on grains of rice or to hold a book bag over her head are acts prohibited by \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). As the defendant concedes, striking a child thereby causing a bloody nose is sufficient evidence of risk of injury to a child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was at least one legal theory under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the jury could have convicted the defendant if the jurors found beyond a reasonable doubt that evidence presented by the state met the elements of the crime. \u201c[A] factual insufficiency regarding one statutory basis, which is accompanied by a general verdict of guilty that also covers another, factually supported basis, is not a federal due process violation .... Jurors are generally well equipped to analyze the evidence, and are in a position to be able to evaluate the testimony presented and to assess whether the evidence supported the charged theory.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>78 Conn. App. 264, 273, 826 A.2d 1238, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 902, 832 A.2d 66 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s claim that his conviction for risk of injury to a child rendered pursuant to a general verdict should be reversed must fail. Had the defendant wanted to limit the factual basis on which the jury rendered its verdict, he could have requested that the court charge out the legally insufficient evidence or submitted interrogatories to the jury. See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 502 U.S. 61 (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The defendant claims that it was improper for the court to fail to instruct the jury as to what evidence it could consider with respect to the count of risk of injury to a child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant also claims that the instruction was wanting because the court did not inform the jury that to convict the defendant, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>act directly perpetrated on the victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 467; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robert H., </em>71 Conn. App. 289, 296, 802 A.2d 152, cert. granted on other grounds, 262 Conn. 913, 811 A.2d 1294 (2002).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The following portions of the court\u2019s instructions to the juiy are relevant to our analysis, in addition to the portions of the charge cited in part I. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, you have heard the evidence presented in this case. It is now my duty to instruct you as to the law that you must apply to the facts in this case. I will not make any substantial comments on the evidence. I will simply explain to you the rules of law as they apply to this case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">\u201cIt is exclusively the function of the court to state the rules of law that govern the case with instructions as to how you are to apply them. It is your obligation to accept the law as I state it. You must follow all of my instructions and not single out some and ignore others. They are equally important. If by chance you have a different idea of what the law is or should be, you must disregard your notions entirely and apply the law exactly as I give it to you. <em>If the law as I give it to you differs in any way from the claims of law made by counsel, dismiss from your minds what counsel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>have said to the extent that it differs from what I tell you. </em>You are the sole judges of the facts. It is your duty to find the facts. You are to recollect and weigh the evidence and form your own conclusions as to what the ultimate facts are.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The court continued: \u201cNow, let me turn to a discussion of the evidence. The evidence from which you are to decide what the facts are consists of, one, the sworn testimony of witnesses, both on direct and cross-examination, regardless of who called the witness; two, stipulations; and, three, the exhibits that have been received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>into evidence. In reaching your verdict, you should consider all the testimony and exhibits received into evidence. <em>Certain things are not evidence and you may not consider them in deciding what the facts are. These include, arguments and statements by the lawyers. The lawyers are not witnesses. What they have said in their closing arguments is intended to help you interpret the evidence, but it is not evidence. If the facts as you remember them differ from the way the lawyers have stated them, your memory of them con</em>trols.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The court also instructed the jury: \u201c[Y]ou will have [the information] with you at the time of deliberation. As you\u2019ve already been told, the information is merely the formal maimer of accusing a person of a crime in order to bring him to trial. You must not consider the information as any evidence whatsoever of the guilt of the defendant, or draw any inference of guilt because he has been charged with a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">\u201cAs indicated in the state\u2019s written information, a copy of which you will have with you in the jury room, the state has charged the defendant with committing three separate crimes. Each one is designated in a separate count of the information. You must consider each count separately. When you return to the courtroom, you will be asked whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty as charged in each of these counts. Your verdict must be unanimous . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">We are guided by the long-recognized standard of review with respect to a claim of an unconstitutional jury instruction. \u201cIn reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. . . . The test is whether the charge as a whole presents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">\u201cA jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 509, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995). \u201cThe primary purpose of the charge is to assist the jury in applying the law correctly to the facts which they might find to be established.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s instruction was unconstitutional because the court did not marshal the evidence. \u201cIt has long been established that [i]n properly instructing the jury it <em>may or may not </em>be necessary for the court to recall the attention of the jury to the evidence and to the facts which the State and the accused respectively claim to have established, or to comment upon the evidence or express an opinion as to its weight, or as to what verdict would be proper if the jury should find certain facts to be proved. The charge should be so framed that the jury may clearly understand the matters which are submitted to [it]. ... It is within the province, and may be within the duty, of the trial judge to not only call attention to the evidence adduced, but to state to the jury in the charge his own opinion of the nature, bearing and force of such evidence. . . . It is not necessarily error to omit <em>all </em>comment upon the bearing and weight of evidence; and generally the extent to which the court should discuss the evidence in submitting a case to the jury is, so long as in criminal cases the jury [is] not directed how to find [its] verdict, <em>within the discretion of the trial judge. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing whether the trial court <em>must </em>comment on any evidence that has been presented, we examine not only the entire juiy charge, but also the presentation of the issues to the jury by counsel in the context of the trial. Within constitutional limitations concerning trial by jury, the nature and extent of the trial court\u2019s comments on the evidence must largely depend on the facts involved in a particular case and the manner in which it has been tried. . . . The <em>wide discretion </em>a trial court has in its comments on the evidence may not require it to discuss particular items of testimony, particularly where issues were clearly delineated during the trial, where the arguments of counsel fairly presented the case and where there was no request to charge. ... In a case where the trial court\u2019s charge contained no review of the evidence, we stated that [t]he issues were narrow, and the court made sufficient reference to them and to the claims of the parties adequately to guide the jury in the application of the principles of law to the facts involved.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphases in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 510-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its wide discretion in commenting on the evidence in the instruction at issue here. We first note that the court properly instructed the jury on the elements of the crime of risk of injuiy to a child pursuant to \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). Second, the court read the second count of the information that alleged that the defendant <em>did an act </em>likely to impair the health of a child younger than sixteen years of age. It also admonished the jury to follow the law as the court instructed and not to follow the law as represented by counsel during closing arguments. It informed the jury that the arguments of counsel were not evidence and that the jury was to decide the facts of the case on the basis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>It is well known that a jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>80 Conn. App. 454, 468, 835 A.2d 503 (2003), cert. denied, 267 Conn. 913, 840 A.2d 1175 (2004). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[Jjurors are well equipped to analyze the evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 502 U.S. 59. We are confident that the court\u2019s clear instruction on the elements of risk of injury to a child and the jury\u2019s proven talent of sorting through the evidence yielded a verdict on the basis of evidence that demonstrated that the defendant committed blatant physical abuse that endangered the victim\u2019s physical well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the jury improperly may have considered the evidence of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the victim, neither he nor the state has provided a legal explanation, in view of the information and the evidence, as to why it would be improper for the jury to consider such evidence. Convictions for both sexual assault and risk of injury to a child do not violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, as each crime requires the state to prove an element that the other does not. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>79 Conn. App. 591, 601-602, 830 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 901, 838 A.2d 211 (2003), citing <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932). Furthermore, there was evidence before the jury that the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim on more than one occasion, which were acts directly perpetrated on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">If, in fact, the court\u2019s instruction was inadequate as to the count of risk of injury to a child, we conclude that the error was harmless. The same set of facts that constitute the crime of sexual assault in the first degree may satisfy the crime of risk of injury to a child. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 835-40, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999). We do not know whether the jury convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the defendant of risk of injury to a child on the basis of his having given the victim a bloody nose or his sexually assaulting her or both. The fact that the jury convicted the defendant of sexual assault in the first degree, however, assures us that, as a matter of law, there was sufficient evidence found by the jury upon which the defendant could have been convicted of risk of injury to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s claims that his conviction of risk of injury to a child should be reversed must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly admitted hearsay statements attributed to the victim. The defendant has argued that the court improperly expanded the medical exception to the hearsay rule by permitting Kanz to testify as to vaginal penetration. The defendant argues that the testimony was improper because the victim saw Kanz at the suggestion of the police, not as a link in the chain of medical care. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The victim testified that the defendant put his penis in her mouth, told her to have sexual intercourse with him and put his penis in her \u201cbutt.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>day after the victim testified, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude Kanz from testifying about the results of her vaginal examination of the victim. The defendant argued that during her testimony, the victim made no mention of the defendant\u2019s having touched her vagina and, in fact, defined sexual intercourse as putting his private in her \u201cbutt.\u201d Because the victim had never testified about vaginal intercourse, the defendant continued, Kanz should not be permitted to testify about her examination of the victim\u2019s vagina. The court denied the motion in limine, concluding that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the victim\u2019s testimony was too limited in view of the manner in which she discussed sexual intercourse throughout her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The state then sought to clarify the purpose of Kanz\u2019 testimony. The prosecutor stated Kanz\u2019 testimony was being offered for constancy of accusation and also as that of a medical care provider. The defendant objected, arguing that Kanz did not examine the victim for medical purposes but at the suggestion of the police. The court reserved its decision on the motion, pending a proffer of Kanz\u2019 testimony. After Kanz testified as to her educational background and experience, the court ruled that she was qualified to testify as an expert in the field of forensic medical examinations. Kanz receives frequent referrals from police departments and the department of children and families to examine children who are alleged to have been sexually abused. She begins an assessment by talking to children to determine the type of physical examination she needs to perform, what areas of the body to examine and whether she should administer tests for sexually transmitted, blood or serum borne diseases. In addition, children who have been abused often are worried that something bad has happened to their bodies. They need to be reassured that their bodies are healthy and can function properly, and that they can have normal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>healthy lives. Kanz\u2019 purpose, as an expert, is to accomplish all of these things for the children she examines. The defendant objected to Kanz\u2019 testifying as to what the victim told her the defendant had done to her. The court overruled the objection concluding that the victim saw Kanz for treatment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">On the basis of the victim\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s sexual contact, Kanz conducted a physical examination, including anal and vaginal examinations. Kanz\u2019 findings on examination were consistent with recurrent vaginal penetration. The results of the victim\u2019s anal examination were within normal limits. Kanz did not recommend further treatment for the victim as her injuries had resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Kanz whether her examination of the victim was for investigative purposes. Kanz repeatedly responded that her services are not for the purpose of gathering information or investigation, but to conduct the appropriate medical examination so that the victim of sexual assault gets whatever treatment is necessary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On redirect examination, Kanz testified that the victim had reported to her in a consistent manner that the defendant had performed acts that involved penile oral penetration, penile vaginal penetration, digital vaginal penetration and penile anal penetration. When the state rested, the court instructed the jury on the purpose of constancy of accusation testimony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">We are mindful of the well established standard of review for evidentiary claims. \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on evidence and its rulings will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done. . . . The exercise of such discretion is not to be disturbed unless it has been abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. . . . And [the exercise of such discretion] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances surrounding the matter .... In our review of these discretionary determinations, we make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>79 Conn. App. 397, 401-402, 830 A.2d 776, cert. granted on other grounds, 266 Conn. 924, 835 A.2d 474 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">On appeal, the defendant claims that it was improper for the court to permit Kanz to testify about the victim\u2019s statements regarding the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse because it was hearsay. He argues that the statements were not admissible as constancy of accusation testimony because the victim saw Kanz after she had reported the abuse to the police. The state, however, argues that Kanz\u2019 testimony was admissible pursuant to the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant counters that because the police referred the victim to Kanz and because Kanz sent a copy of her report to the police, the purpose of her examination was investigative not medical. To support his argument, the defendant also points to the testimony of the victim and her mother regarding an examination at the hospital.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Their testimony regarding the time of the examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>tion is inconsistent. Kanz testified from memory, rather than from her notes, that she thought she examined the victim on December 11, 2000.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">This court frequently has dealt with evidentiary claims regarding the statements of victims of sexual abuse who seek or for whom others seek medical treatment or advice. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 415-421; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Thames Valley Council for Community Action, Inc., </em>69 Conn. App. 850, 853-877, 797 A.2d 1146, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 906, 804 A.2d 212 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>56 Conn.

Furthermore, the medical exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>to the hearsay rule has been codified in our rules of evidence. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (5). Consequently, we do not write on a clean page.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 means a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the proceeding, offered in evidence to establish the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-1 (3). \u201cHearsay is inadmissible, except as provided in the Code, the General Statutes or the Practice Book.\u201d Id., \u00a7 8-2. Section 8-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness ... (5) ... A statement made for purposes of obtaining medical treatment or advice pertaining thereto and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof, insofar as reasonably pertinent to the medical treatment or advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">\u201cThe hearsay rule ... is premised on the theory that out-of-court statements are subject to particular hazards. The declarant might be lying; he might have misperceived the events which he relates; he might have faulty memory; his words might be misunderstood or taken out of context by the listener. And the ways in which these dangers are minimized for in-court statements \u2014 the oath, the witness\u2019 awareness of the gravity of the proceedings, the jury\u2019s ability to observe the witness\u2019 demeanor, and, most importantly, the right of the opponent to cross-examine \u2014 are generally absent for things said out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">\u201cNonetheless, the . . . [rjules of [ejvidence also recognize that some kinds of out-of-court statements are less subject to these hearsay dangers, and therefore except them from the general rule that hearsay is inadmissible. . . . One such category covers statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>made by a patient to a physician for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">\u201cThe rationale underlying the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule is that the patient\u2019s desire to recover his health . . . will restrain him from giving inaccurate statements to a physician employed to advise or treat him.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>260 Conn. 1, 6-7, 792 A.2d 823 (2002). \u201c[T]estimony pertaining to the identity of the defendant and the nature of the sexual assault [are] wholly relevant and pertinent to proper diagnosis and treatment of the resulting physical and psychological injuries of sexual assault. . . . [I]n any sexual assault, the identity of the perpetrator undoubtedly is relevant to the physician to facilitate the treatment of psychological and physical injuries.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he rationale for excluding from the hearsay rule statements that a patient makes to a physician in furtherance of obtaining medical treatment applies with equal force to such statements made to other individuals within the chain of medical care. In each case, [there is a presumption] that such statements are inherently reliable because the patient has an incentive to tell the truth in order to obtain a proper medical diagnosis and treatment.\u201d Id., 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">In the case before us, the defendant does not claim that the court improperly recognized Kanz as an expert in the care and treatment of pediatric victims of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> His claim is premised on his construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>the evidence that the victim was examined for bruises at a hospital soon after she gave her statement to the police and saw Kanz approximately a week to ten days later because the police suggested that Kanz examine the victim. We need not determine how many times the victim was examined by health care providers. The key on which the issue of admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements turns is the purpose of the examination. The defendant claims the purpose of the examination was investigatory, but the court concluded that it was for treatment. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">First, and most importantly, the victim understood that she went to the hospital to be examined for injuries that she may have sustained. Her statements to Kanz meet the reliability criteria for the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule. In addition, Kanz gave extensive foundation testimony about the nature of her employment and the purpose of the child abuse assessment center. The center receives referrals from numerous sources and, in this case, Kanz thought that the victim had been referred by the department of children and families. Regardless of her recollection of the source of the victim\u2019s referral, Kanz\u2019 testimony regarding the manner in which she performs an assessment addresses a standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Kanz testified in relevant part: \u201cOur approach is to see the patient first. If the patient is what we call verbal age, can speak, I take the patient into a room. I do an interview, an independent interview to begin for two main reasons: to put the child at ease and also to guide my exam. What the child tells me lets me know the type of exam I have to do [and] the type of laboratory test I may have to do. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">\u201cThe information that the children, and specifically in this case [the victim], tend to give in the interview lets me know the extent of the exam I have to do. There are children who are referred to me for questions that their pediatricians had on exam. Was this normal? Was this not normal? There are times children may state things that are misunderstood or misconstrued by other people and they end up with me for an exam. This is a detailed exam for which I wouldn\u2019t expect a child to go through unless they had to. So I speak with the child in order to determine that this type of exam is necessary and then beyond that to determine what type exactly of exam is necessary. What . . . area of the body was touched. What areas may be included in this exam, and also to determine if there needs to be testing for STDs, which are sexually transmitted diseases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">On cross-examination, defense counsel specifically asked Kanz whether her examination was for investigatory purposes. Kanz responded: \u201cI\u2019m not there for an investigative purpose. I am there for what we call consultation purpose. Specifically, to determine if the children have injuries that need medical attention [and] [t]o then follow up.\u201d The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence of the victim\u2019s statements to Kanz under the medical exception to the hearsay rule. To the extent that the court made its decision on credibility grounds, we yield, as we must, to the court\u2019s assessment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>51 Conn. App. 478, 485, 723 A.2d 817 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">We therefore conclude that, on the basis of our review of the evidence, particularly the testimony of the victim and Kanz, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim\u2019s statements to Kanz under the medical exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that this court should exercise its supervisory powers to modify the rules of evidence regarding the medical exception to the hearsay rule in sexual assault cases involving children. \u201cAppellate courts possess an inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice. . . . [0]ur supervisory powers are invoked only in rare circumstances where [the] traditional protections are inadequate to ensure the fair and just administration of the courts . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ashe, </em>74 Conn. App. 511, 526, 812 A.2d 194, cert, denied, 262 Conn. 949, 817 A.2d 108 (2003). We decline the defendant\u2019s request to invoke our supervisory powers over the administration of justice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\"> The defendant was acquitted of a second count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom her identity may be ascertained.

Although we need not reach this claim, we note that this is not the first time a vagueness claim has been raised with respect to \u00a7 53a-21 (a) (1). Our Supreme Court has held that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague because authoritative judicial gloss circumscribed \u201cthe type of physical harm prohibited by \u00a7 53-21 to instances of deliberate, blatant abuse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 466, 542 A.2d 686 (1988). \u201cAll that is absolutely known is that the irreducible minimum of any prosecution under the second part of \u00a7 53-21 is an act directly perpetrated on the person of a minor.\u201d Id., 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\"> We note that the defendant did not seek a bill of particulars, did not submit a request to charge, did not object to the proposed charge provided by the court, did not object to the charge as given and did not submit interrogatories to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who (1) wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of such child is endangered, the health of such child is likely to be injured or the morals of such child are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, or (2) has contact with the intimate parts, as defined in section 53a-65, of a child under the age of sixteen years or subjects a child under sixteen years of age to contact with the intimate parts of such person, in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child, shall be guilty of a Class C felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The defendant was charged with crimes that allegedly occurred from January, 1998, through October, 2000.

Public Acts 2000, No. 00-207, \u00a7 6, designated the then existing language of \u00a7 53-21 as subsection (a) and added subsection (b). The amendments to \u00a7 53-21 since 1997 are not relevant for purposes of this appeal. For ease of reference, we refer in this opinion to the revision to 2001, which codified the 2000 amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\"> The United States Supreme Court made the following observation in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>502 U.S. 46, 58-59, 112 S. Ct. 466, 116 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1991): \u201cFinally, petitioner asserts that the distinction between legal error <em>(Yates </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 77 S. Ct. 1064, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1957)]) and insufficiency of proof <em>(Turner </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 90 S. Ct. 642, 24 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1970)]) is illusory, since judgments that are not supported by the requisite minimum of proof are invalid <em>as a matter </em>o/law \u2014 and indeed, in the criminal law field at least, are <em>constitutionally required </em>to be set aside. <em>See Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319 [99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560] (1979). Insufficiency of proof, in other words, <em>is </em>legal error. This represents a purely semantical dispute, hi one sense \u2018legal error\u2019 includes inadequacy of evidence \u2014 namely when the phrase is used as a term of art to designate those mistakes that it is the business of judges (injury cases) and of appellate courts to identify and correct. In this sense \u2018legal error\u2019 occurs when a jury, properly instructed as to the law, convicts on the basis of evidence that no reasonable person could regard as sufficient. But in another sense \u2014 a more natural and less artful sense \u2014 the term \u2018legal error\u2019 means a mistake about the law, as opposed to a mistake concerning the weight or the factual import of the evidence.

See part I A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\"> With respect to the second count of the information, risk of injury to a child, the prosecutor stated in its closing argument: \u201cA portion of the definition includes the impairment of a physical condition or pain. [The victim] from that stand told you how the defendant made her kneel on rice. She told you how he made her hold the stick above her shoulders while he placed a book bag on one end of the stick and she was required to hold that stick and was filled with the defendant\u2019s items as a punishment to her. She didn\u2019t want to hold the stick. She told you that. She complied with his demand. She complied with his sexual demands because she didn\u2019t want to be punished any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Defense counsel responded to that portion of the state\u2019s argument, stating: \u201cThere are two incidents of discipline that have gone unchanged here. Excuse me, again. One, [the victim] testified that she was made to kneel in rice while she was wearing pants. In the second, she talked about holding a stick over her head and that there was a book bag hanging from containing clothing and tapes. [The court] is going to read you an instruction on what is risk of injury to a minor. That instruction will include this language. To establish that the defendant committed an act likely to impair the health of a minor, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed blatant physical abuse that endangered the child\u2019s physical well being. You need to decide if those incidents rise to that level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">On rebuttal, the prosecutor argued: \u201c[The victim] took the stand and told you what she recalls about these incidents. She told you, her mother told you about an incident involving a bloody nose. The mother left, came back from the store to find [the victim] crying, to find [the victim\u2019s] nose bloody. Now, she told you that [the victim] wasn\u2019t prone to bleedy noses or bloody nose. . . . [The victim] told you that the defendant would strike her in the face. You have an adult male striking a child in the face to the extent that that child\u2019s nose is bleeding, that that child is crying. You have an adult male forcing an eight year old child, nine year old child to stand with a pole, with a book bag with his items contained within that bag for punishment.
