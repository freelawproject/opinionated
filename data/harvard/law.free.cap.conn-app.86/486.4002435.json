On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly concluded that he was provided with effective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The underlying facts that gave rise to the petitioner\u2019s conviction are set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>232 Conn. 455, 459-62, 656 A.2d 646 (1995). The petitioner was convicted after a juiy trial of one count of robbeiy in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-8, one count of burglary in the first degree as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1) and 53a-8, two counts of burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102, eighteen counts of burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103, one count of attempt to commit burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-103, and one count of larceny in the second degree as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-123 (a) (1) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>53U-8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner subsequently was tried to the court and convicted of being a persistent felony offender, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (b). The petitioner was then sentenced to a total effective term of seventy-five years in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Following his conviction, the petitioner presented a seven count petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the petitioner claimed that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate his level of intellectual functioning and, as a result, the petitioner was not able to communicate properly with counsel or make informed trial decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court granted the petition as to the seventh count, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to advise the petitioner adequately as to the merits of seeking sentence review,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and dismissed the petition as to the remaining counts. The court thereafter granted the petition for certification to appeal to this court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">As an initial matter, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cOur standard of review in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging the effective assistance of trial counsel is well settled. Although a habeas court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of review . . . [w]hether the representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>a defendant received at trial was constitutionally inadequate is a mixed question of law and fact. ... As such, that question requires plenary review by this court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u201cThe petitioner\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel is assured by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution, and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court established that for a petitioner to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must show that counsel's assistance was so defective as to require reversal of [the] conviction. . . . That requires the petitioner to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Toccaline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>80 Conn. App. 792, 797-98, 837 A.2d 849, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 907, 845 A.2d 413 cert. denied sub nom. <em>Toccaline </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>543 U.S. 854, 125 S. Ct. 301,160 L. Ed. 2d 90 (2004). \u201cA court deciding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim need not address the question of counsel\u2019s performance, if it is easier to dispose of the claim on the ground of insufficient prejudice.\u201d <em>Nardini </em>v. <em>Manson, 207 </em>Conn. 118, 124, 540 A.2d 69 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u201cWe cannot, in a habeas corpus appeal, disturb underlying historical facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The habeas court judge, as trier of the facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>47 Conn. App. 253, 262, 704 A.2d 807 (1997), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 967, 707 A.2d 1268 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In the present case, the petitioner claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to investigate the petitioner\u2019s cognitive disabilities. He argues specifically that, but for counsel\u2019s failure to investigate, the results of his suppression hearing and sentencing would have been different. We conclude that the petitioner\u2019s disabilities were not legally significant and, therefore, disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">At the habeas trial, counsel presented expert testimony regarding the petitioner\u2019s competence and cognitive abilities at the time of his original trial. The state presented Peter Zeman, a psychiatrist, who testified that \u201ctoo many variables exist... to allow for a meaningful retroactive determination of competency.\u201d Crediting the state\u2019s expert, the court found that the petitioner\u2019s experts were \u201ctoo speculative in their conclusions about the petitioner\u2019s abilities or understanding of events between 1991 and 1993 to serve as a basis for this court\u2019s determination of . . . whether trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate the petitioner\u2019s level of intellectual functioning.\u201d The court further found \u201ccredible [trial counsel\u2019s] testimony and assessment that the petitioner was able to assist him and understand the proceedings against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">During cross-examination, the petitioner admitted that he had been arrested on at least ten prior occasions. The petitioner admitted that on each of those occasions, he was represented by a public defender. None of those public defenders, however, requested a psychological evaluation of the petitioner. Furthermore, at each of those arrests, the police informed the petitioner of his rights as required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). He admitted that he understood his rights and that he would not lie to the police. The petitioner and the respondent presented conflicting testimony as to what effect, if any, evidence obtained from a psychological evaluation of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tioner would have had at sentencing. The habeas judge, as the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, was free to credit the respondent\u2019s witnesses over those of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">After a thorough review of the transcripts, record and briefs, granting appropriate deference to the court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, we conclude that the court properly found that the petitioner failed to prove that his counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, therefore, properly determined that the petitioner had failed to satisfy his burden of establishing that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance and, as such, properly dismissed counts one through six and granted count seven of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\"> The petitioner was originally presented on a forty-eight count information. Prior to trial, the prosecution submitted a second amended long form information charging the petitioner only with the crimes to which he had orally confessed when he willingly showed two police officers the \u201cgarages or homes that he had entered and told the officers how he had gained entry and what he had taken.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 462.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> The petitioner\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 476.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> We note that the petitioner does not claim that he was incompetent to stand trial or that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a competency hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\"> As a result, the court reinstated the petitioner\u2019s right to seek sentence review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b523-14\"> Because we conclude that the petitioner failed to satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, an analysis of whether trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient is unnecessary.
