Justice White</author>\n<p id=\"AYV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Pursuant to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA), 86 Stat. 424, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1221 <em>et seq. </em>(1970 ed., Supp. V), and 46 U. S. C. \u00a7 391a (1970 ed., Supp. V), navigation in Puget Sound, a body of inland water lying along the northwest coast of the State of Washington,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is controlled in major respects by federal law. The PWSA also subjects to federal rule the design and operating characteristics of oil tankers.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">This case arose when ch. 125, 1975 Wash. Laws, 1st Extr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Sess., Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 88.16.170 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. 1975) (Tanker Law), was adopted with the aim of regulating in particular respects the design, size, and movement of oil tankers in Puget Sound. In response to the constitutional challenge to the law brought by the appellees herein, the District Court held that under the Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which declares that the federal law \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land,\u201d the Tanker Law could not coexist with the PWSA and was totally invalid. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>No. C-75-648-M (WD Wash. Sept. 24, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Located adjacent to Puget Sound are six oil refineries having a total combined processing capacity of 359,500 barrels of oil per day. In 1971, appellee Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) began operating an oil refinery at Cherry Point, situated in the northern part of the Sound. Since then, the crude oil processed at that refinery has been delivered principally by pipeline from Canada<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by tankers from the Persian Gulf; tankers will also be used to transport oil there from the terminus of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline at Valdez, Alaska. Of the 105 tanker deliveries of crude oil to the Cherry Point refinery from 1972 through 1975, 95 were by means of tankers in excess of 40,000 deadweight tons (DWT),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, prior to the effective date of the Tanker Law, 15 of them were by means of tankers in excess of 125,000 DWT.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Appellee Seatrain Lines, Inc. (Seatrain), owns or charters 12 tanker vessels in domestic and foreign commerce, of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>four exceed 125,000 DWT. Seatrain also operates through a wholly owned subsidiary corporation a shipbuilding facility in New York City, where it has recently constructed or is constructing four tankers, each with a 225,000 DWT capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On the day the Tanker Law became effective, ARCO brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeking a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement. Seatrain was later permitted to intervene as a plaintiff. Named as defendants were the state and local officials responsible for the enforcement of the Tanker Law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that the statute was pre-empted by federal law, in particular the PWSA, and that it was thus invalid under the Supremacy Clause. It was also alleged that the law imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, and that it interfered with the federal regulation o'f foreign affairs. Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2284, a three-judge court was convened to determine the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The case was briefed and argued before the District Court on the basis of a detailed stipulation of facts. Also before the court was the brief of the United States as <em>amicus curiae, </em>which contended that the Tanker Law was pre-empted in its entirety by the PWSA and other federal legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The three-judge court agreed with the plaintiffs and the United States, ruling that all of the operative provisions of the Tanker Law were pre-empted, and enjoining appellants and their successors from enforcing the chapter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We noted probable jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the State\u2019s appeal, 430 U. S. 905 (1977), meanwhile having stayed the injunction. 429 U. S. 1035 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Court\u2019s prior cases indicate that when a State\u2019s exercise of its police power is challenged under the Supremacy Clause, \u201cwe start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977). Under the relevant cases, one of the legitimate inquiries is whether Congress has either explicitly or implicitly declared that the States are prohibited from regulating the various aspects of oil-tanker operations and design with which the Tanker Law is concerned. As the Court noted in <em>Rice, supra, </em>at 230:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASB\">\u201c[The congressional] purpose may be evidenced in several ways. The scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it. Penn<em>sylvania R. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>250 U. S. 566, 569; <em>Cloverleaf Butter Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>315 U. S. 148. Or the Act of Congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject. <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U. S. 52. Likewise, the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose. <em>Southern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Commission, </em>236 U. S. 439; <em>Charleston &amp; W. C. R.

Co., supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Accord, <em>City of Burbank </em>v. <em>Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U. S. 624, 633 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Even, if Congress has not completely foreclosed state legislation in a particular area, a state statute is void to the extent that it actually conflicts with a valid federal statute. A conflict will be found \u201cwhere compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility . . . ,\u201d <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963), or where the state \u201claw stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., supra, </em>at 526, 540-541. Accord, <em>De Canas </em>v. <em>Bica, </em>424 U. S. 351, 363 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">With these principles in mind, we turn to an examination of each of the three operative provisions of the Tanker Law. We address first Wash. Rev. Code \u00a788.16.180 (Supp. 1975), which requires both enrolled and registered<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> oil tankers of at least 50,000 DWT to take on a pilot licensed by the State of Washington while navigating Puget Sound. The District Court held that insofar as the law required a tanker \u201cenrolled in the coastwise trade\u201d to have a local pilot on board, it was in direct conflict with 46 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 215, 364. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Section 364 provides that \u201cevery coastwise seagoing steam vessel subject to the navigation laws of the United States ,. . . not sailing under register, shall, when under way, ... be under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the control and direction of pilots licensed by the Coast Guard.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 215 adds that \u201c[n]o State or municipal government shall impose upon pilots of steam vessels any obligation to procure a State or other license in addition to that issued by the United States . . ...\u201d It goes on to explain that the statute shall not be construed to \u201caffect any regulation established by the laws of any State, requiring vessels entering or leaving a port in any such State, <em>other than coast-wise steam vessels, </em>to take a pilot duly licensed or authorized by the laws of such State . . . (Emphasis added.) The Court has long held that these two statutes read together give the Federal Government exclusive authority to regulate pilots on enrolled vessels and that they preclude a State from imposing its own pilotage requirements upon them. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast S. S. Co., </em>225 U. S. 187 (1912); <em>Spraigue </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>118 U. S. 90 (1886). Thus, to the extent that the Tanker Law requires enrolled tankers to take on state-licensed pilots, the District Court correctly concluded, as the State now concedes, that it was in conflict with federal law and was therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">While the opinion of the court below indicated that the pilot provision of the Tanker Law was void only to the extent that it applied to tankers enrolled in the coastwise trade, the judgment itself declared the statute null and void in its entirety. No part of the statute was excepted from the scope of the injunctive relief. The judgment was overly broad, for just as it is clear that States may not regulate the pilots of enrolled vessels, it is equally clear that they are free to impose pilotage requirements on registered vessels entering and leaving their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ports. Not only does 46 U. S. C. \u00a7 215 so provide, as was noted above, but so also does \u00a7 101 (5) of the PWSA, 33 TJ. S. C.- \u00a7 1221 (5) (1970 ed., Supp. V), which authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to \u201crequire pilots on self-propelled vessels engaged in the foreign trades in areas and under circumstances where a pilot is not otherwise required by State law to be on board until the State having jurisdiction of an area involved establishes a requirement for a pilot in that area or under the circumstances involved . . . .\u201d Accordingly, as appellees now agree, the State was free to require registered tankers in excess of 50,000 DWT to take on a state-licensed pilot upon entering Puget Sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We next deal with \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) of the Tanker Law, which requires enrolled and registered oil tankers of from 40,000 to 125,000 DWT to possess all of the following \u201cstandard safety features\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201c(a) Shaft horsepower in the ratio of one horsepower to each two and one-half deadweight tons; and \u201c(b) Twin screws; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201c(c) Double bottoms, underneath all oil and liquid cargo compartments; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201c(d) Two radars in working order and operating, one of which must be collision avoidance radar; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201c(e) Such other navigational position location systems as may be prescribed from time fi&gt; time by the board of pilotage commissioners .. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">This section contains a proviso, however, stating that if the \u201ctanker is in ballast or is under escort of a tug or tugs with an aggregate shaft horsepower equivalent to five percent of the deadweight tons of that tanker . . . ,\u201d the design requirements are not applicable. The District Court held invalid this alternative design/tug requirement of the Tanker Law. We agree insofar as we hold that the foregoing design require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ments, standing alone, are invalid in the light of the PWSA and its regulatory implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The PWSA contains two Titles representing somewhat overlapping provisions designed to insure vessel safety and the protection of the navigable waters, their resources, and shore areas from tanker cargo spillage. The focus of Title I, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-1227 (1970 ed., Supp. V), is traffic control at local ports; Title IPs principal concern is tanker design and construction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For present purposes the relevant part is Title II, 46 U. S. C. \u00a7 391a (1970 ed., Supp. V), which amended the Tank Vessel Act of 1936, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4417a, as added, 49 Stat. 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Title II begins by declaring that the protection of life, property, and the marine environment from harm requires the promulgation of \u201ccomprehensive minimum standards of design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, and operation\u201d for vessels carrying certain cargoes in bulk, primarily oil and fuel tankers. \u00a7 391a (1). To implement the twin goals of providing for vessel safety and protecting the marine environment, it is provided that the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is located<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cshall establish\u201d such rules and regulations as may be necessary with respect to the design, construction, and operation of the covered vessels and with respect to a variety of related matters. \u00a7 391a (3). In issuing regulations, the Secretary is to consider the kinds and grades of cargo permitted to be on board such vessels, to consult with other federal agencies, and to identify separately the regulations established for vessel safety and those to protect marine environment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Section 391a (5) provides for inspection of vessels for compliance with the Secretary\u2019s safety regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No vessel subject to Title II may have on board any of the specified cargoes until a certificate of inspection has been issued to' the vessel and a permit endorsed thereon \u201cindicating that such vessel is in compliance with the provisions of this section and the rules and regulations for vessel safety established hereunder, and showing the kinds and grades of such cargo that such vessel may have on board or transport.\u201d It is provided that in lieu of inspection under this section the Secretary is to accept from vessels of foreign nations valid certificates of inspection \u201crecognized under law or treaty by the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Title II also directs the Secretary to inspect tank vessels for compliance with the regulations which he is required to issue for the protection of the marine environment. \u00a7 391a (6).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Compliance with these separate regulations, which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>satisfy specified standards,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the consequent privilege of having on board the relevant cargo are evidenced by certificates of compliance issued by the Secretary or by appropriate endorsements on the vessels' certificates of inspection. Certificates are valid for the period specified by the Secretary and are subject to revocation when it is found that the vessel does not comply with the conditions upon which the certificate was issued.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In lieu of a certificate of compliance with his own environmental regulations relating to vessel design, construction, alteration, and repair, the Secretary may, but need not, accept valid certificates from foreign vessels evidencing compliance with rules and regulations issued under a treaty, convention, or agreement providing for reciprocity of recognition of certificates or similar documents. \u00a7391a(7)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">This statutory pattern shows that Congress, insofar as design characteristics are concerned, has entrusted to the Secretary the duty of determining which oil tankers are sufficiently safe to be allowed to proceed in the navigable waters of the United States. This indicates to us that Congress intended uniform national standards for design and construction of tankers that would foreclose the imposition of different or more stringent state requirements. In particular, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>see it, Congress did not anticipate that a vessel found to be in compliance with the Secretary\u2019s design and construction regulations and holding a Secretary\u2019s permit, or its equivalent, to carry the relevant cargo would nevertheless be barred by state law from operating in the navigable waters of the United States on the ground that its design characteristics constitute an undue hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We do not question in the slightest the prior cases holding that enrolled and registered vessels must conform to \u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory conservation and environmental protection measures . . .\u201d imposed by a State. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 </em>U. S. 265, 277 (1977), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>18 How. 71 (1855); <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>139 U. S. 240 (1891); and <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>362 U. S. 440 (1960). Similarly, the mere fact that a vessel has been inspected and found to' comply with the Secretary\u2019s vessel safety regulations does not prevent a State or city from enforcing local laws having other purposes, such as a local smoke abatement law. <em>Ibid. </em>But in none of the relevant cases sustaining the application of state laws to federally licensed or inspected vessels did the federal licensing or inspection procedure implement a substantive rule of federal law addressed to the object also sought to be achieved by the challenged state regulation. <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>for example, made it plain that there was \u201cno overlap between the scope of the federal ship inspection laws and that of the municipal ordinance . . .\u201d there involved. <em>Id., </em>at 446. The purpose of the \u201cfederal inspection statutes [was] to insure the seagoing safety of vessels ... to aifor[d] protection from the perils of maritime navigation,\u201d while \u201c[b]y contrast, the sole aim of the Detroit ordinance [was] the elimination of air pollution to protect the health and enhance the cleanliness of the local community.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\"><em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>302 U. S. 1 (1937), involved a similar situation. There, the Court concluded that the Federal Motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Boat Act, although applicable to the vessels in question, was of limited scope and did not include provision for \"the inspection of the hull and machinery of respondents\u2019 motor-driven tugs in order to insure safety or determine seaworthiness ...,\u201d as long as the tugs did not carry passengers, freight, or in.fla.mmable liquid cargo. <em>Id., </em>at 8. It followed that state inspection to insure safety was not in conflict with federal law, the Court also holding that the limited federal regulations did not imply an intent to exclude state regulation of those matters not touched by the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Here, we have the very situation that <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit </em>and <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Washington </em>put aside. Title II aims at insuring vessel safety and protecting the marine environment; and the Secretary must issue all design and construction regulations that he deems necessary for these ends, after considering the specified statutory standards. The federal scheme thus aims precisely at the same ends as does \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) of the Tanker Law. Furthermore, under the PWSA, after considering the statutory standards and issuing all design requirements that in his judgment are necessary, the Secretary inspects and certifies each vessel as sufficiently safe to protect the marine environment and issues a permit or its equivalent to carry tank-vessel cargoes. Refusing to accept the federal judgment, however, the State now seeks to exclude from Puget Sound vessels certified by the Secretary as having acceptable design characteristics, unless they satisfy the different and higher design requirements imposed by state law. The Supremacy Clause dictates that the federal judgment that a vessel is safe to navigate United States waters prevail over the contrary state judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Enforcement of the state requirements would at least frustrate what seems to us to be the evident congressional intention to establish a uniform federal regime controlling the design of oil tankers. The original Tank Vessel Act, amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>by Title II, sought to effect a \u201creasonable and uniform set of rules and regulations concerning ship construction . . . ,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 2962, 74th. Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1936); and far from evincing a different purpose, the Title II amendments strongly indicate that insofar tanker design is concerned, Congress anticipated the enforcement of federal standards that would pre-empt state efforts to mandate different or higher design requirements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">That the Nation was to speak with one voice with respect to tanker-design standards is supported by the legislative history of Title II, particularly as it reveals a decided congressional preference for arriving at international standards for building tank vessels. The Senate Report recognizes that vessel design \u201chas traditionally been an area for international rather than national action,\u201d and that \u201cinternational solutions in this area are preferable since the problem of marine pollution is world-wide.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Senate Report 23. Congress did provide that the Secretary\u2019s safety regulations would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>apply to foreign ships holding compliance certificates under regulations arrived at by international agreement; but, in the end, the environmental protection regulations were made applicable to foreign as well as to American vessels since it was thought to be necessary for the achievement of the Act\u2019s purposes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Although not acceding to the request of those who thought that foreign vessels should be completely exempt from regulation under Title II,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Congress did not abandon the effort to achieve international agreement on what the proper design standards should be. It wrote into Title II a deferral procedure, requiring the Secretary at the outset to transmit his proposed environmental protection rules and regulations with respect to vessel design to the appropriate international forums for consideration as international standards. \u00a7 391a (7)(B). In order to facilitate the international consideration of these design requirements, Title II specified that the rules and regulations governing foreign vessels and United States vessels engaged in foreign trade could not become effective before January 1, 1974, unless they were consonant with an international agreement. \u00a7391a(7)(C). As noted by the Senate Report, this requirement demonstrated the \u201ccommittee\u2019s strong intention that standards for the protection of the marine environment be adopted, multilaterally if possible, but adopted in any event.\u201d Senate Report 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Congress expressed a preference for international action and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>expressly anticipated that foreign vessels would or could be considered sufficiently safe for certification by the Secretary if they satisfied the requirements arrived at by treaty or convention; it is therefore clear that Title II leaves no room for the States to impose different or stricter design requirements than those which Congress has enacted with the hope of having them internationally adopted or has accepted as the result of international accord. A state law in this area, such as the first part of \u00a7 88.16.190 (2), would frustrate the congressional desire of achieving uniform, international standards and is thus at odds with \u201cthe object sought to be obtained by [Title II] and the character of obligations imposed by it . . . <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U. S., at 230. In this respect, the District Court was quite correct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Of course, that a tanker is certified under federal law as a safe vessel insofar as its design and construction characteristics are concerned does not mean that it is free to ignore otherwise valid state or federal rules or regulations that do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>not constitute design or construction specifications. Registered vessels, for example, as we have already indicated, must observe Washington's pilotage requirement. In our view, both enrolled and registered vessels must also comply with the provision of the Tanker Law that requires tug escorts for tankers over 40,000 DWT that do not satisfy the design provisions specified in \u00a788.16.190 (2). This conclusion requires analysis of Title I of the PWSA, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-1227 (1970 ed., Supp. Y).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In order to prevent damage to vessels, structures, and shore areas, as well as environmental harm to navigable waters and the resources therein that might result from vessel or structure damage, Title I authorizes the Secretary to establish and operate \u201cvessel traffic services and systems\u201d for ports subject to congested traffic,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as well as to require ships to comply with the systems and to have the equipment necessary to do so. \u00a7\u00a7 1221 (1) and (2). The Secretary may \u201ccontrol vessel traffic\u201d under various hazardous conditions by specifying the times for vessel movement, by establishing size and speed limitations and vessel operating conditions, and by restricting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>vessel operation to those vessels having the particular operating characteristics which he considers necessary for safe operation under the circumstances. \u00a7 1221 (3). In addition, the Secretary may require vessels engaged in foreign trade to carry pilots until the State having jurisdiction establishes a pilot requirement, \u00a7 1221 (5); he may establish minimum safety equipment requirements for shore structures, \u00a7 1221 (7); and he may establish waterfront safety zones or other measures for limited, controlled, or conditional access when necessary for the protection of vessels, structures, waters, or shore areas, \u00a7 1221 (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In carrying out his responsibilities under the Act, the Secretary may issue rules and regulations. \u00a7 1224. In doing so, he is directed to consider a wide variety of interests that might affect the exercise of his authority, such as possible environmental impact, the scope and degree of the hazards involved, and \u201cvessel traffic characteristics including minimum interference with the flow of commercial traffic, traffic volume, the sizes and types of vessels, the usual nature of local cargoes, and similar factors.\u201d \u00a7 1222 (e). Section 1222 (b) provides that nothing in Title I is to \u201cprevent a State or political subdivision thereof from prescribing for structures only higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards than those which may be prescribed pursuant to this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Exercising this authority, the Secretary, through his delegate, the Coast Guard, has issued Navigation Safety Regulations, 33 CFR Part 164 (adopted at 42 Fed. Reg. 5956 (1977)). Of particular importance to this case, he has promulgated the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic System containing general rules, communication rules, vessel movement reporting requirements, a traffic separation scheme, special rules for ship movement in Rosario Strait, descriptions and geographic coordinates of the separation zones and traffic lanes, and a specification for precautionary areas and reporting points.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 33 CFR Part 161, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Subpart B (1976), as amended, 42 Fed. Reg. 29480 (1977). There is also delegated to Coast Guard district commanders and captains of ports the authority to exercise the Secretary\u2019s powers under \u00a7 1221 (3) to direct the anchoring, mooring, and movements of vessels; temporarily to establish traffic routing schemes; and to specify vessel size and speed limitations and operating conditions. 33 CFR \u00a7 160.35 (1976). Traffic in Rosario Strait is subject to a local Coast Guard rule prohibiting \u201cthe passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel through Rosario Strait in either direction at any given time.\u201d During the periods of bad weather, the size limitation is reduced to approximately 40,000 DWT. App. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A tug-escort provision is not a design requirement, such as is promulgated under Title II. It is more akin to an operating rule arising from the peculiarities of local waters that call for special precautionary measures, and, as such, is a safety measure clearly within the reach of the Secretary\u2019s authority under \u00a7\u00a7 1221 (3) (iii) and (iv) to establish \u201cvessel size and speed limitations and vessel operating conditions\u201d and to restrict vessel operation to those with \u201cparticular operating characteristics and capabilities . . . .\u201d Title I, however, merely authorizes and does not require the Secretary to issue regulations to implement the provisions of the Title; and assuming that \u00a7 1222 (b) prevents a State from issuing \u201chigher safety equipment requirements or safety standards,\u201d see <em>infra, </em>at 174, it does so only with respect to those requirements or standards \u201cwhich may be prescribed pursuant to this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The relevant inquiry under Title I with respect to the State\u2019s power to impose a tug-escort rule is thus whether the Secretary has either promulgated his own tug requirement for Puget Sound tanker navigation or has decided that no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>requirement should be imposed at all. It does not appear to us that he has yet taken either course. He has, however, issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, 41 Fed. Reg. 18770 (1976), to amend his Navigation Safety Regulations issued under Title I, 33 CFR Part 164 (1977), so as to require tug escorts for certain vessels operating in confined waters.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The notice says that these rules, if adopted, \u201care intended to provide uniform guidance for the maritime industry and Captains of the Port.\u201d 41 Fed. Reg. 18771 (1976). It may be that rules will be forthcoming that will pre-empt the State\u2019s present tug-escort rule, but until that occurs, the State\u2019s requirement need not give way under the Supremacy Clause.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Nor for constitutional purposes does it make substantial difference that under the Tanker Law those vessels that satisfy the State\u2019s design requirements are in effect exempted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the tug-escort requirement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Given the validity of a' general rule prescribing tug escorts for all tankers, Washington is also privileged, insofar as the Supremacy Clause is concerned, to waive the rule for tankers having specified design characteristics.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> For this reason, we conclude that the District Court erred in holding that the alternative tug requirement of \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) was invalid because of its conflict with the PWSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We cannot arrive at the same conclusion with respect to the remaining provision of the Tanker Law at issue here. Section 88.16.190 (1) excludes from Puget Sound under any circumstances any tanker in excess of 125,000 DWT. In our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>view, this provision is invalid in light of Title I and the Secretary\u2019s actions taken thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We begin with the premise that the Secretary has the authority to establish \u201cvessel size and speed limitations,\u201d \u00a7 1221 (3)(iii), and that local Coast Guard officers have been authorized to exercise this power on his behalf. Furthermore, \u00a7 1222 (b), by permitting the State to impose higher equip\u2022ment or safety standards \u201cfor structures only,\u201d impliedly forbids higher state standards for vessels. The implication is strongly supported by the legislative history of the PWSA. The House Report explains that the original wording of the bill did \u201cnot make it absolutely clear that the Coast Guard regulation of vessels preempts state action in this field\u201d and says that \u00a7 1222 (b) was amended to provide \u201ca positive statement retaining State jurisdiction over structures and making clear that State regulation of vessels is not contemplated.\u201d House Report 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">. Relying on the legislative history, the appellants argue that the preclusive effect of \u00a7 1222 (b) is restricted to vessel equipment requirements. The statute, however, belies this argument, for it expressly reaches vessel \u201csafety standards\u201d as well as equipment. A limitation on vessel size would seem to fall squarely within the category of safety standards, since the Secretary\u2019s authority to impose size limits on vessels navigating Puget Sound is designed to prevent damage to vessels and to the navigable waters and is couched in terms of controlling vessel traffic in areas \u201cwhich he determines to be especially hazardous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The pertinent inquiry at this point thus becomes whether the Secretary, through his delegate, has addressed and acted upon the question of size limitations. Appellees and the United States insist that he has done so by his local navigation rule with respect to Rosario Strait: The rule prohibits the passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel through Rosario Strait in either direction at any given time, and in periods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>bad weather, the \u201csize limitation\u201d is reduced to approximately 40.000 DWT. On the record before us, it appears sufficiently clear that federal authorities have indeed dealt with the issue of size and have determined whether and in what circumstances tanker size is to limit navigation in Puget Sound. The Tanker Law purports to impose a general ban on large tankers, but the Secretary\u2019s response has been a much more limited one. Because under \u00a7 1222 (b) the State may not impose higher safety standards than those prescribed by the Secretary under Title I, the size limitation of \u00a7 88.16.190 (1) may not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">There is also force to the position of appellees and the United States that the size regulation imposed by the Tanker Law, if not pre-empted under Title I, is similar to or indistinguishable from a design requirement which Title II reserves to the federal regime. This may be true if the size limit represents a state judgment that, as a matter of safety and environmental protection generally, tankers should not exceed 125.000 DWT. In that event, the State should not be permitted to prevail over a contrary design judgment made by federal authorities in pursuit of uniform national and international goals. On the other hand, if Washington\u2019s exclusion of large tankers from Puget Sound is in reality based on water depth in Puget Sound or on other local peculiarities, the Tanker Law in this respect would appear to be within the scope of Title I, in which event also state and federal law would represent contrary judgments, and the state limitation would have to give way.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Our conclusion as to the State\u2019s ban on large tankers is consistent with the legislative history of Title I. In exercising his authority under the Title, the Secretary is directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to consult with other agencies in order \u201cto assure consistency of regulations ...,\u201d\u00a7 1222 (c), and also to \u201cconsider fully the wide variety of interests which may be affected <em>. . . </em>\u00a7 1222 (e). These twin themes \u2014 consistency of regulation and thoroughness of consideration \u2014 reflect the substance of the Committee Reports. The House Report indicates that a good number of the witnesses who testified before the House subcommittee stated that one of the strong points of Title I was \u201cthe imposition of federal control in the areas envisioned by the bill which will insure regulatory and enforcement uniformity throughout all the covered areas.\" House Report 8.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Such a view was expressed by the Commandant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Coast Guard, Admiral Bender, who pointed out that with a federally operated traffic system, the necessary research and development could be carried out by a single authority and then utilized around the country \u201cwith differences applied . . . to the particular ports <em>....\u2019\u2019 Ibid. </em>He added that the same agency of the Federal Government that developed the traffic systems should then be responsible for enforcing them. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">While the House Report notes the importance of uniformity of regulation and enforcement, the Senate Report stresses the careful consideration that the Secretary must give to various factors before exercising his authority under Title I. It states that the Secretary \u201cis required to balance a number of considerations including the scope and degree of hazard, vessel traffic characteristics, conditions peculiar to a particular port or waterway, environmental factors, economic impact, and so forth.\u201d Senate Report 34. It was also \u201canticipated that the exercise of the authority provided . . . regarding the establishment of vessels size and speed limitations [would] not be imposed universally, but rather [would] be exercised with due consideration to the factors\u201d set forth above and with due regard for \u201csuch matters as combinations of horsepower, drafts of vessels, rivers, depth and width of channels, design types of vessels involved, and other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We read these statements by Congress as indicating that it desired someone with an overview of all the possible ramifications of the regulation of oil tankers to promulgate limitations on tanker size and that he should act only after balancing all of the competing interests. While it was not anticipated that the final product of this deliberation would be the promulgation of traffic safety systems applicable across the board to all United States ports, it was anticipated that there would be a single decisionmaker, rather than a different one in each State.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Against this background, we think the pre-emptive impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of \u00a7 1222 (b) is ail understandable expression of congressional intent. Furthermore, even without \u00a7 1222 (b), we would be reluctant to sustain the Tanker Law\u2019s absolute ban on tankers larger than 125,000 DWT. The Court has previously recognized that \u201cwhere failure of . . . federal officials affirmatively to exercise their full authority takes on the character of a ruling that no such regulation is appropriate or approved pursuant to the policy of the statute,\u201d States are not permitted to use their police power to enact such a regulation. <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. </em>v. <em>New York State Labor Relations Board, </em>330 U. S. 767, 774 (1947); <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., </em>272 U. S. 605 (1926). We think that in this case the Secretary\u2019s failure to promulgate a ban on the operations of oil tankers in excess of 125,000 DWT in Puget Sound takes on such a character. As noted above, a clear policy of the statute is that the Secretary shall carefully consider \u201cthe wide variety of interests which may be affected by the exercise of his authority,\u201d \u00a7 1222(e), and that he shall restrict the application of vessel size limitations to those areas where they are particularly necessary. In the case of Puget Sound, the Secretary has exercised his authority in accordance with the statutory directives and has promulgated a vessel-traffic-control system which contains only a narrow limitation on the operation of supertank\u00e9rs. This being the case, we conclude that Washington is precluded from enforcing the size limitation contained in the Tanker Law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We also reject appellees\u2019 additional constitutional challenges to the State\u2019s tug-escort requirement for vessels not satisfying its design standards.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Appellees contend that this provision, even if not pre-empted by the PWSA, violates the Commerce Clause because it is an indirect attempt to regulate the design and equipment of tankers, an area of regulation that appellees contend necessitates a uniform national rule. We have previously rejected this claim, concluding that the provision may be viewed as simply a tug-escort requirement since it does not have the effect of forcing compliance with the design specifications set forth in the provision. See n. 25, <em>supra. </em>So viewed, it becomes apparent that the Commerce Clause does not prevent a State from enacting a regulation of this type. Similar in its nature to a local pilotage requirement, a requirement that a vessel take on a tug escort when entering a particular body of water is not the type of regulation that demands a uniform national rule. See <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Board of Wardens, </em>12 How. 299 (1852). Nor does it appear from the record that the requirement impedes the free and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>efficient flow of interstate and foreign commerce, for the cost of tug escort for a 120,000 DWT tanker is less than one cent per barrel of oil and the amount of oil processed at Puget Sound refineries has not declined as a result of the provision\u2019s enforcement. App. 68. Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) of the Tanker Law is not invalid under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Similarly, we cannot agree with the additional claim that the tug-escort provision interferes with the Federal Government\u2019s authority to conduct foreign affairs. Again, appellees\u2019 argument is based on the contention that the overall effect of \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) is to coerce tanker owners into outfitting their vessels with the specified design requirements. Were that so, we might agree that the provision constituted an invalid interference with the Federal Government\u2019s attempt to achieve international agreement on the regulation of tanker design. The provision as we view it, however, does no more than require the use of tug escorts within Puget Sound, a requirement with insignificant international consequences. We, therefore, decline to declare \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) invalid for either of the additional reasons urged by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the three-judge District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> Puget Sound is an estuary consisting of 2,500 square miles of inlets, bays, and channels in the northwestern part of Washington.

Reg. 18770 (1976). It states that the following factors will be considered in developing the rules: size of vessel, displacement, propulsion, availability of multiple screws or bow thrusters, controllability, type of cargo, availability of safety standards, and actual or predicted adverse weather conditions. <em>Id., </em>at 18771.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\"> Appellees insist that the Secretary through his Coast Guard delegates has already exercised his authority to require tugs in Puget Sound to the extent he deems necessary and that the State should therefore not be permitted to impose stricter provisions. Appellees submit letters or other evidence indicating that the local Coast Guard authorities have required tug escorts for carriers of liquefied petroleum gas and on one occasion for another type of vessel. This evidence is not part of the record before us; but even accepting it, we cannot say that federal authorities have settled upon whether and in what circumstances tug escorts for oil tankers in Puget Sound should be required. The entire subject of tug escorts has been placed on the Secretary\u2019s agenda, seemingly for definitive action, by the notice of proposed rulemaking referred to in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"><em> </em>In fact, at the time of trial all tankers entering Puget Sound were required to have a tug escort, for no tanker then afloat had ah of the design features required by the Tanker Law.

The cost of tug escorts for all of appellee ARCO\u2019s tankers in Puget Sound is estimated at $277,500 per year. While not a negligible amount, it is only a fraction of the estimated cost of outfitting a single tanker with the safety features required by \u00a7 88.16.190 (2). The Office of Technology Assessment of Congress has estimated that constructing a new tanker with a double bottom and twin screws, just two of the required features, would add roughly $8.8 milhon to the cost of a 150,000 DWT tanker. Thus, contrary to the appellees\u2019 contention, it is very doubtful that the provision will pressure tanker operators into complying with the design standards specified in \u00a7 88.16.190 (2). While the tug provision may be viewed as a penalty for noncompliance with the State\u2019s design requirements, it does not \u201cstan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U.

The overall effect of \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) is to require tankers of ovqr 40,000 DWT to have a tug escort while they navigate Puget Sound, a result in no way inconsistent with the PWSA as it is currently being implemented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> It appears that the minimum water depth in Rosario Strait is 60 feet, App. 65, which according to the design standards used by the United States at the 1973 International Conference on Marine Pollution would accommodate vessels well in excess of 120,000 DWT. <em>Id., </em>at 80.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b248-5\"> During the hearings in the House, for example, Representative Keith expressed concern that States might on their own enact regulations restricting the size of vessels, noting that Delaware had already done so.

Under this program the construction of tankers of various sizes is subsidized, including tankers far in excess of 125,000 DWT. The Maritime Administration has rejected suggestions that no subsidies be offered for the building of the larger tankers. There is some force to the argument, but we need not rely on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> Although the District Court did not reach these additional grounds, the issues involved are legal questions, and the record seems sufficiently complete to warrant their resolution here without a remand to the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b252-8\">Mr. Justice Marshall,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">with whom Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The Washington Tanker Law at issue here has three operative provisions: (1) a requirement that every oil tanker of 50.000 deadweight tons (DWT) or larger employ a pilot licensed by the State of Washington while navigating Puget Sound and adjacent waters, Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 88,16.180 (Supp. 1975); (2) a requirement that every oil tanker of from 40.000 to 125,000 DWT either possess certain safety features or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>utilize tug escorts while operating in Puget Sound, \u00a7 88.16.190 (2); and (3) a size limitation, barring tankers in excess of 125,000 DWT from the Sound, \u00a7 88.16.190 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">I agree with the Court that the pilotage requirement is pre-empted only with respect to enrolled vessels. I also agree that the tug-escort requirement is fully valid, at least until such time as the Secretary of Transportation or his delegate promulgates a federal tug-escort rule or decides, after full consideration, that no such rule is necessary. I therefore join Parts I, II, III, Y, and VII of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In the current posture of this case, however, I see no need to speculate, as the Court does, on the validity of the safety features alternative to the tug requirement. Since the effective date of the Tanker Law, all tankers \u2014 including those owned or chartered by appellees \u2014 have employed tug escorts rather than attempting to satisfy the alternative safety requirements. The relative expense of compliance, moreover, makes it extremely unlikely, at least for the foreseeable future, that any tankers will be constructed or redesigned to meet the law\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the Court itself concludes that \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) \u201cmay be viewed as simply a tug-escort requirement since it does not have the effect of forcing compliance with the design specifications set forth in the provision.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 179; see <em>ante, </em>at 173 n. 25, and 180. Accordingly, I cannot join Part IV of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">I also cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion in Part VI of its opinion that the size limitation contained in the Tanker Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>is invalid under the Supremacy Clause. To reach this conclusion, the Court relies primarily on an analysis of Title I of the PWSA and the Secretary of Transportation\u2019s actions thereunder. I agree with the Court that the Secretary has authority to establish vessel size limitations based on the characteristics of particular waters,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that a State is not free to impose more stringent requirements once the Secretary has exercised that authority or has decided, after balancing all of the relevant factors, that a size limitation would not be appropriate. On the other hand, Title I does not by its own force pre-empt all state regulation of vessel size, since it \u201cmerely authorizes and does not require the Secretary to issue regulations to implement the provisions of the Title.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 171. Thus, as the Court notes, \u201c[t]he pertinent inquiry at this point . . . [is] whether the Secretary, through his delegate, has addressed and acted upon the question of size limitations.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Court concludes that the Secretary\u2019s delegate, the Coast Guard, has in fact considered the issue of size limitations for Puget Sound and reached a judgment contrary to the one embodied in the Tanker Law. Under well-established principles, however, state law should be displaced \u201c 'only to the extent necessary to protect the achievement of the aims of\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>federal law; whenever possible, we should \u201creconcile 'the operation of both statutory schemes with one another rather than holding [the state scheme] completely ousted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>414 U. S. 117, 127 (1973), quoting <em>Silver </em>v. <em>New York Stock Exchange, </em>373 U. S. 341, 361, 357 (1963); accord, <em>De Canas </em>v. <em>Bica, </em>424 U. S. 351, 357-358, n. 5 (1976). Viewed in light of these principles, the record simply does not support the Court\u2019s finding of conflict between state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Coast Guard\u2019s unwritten \u201clocal navigation rule,\u201d which prohibits passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel through Rosario Strait at any given time, is the sole evidence cited by the Court to show that size limitations for Puget Sound have been considered by federal authorities. <em>Ante, </em>at 174-175. On this record, however, the rule cannot be said to reflect a determination that the size limitations set forth in the Tanker Law are inappropriate or unnecessary. First, there is no indication that in establishing the vessel traffic rule for Rosario Strait the Coast Guard considered the need for promulgating size limitations for the entire Sound.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, even assuming that the Rosario Strait rule resulted from consideration of the size issue with respect to the entire area, appellees have not demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>strated that the rule evinces a judgment contrary to the provisions of the Tanker Law. Under the express terms of the PWSA, the existence of local vessel-traffic-control schemes must, be weighed in the balance in determining whether, and to what extent, federal size limitations should be imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no evidence in the record that the Rosario Strait \u201csize limitation\u201d was in existence or even under consideration prior to passage of the Tanker Law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus appellees have left unrebutted the inference that the Coast Guard\u2019s own limited rule was built upon, and is therefore entirely consistent with, the framework already created by the Tanker Law\u2019s restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Perhaps in recognition of the tenuousness of its finding of conflict with federal regulation under Title I, the Court suggests that the size limitation imposed by the Tanker Law might also be pre-empted under Title II of the PWSA. <em>Ante, </em>at 175. In particular, the Court theorizes that the state rule might be pre-empted if it \u201crepresents a state judgment that, as a matter of safety and environmental protection <em>generally, </em>tankers should not exceed 125,000 DWT.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(Emphasis added.) It is clear, however, that the Tanker Law was not merely a reaction to the problems arising out of tanker operations in general, but instead was a measure tailored to respond to unique local conditions \u2014 in particular, the unusual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>susceptibility of Puget Sound to damage from large oil spills and the peculiar navigational problems associated with tanker operations in the Sound.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, there is no basis for preemption under Title II.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>For similar reasons, I would hold that Washington\u2019s size regulation does not violate the Commerce Clause. Since water depth and other navigational conditions vary from port to port, local regulation of tanker access \u2014 like pilotage and tug requirements, and other harbor and river regulation \u2014 is certainly appropriate, and perhaps even necessary, in the absence of determinative federal action. See, <em>e. g., Cooley </em>v. <em>Board of Wardens, </em>12 How. 299, 319 (1852); <em>Packet Co. </em>v. <em>Catlettsburg, </em>105 U. S. 559, 562-563 (1882). Appellees have not demonstrated that the Tanker Law\u2019s size limit is an irrational or ineffective means of promoting safety and environmental pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tection,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor have they shown that the provision imposes any substantial burden on interstate or foreign commerce.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, it is clear that appellees have not carried their burden of showing that the provision\u2019s impact on interstate or foreign commerce \u201cis clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u201d <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">I do not find any of appellees\u2019 other arguments persuasive. I would therefore sustain the size limitation imposed by the Tanker Law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"> According to the record, no tanker currently afloat has all the design features prescribed by the Tanker Law. Neither Atlantic Richfield nor Seatrain has plans to modify any tankers currently in operation to satisfy the design standards, \u201cbecause such retrofit is not economically feasible under current and anticipated market conditions.\u201d App. 67. Moreover, the vessels being constructed by Seatrain will not meet the majority of the design requirements, and, as the Court convincingly demonstrates, <em>ante, </em>at 173 n. 25, the Tanker Law is not likely to induce tanker owners to incorporate the specified design features into new tankers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> The relevant provision of Title I states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cIn order to prevent damage to, or the destruction or loss of any vessel, bridge, or other structure on or in the navigable waters of the United States, or any land structure or shore area immediately adjacent to those waters; and to protect the navigable waters and the resources therein from environmental harm resulting from vessel or structure damage, destruction, or loss, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\u201c(3) control vessel traffic in areas which he determines to be especially hazardous, or under conditions of reduced visibility, adverse weather, vessel congestion, or other hazardous circumstances by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\u201c(iii) establishing vessel size and speed limitations and vessel operating conditions . . . .\u201d 33 U.

While it is true that construction of tankers larger than 125,000 DWT has been subsidized under the program, almost two-thirds of the tankers that have been or are being constructed have been smaller than 125,000 DWT, App. 60; of the remainder, the smallest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>are 225,000 DWT vessels with drafts well in excess of 60 feet \u2014 too large to pass through Rosario Strait, see n. 6, <em>supra, </em>or dock at any of the refineries on Puget Sound (Atlantic Richfield\u2019s refinery at Cherry Point has a dockside depth of 55 feet; none of the other five refineries on Puget Sound has sufficient dockside depth even to accommodate tankers as large as 125,000 DWT.

Relying on the well-established proposition that federal enrollment and licensing of a vessel give it authority to engage in coastwise trade and to navigate in state waters, <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Seacoast Products, Inc., </em>431 U. S. 265, 276, 280-281 (1977); <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>9 Wheat. 1, 212-214 (1824), appellees assert that Washington may not exclude from any of its waters tankers that have been enrolled and licensed, or registered, pursuant to the federal vessel registration, enrollment, and licensing laws, 46 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 221, 251, 263. Even assuming that registration of a vessel carries with it the same privileges as enrollment and licensing, this argument ignores a proposition as well established as the one relied on by appellees: Notwithstanding the privileges conferred by the federal vessel license, \u201cStates may impose upon federal licensees reasonable, nondiscriminatory conservation and environmental protection measures otherwise within their police power.\u201d <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, </em>at 277; see, <em>e. g., Huron Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>362 U.

App. 68. Moreover, according to the record, use of a 120,000 DWT tanker rather than a 150,000 DWT tanker increases the cost of shipping oil from Valdez, Alaska, to Cherry Point by a mere $.02 to $.04 per barrel, <em>id., </em>at 64; and the record does not specify the relevant cost data for the Persian Gulf-Cherry Point route. Finally, appellees offered no concrete evidence of any significant disruption in their tanker operations, or of any decrease in the market value of the tankers that they own, as a result of the Tanker Law\u2019s provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b259-6\">Me. Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"AuU\">with whom Me. Justice Powell joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The federal interest in uniform regulation of commerce on the high seas, reinforced by the Supremacy Clause, \u201cdictates that the federal judgment that a vessel is safe to navigate United States waters prevail over the contrary state judgment.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 165. For that reason, as the Court explains in Part IY of its opinion, we must reject the judgment expressed by the Legislature of the State of Washington that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>an oil tanker of 40,000 to 125,000 deadweight tons cannot safely navigate in Puget Sound unless it possesses the \u201cstandard safety features\u201d prescribed by \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) of the Washington Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Court holds, the state statute imposing those design requirements .is invalid. It follows, I believe, that the State may not impose any special restrictions on vessels which do not satisfy these invalid criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The Court correctly holds that the State may not exclude vessels in that category from Puget Sound but it inconsistently allows the State to impose a costly tug-escort requirement on those vessels and no others. This tug-escort requirement is not, by its terms, a general safety rule from which tankers are exempt if they possess the invalid design features.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Quite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>contrary, the tug-escort requirement is merely a proviso in \u00a7 88.16.190 (2) \u2014 the section of the Washington Tanker Law that prescribes the design requirements; it is imposed only on tankers that do not comply with those requirements. The federal interest that prohibits state enforcement of those requirements should also prohibit state enforcement of a special penalty for failure to comply with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">If the federal interest in uniformity is to be vindicated, the magnitude of the special burden imposed by any one State\u2019s attempt to penalize noncompliance with its invalid rules is of no consequence. The tug-escort penalty imposed by Washington will cost appellee ARCO approximately $277,500 per year. The significance of that cost cannot be determined simply by comparison with the capital investment which would be involved in complying with Washington\u2019s invalid design specifications. Rather, it should be recognized that this initial burden is subject to addition and multiplication by similar action in other States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, whether or not so multiplied, the imposition of any special restriction impairs the congressional determination to provide uniform standards for vessel design and construction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Since I am persuaded that the tug-escort requirement is an inseparable appendage to the invalid design requirements, the invalidity of one necessarily infects the other. I therefore respectfully dissent from Parts V and VII of the Court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-5\"> Washington Rev.

See <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U. S. 52, 67.
