This is in accord with appellee\u2019s contention on the argument that the money collected herein was not an \u201coverpayment\u201d of a \u201ctax\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The general rule is that \u201cthe United States is not liable'to [for] interest except where it assumes the liability by contract or by the express words of a statute, or must pay it as part of the just compensation required by the Constitution\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellant argues that the certificate of probable cause contained in the judgment affirmed, converted the judgment into a judgment against the United States, and therefore no interest may be allowed. Appellee contends that in form the judgment is not one against the United States, but against a private individual, and therefore interest may be allowed the same as in any action against a private party.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Interest may be included in a judgment against a collector from the time of collection by the collector to the date of judgment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> except where \u201cplaintiff has been guilty of laches in unreasonably delaying the prosecution of his claim\u201d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a point not urged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">U.S.Code, Title 28, \u00a7 842, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 842, provides: \u201cWhen a recovery is had in any suit or proceeding against a collector * \" * * for the recovery of any money exacted by or paid to him and by him paid into the Treasury, in the performance of his official duty, and the court certifies that there was probable cause for the act done by the collector or other officer, or that he acted under the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury, or other proper officer of the government, no execution shall issue against such collector or other officer, but the amount so recovered shall, upon final judgment, be provided for and paid out of the proper appropriation from the Treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">The effect of such statute is shown by the following quotation from Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., 257 U.S. 1, 4, 42 S.Ct. 1, 66 L.Ed. 99: \u201cAs the law stood before later statutes a collector was liable personally for duties mistakenly collected, if the person charged gave notice, at the time of his intention to sue, and warning not to pay over the amount to the Treasury. * * * But after an Act of Congress had required collectors to pay over such monies, it was held * * * that the personal liability was gone. * * * \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The effect of the certificate of probable cause is to convert the claim into one against the United States<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> when, but not until, the certificate is given.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the United States is not liable for interest on a judgment from its date to the date of the certificate of probable cause, because when the obligation of the United States arises, it is an obligation to pay the amount of the judgment only,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> interest on such judgment being forbidden by the general rule regarding interest above alluded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">However, the liability of the United States is, as provided in the statute, for the amount of the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and until there is a final judgment there is nothing to prevent enforcement of the claim for interest to the date of the final judgment the same as in any other action against a private individual. Accordingly, where the collector appeals from a judgment rendered against him, and the appellate court affirms the judgment, interest should be allowed on the judgment affirmed to the date of the judgment to be entered on the mandate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Upon entry of that judgment, the certificate of probable cause converts it into one against the United States, and the general rule regarding interest against the United States applies, so that the United States is not liable for interest on the judgment which is entered on the mandate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">From these rules it can be seen that appellee is entitled to interest on the judgment affirmed to the date of the entry of the judgment on the mandate. It is not apparent why the judgment should so state, Rule 26 being pTain in that respect,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but to avoid any doubt the mandate should be recalled and modified to specifically provide for interest to the date of the judgment which will be entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> U.S. Code, Title 28, \u00a7 811, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 811.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> 3 Ore.Code Ann., 1930, \u00a7 57-1201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-10\"> Reed v.
