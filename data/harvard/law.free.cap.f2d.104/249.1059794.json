Persham (appellant) did \u201cin a certain public park of the United States- known as Monument Grounds * * * unlawfully operate a certain motor vehicle, to wit, an automobile, recklessly, that is to say at a greater rate of speed than was reasonable and proper * * * against the form of the statute in such case made and provided,\u201d etc. At the trial the witnesses for the United States identified the place of the alleged offense as the intersection of 15th Street and Constitution Avenue, Northwest. At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground that there was no evidence tending to show that the violation occurred \u201cin a certain public park of the United States known as Monument Grounds\u201d and that the offense, if any, was an offense which by law was subject to be prosecuted only by the corporation counsel of the District of Columbia. We think the court on this motion should have quashed the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">As recently as the latter part of 1937<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we held that a prosecution in the District of Columbia for reckless driving, for which the penalty may be both fine and imprisonment not exceeding one year, should be in the name of the District and filed by its corporation counsel. We called attention in that case to the fact that Congress had in 1925 passed a general traffic law applicable to the District of Columbia. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act is comprehensive, and either by specific provisions or by authorizing the adoption of rules and regulations by the Commissioners and the Director of Parks covers the entire subject of traffic control in the District of Columbia. The Act, however, tr\u00edade no change in the then existing laws in relation to prosecutions for traffic offenses, and Sec. 16(b) retained control in the Director of Parks <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> over vehicles and traffic on the roads, highways, and bridges within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the public grounds of the District and specifically empowered him to make and enforce regulations for that purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We may,'therefore, assume that at the time of the passage of the Act traffic offenses occurring in the public parks were subject to prosecution by the United State's Attorney under Sec. 932 of the D.C.Code of 1901,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as amended by the Act of June 30, 1902. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But in July, 1926, Congress amended the general traffic law to provide that all violations of the Traffic Act as amended or of regulations promulgated thereunder should be prosecuted by information filed by the corporation counsel. <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This provision was amended in 1931,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201c(i) All prosecutions for violations of provisions of the Traffic Acts, excepting section 11 thereof, and this Act or regulations made and promulgated under the authority of said Acts shall be in the police court of the District of Columbia upon information filed ,by the corporation counsel of the District of Columbia or any of his assistants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The Traffic Act as amended to date may, therefore, be said to delegate to the Commissioners of the District power and authority to make rules and regulations in relation to traffic on the public thoroughfares, and to the Director of Parks authority to make rules and regulations in relation to traffic on the roads in the public parks within the District; and by the quoted section to provide for the prosecution and punishment for violations, whether on the public streets or in the parks, by proceedings in the police court at the instance of the corporation counsel and to exclude the United States Attorney from any part in the commencement of such prosecutions except in the case of a violation of Sec. 11, the smoke screen felony provision of the Act, D.C.Code 1929, T. 6, \u00a7 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">As the information on which the prosecution in this case was begun was brought by the United States Attorney, it was invalid, and on defendant\u2019s motion should have been quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the information, but without prejudice to the right of the corporation counsel, if he shall be so advised, to institute a prosecution under the Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-18\"> District of Columbia v.
