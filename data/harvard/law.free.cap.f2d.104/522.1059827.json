It operated about eight months a year in,.the territory of the Calumet River (concededly a navigable water). It supplied coal to other vessels on their order, each operation consuming only a couple of hours. It had no sleeping or eating quarters. Its certificate of inspection required that \u201cIncluded in the entire <em>crew </em>hereinafter specified and designated there must be 1 licensed master and pilot, 1 licensed chief engineer, 3 seamen, 1 fireman.\u201d If deceased were counted as a member, of the crew, the full complement of the ship was present. Otherwise not.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">Deceased had been in the employ of appellee from October 5th to the 31st, only, a total of 269 hours, at an hourly wage of sixty cents. He was paid semimonthly \u2014 in all $161.40. His chief task was in facilitating the flow of coal from his boat to the vessel being fueled \u2014 removing obstructions to the flow with a stick. He performed such additional tasks as throwing the ship\u2019s rope in releasing or making the boat fast. He performed no navigation duties. He occasionally did some cleaning of the boat., He did no work while the boat was en route from dock to the vessel to be fueled.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-21\">Pertinent excerpts from the record relative to deceased\u2019s duties are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Presented for determination is the line of demarcation between the duties of the deputy commissioner and those of the District Court. The generalization is accepted that the determination of \u201cj'urisdictional facts\u201d is reserved to the courts while issues involving \u201ccircumstances, nature, extent and consequences of injuries\u201d are for the commissioner. The court\u2019s review of the commissioner\u2019s action, through an injunction suit, is limited. As to these latter questions, the court is limited to an ascertainment of any supporting evidence, while questions involving \u201cjurisdictional\u201d controversies are determinable by the court in a trial de novo. This differentiation of jurisdiction is derived from our constitutional theory, \u2014 the Federal Congress may not impose a liability on an employer except by virtue of the existence and involvement of the two factors \u2014 (1) navigable waters, and (2) master and servant relationship. And the determination of the existence of these two j'urisdictional prerequisites may not be left to the decision of an administrative tribunal, but must be lodged in a court. Crowell v. Benson, supra. Other issues may, however, be left to administrative determination, and such findings are conclusive if supported by evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We conclude that the inquiry into the crew-membership status is not jurisdictional in character, and, therefore, is one for the commissioner to determine, and his determination if supported by the evidence may not be disturbed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The following reasons underlie our conclusion: .</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(1) The Supreme Court has held that <em>two </em>factors are jurisdictional (navigable waters, and employer-employee relation) because without their\u2019 presence the Federal Government would have no power to act. The naming of the <em>two </em>jurisdictional prerequisites impliedly excludes the existence of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">(2) Although being a \u201cmember of \u00e1 crew\u201d <em>excepts </em>one from the purview of the <em>coverage </em>section (Section 3, above-quoted) the Supreme Court has held that another exception from coverage, namely, suicide, is <em>not </em>a jurisdictional issue. These two statutory exceptions, namely, a \u201cmember of a crew\u201d and a death by suicide, are of identical structure in the statutory setup of this section, and a legal construction given to the latter (suicide) might with plausibility be given to the former. If one is not a jurisdictional question, should we not give a like effect or construction to the other?</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">(3) The statute should be construed liberally to protect laborers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">(4) The number of jurisdictional issues should not be increased beyond legal reason because the purpose of the Act was to expedite the hearing of claims and granting of awards and \u2019 to simplify as greatly as possible the procedure in such matters, so that the needy, the helpless, and the ignorant would receive financial aid promptly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act gives to the commissioner broad powers to accomplish this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-19\">There remains only the review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that Schumann was not a member of a crew. The District Court found otherwise on a trial de novo on evidence similar to that heard by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-20\">The evidence in our opinion, supports the commissioner\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The following facts are significant:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>a) Schumann had no duties pertaining to the navigation of the vessel, except the incidental task of throwing the ship\u2019s line. His <em>primary </em>duty was to free the coal if it stuck in the hopper while being discharged into the fueled vessel, while both boats were at rest. He had no duties while the boat was in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">b) He was paid an hourly wage. He had no \u201cArticles\u201d (a naval term meaning employment contract) and none were necessary in this kind of work. He slept at home and boarded off ship. He was called very early in the morning each day as he was wanted. While he had worked only three weeks, and it might have been possible that he would have been retained for years to come, his employment was still more akin to temporary employment. The Captain testified that he was under no obligation to give him work each day \u2014 no contract of regular employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">c) While we have given some weight to the fact that the Certificate of Inspection required the craft to have a crew of five in addition to the master, and that in this instance five would be present only if Schumann were included, we are convinced that the word \u201ccrew\u201d as used in the certificate has a different significance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>and .connotation than the word \u201ccrew\u2019? as used in the statutory exception. The Longshoremen\u2019s Act contemplated the exclusion of that body of men who in the common parlance make up the ship\u2019s complement, \u2014 those who regularly or ordinarily are engaged in seafaring and navigation, not those\u2019whose tasks are of such a nature that they are independent of navigation in their scope, such as tasks which might as well have their background on shore, or at the dock (such as watchmen, etc.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>). The task, of prodding coal down a runway might just as well have as its background a coal truck, a round house, or a mine, .as a steamship. It was an ordinary laborer\u2019s job, and it was merely happenstance that the location of this position was on shipboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Even though the construction of this statute necessitated a different answer to the jurisdictional question, the result would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">A District Court in reviewing the finding of the deputy commissioner, made in a proper case, is precluded from weighing the evidence. He may only inquire into the existence of any evidence to support a finding that the deceased was not a seaman. In such a case the District Court was required' to examine the record and .ascertain whether there was any evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Likewise, on this review, assuming a trial de novo was proper and the seaman status presented a jurisdictional question, we must examine the evidence to ascertain whether there was any evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that he was a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In either case the facts are not in dispute. Therefore on undisputed evidence, is the finding, which we might call a conclusion that the deceased was a seaman, consistent with the undisputed facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Convinced as we are that the evidence establishes a nofr-seaman status, it follows that the court erred in holding to the Contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">The decree is reversed with directions to vacate the injunction and dismiss the bill.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> The Captain, testifying before the Deputy Commissioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">\u201cQ. And among the deckhands you claim the deceased was one? A. Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-8\">\u201cQ. Those, with yourself, constituted the crew of this vessel? A.

Why, he was a deck hand and he did general deck work. He handled lines, .got on the dock and took the stem line and made it fast and on leaving the dock he threw the stern line off the dock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">\u201cQ. Did he assist the fireman at any time? A. Why, yes, they were all willing to take an interest in learning to fire so in case the fireman got sick he could have a man to replace him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">\u201cQ. Under what status was he paid? I mean by that, was he paid as a seaman or sailor or deck hand? A. He was paid as a deck hand, as a member of the crew of the boat Koal Kraft. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-uW\">\u201cQ. He took orders solely from you, is that right, Captain? A. Yes, sir. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A11\">\u201cQ. You say he worked with the fireman on the day he was injured? A. Yes, Sir. That is, he handled the line;. The fireman ran the winch that operates the line and he passed the line off the dock, or put it on the dock, whatever the occasion would be. * * \u2019 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-23\">\u201cQ. In employing this kind of help they sign no papers, do they? A. No, sir. * * * No local boat signs any articles. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-26\">\u201cQ. You say his duties were those of a deck hand? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmE\">\u201cQ. What are the duties of a deck hand on a boat of this sort? A. Well, just general labor, keeping it clean, handling the lines, painting or whatever you ask him to do. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-29\">\u201cQ. Do they have to have any experience when they come on there, any kind of experience as seamen or sailors <em>* </em>* * ? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-30\">\u201cQ. They come on like laborers? A. Yes. They pick up the work as they work along 'there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-31\">\u201cQ. * * * Now, as a matter of fact, Schumann was called in only by telephone to come whenever; there was work? A. Yes, sir. ' - \u2022 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-32\">\u201cQ. Otherwise he was- staying home -waiting for a call to com\u00e9- to work? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201cQ. He was a plain laborer? A. Yes, sir. In other words, he was called a deck hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cQ. Now, he did not participate in any of the navigation of the boat did he? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that the man\u2019s main work consisted of coaling up the steamboat, when the boat came up it was his duty to coal up the steamboat? A. No, while discharging the coal his duty was to keep the coal running in these hoppers up on deck with a pole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cQ. If there was no work he didn\u2019t have any claim on you, if there was no work he would not come and ask for work. Isn\u2019t that correct? A. Why, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cQ. He would only come when you called him? A. Why yes. Well, generally he kn\u00bbw when he went home at night whether to wait for a call or come out the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">\u201cQ. There was no obligation on your part to give him work? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">The fireman of the Koal Kraft testified before the Commissioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201cQ. Did you know John Schumann? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">\u201cQ. What part of the crew was he? A. He was on the after deck, a deck hand on the after deck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">\u201cQ. What were his duties? A. Well, his duties, his main duty was to poke \u2022down the coal from tile hopper on to the belt when it stuck there. He also put the line on the winch, he stood there and gave me signals. When the boat was tied up he went up and pushed coal down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">\u201cQ. * * .* did he do any work other than that occasionally? A. Well, he went down below and helped scrub the deck down there. * * * Any painting that was necessary to be done on the boat was a part of his job. The deck hand maintained the outside of the boat and inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">\u201cQ. You say the deck hands have nothing to do with the steering or with the navigation of the boat? A. No, they don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">\u201cQ. And while the boat is in motion the dock hands really have nothing to do? A. Well, I would say the deck hand has nothing to do except when there is an emergency breakdown * * *,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-18\">\u201cQ. You said before that the main duty of John Schumann was to refuel this steamboat when your coal barge would come to it? That was his main duty? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-19\">\u201cQ. Now, while he was working there he never slept there in the boat? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-20\">\u201cQ. Ho stayed at home and was called whenever there was work? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-21\">\u2018Q. That applied to all of you? A.
