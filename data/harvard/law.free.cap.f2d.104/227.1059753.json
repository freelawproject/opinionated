The lower court thereupon entered an order for costs in favor of appellee and for a new trial. The parties stipulated \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the issues of fact herein may be tried and determined by the Court without the intervention of a jury, a jury being hereby waived, and further that the evidence adduced at the former trial of the issues herein may be considered as resubmitted to the trial judge upon this trial and that both parties may submit such additional evidence as they may be advised.\u201d The record states that evidence was adduced by the parties, but fails to reveal that any additional evidence was offered or received. The lower court made new findings of fact, judgment was entered in favor of appellee, and the present appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Appellant concedes that so far as the express contract is concerned, this court must reverse itself in order to allow him a recovery thereon, because he can point to no element which constitutes a substantial distinction between the case presented in the earlier appeal and that presented in the present appeal. In support of his argument for reversal he urges that (1) our earlier conclusion was incorrect; (2) the court is not precluded by the \u201claw of the case\u201d- doctrine from reaching a different conclusion; (3) the contract is legal; and (4) a decision in accord with our earlier decision would be plainly wrong and would work manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">While it is true that the rule of the \u201claw of the case\u201d would not prevent a different conclusion, if a clear case were pr\u00e9sented showing that the earlier adjudication was plainly wrong and that application of the rule would work manifest injustice,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there is no such showing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">Appellant relies upon certain language which appears in our earlier opinion to support his contention that he had a lawful claim which required merely remedial legislation to enforce it, <em>i. e.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALy\">\u201cDefendant had no existing legal claim against the government prior to the enactment of the War Claims Act, nor was any claim in its favor specifically granted or established by the act. It required legislation to create the rights so that claims for compensation under plaintiffs\u2019 contract could be instituted in the department or tribunal provided. In the passage of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 254), Congress was acting in a purely legislative capacity and not in a quasi-judicial capacity. It was not adjudicating the right of defendant or any other claimant to recover an individual claim against the government. It was merely enacting a remedial statute, providing a method by which claims might be adjudicated in a proper tribunal and the rights of claimants be determined.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACP\">The latter part of the quoted paragraph, standing alone and without regard to the context of the opinion, may be susceptible of the interpretation which he seeks to place upon it. But the language which is decisive of the case is: \u201cDefendant had no existing legal claim against the government prior to the enactment of the War Claims Act, . . . \u201d As it had no legal claim, appellant\u2019s agreement to take such steps as might be deemed necessary to protect the rights and interests of ap-pellee'and to enforce such rights against the government or any of its departments, bureaus, or divisions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> fell within the class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of contracts condemned by the law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we said further: \u201cThis provision [of the contract] broadly opened the door for plaintiff and his associates through the inducement of the large compensation involved to attempt means and methods which have led to the establishment by the courts of the rule of public policy, which renders this contract null and void.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">So far as the rights of appellee were concerned, the War Claims Act constituted \u201cfavor legislation\u201d as distinguished from \u201cdebt legislation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Careful analysis reveals this distinction in each of the cases relied upon by appellant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In each there was a lawful\" existing claim; here there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> In our earlier opinion we used language derogatory of appellee because after reaping the reward of appellant\u2019s efforts, its corporate conscience was satisfied by pleading the rule of public policy and failing to compensate appellant for services rendered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant finds comfort in this language and urges it upon us now to show that our prior opinion results in injustice. Unfortunately for appellant we cannot follow him to that conclusion. The policy of the law which prohibits contingent fees for services rendered in securing \u201cfavor legislation\u201d, is not concerned with the moral or ethical standards of clients served. The purpose of the law is to prevent improper pressures upon legislative action. The fact that a client may he one of such low moral and ethical standards as to take advantage of his agent, certainly constitutes no reason for permitting his agent to take advantage of the government. This is par-ticulary true in the present case. Justice, although perhaps a blind goddess, cannot overlook the fact that appellant is a lawyer, an officer of the court, charged with knowledge of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-20\">Appellant proposes also \u2014 apparently with the idea that it is a newly discovered alternative \u2014 that if the court adheres to its earlier adjudication upon the express contract, it may nevertheless give him a judgment in <em>quantum meruit. </em>This proposal was considered on the former appeal and rejected.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We adhere to our decision upon that point also.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-30\"> Gesellschaft Fur Drahtlose Telegraphie M.
