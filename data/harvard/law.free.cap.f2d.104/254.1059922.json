The insurance carrier filed its bill in the District Court for a review of the order. On hearing the court dismissed the bill, and the carrier appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">The appeal is wholly based on the ground that there was no evidence to support the finding of continuing injury. We have examined the evidence carefully and are of opinion that there is enough in the record to justify the commissioner\u2019s conclusion and order. It is of no consequence that we might have reached a different con-\u2019 elusion, or that there -is a sharp conflict in the testimony, or even that the evidence preponderates strongly\u2019 against the claimant. Under the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we cannot substitute our judgment for the commissioner\u2019s judgment, nor can we weigh the evidence. As we have many times said, on questions of fact as to injury the findings of the commissioner, when supported by substantial evidence, are final. See Powell v. Hoage, 61 App.D.C. 99, 57 F.2d 766; Hoage v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corporation, 62 App.D.C. 77, 64 F.2d 715; Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corporation v.
