It further appears from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, dated April 1, 1937, that appellee\u2019s motion was sustained only so far as it related to the evidence pertaining to the patentability of the involved design. It further appears that the tribunals of the Patent Office considered all other evidence introduced by appellant, the Examiner of Interferences stating in his decision that, regardless of what appellant\u2019s evidence established, he would be restricted to the dates alleged in his preliminary statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">It is well settled that \u201ca party is restricted to the dates alleged in his preliminary statement for conception (which ordinarily involves proof of disclosure to others) and reduction to practice of an invention,\u201d and that proof of any date earlier than those alleged in his preliminary statement is competent only for the purpose of establishing \u201cthe date alleged and none other.\u201d See rule 110 of the Rules of Practice of the United States Patent Office, also Fenton R. Brydle v. Harry H. Honigbaum, 54 F.2d 147, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 773; Borm v. Champayne, decided April 10, 1939, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, \u2014, 102 F.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Counsel for appellant state in their brief that during the motion period appellant moved to dissolve the interference on the ground \u201cof non-patentability of the Drey fuss claim,\u201d and contend that the Examiner of Interferences and the Board of Appeals erred in not considering evidence introduced by appellant (which, it is stated, was not before the Primary Examiner) for the purpose of establishing the non-patentability of the subject matter of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\"> Neither the alleged motion to dissolve the interference nor the decision of the Primary Examiner with regard thereto 'are in the record; accordingly, we are not in a position to pass upon any issue claimed to have been raised by the alleged motion. It is well settled, however, that the question of the patentability of counts in an interference is not ancillary to the issue of priority, and will not be considered in an interference proceeding. Hendrick-son &amp; Nelson v. Ronning &amp; Ronning, 76 F.2d 137, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">It appears from the record that appellant\u2019s preliminary statement was filed on March 24, 1936; that his evidence in the case was submitted on September 9 and 14 to 17, inclusive, 1936; and that appel-lee\u2019s evidence was submitted on October 13 and 14 of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">It appears from a decision of the Examiner of Interferences, dated January 30, 1937, that, on January 21, 1937, approximately four months after the submission of his evidence and approximately three months after the evidence of appellee had been submitted, appellant moved to amend his preliminary statement by inserting therein that he first made drawings of the invention in March or April 1934, that he disclosed it to others in March or April 1934, that he reduced it to practice between April and July 1934, and that he commenced to exercise reasonable diligence in reducing it to practice between April and July 1934; that affidavits of appellant and his counsel were submitted in support of the motion; and that appellant was fully aware, in August 1936, and prior to the submission of any evidence in the case, of the \u201cneed for amendment\u201d of his preliminary statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">The motion to amend was denied by the Examiner of Interferences, and his decision was affirmed by the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Counsel for appellant contend here that the tribunals of the Patent Office erred in refusing to permit appellant to amend his preliminary statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">It may be said at this point that neither the motion to amend appellant\u2019s preliminary statement nor the affidavits filed in support thereof are in the record before us. Assuming, as we must, in view of the state of the record, that the Examiner of Interferences correctly stated the facts (the correctness of his statement is not challenged) in his decision on the motion to amend, the decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office denying appellant\u2019s motion to amend were clearly right. See Methudy v. Roy, 65 F.2d 171, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1142; Robins v. Wettlaufer, 81 F.2d 882, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">Relative to the question raised here by counsel for appellant as to whether ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>pellee or one of his associates conceived the involved invention disclosed and claimed in appellee\u2019s application, it is sufficient to say that such an issue cannot be raised in a proceeding of this character, and that any evidence in the record upon that subject is not pertinent to the issue of priority as between the parties to the interference. Croskey v. Atterbury, 9 App.D.C. 207; Derby et al. v. Whitworth, 62 F.2d 368, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 791; Hoza v. Colby, 97 F.2d 89, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1206; Underwood\u2019s Interference Practice, \u00a7 81, and cases cited; Rava v. Charlton, 104 F.2d 798, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents,-, decided concurrently herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The Examiner of Interferences held that the evidence submitted by appellee establishes that he conceived the invention at least as early as August 15, 1934, and that he actually reduced it to practice at least as early as January 8, 1935. Those findings, which were apparently approved by the Board of Appeals, are not challenged here by counsel for appellant, except as it is argued that some one in ap-pellee\u2019s organization other than appellee is the inventor of the subject matter claimed in his involved application.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that appellant failed to establish that he conceived the invention prior to appellee\u2019s filing date \u2014 February 27, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The evidence introduced by appellant has been fully analyzed and discussed in the decision of' the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">We have carefully examined the exhibits introduced by appellant and the testimony relative thereto, and, as we are in complete accord with the views expressed in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences with regard thereto, we deem it unnecessary to enter upon' a discussion of the evidence here. It is sufficient to say that, in our opinion, appellant has failed to establish conception of the involved invention prior to appellee\u2019s filing date (February 27, 1935) ; that the record clearly establishes that appellee was the first to conceive the invention and the first to reduce it to practice; and that, therefore, appellee is entitled to an award of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The decision of the Board of Appeals Is 'affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
