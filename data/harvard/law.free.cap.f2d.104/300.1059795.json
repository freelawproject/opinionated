Appeals in criminal cases are thus properly to be heard wherever the Court is sitting, without special order, and on no other notice than is customarily given of the setting of cases for argument. It appears from our records, of which we take notice, that Messrs. Mood and Mc-Cutcheon, attorneys who had been admitted to practice in this court, filed their appearance as counsel for appellant on December 12, 1938. At least 40 days notice of the fixing of the case for trial was sent to them. No objection was ever made by appellant or his counsel to the time or place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is true that Rule X states: \u201cSave where good cause is shown for an earlier hearing, the appellate court shall set the appeal for argument on a date not less than thirty (30) days after the filing in that court of the record on appeal and as soon after the expiration of that period as the state of the calendar of the appellate court will permit.\u201d This provision applies where the record is timely filed. Where as in this case there is no apparent effort to prepare the record and it is not in fact timely filed the Court may apply the provisions of Rule IV, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a, \u201cThe appellate court may at any time, upon five (5) days\u2019 notice, entertain a motion to dismiss the appeal.\u201d The appellant can not postpone the disposition of the appeal by delaying beyond the time allowed the preparation and filing of his record. The Court may set the matter on its docket for hearing and where there is no appearance and no motion for continuance or other relief, may dismiss the appeal. When the case was called on April 11th, in its order on our docket and there was no record filed, the time having expired April 5th, and no application for any relief about it, no brief and no counsel present, the appeal might have been forthwith dismissed for want of prosecution under our Rule 22. We withheld judgment on the motion for dismissal until April 18th directing that notice be given of it to appellant, and there still being no appearance on brief for appellant and no motion in his behalf, although the Clerk had transmitted a meagre record, we dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The motion to set aside the dismissal does not disclose a meritorious case but is based on the technical grounds above stated. We think the dismissal was not erroneous and the motion to set it aside is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
