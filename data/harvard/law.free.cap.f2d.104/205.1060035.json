I am clearly of the opinion that they are not. In each mark the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d is the name of the goods; and it seems to me that the prefixes \u201cPepso\u201d and \u201cAlka\u201d are so widely different in all respects as to render the marks in their entireties sufficiently dissimilar to insure against any reasonable probability of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Appellant challenges the statement of the commissioner that \u201cthe word \u2018Seltzer\u2019 is the name of the goods\u201d and insists that there is nothing in the record warranting this conclusion. While the commissioner may have been in error in that his statement was too broad, we are clear that the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d is descriptive of the character of the goods upon which appellant\u2019s mark is applied, and this word, standing alone, would be barred from registration under section 5 of said trademark act because descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary defines \u201cSeltzer\u201d as follows: \u201cAn effervescing alkaline mineral water, originally from Nieder Selters, a village in Prussia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">It is a matter of common knowledge that the word is used, both alone and in combination, applied to effervescing waters and preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">It is therefore our opinion that the portion of each mark consisting of the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d would furnish no indication to purchasers of the origin of the goods, and when such word is used in combination with another, non-descriptive, word or term, the latter would be the dominant part of the mark and would be relied upon to indicate origin of the goods to which the mark is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">In our decision in the case of American Brewing Co., Inc. v. Delatour Beverage Corporation, etc., 100 F.2d 253, 255, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents,-, we said: * * * It is true that the general rule is that marks should be regarded in their entirety, including disclaimed words, but we do not think it could well be argued that disclaimed descriptive words could ever constitute the dominant part of a mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">In the case of Beckwith\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U.S., 538, 546, 40 S.Ct. 414, 417, 64 L.Ed. 705, the court said: \u201c * * * a disclaimer on the part of applicant that no claim is made to the use of the words \u2018Moistair Heating System\u2019 apart from the mark as shown in the drawing and as described, would preserve to all others the right to use these words in the future to truthfully describe a like property or result of another system, provided only that they be not used in a trade-mark which so nearly resembles that of the petitioner \u2018as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers\u2019 when applied \u2018to merchandise of the same descriptive properties\u2019 section 5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">It is clear to us that anyone has the right to use the disclaimed word \u201cSeltzer\u201d in a descriptive way, if descriptive of his merchandise, and appellant may not rely upon the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d in its mark as indicating origin of its goods; and, when used in combination with the word \u201cAlka\u201d the latter would be considered by purchasers as the dominant portion of the mark indicating origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">To hold otherwise would result in appellant having practically a monopoly of the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d in a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">We hold that in appellant\u2019s mark \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d the term \u201cAlka\u201d is the dominant portion thereof, and the term \u201cPepso\u201d is the dominant portion of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">While it is true that in comparing trade-marks used upon goods of the same descriptive properties they must be considered in their entireties, it is not true that equal importance must in all cases be given to every part of a mark. To so hold could result in the destruction of valuable trademarks by adding descriptive words thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">In the case of Younghusband v. Kurlash Co., Inc., 94 F.2d 230, 231, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 886, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-19\">\u201cIt is familiar doctrine that, in determining the question of confusing similarity of marks, they must be considered as a whole, but it does not follow that portions of marks which are similar must be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>equal weight with portions of marks' which are' dissimilar. In the case of Yeasties Products, Inc., v. General Mills, Inc., 77 R 2d 523, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1215, the marks \u2018Yeasties\u2019 and \u2018Wheaties\u2019 were involved, applied to goods not identical,- but nevertheless possessing the same descriptive properties. We there said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201c \u2018It is evident from the record, and no claim is made to the contrary, that ap-pellee is not the exclusive owner of the, suffix \u201cies.\u201d Accordingly, if the word \u201cYeast,\u201d of appellant\u2019s mark, is sufficiently dissimilar with the word \u201cWheat,\u201d of ap-pellee\u2019s mark, so that, when considered as a whole, the marks are not confusingly similar, appellant is entitled to the registration pf its mark.\u2019 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We are in accord with the decisions of the' Patent Office tribunals that confusion in trade is not likely in the use by the parties hereto of their respective trade-marks..</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">App\u00e9llant, contends that the record shows that appellee, before adopting its mark, had knowledge of appellant\u2019s mark, and endeavored to hire some of appellant\u2019s employees in the manufacture of appellee\u2019s, goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The fact that appellee had prior knowledge of appellant\u2019s mark is immaterial; for appellee.had the right to use the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d to describe its goods and' to use it in combination with another term,' so long as its mark as a whole indicated origin in appellee and was not confusingly similar to the mark of appellant, and' its Use of the word \u201cSeltzer\u201d can not be held-to be evidence of a desire to profit by con-, fusion- with appellant\u2019s mark. Also, \u25a0 -the mere fact that appellee endeavored-to hire-some of appellant\u2019s employees does not evidence any improper motive of appellee in adopting its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel have brought to our attention certain decisions of district courts of the United States wherein -cer-' tain other trade-marks were held to be-confusingly similar with appellant\u2019s mark. It is sufficient to say that, in so far as they may be pertinent to the issues here involved, we have given them consideration-in arriving at our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Upon'oral argument before us the question was raised of whether th\u00e9 issue here involved had become moot by reason of the fact that in another .opposition proceeding it has been finally deter-' mined that appellee is not entitled to registration of its mark upon the application here involved. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">In the case of Pepsodent Co. v. Pepsinic Seltzer. Co., 103 F.2d 362, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents,-, we affirmed a decision of the Commissioner of Patents sustaining the opposition there involved and holding that appellee here was not entitled to register its mark upon the application here involved. Appellant was not a party to that proceeding and we do not think it may be considered here further than to say that, in affirming the decision of the commissioner upon the record before us, we do not hold that appellee\u2019s application must be allowed. This -will be a matter for ex parte consideration by the Patent Office when appel-lee\u2019s application comes before it for final action, when our decision in the case of Pepsodent Co. v. Pepsinic Seltzer Co., supra, may be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">For the reasons herein stated, the deci-' sion of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b264-16\">BLAND, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AoW\">(specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">I concur in the conclusion of the majority only because I am of the opinion that taking the trade-marks as a whole the terms ' \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d and \u201cPepso-Seltzer\u201d are not so similar that there would be likelihood of confusion by their concurrent use.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">I a,m out of harmony with the views of the majority which hold that the words \u201cAlka\u201d and \u201cPepso\u201d are the dominant portions of the respective marks and with the statement, supported by this court\u2019s' decision in American Brewing Co., Inc. v. Delatour Beverage Corporation, etc., 100 F.2d 253, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents,-, to the effect that descriptive words could never constitute the dominant portion of a mark. The dominant portion would seem to be that portion which would be most noticeable and would dominate over the other portions of the mark. It is needless to call attention here to the fact that the commerce of our country employs countless marks, the dominant portions of which are descriptive. Usually such a mark indicates origin by reason of the fact that it as a whole is not confusingly similar to other marks. We must look at the mark as a whole. It is true that in doing so we have, a right to analyze, its different features in order to 'p'roperly consider the characteristics of the mark.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
