The court remanded the case to the referee with directions to determine the amount of the claim, thus making it possible for the referee, upon such remand, to allow the full amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">The petition states, erroneously, that the proposed appeal involves less than $500. Actually, it involves $1,846.26, being the difference between the amount claimed and the amount heretofore allowed. Since it involves over $500, the proposed appeal is not allowable by this court. Bankruptcy Act, \u00a7 24, 52 Stat. 854, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-18\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
