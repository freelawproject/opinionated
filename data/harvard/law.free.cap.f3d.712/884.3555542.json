Because Davison\u2019s appellate brief fails reasonably to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28, Huntington\u2019s motion to summarily dismiss the appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Rule 28 requires an appellant\u2019s brief to contain, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca statement of the issues presented for review,\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), \u201ca statement of facts relevant to the issues submitted for review with appropriate references to the record,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(7), as well as an argument section comprised of \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201ca concise statement of the applicable standard of review,\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">\u201cAlthough we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs, such litigants must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28 in order to preserve them.\u201d <em>Clark v. Waters, </em>407 Fed.Appx. 794, 796 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cFailure to comply with the rules of this court regarding the contents of briefs can be grounds for dismissing a party\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam). Dismissal is warranted where the non-compliance is not merely \u201ctechnical or stylistic,\u201d but rather is so \u201cfundamental\u201d that it prevents the court from engaging in meaningful review. <em>Owens v. Sec\u2019y of Army, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 156, 158 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal for want of prosecution on the ground that appellant\u2019s brief \u201clacks any argument in support of the issues that it raises\u201d); <em>see also Clark v. Waters, </em>407 Fed.Appx. 794, 796 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (affirming dismissal on ground that appellant\u2019s brief \u201cis grossly non-compliant with Rule 28\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Davison\u2019s brief does not comply with Rule 28 in many crucial respects. Instead of listing the issues presented for review, he recites the federal statute giving rise to his cause of action \u2014 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 and three theories of recovery: \u201cHostile Work Environment,\u201d \u201cUnfair Labor Practices,\u201d and \u201cDenial of Proper Training.\u201d His statement of facts lists, without elaboration, four allegations: \u201cRacial graffiti on the bathroom walls was reported to supervisors,\u201d \u201cUnfair labor practiees-moving people out of seniority,\u201d \u201cDenied training in order to do a job properly,\u201d and \u201cNot posting upcoming jobs openings and promotions\u201d; and does not contain record citations. In his argument section, which does not state the standard of review, he asserts that Magistrate Judge John Roper and District Judge Halil Ozerden \u201cviolated our United States Constitutional Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>and our Civil Right due to the fact that they never gave us the chance to be heard in the State of Mississippi where some of the plaintiffs live and pay taxes\u201d and reiterates that he \u201cdeserve[s] the right to be heard by a jury.\u201d He does not specify the basis for his challenge to the district court\u2019s summary judgment. He does not argue, for example, that triable issues of fact remain; or that his claims are not barred by statutes of limitation set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). In summary, Davison\u2019s brief does not identify the nature of his challenge or its factual and legal underpinnings, and is thus materially non-compliant with Rule 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">On that basis, we GRANT Huntington\u2019s motion to dismiss summarily the appeal, and DISMISS the appeal for want of prosecution. <em>See Owens, </em>354 Fed.Appx. at 158.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. Rule 28(a)(7) is supplemented by Fifth Circuit Rule 28.2.2, which more strictly requires \u201c[e]very assertion in briefs regarding matter in the record [to] be supported by a reference to the page number of the original record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
