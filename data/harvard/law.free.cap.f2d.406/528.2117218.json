App. \u00a7 462. After having been classified as I-A and after being ordered to submit to induction he applied for a classification of I-O, Conscientious Objector, which application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-23\">A decision of the Selective Service Board as to a registrant\u2019s classification made in conformity with regulations may be overturned by the courts only if it clearly appears that there is no basis in fact for such classification. Upon careful examination of the record we cannot say that there is no basis in fact for the Board\u2019s determination. Therefore, the judgment of conviction will be affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-15\">. Estep v.
