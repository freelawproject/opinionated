Moore, not having been paid, made proper demand on Professional on May 4, 1966 for payment for labor and materials furnished. Payment was not made. This Miller Act case, 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270a et seq., against General Insurance Company of America as surety on Professional\u2019s payment bond, was filed April 20, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The primary issue on appeal, which is dispositive of the case, is whether the claim was barred by the statute of limitations in the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge overruled this defense and submitted the case to the jury, which returned a general verdict for appellee for the amount claimed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The crux of the case is a determination of when the \u201clast of the labor was performed or material was supplied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">It is undisputed that the only thing done by Moore after April 2, 1966 was to take final measurements and to make a final inspection pursuant to preparation of his final estimate or statement. This was done in the latter part of April. All other activity had ceased and all materials had been supplied as of April 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">We conclude that the limitations period began to run on April 2, 1966. Appellee had one year from that date in which to file suit. Going on the premises to make final inspections and measurements for the purpose of preparing a final estimate or statement is insufficient as a matter of law to constitute supplying labor within the meaning of 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270b(b). Such activity involves no more \u201clabor\u201d than correcting defects in prior work. Yet cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>rection of errors has been held insufficient to extend the time for filing suit. See United States ex rel; Austin v. Western Electric Co., 337 F.2d 568 (9th Cir. 1964); United States ex rel. Circle-L-Electric Co. v. Hyde Construction Co., 255 F.Supp. 335 (N.D.Okla. 1966); United States ex rel. McGregor Architectural Iron Co. v. Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp., 185 F.Supp. 381 (M.D.Pa.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Appellee\u2019s theory would defeat the purpose of the 1959 amendment to section 270b(b) and restore some of the uncertainty the amendment was designed to remove.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress, by that amendment, attempted to set a specific, easily ascertainable date on which limitations begins to run. This court previously has said that the language of section 270b (b) is unambiguous and that the court must \u201cgive effect to the plain and obvious meaning of the statute without reading in or reading out.\u201d General Electric Co. v. Southern Construction Co., 383 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir. 1967). We will not depart from that rule now.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Appellee also claimed at the trial, and submitted to the jury, that appellant was estopped from asserting limitations as a defense because: (one), by its letter dated March 28, 1967 appellant led the \u201cplaintiff to reasonably rely that the defendant would take some type of remedial action in seeing that plaintiff\u2019s claim was investigated and at a further date would advise him of what course of action the defendant planned to follow in connection with this claim;\u201d (two), that appellee\u2019s attorney negotiated with the attorney for appellant about the joinder of General Insurance in a state .court action but those negotiations failed and this action was instituted forthwith; (three), that a statement made in a letter from appellant\u2019s attorney to General Insurance about when the limitations period expired caused appellee to rely on that date as the date to file suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">All of these matters are insufficient as a matter of law to create estoppel, under the circumstances of this case. The letter of March 28,1967 is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It contained no representations or promises which might reasonably be expected to induce reliance by Moore or his attorneys to its detriment, nor was there any deception. McWaters &amp; Bartlett v. United States, 272 F.2d 291 (10th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">As for the other two bases of appellee\u2019s claim of estoppel, it need only be pointed out that the record shows conclusively that at the time of the al-leged negotiations and the letter to General Insurance the attorney that appellee asserts was appellant\u2019s counsel was at that time counsel for Professional Constructors only. It was not until a later date that he undertook representation of General Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">The district court is reversed with directions' to enter judgment for appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">. 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270b:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\u201c(b) Every suit instituted under this section shall be brought in the name of the United States for the use of the person suing * * *, but no such suit shall be commenced after the expiration of one year after the day on which the last labor was performed or material was supplied by him. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\">. The trial judge charged the jury that before returning, a verdict for either party they must determine the last day upon which labor or material was furnished. They were instructed that if the last day was prior to April 20 the verdict must be for the defendant; if after, they should find for the plaintiff. The judge also charged that even if they found the work was completed prior to April 20, they still could find for plaintiff if they also found that defendant was estopped from asserting the limitations defense. Since the jury returned a general verdict, we do not know which theory was the basis of the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\">. The undisputed evidence shows that the last of fifty-five payroll statements which Moore submitted to Professional was for the period of March 31, 1966 to April 2, 1966. The only work done after that date was characterized by Mr. Moore as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">\u201cQ. Mr. Moore, what was the last work that you did on the project location itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">A. That was final clean-up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">Q. And when was this done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-18\">A. The last day of April and part of the first day of May. I wouldn\u2019t be positive of the two days, but it was in the latter part of April or the first of May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">Q. Did you do anything else on the project at that particular time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-20\">A. Made all my final inspection and final measurements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-21\">Q. Now, measurements of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-22\">A. Field measurements of work performed, such as so many lineal feet of curb and gutter, so many square feet of sidewalks, so many square feet of asphalt pavement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-23\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-24\">Q. * * * what work, then, did you \u2022 \u2014 did your firm do, sir, after, April 2, 1966?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-26\">A. Along the latter part of April my son and I went down and made all final inspections and final measurements on the project, computing, it to make a \u2014 to make a final estimate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-27\">Q. Final inspections \u2014 final measurements ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-28\">A. To see if there was any cleaning up or anything to do to the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-29\">Q. Did you do any cleaning up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-30\">A. As well as I remember, there wasn\u2019t anything to do.\u201d (Excerpts from Direct and Cross Examination.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">. The amendment substituted \u201cday on which the last of the labor was performed' or material was supplied by him\u201d for \u201cdate of final settlement of such contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">.
