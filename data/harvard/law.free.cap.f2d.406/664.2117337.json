Appellant submitted an application to operate a station on the frequency of 850 kHz.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> out of Pharr, Texas. It is conceded that before the application could be accepted for consideration at a comparative hearing with other mutually exclusive applications, it was necessary to establish that the operations would not conflict with the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s \u201cclear channel policy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Appellant does not contend that its application met all the requirements of Commission Rule 1.569 <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>which sets forth the criteria for clearance in regard to the \u201cclear channel policy.\u201d With respect to one \u201cclear channel\u201d frequency, 830 kHz., appellant requested a waiver of the Commission Rule, claiming that its proposals would have \u201cno special impact upon that channel [830 kHz.].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s application then demonstrated how it would be possible to set up a Class II-A station on 830 kHz. at Encino, Texas, without interference from appellant\u2019s Pharr operations. The fact is, however, that appellant was seeking a waiver and was under a duty to allege and substantiate a negative contention: that there is no feasible site for a possible Class II-A station within the range of interference from appellant\u2019s proposed station.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission need not grant a waiver of its Rules unless an application therefor sets out \u201cadequate reasons why the Rules should be waived * * United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 205, 76 S.Ct. 763, 771, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956). Appellant\u2019s statement \u2014 that its operations would have \u201cno special impact\u201d \u2014 does not suffice to justify waiver. When an applicant seeks a waiver of a rule, it must plead with particularity the facts and circumstances which warrant such action. The Commission staff must process annually thousands of applications. It cannot be expected to do research for applicants or to probe the underlying engineering or economic data to see whether they will support a greater claim than that made by experts or counsel. If the Commission staff were required to assume such a burden, little or nothing would be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">2. On July 18,1968, subsequent to the filing of briefs in this court, the Commission issued a release imposing a \u201cfreeze\u201d on the filing of additional proposals for radio stations, pending a rule-making inquiry into the desirability of licensing any more AM stations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This freeze raises questions about the merits of the present \u201cclear channel\u201d policy. If the Commission expects to cease licensing new stations, pending applications post no obstacle to the licensing of future Class II-A stations. Since the Commission has pending several mutually exclusive applications for the frequency sought by appellant, the incremental administrative burden of including appellant in any hearings is relatively modest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The importance of including all eligible applicants at comparative hearings cannot be overstated,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we presume that the Commission would be interested in providing a hearing, if that is possible consonant with its rules, to an applicant like appellant, representative of a group involved in missionary and charitable activities along the Mexican border.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">Of course, there are matters properly raised before the Commission. Our discussion will clarify, however, that our ruling is in no way intended to preclude consideration of these issues by the Commission which has before it, according to information at argument, a second petition for rehearing filed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-11\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-12\">. The term \u201ckilohertz\u201d (kHz) means exactly the same thing as \u201ckilocycles.\u201d Heinrich Hertz, a German scientist, was the discoverer of electromagnetic radiation (radio waves), and his name has been nsed for many years in foreign countries as the unit of frequency. One cycle per second is called one \u201chertz.\u201d A movement was started to introduce \u201chertz\u201d terminology into the United States, and has been virtually 100% successful. The Commission has amended its rules to make the use of the term official.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-14\">. The Commission policy on the \u201cclear channel freeze\u201d is set forth in 21 P. &amp; F.Radio Reg. 1801 (1961). In essence it amounts to a policy of holding open certain frequencies so that high-powered stations, denominated Class II-A station can be established some time in the future. When an applicant seeks to utilize a frequency which is adjacent to a \u201cclear channel,\u201d it must demonstrate that its operations will comply with certain criteria set forth in Commission Rule 1.569, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.569. A nonconforming application is customarily rejected as contrary to the \u201cclear channel\u201d policy, unless the applicant demonstrates reasons for waiving the Rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-4\">. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 ,1.569 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-5\">. Appellant\u2019s application also asserts that its operations will have \u201cno material effect upon the future use of 830 kHz.\u201d This language also lacks the specificity required for requesting a waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">. A mere allegation that a \u201cclear channel\u201d could be erected at Encino does not demonstrate that appellant\u2019s station will not interfere with a station installed elsewhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b730-14\">. 33 Fed.Reg. 10343 (July 19, 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b730-15\">. The addition of a party may mean some added burden, but not one comparable to the burden involved in holding a broadcast hearing not otherwise scheduled. Once a hearing is planned, the Commission will have already made arrangements for a trial examiner and have assigned staff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b730-16\">.
