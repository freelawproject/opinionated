BROWN, Chief Judge, and THORNBERRY and MORGAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1124-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1124-23\">In this appeal from the judgment of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence as per Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, by letter to the Clerk he has requested that the appeal be dismissed without prejudice. This we decline to do as the case obviously has no merit and should be disposed of without further briefs or argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-24\">Appellant was convicted of possession of an unregistered distillery [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5179], operating a distillery without posting bond [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601 (a) (4)], and unlawful production of mash [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5222(a) (1)]. He is attacking only his conviction under \u00a7 5179, attempting to bring himself within the rule of Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>(1968); and Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968). In Brown v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 401 F.2d 769, and Anderson v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 206, this Court discussed this same issue, holding in these cases that the registration and tax statutes governing distilleries and distilled spirits do not impose the danger of self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">We are bound by and in full accord with these holdings. The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
