The Board\u2019s decision and order, issued May 2, 1967, are reported in 164 NLRB No. 46. On October 11, 1965, the Board found that the Rogers Mfg. Co., respondent, of Akron, Ohio, had discharged employee Sarah LaRue in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (a) (3) on February 4, 1965; it ordered the respondent to offer her reinstatement and to make her whole for any loss of pay caused by its discrimination (155 NLRB 117). On June 2,1965, this Court enforced the Board\u2019s order pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint motion for entry of a consent decree. The parties were unable to agree on the amount of backpay due LaRue. Backpay proceedings (NLRB Rules and Regs. 29 C.F.R. 102.52 et seq.) were thereupon initiated and concluded. Under the Board\u2019s conclusions and supplemental order the backpay period began February 4, 1965, and ended April 7, 1966. The amount of backpay as determined by the Board \u2014 $4,085.39, included $34.79 (reflecting an underpayment during a period of reinstatement running from December 16, 1965, when LaRue returned to respondent\u2019s employ) and included $204.78 (vacation pay) and reflected a mitigation item of $40.00 (interim earnings) which were removed from controversy either on brief or in argument. The controversy is with respect to that part of the Board\u2019s order which ordered payment for the period from April 6, 1965 (the date the Union [bargaining representative for respondent\u2019s employees, International Chemical Workers Union, AFL-CIO] called a strike) to December 16, 1965 (the date the respondent recalled LaRue to work). The Board\u2019s supplemental order did not include interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Basically, the question presented is the validity of the inclusion in a supplemental backpay period of the time during which an employee (who is also a union official, previously discharged via an unfair labor practice) walks a picket line in an economic strike, called subsequent to the discharge, and the time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">The question is posed by these facts. LaRue was continuously in the employ of respondent from September, 1946, until her discharge in February of 1965 \u2014 19 years \u2014 longer than any other female employee. From the time the union began organizing respondent\u2019s employees, La-Rue became an active union \u201cprotagonist.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was a \u201czealous and aggressive Union advocate * * * an ardent Union Supporter.\u201d (155 NLRB No. 17.)1 The union won a Board-conducted election and was certified on December 18, 1964, as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. LaRue was elected as a union trustee. She became a member of the union\u2019s negotiating committee and attended three bargaining sessions prior to her discharge. She continued to be active on the negotiating committee after her unlawful discharge on February 2, 1965, and attended all the bargaining sessions she was notified about; probably all. She considered herself an \u201cofficer of the union.\u201d On February 8, 1965, the union filed with the Board a charge regarding her discharge, which resulted in the Board\u2019s order of October 11, 1965, and this Court\u2019s consent order of June 2, 1966. On April 6, 1965, the union called a strike and maintained a picket line at the plant for about three months. During the strike, negotiations continued for some few months at least and Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>LaRue continued to sit on the committee. In July a Summit County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court injunction issued limiting the pickets; the injunction was violated ; contempt proceedings followed (not involving Mrs. LaRue as far as the record before us indicates) and, also in July, the State Court \u201cremoved all the pickets.\u201d During the three months\u2019 picketing period (April \u2014 July, 1965) LaRue walked the picket line \u201cevery other day.\u201d The strike has never been formally terminated by the union, so that the \u201ccall\u201d remained in effect during the entire period in question (April \u2014 December, 1965) and LaRue was a union member and trustee during that time. On December 16,1965, shortly after the Board\u2019s basic order issued, respondent recalled LaRue and she promptly answered the call. It was the first recall by respondent and, at no time prior thereto, had La-Rue applied for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">The basic substantive and procedural (burden of proof) principles applicable to backpay upon reemployment, subsequent to an unfair labor practice discharge, have been stated by this Court in a series of decisions, beginning with N. L. R. B. v. Cambria Clay Products Co., 215 F.2d 48 (1954), and recently including N. L. R. B. v. Interurban Gas Co., 354 F.2d 76 (1965) ; N. L. R. B. v. Reynolds, 399 F.2d 668 (1968); and N. L. R. B. v. Robert Haws Co., 403 F.2d 979 (1968). The references render repetition unnecessary. In a sentence, in this context, \u201cthe employer has the burden of proving facts that show no liability or that mitigate the extent of the damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">The Board\u2019s conclusion that the burden had not been met by respondent was based, not on the usual finding of fact (for all practical purposes binding on this Court, N. L. R. B. v. Interurban Gas Co., supra, 354 F.2d at 78), but on a conclusion of law. That is apparent in the Trial Examiner\u2019s decision (\u201cadopted\u201d by the Board)\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-8\"><em>\u201cLaRue\u2019s activities as union officer </em>and in contract negotiations, both before and <em>after </em>her discharge, are <em>irrelevant </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the issue here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">Beginning with Spitzer Motor Sales, 102 N.L.R.B. 437 (1953) and continuing through Merchandiser Press, 115 N.L.R.B. 1441 (1956), East Texas Steel Castings Co., 116 N.L.R.B. 1336 (1956), and to its decision in this proceeding, the Board has consistently held \u2014 in cases involving employees wrongfully discharged <em>before </em>an economic strike is called\u2014 that the strike duration (during which time perhaps there would have been replacement of economic strikers or job discontinuances because of operation reduction, or perhaps the employee involved might have gone out and stayed out on strike) ante recall is includible in the backpay award period because\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-10\">\u201c * * * the respondent\u2019s contention, which is based on conjecture and speculation, is unsound, * * * as the employer\u2019s own discrimination against the claimant has made it impossible to ascertain whether they would have gone out on strike in the absence of such discrimination, the uncertainty must be resolved against the employer.\u201d <em>East Texas, </em>supra, at 1339-40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">A careful examination of the Board cases, previous to this one, and of the related decisions, N. L. R. B. v. East Texas Steel Castings Co., 211 F.2d 813, at 816 (5th, 1954); 255 F.2d 284 (5th, 1958-same case, on review of backpay order <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) makes this clear \u2014 the extent of the \u201cpro-union or anti-employer\u201d activity of the employees involved began and ended with \u201cjoining the union.\u201d None of the employees involved in those cases would qualify for the adjectival attributions of the Board to LaRue noted above (\u201cprotagonist,\u201d etc.). None was a union \u201cof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>ficer\u201d \u2014 or \u201ctrustee\u201d \u2014 or \u201cbargaining team member\u201d \u2014 or \u201cpicket.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\"> True it be that \u201cthe particular means by which the effects of unfair labor practices are to be expunged are matters \u2018for the Board, not the courts, to determine,\u2019 \u201d Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 319 U.S. 533, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1942), and \u201cthat administrative determination * * * should stand unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act,\u201d Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, at 540, 63 S.Ct. at 1218 (N. L. R. B. v. Interurban Gas Co., supra, 354 F.2d at 78); but, also true it be that \u201cIt (the Board) must have regard for considerations governing the mitigation of damages.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, at 346, 72 S.Ct. 287, at 289, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Axiomatically, the determination of relevancy is a matter of law and not of fact. We hold simply that the pro-union activity of an unlawfully discharged employee during a subsequently called economic strike is relevant to the determination of the appropriate back-pay period, i. e., is a \u201cconsideration\u201d to which \u201cregard * * * must\u201d be given. Whether the Trial Examiner, giving consideration to rejected (excluded) relevant</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">evidence would have factually found differently, and/or whether the Board would have \u201cadopted\u201d any such different factual conclusions are'not for this Court. \u201cFact finding\u201d - is the province of \u201cthe Board\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e)) and a Court may not venture into that area \u2014 either initially or via substitution. The mandate of a statute is not \u201clogomachy\u201d \u2014 to follow the mandate is not to \u201center into a bog,\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., supra, at 348, 73 S.Ct. 287. N. L. R. B. v. United Insurance Co., 390 U.S. 254, 88 S.Ct. 988, 19 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1968), is not unheeded. There is not before us a <em>determination </em>\u2014\u201cinvolving no special administrative expertise\u201d that a court does not possess, \u201cresulting\u201d in the \u201cBoard\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views\u201d which should not be \u201cdisplaced\u201d by a court\u2014 there is before us a conclusion made without giving consideration to \u201ctwo fairly conflicting views.\u201d Cf. General Electric Co. v. N. L. R. B., 400 F.2d 713 (5th, 1968). \u201cNevertheless, we must not condone an erroneous conception of the balance, especially when the conflicting interests may not have been explored by the Board. * <em>* * </em>\u201d It is, in this context too, the \u201cprimary responsibility of the Board and not of the courts \u2018to strike the proper balance between the asserted business justifications <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6and the invasion of employees\u2019 rights in the light of the Act and its policy.\u2019 \u201d N. L. R. B. v. Fleetwood Trailer Co., 389 U.S. 375, 88 S.Ct. 543, 19 L.Ed.2d 614 (1967).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>The Board\u2019s Backpay Order is enforced in respect of the vacation pay item, is enforced for the period from the wrongful discharge (February 4, 1965) to LaRue\u2019s commencement of picketing (April 6, 1965),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is otherwise denied enforcement and this cause is remanded for any further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1172-15\">.

Respondent also urges in mitigation that, during the strike, it was illegal for respondent to ask LaRue to return to work. The claim is that soliciting a striker to return is in derogation of the union\u2019s status as exclusive bargaining agent, constituting an unfair labor practice under Sec. 8(a) (1) of the Act. See Texas Gas Co., 136 NLRB No. 38; 143 NLRB No. 95; and particularly N.L.R.B. v. Acme Air Appliance Co., 117 F.2d 417 (2nd, 1941-Judge Hand (A.N.)) at 420 \u2014 \u201cTo permit the employer to go behind the chosen bargaining agent and negotiate with the employees individually * * * in spite of the fact that they had not revoked the agent\u2019s authority, would result in nothing but disarrangement of the mechanism for negotiation created by the Act, disparagement of the services of the union * * * which it is the avowed purpose of the Act to avoid or mitigate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">However, the respondent could easily put the question at rest by a reemployment offer \u2014 however vain \u2022\u2014 <em>through </em>the union.
