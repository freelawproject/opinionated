App. section 462 in that he wil-fully failed to comply with an order of his local board to submit to induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">Appellant filed his original Selective Service Form 100 on June 5, 1959, indicating therein that he was then working 40 hours per week as a cabinet maker and claiming that he was a minister of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses denomination and was formally ordained on August 20, 1955 (the date of his baptism). On July 18, 1959, he filed a Form 150 (Special Form For Conscientious Objector) in which he claimed exemption from both combatant and noncombatant training and service in the armed forces. Attached to this form were several sheets containing an explanation of his views.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Having been classified 1-A by his local board and failing to convince the board at a personal appearance that he should be given a different classification, Chaney appealed his classification to the Appeal Board for the Southern District of Georgia. The case was referred to the Justice Department for its recommendation. A special hearing officer of the Justice Department held a hearing after which he recommended to the Department that Chaney\u2019s 1-A classification be continued. However, in spite of the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation, the Conscientious Objector Section of the Department of Justice, which had the benefit of an F.B.I. report on appellant, recommended that he be placed in class 1-A-O (conscientious objector available for noncombatant military training and service only). The reason for the refusal to recommend a 1-0 classification was that it seemed to the Conscientious Objector Section of the Department of Justice that Chaney\u2019s primary objection to military service was that it would interfere with his ministry, and that according to Leifer v. United States, 260 F.2d 648 (6th Cir. 1958) and Tomlinson v. United States, 216 F.2d 12 (9th Cir. 1954), this reason is not a ground of objection to noncombatant service. Accordingly, the Appeal Board classified him 1-A-O by a vote of 4 to 0, and on August 29, 1960, a Form 110 notifying Chaney of such classification was mailed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The local board sent appellant current questionnaire forms (Form 127) on February 19, 1963, May 22, 1964, May 7, 1965, August 9, 1965, and February 18, 1966, and each was returned reporting no change in status except from single to married.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">By written appointment dated March 31, 1966, in New York, appellant was appointed to serve as a Vacation Pioneer Minister between the dates of April 1 and July 31, 1966. Also, by written appointment dated April 15, 1966, in New York, Chaney was appointed to serve as a Book Study Conductor in his local congregation. He testified that he received notice of the latter appointment about April 20, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">On April 22, 1966, appellant\u2019s local board mailed him an Order to Report for Induction (Form 252) scheduling him for induction on May 5, 1966. By letter of April 26, 1966, appellant submitted proof of his two appointments, outlined his duties and requested a stay of the induction order and a reconsideration of his classification. He asserted therein that in his capacity as a Vacation Pioneer Minister he was serving at least 25 hours per week in house-to-house ministry and was attending five 1-hour Bible instructional meetings at his church, and that in his capacity as a Book Study Conductor, he presided over Bible study sessions and oversaw the house-to-house ministry of those assigned to his Bible study group. Adding up the time spent, Chaney noted that he was spending \u201cwell over 40 hours per week\u201d in ministerial activities. Appellant also mailed letters to both the State and the National Directors of the Selective Service System advising them of his alleged change of status and requesting an order staying his induction and directing the local board to reopen and consider his classification anew pursuant to 32 C.F.R. section 1625.3. The petitions to the State and National Directors were both denied. Appellant was never expressly notified by the local board as to what ruling it had made on his request for a reopening as is required by 32 C.F.R. section 1625.4, and he complied with the April 29th instructions of his local board regarding transportation to the induction center where he refused to take the symbolic step forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Prior to the trial, appellant caused a subpoena duces tecum to be issued and served upon John J. Hennessy, the special hearing officer who conducted the hearing for the Department of Justice during Chaney\u2019s 1960 administrative appeal, requiring Hennessy to be at the trial (so that appellant could inquire into his bias or hostility and into his conduct of the hearing) and to bring with him all records, notes and reports relating to the hearing. On the authority of Gon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>zales v. United States, 364 U.S. 59, 80 S. Ct. 1554, 4 L.Ed.2d 1569 (1960), the trial court granted the government\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena. At the trial the government called as witnesses the clerk of Local Board No. 35, the commanding officer of the Armed Forces Examination and Entrance Station at Jacksonville, Florida, and a former member of the armed forces who was stationed at the Jacksonville induction center at the time of appellant\u2019s processing. The government also introduced into evidence appellant\u2019s Selective Service file. Appellant testified as his only witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The appellant\u2019s motions for acquittal were denied. After an adverse jury verdict, appellant received a 5-year sentence and brings this appeal complaining that: (1) the failure of the local board to consider the petition for reopening of classification in April of 1966 was error; (2) quashing the subpoena duces tecum requiring the Justice Department special hearing officer to appear at the trial was error; (3) appellant\u2019s 1-A-O classification was without basis in fact, and (4) appellant\u2019s classification and conviction resulted from a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Failure to Consider Request for Reopening</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Since the local board had mailed to appellant an Order to Report for Induction prior to his requesting a reopening of his classification, the following regulation applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">\u201c\u00a7 1625.2 When registrant\u2019s classification may be reopened and considered anew</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">\u201cThe local board may reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant (s) upon the written request of the registrant * * * if such request is accompanied by written information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified, which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification; or (b) upon its own motion if such action is based upon facts not considered when the registrant was classified which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification; provided, <em>in either event, the classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Order to Report for Induction </em>(SSS Form No. 252) * * * <em>unless the local board first specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">In an attempt to bring his case under the rule of Olvera v. United States, 223 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1955), appellant complains that the local board never considered his request to reopen his classification because the board members were under the mistaken impression that they had no authority to do so after the registrant had been mailed an Order to Report for Induction. In support of his contention, appellant relies upon the following testimony of the clerk of the local board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-13\">\u201cQ. And wasn\u2019t that letter a petition by him for reopening of his classification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-14\">A. After his orders for induction were mailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-15\">Q. Yes, Ma\u2019am. And isn\u2019t there a procedure for reopening an individual\u2019s induction after his order has been entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-16\">A. We can\u2019t do it. We have no method whatsoever but we can order without our State Director giving us permission to reopen a case once that order for induction is mailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avm\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-17\">Q. Your board then, as a matter of fact, does not reopen an individual\u2019s classification after his notice for induction has been mailed to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-18\">A. That\u2019s correct.\u201d (Record at 165-66).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-20\">\u201cQ. Will you state when a classification is reopened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-21\">A. A classification is reopened when sufficient evidence is received that is justifiable and if it\u2019s in the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>length of time that he has for his appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">Q. Must a classification be reopened after an order for an induction is mailed to the registrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">A. A classification cannot be reopened by a local board after his order for induction is mailed.\u201d (Record at 177).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">32 C.F.R. section 1625.2 provides that even after an Order to Report for Induction has been mailed, the board may reopen the registrant\u2019s classification if it \u201cfirst specifically finds there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d This regulation imposes a duty on the local board to consider<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a post-induction-order request for a reopening. See <em>Olvera, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Appellant is faced with the task of overcoming the presumption of regularity that attaches to administrative proceedings by showing that the local board did not in fact comply with the regulation by considering his request for a reopening. We hold that the testimony of the clerk of the registrant\u2019s local board is not sufficient to rebut this presumption of regularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The clerk\u2019s testimony is <em>some </em>evidence that the local board rejected Chaney\u2019s request in the light of an erroneous impression of the law. However, the presumption that public officers discharged their duties according to law is such a strong presumption that it is overcome only by <em>clear and convincing </em>evidence. NLRB v. Bibb Manufacturing Company, 188 F.2d 825 (5th Cir. 1951); Barnes v. City of Gadsden, 174 F.Supp. 64 (N.D.Ala.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">The clerk\u2019s testimony is not clear and convincing evidence that the board disregarded Chaney\u2019s request for a reopening because of the erroneous impression of the board members that they had no authority to reopen. The clerk\u2019s answers to questions give a strong impression that she was basing her testimony on what she thought the law is and not on what the board thought the law is or what the board actually did in this particular case. She never testified either that Chaney\u2019s request was never considered or that the board members thought that they had no authority to reopen his classification. Even her testimony that the board does not reopen classifications after the mailing of an induction notice is not a clear statement of the board\u2019s attitude toward requests for reopenings because it could very well reflect a combination of two factors: (1) the clerk\u2019s recollection that such requests have in the past been denied, and (2) her version of the law applicable to such requests. In the face of her recollection that classifications had not been reopened in the past, this clerk, who thought that the board had no authority to reopen classifications, would understandably testify that the board does not reopen classifications after the mailing of an induction notice. Conspicuously absent from the clerk\u2019s testimony is a statement that she knows of her own knowledge that the local board never <em>considers </em>granting post-induction-order requests for reopenings <em>because the board members do not think </em>that they have any authority under any circumstances to do so without authorization from the State or National Director. There thus exists such a degree of doubt concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>basis of the clerk\u2019s testimony as is sufficient to prevent such testimony from rising to the status of <em>clear and convincing </em>evidence. The presumption of regularity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> must stand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The Quashing of the Subpoena Duces Tecum</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The trial judge was clearly correct in granting the government\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum that directed the special hearing officer of the Justice Department to be at the trial to testify and to produce his records and notes of the hearing. Gonzales v. United States, 364 U.S. 59, 80 S.Ct. 1554, 4 L.Ed.2d 1569 (1960) is directly against appellant as to the written matter sought by the subpoena, and the reasoning of that case is likewise applicable to that portion of the subpoena requiring the hearing officer himself to be available to give testimony. In addition, as was the case in <em>Gonzales, </em>supra, appellant does not charge that any specific evidence was withheld, nor does he give any indication of what he would expect to be brought to light through the report and testimony of the hearing officer. In his brief he merely says <em>\u201cIt is possible to envision </em>many extremely relevant things which might plausibly have been brought out by appellant had the instant subpoena not been quashed.\u201d (emphasis added). He then goes on to suggest some of the things that might have been discovered. It is plain, however, that he has nothing specific in mind. There is no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Basis in Fact for Denial of 1-0 Classification</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\"> In reviewing the action of the appeal board in classifying Chaney 1-A-0 instead of 1-0, the scope of judicial review is limited to an inquiry into whether there is a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the classification. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946). The trial court found that a basis in fact exists to support the appeal board\u2019s 1-A-O classification. Such a basis in fact is provided in the following portion of the recommendation of the Department of Justice which refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>testimony of appellant before the special hearing officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">\u201cThe hearing officer suggested to the registrant that the registrant had but one objective and that is not to go into the Army. The registrant replied: \u2018That is not the objective. The objective is preaching and going into the Army would interfere with my ministry. So therefore I object \u2014 it would be wrong according to God\u2019s law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEM\">This testimony is sufficient authorization for the appeal board\u2019s conclusion that Chaney\u2019s real objection to military service is that it would interfere with his ministry. This conclusion is entitled to stand even if it could be said that it is erroneous. <em>Estep, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Since the objection that military service would interfere with the registrant\u2019s ministry is not a recognized objection to military service, Leifer v. United States, 260 F.2d 648 (6th Cir. 1958); Simon v. United States, 218 F.2d 127 (9th Cir. 1954), rev\u2019d. on other grounds, 348 U.S. 967, 75 S.Ct. 531, 99 L.Ed. 753 (1955); Tomlinson v. United States, 216 F.2d 12 (9th Cir. 1954), the appeal board was justified in classifying appellant 1-A-0 thereby recognizing his claim of being a conscientious objector to combat but allowing him to be inducted into the armed forces for the performance of noncombatant duties only. See 32 C.F.R. section 1622.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In the Brief of Appellant, the due process claim is thus made more specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">\u201c1. Due process of law was violated by the procedure governing appellant\u2019s appearance before his local board. Appellant complains particularly about the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">\u201ca. The prohibition against his being represented by counsel. 32 C.F.R. 1624.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-11\">\u201cb. The prohibition against his presenting supporting witnesses, except as allowed by the board in its discretion. 32 C.F.R. 1624.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-12\">\u201cc. The unlimited right of the board to restrict the time and form of the registrant\u2019s appearance. 32 C.F.R. 1624.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-13\">\u201cAppellant says that the critical importance of the appearance and the finality of the administrative classification, as combined with the attendant criminal enforcement penalties, make such curtailment of a registrant\u2019s rights violative of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-14\">\u201c2. Due process of law was violated by the procedures governing appellant\u2019s administrative appeal. Appellant complains particularly about the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-15\">\u201ca. The denial of an opportunity for the appellant to appear, either personally or by counsel, before the appeal board. 32 C.F.R. 1626.24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-16\">\u201cb. The consideration given to the F.B.I. report composed of hearsay evidence from unidentified informants (submitted with the Justice Department recommendation). 32 C.F.R. 1626.24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-17\">\u201c3. Appellant\u2019s right to trial by jury was abridged by the refusal of the trial court to submit to the jury disputed issues of fact underlying the administrative handling of appellant\u2019s case. See Tamblyn v. United States, 216 F.2d 345 (5th Cir. 1954).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Appellant\u2019s first two objections, denial of the right to have counsel and to present supporting witnesses, are answered by the following passage from Merritt v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 401 F.2d 768 [October 15, 1968] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-19\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s further assertion that his constitutional rights have been violated because of .the absence of provisions in the Selective Service Act and the Regulations for representation by counsel before the local board for compulsory process, and for the confrontation of witnesses against him, is without merit: <em>The procedure under the draft law and classification by a local board is in no way penal, nor is it a criminal trial with the right to be represented by counsel, and to call, ex</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>amine and cross-examine witnesses. </em>United States v. Capson, 10 Cir. 1965, 347 F.2d 959, 962; Imboden v. United States, 6 Cir. 1952, 194 F.2d 508; 513, cert. denied, 343 U.S. 957, 72 S.Ct. 1052, 96 L.Ed. 1357.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">In claiming that due process was denied to appellant by \u201cThe unlimited right of the local board to restrict the time and form of the registrant\u2019s appearance\u201d appellant cites 32 C.F.R. section 1624.1 but clearly also has in mind section 1624.2, which gives the board members discretion to \u201cimpose such limitations upon the time which the registrant may' have for his appearance as they deem necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Appellant has not made it to appear that the board abused its discretion so as to deny him a fair hearing, and we find no constitutional defect on the face of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\u2022We have carefully considered all of the remaining specific due process objections and likewise find them all to lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\">. The act of <em>considering the request for a reopening </em>should not be confused with the more significant act of <em>reopening and considering anew the registrant\u2019s classification. </em>The latter act would by virtue of 32 C.F.R. section 1625.14 result in the cancellation of an order to report for induction or for civilian work and would by virtue of section 1625.13 bring about \u201cthe same right of appearance before the local board and the same right of appeal as in the case of an original classification.\u201d The mere consideration of a request for a reopening has no such effect and would not interfere with the induction process unless the local board, after considering the registrant\u2019s request for a reopening, did in fact decide to \u201creopen and consider anew\u201d the registrant\u2019s classification within the meaning of section 1625.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">. This presumption that the board did consider this request is strengthened by the fact that on April 29, 1966 it received a copy of the letter from the State Director to the registrant stating that \u201cit is the opinion of this office that the information submitted by you is insufficient to justify reopening of your classification,\u201d and it also received a copy of letter from the National Director dated May 4, 1966 advising him that the information submitted had been carefully considered and that there was found insufficient basis for taking any action in his behalf at that time. While it would have been more regular if the Board had advised registrant by letter that the information submitted did not warrant a reopening of his classification and had placed a copy of the letter in the file the failure to do so did not under the facts of this case invalidate the induction order. The Board\u2019s finding may be \u201covert or implicit.\u201d Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 396, 74 S.Ct. 152, 157, 98 L.Ed. 132, 138 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">'. The question whether Chaney\u2019s request for a reopening set forth facts making out a prima facie ease of a change in status resulting from circumstances over which he had no control is not raised by appellant\u2019s first assignment of error since that assignment complains of the board\u2019s failure to consider the request rather than the board\u2019s making an erroneous decision not to reopen after giving due consideration to the request. Even so, it should be pointed out that the request for a reopening did not make out a prima facie case for a 4-D classification. McCoy v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 403 F.2d 896 [November 12, 1968]. Furthermore, the fact that Chaney became a Vacation Pioneer Minister and a Book Study Conductor as a result of advancement in his sect through personal endeavor and the fact that these appointments were not in any real sense <em>forced </em>upon him by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society provide an ample basis in fact for the local board\u2019s refusal to find that (aside from whether or not the appointments effected a change in status) the new appointments were the result of circumstances over which Chaney had no control. See United States v. Rup-pell, 278 F.Supp. 287 (E.D.N.Y.1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
