(Pacific), brought this civil action to compel Appellee, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s Fund), to honor an alleged contractual obligation to indemnify Pacific against loss by reason of liability imposed upon it by law for damages. The contract in question is Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company Policy No. LS-1214 effective June 1, 1964. The particular accident was suffered by a longshoreman, Friedolf Hum-pla, while directly employed by Pacific aboard one of its barges in the Port of Portland, Oregon, on September 27, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">Humpla subsequently brought suit against Appellant in reliance upon the case of Reed v. S/S YAKA, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963). The defense of that suit was tendered to Fireman\u2019s Fund and was rejected. Thereafter, Pacific settled the Humpla suit for $35,343.85. . Of this amount, $30,000 was paid by Pacific and the remainder was contributed by Fireman\u2019s Fund through waiver of its statutory lien under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for medical expenses and compensation paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">The basis of this suit is the policy of insurance identified above. The coverage upon which Appellant relies is set forth in paragraph One (b), stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-15\">\u201cTo indemnify this employer against loss by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law for damages on account of such injuries to such of said employees as are legally employed wherever such injuries may be sustained within the territorial limits of the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJLL\">Appellee has denied coverage for this loss suffered by Appellant, maintaining that Endorsement No. 2 restricted policy coverage only to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Both Appellant and Appellee, believing that this was solely a question of construction, filed motions for summary judgment. Both motions were heard by the court below which thereafter entered its summary judgment on July 31, 1967, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-16\">\u201c * * * and the Court having found that there is no dispute of material facts concerning the insurance contract and endorsements thereto issued by Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company as Policy No. LS-1214, and concluding that the language of said contract, as endorsed, did not cover the liability of the plaintiff assured in a lawsuit brought under the authority of Reed v. The Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-18\">The judgment concludes by dismissing Appellant\u2019s complaint and awarding the Appellee judgment on its counterclaim in the amount of $5,343.85 expended by it under waiver of its statutory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-19\">The jurisdiction of the District Court was predicated upon diversity of citizen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>ship and the amount in controversy. We have jurisdiction on appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">Inasmuch as we find the insurance contract to foe clear and unambiguous, there is no need to apply the principles established by the Washington cases cited by Appellant governing the interpretation of obscure, indefinite, uncertain or ambiguous insurance contracts. The language of the policy should be given the usual, popular and ordinary meaning. Safeco Insurance Company of America v. McManemy, 72 Wash.Dec.2d 212, 432 P.2d 537; Town of Tieton v. General Insurance Co. of America, 61 Wash.2d 716, 380 P.2d 127.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-15\">The pertinent portions of this policy are quoted on the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>ment No. 2 explicitly and unambiguously restricts the coverage of the policy to liability defined by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Appellant argues that if we accept this at face value, the coverage of Clause No. 1-B of the policy becomes illusory and that there is no possible liability at law for damages for which the employer might require indemnification. The further provision of Endorsement No. 2 saving the coverage of Clause No. 1-B \u201cif said Federal Longshoremen\u2019s, and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should be declared in whole or in part unconstitutional\u201d is debunked as similarly illu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>sory and a proliferation of meaningless words inasmuch as the Act withstood an attack on its constitutionality in Crowell v. Benson (1932), 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598. Thus, argues Appellant, in order to give some effect to the policy as a whole and particularly the coverage of Clause 1-B (see Hollings-worth v. Robe Lumber Co., 182 Wash. 74, 45 P.2d 614, 615; Fardig v. Reynolds, 55 Wash.2d 540, 348 P.2d 661), it is essential to interpret the restrictive language of Endorsement No. 2 as applying only to the coverage under Clause 1-A to avoid an \u201cobscure or unreasonable result.\u201d Town of Tieton v. General Insurance Co', of America, <em>swpra. </em>This interpretation would leave the coverage of Clause 1-B unfettered and applicable as indemnity to the employer, Pacific, \u201cagainst loss by reason of the liability imposed upon him by law for damages on account of * * * injuries * * * to * * * employees\u201d (Clause 1-B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">If Appellant\u2019s premises were sound, the argument would be appealing; that is to say, if the interpretation given to the policy by the District Court left the coverage of Clause 1-B as an illusory representation of coverage for which the insured paid a premium but which, in substance, represented no promise of indemnification whatsoever, a different result would be indicated. This, however, is not the case. The Federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, when adopted and now, did contain and does contain a specific provision saving in the employee a right of action against the employer if any part of the Act is declared unconstitutional so as to invalidate the payment of compensation under the Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 949).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Otherwise, the employee\u2019s remedies under the Act are exclusive (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">Accordingly, to provide an employer with compensation insurance coverage which will afford him full and complete coverage under the very terms and provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act itself, it is essential that the coverage of Clause 1-B be included as applicable to the very limited area of possible unconstitutionality o-f a part of the law. This obvious and reasonable basis for the form of the policy declarations and the endorsements eliminates any cause for according other than face value to the straightforward and unambiguous announcement in Endorsement No. 2 that \u201cno other liability of any nature whatsoever, except as defined by the said Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, is covered hereunder.\u201d This is a workmen\u2019s compensation policy and nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">. '\u2018When construing the terms of an insurance policy, the court will give the language used its popular and ordinary meaning, unless it is apparent from a reading of the whole instrument that a different or special meaning was intended or is necessary to avoid an obscure or unreasonable result.\u201d Town of Tieton v. General Insurance Co. of America, 380 P.2d 127, at p. 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">.
