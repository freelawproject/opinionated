The controversy stems from the Commissioner\u2019s disallowance of taxpayer\u2019s deductions for the alleged bad debts of an allegedly related corporation upon the merger of the taxpayer with that corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">A brief look at the transactions leading up to this suit, as adduced in the district court, is necessary. The taxpayer was originally organized in 1949 as a Delaware corporation, under the name of Consolidated Gas and Service Company (Delaware Consolidated). The entire capital stock of this corporation, which engaged in the construction of gas distribution facilities, was owned by John C. Donnelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">In 1954, Niagra Mohawk Power Company, one of Delaware Consolidated\u2019s most important customers, became involved in the St. Lawrence Seaway Project and began to allocate considerably more funds for the electrical facilities needed for that Project than for the construction of gas facilities. In order to accommodate this customer, as well as to enter the electrical construction field, a separate company, Northeastern Construction Corp. (Neceo) was organized with Donnelly and Arthur Schmidt, an officer of Delaware Consolidated, as its only shareholders. The separate company was formed because the rules of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers prevented its members from being employed by companies not doing electrical work exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">Thus, Neceo was formed, with initial capital of only $12,358.11, in order to engage exclusively in the construction of electrical facilities. Because of this thin capital base, Delaware Consolidated advanced over $300,000 to or on behalf of Neceo, primarily for operating expenses. These advances were carried as current liabilities by Neceo and as current accounts receivable by Delaware Consolidated. No written evidences of indebtedness were given, no interest or maturity date was agreed upon and no security was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">The Neceo venture proved unprofitable from the beginning, however, and in March, 1956, it was decided to merge Neceo with Delaware Consolidated to form the present taxpayer corporation, Northeastern Consolidated Company. After the statutory merger, under Delaware law, was completed, including a transfer of Necco\u2019s assets to taxpayer, there remained as unpaid balances the amount of $199,791.09, representing the advances to Neceo which were unreim-bursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">Taxpayer then cancelled this amount on its books as a bad debt and deducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>it from ordinary income for the fiscal year which ended March 31, 1956. The Commissioner first allowed the deduction and carryback, but subsequently disallowed it and assessed deficiencies. As part of the merger effected in 1956, Necco\u2019s own operating loss of about $187,000 was made available to taxpayer to be offset against its available income under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 381(a) and (c). Taxpayer claimed and was allowed deductions by virtue of this for 1959, 1960, and 1961, in an aggregate amount of approximately $85,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The primary issue is whether the Commissioner\u2019s disallowance of the bad debt deduction against ordinary income was proper. This disallowance, as well as the Government\u2019s case before the district court and on appeal, is based on the assertion that the advances to Neceo were contributions to capital, rather than loans, and thus the losses incurred were capital losses which could be deducted only from capital gains, of which there were none in the relevant years.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The district court, in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, 279 F.Supp. 592 (N.D.Ill.1967), found that the advances constituted contributions to the capital of Neceo rather than loans, and therefore could not be allowed as a bad-debt under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166. This finding was based on the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">(1) The heavy preponderance of \u201cdebt\u201d to equity ($300,000 to $12,000);</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">(2) The fact that the repayment of the advances rested solely on the success of Necco\u2019s venture;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">(3) Plaintiff\u2019s own assertions that the activities of Neceo were really part of plaintiff's own business and that they were not a separate corporate venture;</p>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">(4) The unlikeliness that Neceo could have obtained $300,000 from any other source on the same terms, or absence of terms, as it received from plaintiff. 279 F.Supp. at 595-596.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">We agree with the district court and adopt its opinion on this issue. We find that this conclusion is compelled by looking at the substance, rather than the form, of the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">Similarly, we adopt the opinion of the district court in its holding that the deduction was not allowable as an ordinary and necessary business expense under Section 162, and that it was not allowable as a business loss under Section 165. 279 F.Supp. at 597. On this last point, however, we feel that some further elaboration is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-20\">Taxpayer contends that, even if the advances to Neceo constitute an investment, Section 165<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> allows a deduction against ordinary income for the uncompensated loss suffered on the investment. The real problem taxpayer faces in this area is in showing that its investment in Neceo was not a capital asset and therefore that the loss can be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ducted from ordinary income. Taxpayer\u2019s first argument on this point is that, although securities in other corporations ordinarily constitute capital assets, the instant security was purchased in the ordinary course of business and was therefore entitled to non-capital treatment. We agree with and adopt the district court\u2019s holding rejecting this contention on the grounds that the creation of Neceo as a separate entity, engaged in unrelated work, was not done in the ordinary course of taxpayer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Taxpayer further attempts to bring its investment under non-capital treatment by arguing that the transaction falls under Section 165(g) (3), which provides that any security of a corporation affiliated with the taxpayer shall not be treated as a capital asset. This argument fails, however, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">First of all, in order to fall under Section 165(g) so as to be treated as non-capital assets, the securities held by the taxpayer must become \u201cworthless.\u201d We find that the security held by the taxpayer in the instant case did not become \u201cworthless,\u201d but was only impaired to the extent of the loss suffered when the merger took place. See 5 Mertens 28.65b and 28.66. Thus, looking at the substance of the transaction, taxpayer invested over $300,000 in Neceo and, on Necco\u2019s merger with taxpayer, received back $192,852. Therefore, although taxpayer took a loss on its investment in the equity of Neceo, its security did not become \u201cworthless\u201d, as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Secondly, even under plaintiff\u2019s reasoning, Neceo does not qualify as an affiliated corporation. Under \u00a7 165(g) (3) (A), \u201ca corporation shall be treated as affiliated with the taxpayer only if\u2014 (A) at least 95 percent of each class of its stock is owned directly by the taxpayer * * * \u201d In the instant case, although taxpayer owned an equity investment in Neceo, that investment was not in Necco\u2019s common stock. It is undisputed that Donnelly and Schmidt owned 100 percent of that class and thus Neceo was not, under the statutory definition, affiliated with taxpayer since taxpayer did not own at least 95 percent of each class.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. \u00a7 165 Losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">(a) General rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">There shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-9h\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">(f) Capital losses.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">Losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the extent allowed in sections 1211 and 1212.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">(g) Worthless securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">(1) General rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">If any security which is a capital asset becomes worthless during the taxable year, the loss resulting therefrom shall, for purposes of this subtitle, be treated as a loss from the sale or exchange, on the last day of the taxable year, of a capital asset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-21\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"b142-22\">(3) Securities in affiliated corporation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-23\">For purposes of paragraph (1), any security in a corporation affiliated with a taxpayer which is a domestic corporation shall not be treated as a capital asset.

Williams, 286 F.2d 285 (6th Cir. 1960). This important case was heavily relied upon by the taxpayer, but is not mentioned in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">In <em>Byerlite </em>the Sixth Circuit held that advances made by the Byerlite Corporation to its subsidiary, the Byerlite Export Company, Ltd., were loans rather than contributions to capital and therefore the taxpayer was entitled to deduct from its ordinary income as a worthless debt the loss of such loans. The situation there presented and the facts in case at bar are compellingly analogous. The only factual difference is that in <em>Byerlite </em>the Export Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of the taxpayer whereas here NECCO was not a subsidiary of the taxpayer (although there was common stock ownership of the two corporations). In my opinion, this differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ence is without legal significance. In both eases, proper resolution of the tax question depends upon whether the taxpayer's expenditures were proximately related to his business activities. This court must decide whether the taxpayer\u2019s expenditure served a recognizable business purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In the course of his opinion, Chief Judge McAllister in <em>Byerlite </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">On the books of Byerlite, the advances to Export were carried as accounts receivable; on Export\u2019s books, as accounts payable. This is the nomenclature of debt. Of course, the government is not bound in its tax collecting activities by the terminology used by a taxpayer if such terminology is used to disguise something quite different. However, if the stockholders of a corporation determine just how much of their funds they care to risk in the form of capital and how much, if any, they are willing to lend as a credit, and, when the venture is closed up, they take their loss as to such amount as they have loaned, and this leaves them in a position to enjoy more favorable deduction privileges than if they had put it all in as capital, this does not entitle the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to rewrite their balance sheet for them and show to be capital what was intended to be a loan. <em>* * * </em>The decisive factor is not what the payments are called but what, in fact, they are, and that depends upon the real intention of the parties. * * * The indicia relied upon by the government are not controlling. The fact that advancements to a corporation are made without requiring any evidence of indebtedness or fixing any date for repayment; without requiring the payment of any interest; and with the realization that the tangible assets of the corporation were not such, at any given time during the taxable period, as to repay any part of the loan \u2014 was not a controlling consideration requiring a conclusion that the advances were not loans, and that a deduction from ordinary income for a bad debt was not properly allowable, when the advances became uncollectible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">From the foregoing, it appears that losses of great sums of money resulting from large loans to corporations with slight capital, and even purchases of stock in corporations, are held not to be investments in capital, where the intent to invest was not present and where the funds were loaned, or stock purchased, only to promote the business purposes of the stock purchaser or lender, (footnotes omitted.) 286 F.2d at 290-291.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">There, as here, the Government argued that the advances made by the taxpayer constituted contributions of capital and attempted to support the argument by indulging in various fictions unsupported by the realities of the situation. Judge McAllister\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s contention is squarely applicable to this ease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">In arguing that appellant is not entitled to a bad debt deduction, the government is obliged to contend, as the District Court found, that Byerlite\u2019s advances to Export were not loans but were an investment in Export\u2019s capital stock. Such a contention is based upon a theory that seems most unreal and artificial. Export had no need to sell stock, and Byerlite had no need to purchase stock to carry out the contemplated operations. To deprive By-erlite of a deduction for a bad debt on the ground that it was investing in Export\u2019s stocks, rather than loaning money to Export, would seem to require a complicated, unreal, artificial assumption to be substituted for an ordinary, normal, and regular method of doing business, which, in this case, was characterized by the absence of any motive to operate otherwise than as shown by the records of the two companies, and with no hint of subterfuge or attempt to evade simple, straightforward business practices\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and, certainly, with no thought of advantage in manner of operation, or as to tax consequences. 286 F.2d at 292.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjL\">One of the fictions suggested by the Government to support its theory that, the advances to NECCO were contributions to capital rather than loans is that the taxpayer was actually a shareholder in NECCO and that the debt carried on the taxpayer\u2019s books was in reality an investment. That the Government\u2019s position is illogical can be demonstrated by hypothesis. If NECCO had been a successful operation and not only repaid the taxpayer\u2019s cash advances but also generated a profit, this profit, would have been distributed not to the taxpayer, but to NECCO\u2019s stockholders. The taxpayer would have had no claim to such profit. Under such circumstances would the Government have attempted to tax such profit to the taxpayer ? To ask the question is to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">I would reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
