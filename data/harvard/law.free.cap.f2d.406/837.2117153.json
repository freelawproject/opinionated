One of the plaintiffs is Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, an incorporated association of data service organizations domiciled in Pennsylvania whose members perform data processing services throughout the United States. It is hereinafter referred to as ADAPSO. The other plaintiff, Data Systems, Inc., is a Minnesota corporation engaged in the data processing business, with its principal place of business in Minneapolis. The complaint seeks equitable relief against the defendants and a \u201cdetermination of the powers granted national banking associations under [the National Bank] Act as set forth in 12 U.S.Code \u00a7 24.\u201d It is alleged that by administrative rule the Comptroller of the Currency has authorized national banks to perform data processing services for bank customers in violation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 which gives national banks' only \u201cincidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the unauthorized action ADAPSO members are threatened with the loss of a substantial part of the data processing market.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is alleged that American National now performs data processing services for two companies with whom Data Systems had \u201cnegotiated\u201d as prospective customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">Jurisdiction is asserted by reason of an alleged federal question arising under the banking laws of the United States. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21 et seq. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for lack of jurisdictional standing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">The question of standing serves as a test of federal jurisdiction. Standing is the constitutional prerequisite related to whether a justiciable \u201ccase or controversy\u201d exists. Involved is an examination to determine whether the plaintiffs have a personal stake legally sufficient \u201cto assure that concrete adverseness\u201d which avoids merely abstract determinations. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). See also Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937). Justiciability, although not always related to standing, becomes definitively attached when we consider whether the legal relationships of parties are such that they are aligned with adverse legal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">Plaintiffs assert standing in that they have been and will continue to be economically injured by <em>illegal </em>competition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>of the national banks. Whether a litigant has standing to challenge competitive injury has been the subject of extended litigation and discussion. Doctrinal rules have developed a maze of eon-ceptualistic abstractions and theories which at times are viewed and applied as being indistinguishable one from another. See Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Saxon, 261 F.Supp. 247 (D.D.C.1966), aff\u2019d sub nom., Port of N. Y. Authority v. Baker, Watts &amp; Co., 129 U.S.App.D.C. 173, 392 F.2d 497 (1968); Saxon v. Georgia Ass\u2019n of Ind. Ins. Agents, Inc., 399 F.2d 1010, 1019 (5 Cir. 1968) (concurring opinion).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The trial court here has observed that language in Rural Elec. Admin, v. Northern States Power Co., 373 F.2d 686 (8 Cir. 1967) (denying standing)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in Webster Groves Trust Co. v. Saxon, 370 F.2d 381 (8 Cir. 1966) (allowing standing) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seems to state divergent principles, either of which could govern in the instant case. However, all legal principles must be qualitatively analyzed within the context of factual surroundings. Much of the confusion on standing seems to arise from the emphasis upon the issues to be adjudicated or upon the possible merits of the substantive claim rather than upon an examination of the <em>status </em>of the complaining plaintiff. Whether or not a defendant is alleged to be engaged in illegal competition cannot by itself determine a plaintiff\u2019s standing to complain. Cf. City of Chicago v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry., 357 U.S. 77, 78 S.Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174 (1958) and note 8 infra. Chief Justice Warren has stated, \u201cThe fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.\u201d However, he added, \u201c * * * it is both appropriate and necessary to look to the substantive issues for another purpose, namely, to determine whether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 99, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1952, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Whether a party may or may not challenge allegedly illegal competition by others is best evaluated by examining the various factual circumstances within which the courts have discussed a particular plaintiff\u2019s standing and competitive injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">Perhaps most well known are the so-called \u201cpower cases,\u201d where the threatened economic loss arises from government-created competition. In these situations the embryo of the competition by the defendant is generally found in congressional legislation. But even though the validity of such legislation is challenged, or an attack is made on the authority of a government agent to loan money, the courts uniformly have denied standing to competitors who otherwise possess no legal right to be free from competition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This group of cases is represent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>ed by Tennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U.S. 118, 137, 59 S.Ct. 366, 369, 83 L.Ed. 543 (1939), which early emphasized :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-4\">\u201cThe appellants invoke the doctrine that one threatened with direct and special injury by the act of an agent of the government which, but for statutory authority for its performance, would be a violation of his legal rights, may challenge the validity of the statute in a suit against the agent. The principle is without application unless the right invaded is a legal right, \u2014 \u25a0 one of property, one arising out of contract, one protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">See also Rural Elec. Admin, v. Northern States Power Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Secondly, in contrast to the \u201cpower\u201d cases are situations where a plaintiff, possessing a public grant or contract to operate, seeks to prevent a competitor from entering into an area of regulated and <em>restricted </em>competition. Representative of these cases is Frost v. Corporation Comm\u2019n, 278 U.S. 515, 49 S.Ct. 235, 73 L.Ed. 483 (1929). This court has applied the rationale of <em>Frost </em>to a suit by a state bank against the Comptroller to prevent illegal competition. Webster Groves Trust Co. v. Saxon, 370 F.2d 381 (8 Cir. 1966). As observed in Whitney Nat\u2019l Bank in Jefferson Parish v. Bank of New Orleans &amp; Trust Co., 116 U.S.App.D.C. 285, 323 F.2d 290 (1963), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 379 U.S. 411, 85 S.Ct. 551, 13 L.Ed.2d 386 (1965), involved is a property right arising out of a public charter which bestows a <em>legal </em>interest on a state bank to complain.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Closely related but significantly different are those cases involving areas of competition which because of public interest find need of public licensing as opposed to a public grant or contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Here plaintiff-competitors are considered to be without a private \u201clegal right\u201d to protest unauthorized competition \u25a0 but nevertheless find standing by specific legislation as \u201caggrieved persons\u201d to act in the public interest. See, e. g., FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940) ; Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U.S. 4, 62 S.Ct. 875, 86 L.Ed. 1229 (1942). Cf. Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 328, 359 F.2d 994 (1966). In these cases <em>Congress </em>has patently recognized need for judicial review even though the competitive business controlled is considered free and otherwise unrestricted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Fourth, there are situations where competitors are given standing to challenge competition which is allegedly in violation of a statute, where the statute itself is said to be enacted for the express protection of the class of competitor complaining. The most recent example of these cases is found in Hardin v. Kentucky Util. Co., 390 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on recent cases against the Comptroller fall within facile classification of this rule. See, e. g., Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Saxon, 261 F.Supp. 247, supra, as ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>plained in Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 274 F.Supp. 624, 636 (D.D.C. 1967) ; Saxon v. Georgia Ass\u2019n of Ind. Ins. Agents, Inc., 399 F.2d 1010 (5 Cir. 1968) .<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Fifth, the last group of \u201ccompetition\u201d cases relates to a plaintiff\u2019s unsuccessful challenge of a competitor\u2019s alleged <em>ultra vires </em>acts affecting plaintiff\u2019s non-regulated area of commerce. This factual setting is best illustrated by Railroad Co. v. Ellerman, 105 U.S. 166, 26 L.Ed. 1015 (1882). In that case the plaintiff, who had contracted with the city of New Orleans to collect revenue from users of the city wharves, sought to en) oin a railroad company from operating wharves in New Orleans. He alleged this action would constitute illegal competition because the state statute authorizing the company to operate wharves was unconstitutional. The principle here furnishes an analogue to that in the \u201cpower cases\u201d where the conduct of the defendant, although alleged to be illegal is nevertheless considered \u201clawful\u201d with respect to the plaintiff because of the total absence of legal interest found in plaintiff\u2019s status.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aid-dedup-0\">In summary, a plaintiff may challenge alleged illegal competition when as complainant it pursues (1) a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>interest by reason of public charter or contract, Frost v. Corporation Comm\u2019n, supra, (2) a legal interest by reason of statutory protection, Baker, Watts &amp; Co. v. Saxon, supra, or (3) a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in which Congress has recognized the need for review of administrative action and plaintiff is significantly involved to have standing to represent the public, FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, supra. From this analysis, it seems clear that an allegation of \u201cillegal competition\u201d is not the balancing determinant of a plaintiff\u2019s standing. The primary search must rest on whether the plaintiff\u2019s status is one which enjoys a private interest entitled to protection or is one which the law recognizes to be of such legal significance to allow a party to act as a public representative for a public interest. \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">In the instant case the facts clearly place plaintiffs outside those cases which recognize standing. Plaintiffs are competing in a non-regulatory field of free competition. They possess no private legal interest nor do they plead any legal harm which is recognized at law. Their status is not one which places them within a class designedly protected by statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In direct accord see Wingate Corp. v. Industrial Nat\u2019l Bank, 288 F. Supp. 49 (D.R.I.1968); Arnold Tours, Inc. v. Camp, 286 F.Supp. 770 (D.Mass. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is in essence an equitable plea, that in effect they have a personal stake to pursue, even though not a legal one, but nevertheless one which makes them logical parties to protect the public interest from illegal actions of government agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The problem with their plea is many-fold. Congress has not seen fit within the National Bank Act to reeognize any \u201caggrieved person\u201d to assert the public\u2019s rights. Congress has not expressed a public concern for protection as found in FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 60 S.Ct. 693, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940), and its progenitors. Without a legal interest or the status of a recognized \u201caggrieved\u201d party, the complaint resolves itself into an attempt merely to show \u201ca common concern for obedience to law.\u201d L. Singer &amp; Sons v. Union Pac. R. R., 311 U.S. 295, 304, 61 S.Ct. 254, 258, 85 L.Ed. 198 (1940). As pronounced in <em>Singer, </em>outside statutory consent, the general or common interest can find protection only in the standing granted to public authorities. Unless a relevant statute provides for a \u201cparty in interest\u201d to seek judicial review or unless a complainant possesses a recognized legal interest, he lacks standing to be a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d to represent the public interest. See Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. v. McKay, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 225 F.2d 924 (1955) ; Braude v. Wirtz, 350 F.2d 702, 707, 708 (9 Cir. 1965).:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Mr. Justice Frankfurter best describes judicial obligation to avoid review when legal standing is not otherwise involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-10\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of the federal courts can be invoked only under circumstances which to the expert feel of lawyers constitute a \u2018case or controversy.\u2019 The scope and consequences of the review with which the judiciary is entrusted over executive and legislative action require us to observe these bounds fastidiously.\u201d Joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 150, 71 S.Ct. 624, 637, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (concurring opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\">.

In addition, even though the attack upon a government program to loan money is alleged to be illegal, this does not make the competition itself legally wrong. This is explained because \u201cthe borrower owes him [the plaintiff] <em>no obligation </em>to refrain from using the proceeds in any lawful way the borrower may choose.\u201d Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464, 480, 58 S.Ct. 300, 304, 82 L.Ed. 374 (1938). (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">. The branch banking provisions of the National Bank Act make the establishment of branch banks subject to the law of the states. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 30. A primary purpose in doing' so is to ensure competitive equality between state and national banks. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Logan, Utah v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co., 385 U.S. 252, 87 S.Ct. 492, 17 L.Ed.2d 343 (1966). It lias accordingly been held that this provision gives state banks a sufficient legal interest to provide them with statutory standing to challenge the legality of branching by national banks. See National Bank of Detroit v. Wayne Oakland Bank, 252 F.2d 537 (6 Cir. 1958), discussed in Hoosier State Bank of Ind. v. Saxon, 24S F.Supp. 233 (N.D.Ind.1965). The contrast between basing a state bank\u2019s standing on a \u201cproperty right\u201d arising out of its charter and standing by reason of its inclusion within the class intended to be protected by the National Bank Act is one without essential difference. Perhaps the most realistic approach is that the right indigenous to the charter is protected by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b904-9\">. The Court stated in FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470 at 474, 60 S.Ct. 693 at 697, 84 L.Ed. 869 (1940) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-10\">\u201cIn contradistinction to communication by telephone and telegraph, which the Communications Act recognizes as a common carrier activity and regulates accordingly in analogy to the regulation of rail and other carriers by the Interstate Commerce Commission^ the Act recognizes that broadcasters' are not common carriers and are not to be dealt with as such. Thus the Act recognizes that the field of broadcasting is one of free competition. The sections dealing with broadcasting demonstrate that Congress has not, in its regulatory scheme, abandoned the principle of free competition, as it has done in the case of railroads, in respect of which regulation involves the suppression of wasteful practices due to competition, the regulation of rates and charges, and other measures which are unnecessary if free competition is to be permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-14\">\u201cAn important element of public interest and convenience affecting the issue of a license is the ability of the licensee to render the best practicable service to the community reached by his br-oadcasts.

But cf. City of Chicago v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry., 357 U.S. 77, 78 S.Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174 (1958). The Supreme Court recognized standing of a municipal licensed public transportation system to intervene and attack the entry of one seeking to compete in an alleged violation of a city ordinance. The Court made clear that standing of the intervenor could not be viewed from examination of the merits as to whether in fact the competition was or was not illegal. Parmelee, the intervenor, for many years had enjoyed an arrangement with the railroad to transport passengers between stations. Parmelee was notified of its termination. A com^ petitor, Railroad Transfer Service, was subsequently given this business notwithstanding a city ordinance that prohibited it from doing so without a license from the city. The Court found that Parmelee had \u201ca direct and substantial personal interest in the outcome\u201d and allowed'standing. The ordinance was then held unconstitutional as being repugnant to the Interstate Commerce Act and the intervenor lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">This ease may best be categorized with those instances where standing to challenge illegal competition is implicitly found within a legislative enactment, be it an existing ordinance or statute, valid or not.

The Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-12\">\u201cThis Court has, it is true, repeatedly held that the economic injury which results from lawful competition cannot, in and of itself, confer standing on the injured business to question the legality of any aspect of its competitor\u2019s operations. Railroad Co. v. Ellerman, 105 U.S. 166 [26 L.Ed. 1015] (1882) ; Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464 [58 S.Ct. 300, 82 L.Ed. 374] (1938) ; Tennessee [Electric] Power Co. v.

But competitive injury provided no basis for standing in the above cases simply because the statutory and constitutional requirements that the plaintiff sought to enforce were in no way concerned with protecting against competitive injury. In contrast, it has been the rule, at least since the Chicago Junction Case, 264 U.S. 258 [44 S.Ct. 317, 68 L.Ed. 667] (1924), that when the particular statutory provision invoked does reflect a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest, the injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision. See Alton R. Co. v. United States, 315 U.S. 15, 19 [62 S.Ct. 432, 435, 86 L.Ed. 586] (1942) ; [City of] Chicago v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., 357 U.S. 77, 83 [78 S.

If he has such interest, it can only consist in preventing competition with himself as a wharfinger, which such more extensive use of the railroad property would create. And if the right to assert it exists, it must rest, not upon the claim that the premises are thus used for purposes to which they might not be lawfully devoted if owned and used by a natural person, but on the allegation merely that such use is beyond the corporate powers of the company. But if the competition in itself, however injurious, is not a wrong of which he could complain against a natural person, being the riparian proprietor, how does it become so merely because the author of it is a corporation acting <em>ultra viresl </em>The damage is attributable to the competition, and to that alone. But the competition is not illegal. It is not unlawful for any one to compete with the company, although the latter may not be authorized to engage in the same business. <em>The legal interest which qualifies a complainant other than the State itself to sue in such a case is a pecuniary interest in preventing the defendant from doing an act where the injury alleged flows from its quality and character as a breach of some legal or equitable duty. </em>A stockholder of the company has such an interest in restraining it within the limits of the enterprise for which it was formed, because that is to enforce his contract of membership. The State has a legal interest in preventing the usurpation and perversion of its franchises, because it is a trustee of its powers for uses strictly public. In these questions the appellee has no interest, and .he cannot raise them in order, under that cover, to create and protect a monopoly which the law does not give him. The only injury of which he can be heard in a judicial tribunal to complain is the invasion of some legal or equitable right. If he asserts that the competition of the railroad company damages him, the answer is, that it does not abridge or impair any such right. If he alleges that the railroad company is acting beyond the warrant of the law, the answer is, that a violation of its charter does not of itself injuriously affect any of his rights. The company is not shown to owe him any duty which it has not performed.\u201d (Emphasis ours).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\">. The National Bank Act has never been construed to give a private litigant standing to complain concerning <em>ultra vires </em>acts of national banks relating to executed contracts. See National Bank v. Matthews, 98 U.S. 621, 25 L.Ed. 188 (1878). Although distinctive policy arguments exist for this rule, nevertheless there exists no legislative history nor do plaintiffs offer any serious contention that the National Bank Act was intended to give these private litigants standing to litigate alleged <em>ultra vires </em>activities of national banks. The reliance on the Bank Holding Company Act of 1966 and the Bank Service Corporation Act is misplaced. Neither act is applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b907-12\">.
