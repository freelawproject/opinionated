In this case the appellant\u2019s rectum was searched by forcible digital insertion and manipulation in locating and extracting four narcotic packets which were seized and introduced in evidence at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-28\">This issue necessarily raises the questions of \u201creasonableness\u201d of the search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the permissibility of the techniques used under the \u201cdue process\u201d clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Appellant Huguez (with a codefendant alleged to have aided and abetted him) was charged in two counts of a four-count indictment with knowingly importing four ounces of heroin into the United States from Mexico, and with concealing and transporting it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The third and fourth counts, charging the codefendant and appellant respectively with failing to register as narcotics addicts or users upon entry into the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were both dismissed upon motion of the Government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">On the day of trial in the District Court, Southern District of California, May 26, 1966, appellant filed a motion to suppress the use of the heroin in evidence, pursuant to Rule 41(e), Fed.R.Crim.P., supporting it with his affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>and claiming that the heroin was inadmissible because:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">(a) It was seized without a search ' warrant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">(b) The heroin was seized in an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search which was constitutionally invalid; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">(c) The heroin was obtained by the use of methods and techniques violative of \u201cdue process\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">This motion was impliedly overruled throughout the trial when the Court permitted the introduction of the heroin into evidence and at the end of the trial was formally denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">After the non jury trial, the appellant was found guilty of the offenses charged in the first two counts; the Government agreed to and later did dismiss count three as to the codefendant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and count four as to appellant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">A seven-year sentence was then imposed upon appellant on each of the two counts, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Jurisdiction below rested on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1407<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 3231,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our jurisdiction is established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 1294.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The substantive error urged on this appeal is the denial of the motion to suppress and the subsequent admission into evidence of the four ounces of heroin seized in the intrusive search of appellant\u2019s rectum. We find that the specification of error is well taken because readily apparent upon close analysis of the facts contained in the record, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, as we are obliged to do, and disregarding only such testimony as shown by the whole record to be palpably unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-24\">A careful reading of the Transcript of Record in this case leads us chronologically and inevitably to a four-step summary of what occurred from the beginning of the border crossing through the naked strip and skin search on to the final forcible intrusion of the rectal cavity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-25\">1. The border crossing and initial detention by Inspector Teela;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-26\">2.

THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">1. <em>The Border Crossing and Initial Detention by Inspector Teela.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">At 8:50 p. m. on the evening of May 13, 1966, appellant Huguez and a companion, codefendant Baros, attempted to enter the United States at the San Ysidro border crossing, San Diego County, California, after traveling by automobile from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At the primary inspection point, Customs Inspector Thomas N. Teela approached the automobile and engaged the two men in routine border questioning.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Huguez responded to the questions by stating that he was 'a citizen of the United States, had been born in Los Angeles, California, and was bringing in some mascara which he had purchased for his wife in Mexico.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He declared this merchandise but did not declare any narcotics, nor did he register as a narcotic addict or user under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> nor did he present any registration certificate as required by this statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Nonetheless, Inspector Teela became \u201csomewhat suspicious\u201d that the two men were under the influence of narcotics when he observed, with the aid of the fluorescent lighting in the inspection area and a flashlight which he focused upon the men during the inquiry, that their eyes appeared to be \u201cglassy and pinpointed\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">During the trial, Inspector Teela admitted on cross examination that, since he had not seen either of the men on any previous occasion and was not trained or experienced in medical matters, he had \u201cno way of knowing\u201d the normal size of their pupils nor the reflective effect that fluorescent lighting and flashlights would have upon their eyes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On this basis Teela reached the conclusion that appellant and codefendant Baros were under the influence of narcotics, and thereupon entered the passenger side of the automobile and directed the suspects to proceed to the secondary area.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">2. <em>The Secondary Area Examination and Strip and Skin Search by Inspectors Teela and Lasher.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATK\">Inspector Teela escorted the suspects to the secondary area where the windowless search rooms are located, and after entering one of the rooms Huguez was instructed to take off his clothes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> With the assistance of Supervisor Inspector Lasher, Teela then conducted a personal clothing and skin search of the' naked Huguez and later of the codefendant Baros. The strip and skin search failed to produce narcotics or other contra-brand, but did reveal what Lasher said was the presence of \u201cneedle marks on their arms\u201d as well as what Teela said was a \u201cgreasy substance\u201d on appellant\u2019s buttocks.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Inspector Lasher subsequently turned the two men over to Assistant Customs Agent-in-Charge Walter A. Gates and Customs Agent John D. Maxcy.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Gates was informed by Inspector Lasher only of the needle marks on the suspects\u2019 arms and, for some reason not at all apparent, Teela failed to say anything at all to either Gates or Maxcy about:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-18\">(1) the \u201cgreasy substance\u201d he had allegedly observed on Huguez\u2019s buttocks ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-19\">(2) the United States citizenship of Huguez and his failure to register or present a certificate as a narcotic user or addict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-20\">(3) the \u201cglassy and pinpointed eyes\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Nor did Teela, Lasher or anyone else suggest to Gates that the doctor examine the appellant.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">3. <em>The Forcible and Intrusive Rectal Cavity Invasion by Dr. Salerno and the Three Customs Agents </em>\u2014 Gates, <em>Maxcy and Syohr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Agents Gates and Maxcy took the two men, now fully dressed again, from the windowless search room to the baggage area across the street and into one of the rooms in this baggage <em>area</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 not a <em>medical </em>room nor even a room, so far as the record discloses, equipped with any of the usual hygienic and sterilized equipment found in the physician\u2019s customary office, but evidently only a bare <em>baggage </em>room with \u201can examination table\u201d in it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Dr. Paul R. Salerno proceeded to examine codefendant Baros and then appellant Huguez,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> while Inspector Lasher leaned against the wall watching the proceedings.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Neither Agent Gates, nor Agent Maxcy, nor Inspector Lasher, nor anyone else passed on to Dr. Salerno any information about the physical condition of Huguez and Baros. The doctor was <em>not </em>told of the \u201cglassy and pinpointed eyes\u201d which Teela claims made him \u201csomewhat suspicious\u201d; <em>nor </em>of the \u201cneedle marks\u201d which Lasher had noticed; <em>nor </em>of the alleged \u201cgreasy substance\u201d that Teela claims he saw on Huguez\u2019s buttocks.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And the record does not show that the doctor was ever told that Huguez was a United States citizen and had not registered or presented a narcotic user, or addict registration certificate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Yet, starting from scratch, without a search warrant, which it is clear (and the Government admits) was not issued or served, without any prior information of any kind whatsoever, Dr. Salerno took it upon himself to conduct the forcible body and intrusive rectal cavity invasion to locate and extract the four packets which were later introduced in evidence at the trial and are now the basis of appellant\u2019s contention of reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">After appellant had removed his shirt as directed, Dr. Salerno then for the first time became aware of the small needle marks on Huguez\u2019s arms which, according to the doctor\u2019s testimony, suggested that Huguez had recently used narcotics.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> During the examination. Dr. Salerno also concluded that Huguez\u2019s pupils responded sluggishly to darkness, that the deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremity were hyperactive, and that his pulse rate was accelerated. On the basis of this examination, and admittedly having failed to administer either one of the ordinary and easily given Nalline or urine tests, the doctor arrived at the opinion that Huguez was a user and at that time under the influence of narcotic drugs.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> And after arriving at this opinion the doctor made the request \u201cto conduct a routine digital or rectal examination\u201d.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Thereupon Huguez was ordered to lower his trousers so that Dr. Salerno could conduct a digital rectal probe to determine whether any material was concealed in the anal cavity,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> despite the fact that the doctor had not received any information at all from the agents or from anyone else regarding the \u201cgreasy substance\u201d that Teela claimed he saw on Huguez\u2019s buttocks.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As we have said, he gave this order to Huguez to lower his trousers and began the rectal cavity invasion without a search warrant of any kind having been sought, issued or served.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Upon Huguez\u2019s refusal to lower his trousers, Dr. Salerno told him \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do it the hard way.\u201d Whereupon the three customs agents\u2014 Gates, Maxcy and Spohr\u2014forcibly pulled Huguez\u2019s pants down.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Dr. Salerno then started his \u201cdigital or rectal examination\u201d by using a plastic glove and inserting his index finger up Huguez\u2019s anus and into his rectum.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Parenthetically we note, and it is a curious circumstance indeed, that when Dr. Salerno examined Huguez\u2019s buttocks and rectal area prior to inserting his finger, he found absolutely no evidence of the \u201cgreasy substance\u201d which Teela claimed he saw. In fact, the doctor testified that there was no \u201cforeign chemical substance\u201d or \u201clubrication\u201d in the rectal and buttock area at all. And he so testified both on direct and on cross examination.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Incidentally, Huguez also testified that there was no \u201cgreasy substance\u201d on or in the area of his buttocks.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">As the doctor\u2019s finger was inserted, Hu-guez did not at first physically resist,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> but when the doctor persisted in the digital manipulation, Huguez vehemently protested :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-14\">\u201cI told him that I wasn\u2019t going to relax, that he was just running over my constitutional rights. He couldn\u2019t go up my rectum without my consent.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE1E\">And then Huguez began to resist with all the strength he could muster. As Dr. Salerno put it, \u201che forcibly constricted his external sphincter; he also reached around with one of his hands in an effort to remove my finger from the examining position.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> And he continued his struggling resistance against the combined efforts of at least three agents there in the room with Dr. Salerno.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">At this critical juncture of the struggle, the agents handcuffed Huguez and threw him onto a table<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Agent Gates was then able to break Huguez\u2019s will to resist by pulling forward on the handcuffs and exerting enough pressure on Huguez\u2019s head, shoulders and back to keep him bending over forward and forcing his chest to remain on the table.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Gates said Huguez\u2019s hands were cuffed behind his body and were pulled up and forward to force his upper body prone on the table,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> while Huguez claimed he was cuffed with his hands and arms in front.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In any event, sufficient pressure was exerted to bring Huguez against the table and flat down on it from hips to head.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">Agent Gates admitted having noticed \u201cred streaks\u201d on Huguez\u2019s wrist following his protests that the handcuffs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>applied too tightly.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Huguez elaborated that the continuous pulling on the handcuffs caused \u201cmetal to bite into the flesh\u201d and \u201cthe skin was peeled\u201d, resulting in \u201ccuts on my wrists\u201d.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> And Agent Spohr admitted that he observed at least \u201ca red spot on the one wrist.\u201d <footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">While Agent Gates pulled on the handcuffs to control the shoulders and head area, the other officers were applying pressures to the rest of Huguez\u2019s body.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Agent Maxcy controlled the small of his back in pressing down with arms and hands. Huguez\u2019s legs were stretched and pulled apart by Agent Spohr who controlled Huguez\u2019s left leg with the weight of his own right leg, and by Dr. Salerno who controlled Huguez\u2019s right leg with his own right arm.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Eventually the agents succeeded in breaking appellant\u2019s resistance and Dr. Salerno was finally able to extract the four large spherical packets, each measuring approximately one to one and one-half inches in diameter which, with the doctor\u2019s finger, constituted in each case a mass of approximately two inches in diameter when being removed from the rectal cavity through the anus and external sphincter, requiring a stretching of the sphincter.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The packets were later determined and stipulated to contain four ounces of the narcotic, heroin.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">This \u201cforce process\u201d, as Agent Gates characterized it, took about five minutes, although the appellant declared it was something more like ten, fifteen or twenty minu\u00e9s.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Needless to say, this \u201cforce process\u201d, simultaneously applied by the three custom agents in restraining Hu-guez and by Dr. Salerno in locating and removing the packets, caused the appellant considerable discomfort and pain.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Throughout it all, Huguez\u2019s pleas and protestations went unheeded. \u201cI told them to stop. It was hurting. And they just laughed * * * They just made like a wisecrack out of it.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> And throughout it all, the appellant was never put under arrest. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">4. <em>The Absence of Any Emergency or Compelling Urgency.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">Dr. Salerno\u2019s testimony clearly revealed that there was no emergency necessitating or justifying the brutal \u201cforce process\u201d to which Huguez was subjected in the conduct of the intrusive rectal cavity invasion. According to Dr. Salerno, it is entirely possible for a person to retain packets of heroin within the rectal cavity for a period of several days even though some degree of discomfort might be experienced during that period.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Moreover, according to the doctor, the frequency of a normal bowel movement is about once a day and the administration of an oral laxative ordinarily would entail a waiting period of no more than six or eight hours.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> And finally the doctor agreed that even though the rubber balloon material with which the packets were covered might eventually deteriorate and cause some health hazard to Huguez, possibly even death upon direct contact and absorption by the rectal cavity, there would be no such hazard for at least six to eight hours.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The inference is clear, then, that no emergency or com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>pelling urgency existed for at least a six to eight hour period during which the government agents could have obtained the issuance and service of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">THE INTRUSIVE INVASION OF APPELLANT\u2019S RECTAL CAVITY EXCEEDS THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT ON BORDER SEARCHES WITHOUT A WARRANT, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO \u201cCLEAR INDICATION\u201d THAT THE CAVITY CONTAINED NARCOTICS.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">No constitutional right is more basic or fundamental than the right of privacy, protected by the Fourth Amendment restriction against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d which violate \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects.\u201d Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In its historical and inevitable development, this constitutional right has been enforced by exclusion of evidence obtained illegally in contravention of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">With scientific advances and the development of the telephone and electronic gear, the Supreme Court has been zealous to protect this right against invasions by wiretapping<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> and electronic eavesdropping.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-18\">Our Ninth Circuit has summed it up: \u201cThe Fourth Amendment protects against invasion of the right of privacy. To effectuate this basic purpose and policy, the prohibitory language has been implemented by the Federal exclusionary rule. Evidence illegally obtained in contravention of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in a federal prosecution.\u201d Blackford v. United States, 247 F.2d 745, 748 (9th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-19\">Pointing out that the Fourth Amendment has a rich heritage and that \u201cits genesis lies in the fervent discontent aroused in the American colonies in the period antedating the Revolution by the flagrant abuses of \u2018writs of assistance\u2019 \u201d, the Court added: \u201cIt represents recognition and embodiment in our fundamental framework of government of the precept that a man\u2019s property and person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>are inviolable to search except upon due cause.\u201d <em>Blackford, </em>supra, at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"> Just last year this Court distilled the essence of the Fourth Amendment by quoting the Supreme Court in Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (196 6 ) <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and concluding: \u201cThe decision emphasizes that the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is \u2018to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the state\u2019. To us, this means that every search must be examined in the light of the Amendment\u2019s requirement that it not be \u2018unreasonable\u2019. <em>And we think that this requirement applies to border searches.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Henderson v. United</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">States, 390 F.2d 805, 807. (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We are indeed mindful that, as so aptly put in <em>Blackford, </em>supra, 247 F.2d 745 at 751:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201cThere is no slide-rule formula yet devised for ascertaining whether specific conduct is or is not reasonable. Each case must turn on its own relevant facts and circumstances. United States v. Rabinowitz, supra; Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 150, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399; Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 357, 51 S.Ct. 153, 75 L.Ed. 374. \u2018Reasonableness is in the first instance for the District Court to determine.\u2019 United States v. Rabino-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>witz, 339 U.S. 56 at page 63, 70 S.Ct. 430 at page 434, 94 L.Ed. 653. The determination by that court of a constitutional question is not binding upon us, but is entitled to weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Along with Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, 871 (9th Cir. 1966), we \u201caccept the principle that the reasonableness of the search is, in the first instance, a substantive determination to be made by the trial court from the facts and circumstances of the case. Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 33, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">However, we note that when the trial court here in <em>Huguez </em>made its determination on May 26, 1966 \u2014 the date of the one-day nonjury trial \u2014 holding the intrusive invasion of appellant\u2019s rectal cavity a \u201creasonable search\u201d, the opinion in <em>Blackford </em>(July 10, 1957) <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> was the only effectively determinative decisional authority in either the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court. Since that date, the cases of <em>Blefare </em>(June 8, 1966),<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> <em>Schmerber </em>(June 20, 1966),<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> <em>Rivas </em>(November 8, 1966) <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and <em>Henderson </em>(July 7, 1967) <footnotemark>71</footnotemark> have laid down additional guidelines unavailable to the District Court at the time of the <em>Huguez </em>trial, but now controlling and imperative upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">It is, therefore, our duty to test the facts of the <em>Huguez </em>intrusive body cavity invasion, not only by the earlier exposition of Blackford, but by the more recent teachings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In doing so, and without any implication of criticism of the learned trial judge, we find that the intrusive search of appellant\u2019s rectum here in <em>Huguez </em>exceeded the constitutional limitations of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Parenthetically, we should add that we \u201ctake judicial notice of the fact that the Mexieo-California border is one of the major centers for importation of narcotic drugs into the United States\u201d and of the continuing increase, to what is now virtually a common practice, of the use of body cavities by experienced smugglers to transport narcotics across the Mexican border. Blackford, supra, 247 F.2d at 752. Not only does other decisional literature to date so advise us,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> but we also find here in <em>Huguez, </em>testimony that between July 1, 1965 and May 26, 1966, there were approximately 20 reported instances in which narcotics had been recovered from body cavities (rectums or vaginas) in border searches at the San Ysidro, California, crossing into the United States from Tijuana, Mexico.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">That this common practice makes effective border patrol difficult is undeniable. Yet that it must be curbed within the confines of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-18\">The most recent decision of this Ninth Circuit agrees \u201cthat this presents a serious problem of law enforcement, to be weighed against the individual\u2019s right to human dignity and privacy as protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805, 808 (9th Cir. 1967). In the words of <em>Henderson </em>at 806-807:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-19\">\u201cThis court has repeatedly upheld border searches of body cavities 1<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>eluding such searches carried out m spite of the violent resistance of the person searched.2 <footnotemark>75</footnotemark> However, for reasons that will appear, we do not reach such issues here. The only question we decide is whether initiation of the search was lawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">\u201cWe have repeatedly said that a border search can be undertaken without probable cause.3 <footnotemark>76</footnotemark> but we have also held that even in such cases, the officers must act reasonably.4 <footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Our recent decision in Rivas v. United-States, supra, n. 1 [74] establishes that in the case of a search of body cavities, \u2018 \u201cthere must be a clear indication of the possession of narcotics,\u201d \u2019 or a \u2018plain suggestion\u2019 of the smuggling, which must be \u2018over and beyond \u201ca mere suspicion.\u201d \u20195 <footnotemark>78</footnotemark> <em>Rivas </em>requires, when body cavities are searched, something more than was required in the earlier decisions, which said that \u2018mere suspicion\u2019 is enough.6 <footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The <em>Rivas </em>requirement is based upon language used by the Supreme Court in Schmerber v. State of California, 1966, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"> Recognizing as too well established to require citation of authority that border searches are different from other searches, that they are unique, that the mere fact a person is crossing the border is sufficient cause for a search of his baggage, vehicle and contents of purse, wallet or bags, <em>Henderson </em>then lays down the restrictions that must gov-era a naked strip and skin search and an intrusive body cavity invasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201cIf, however, the search of the person is to go further, if the party, male or female, is to be required to strip, we think that something more, at least a real suspicion, directed specifically to that person, should be required. And if there is to be a more than casual examination of the body, if in the course of the search of a woman there is to be a requirement that she manually open her vagina for visual inspection to see if she has something concealed there, we think that we should require more than a mere suspicion. Surely, to require such a performance is a serious invasion of personal privacy and dignity, and so unlawful if \u2018unwarranted\u2019. Surely, in such a case, to be warranted, the official\u2019s action should be backed by at least the \u2018clear indication\u2019, the \u2018plain suggestion\u2019, required in <em>Sehmerber </em>and <em>Rivas.\u201d </em>(390 F.2d at 808).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">As in <em>Henderson, </em>we, too, believe that the <em>Schmerber-Rivas </em>test should be applied to the rectal cavity invasion here in <em>Huguez </em>and for the same reasons, namely, we take judicial notice that many thousands of men and women crossed the California-Mexieo border during the same year\u2019s period during which the record discloses there were 20 reported instances of recovery of narcotics from rectums or vaginas; that the vast majority were obviously not carrying narcotics in their body cavities or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>elsewhere; that there is no disclosure in the record how many men and women crossing the border in that period were subjected to similar searches as a result of which nothing was found; and that these men and women were \u201ccertainly entitled to their dignity and privacy and their interests, too, are to be weighed.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>supra, 390 F.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Here in <em>Huguez </em>as in <em>Henderson, </em>appellant crossed the border with another person in an automobile. The customs' officers had not received any advance information with respect to the car, to the other person or to Huguez that would alert the officers to the possibility that they might possess or be carrying narcotics. Contrariwise, there was such information, and from reliable informants, in <em>Denton, Blefare </em>and <em>Witt, </em>supra, note 74. Neither Huguez nor his companion was a known, convicted and registered user of narcotics, as the defendants were in <em>Murgia </em>and <em>Rivas; </em>neither of them did or said anything to arouse suspicion. The agents had not been told by Huguez or anyone else that he had anything concealed in his body, as was the case in <em>Blackford </em>and <em>Murgia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">It is true, and the record indicates, Teela did become \u201csomewhat suspicious\u201d that the two men were under the influence of narcotics when he observed that their eyes appeared to be glassy and pinpointed.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> This, under the test of <em>Schmerber, Rivas </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>might be sufficient to justify the initial detention by Inspector Teela, since it probably can be interpreted as a \u201cmere suspicion\u201d. It might also, for the same reason, be sufficient to support the examination of the personal clothing and the strip and skin search of the naked Huguez and his companion by Inspectors Teela and Lash-er in the secondary area and its windowless search room, during which they discovered what Lasher said was the presence of \u201cneedle marks on their arms\u201d as well as what Teela said was a \u201cgreasy substance\u201d on appellant\u2019s buttocks.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">But when the two men were turned over to Agents Gates and Maxcy, Lasher informed Gates only of the \u201cneedle marks\u201d, and Teela failed completely to say anything at all to either Gates or Maxcy about the \u201cgreasy substance\u201d he had allegedly observed on Huguez\u2019s buttocks, or about the \u201cglassy and pinpointed eyes\u201d, or about the United States citizenship of Huguez and his failure to register or present a certificate as a narcotic user or addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Any \u201cmere suspicion\u201d that Inspector Teela had was never in any way communicated to Gates or Maxcy, and when Gates and Maxcy took Huguez and his companion from the windowless search room to the baggage area across the street where the brutal and painful intrusive rectal cavity invasion was conducted, Gates and Maxcy <em>did not </em>and <em>could not </em>have even the \u201cmere suspicion\u201d that Inspector Teela had, let alone any \u201cclear indication\u201d or \u201cplain suggestion\u201d of any cache of narcotics in Huguez\u2019s rectum, as required by <em>Schmerber, Rivas </em>and <em>Henderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Therefore Gates and Maxcy <em>did not </em>and <em>could not </em>have passed on to Dr. Salerno and Agent Spohr any information about the physical condition of Huguez and his companion that could raise the slightest real suspicion in these two other participants in the \u201cforce process\u201d of the intensive body cavity search.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Without a search warrant, without any \u201cclear indication\u201d or \u201cplain suggestion\u201d that Huguez carried narcotics in his rectal cavity, and in fact without the slightest real suspicion of any such rectal cavity cache, Dr. Salerno proceeded to conduct the examination on his own initiative without any request or suggestion that he do so, but with the aid of the three customs agents \u2014 Gates, Maxcy and Spohr. He followed up with his digital rectal probing without having observed any \u201cgreasy substance\u201d, and then Huguez was handcuffed, thrown on the table, pressured flat down and pulled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>by the handcuffs until the metal bit into his flesh and the skin 'was peeled, resulting in cuts on his wrists. In these circumstances, the \"medical examination\u201d degenerated into a \u201cforce process\u201d, so aptly termed by Agent Gates, which cannot be condoned, justified or upheld as a constitutional border search. Rather, it is a brutal invasion of privacy, an illegal and frightening example of unlawful law enforcement. The evidence so gained should have been suppressed and excluded in the prosecution of Huguez. That not having been done, our duty and obligation is to apply the <em>Schmerber-Rivas-Henderson </em>test. And so doing we must and do reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">THE \u201cFORCE PROCESS\u201d EXERTED ON APPELLANT EXCEEDS THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Here again we start with the most apposite case available to the District Court at the <em>Huguez </em>trial in May, 1966, in determining the test which should be applied under the Fifth Amendment. Blackford v. United States, 247 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">We agree that \u201cthe Fourth and Fifth Amendments are companion pillars in the Bill of Rights structure which protects the individual against arbitrary government invasion of personal freedom and liberty.\u201d (247 F.2d at 748). And that though their ultimate goal is the same, they combat different evils:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment safeguards the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; the Fifth Amendment guarantees the individual against being compelled to give evidence against himself and also assures to him under the Due Process proviso, fair and humane treatment by federal law enforcement officers.\u201d (247 F.2d at 748)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">If Huguez\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were violated, the narcotics were inadmissible at his trial and the judgment of conviction must be reversed. Rochin v. People of State of California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed.2d 183 (1952), reversing conviction; Breit-haupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432, 435, 77 S.Ct. 408, 1 L.Ed.2d 448 (1957), affirming conviction; but compare dissenting opinions of Warren, C. J. at 440, 77 S.Ct. at 412 and Douglas, J. at 442, 77 S.Ct. at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">Our Ninth Circuit carefully distinguishes <em>Blackford </em>from <em>Rochin </em>and identifies it with <em>Breithaupt. </em>While Rochin was abused and his rights violated by forcible attacks, Blackford was treated civilly throughout the rectal examination; there was only a suspicion that Rochin had swallowed pills whereas Blackford admitted he had a cache of narcotics in his rectal cavity, an admission corroborated by the presence of a greasy type substance around the anus; whereas the regurgitation in <em>Rochin </em>was induced by the application of intense physical pressure and enforced stomach pumping, the physical examinations and rectal extraction in <em>Blackford </em>were by \u201cqualified physicians, under sanitary conditions, with the use of medically approved procedures\u201d in the San Diego County Jail and the United States Naval Hospital at San Diego. Blackford, supra, 247 F.2d at 747, 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">The test of <em>Rochin-Breithaupt </em>as followed in <em>Blackford </em>was stated to be \u201cwhether the alleged activity of law enforcement officers in obtaining the questioned evidence fell short of civilized standards of decency and fair play\u201d, or was \u201cso unconscionable that it \u2018shocks the conscience\u2019 or \u2018offend[s] a sense of justice\u2019 \u201d. Blackford, supra, at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">But again, in considering Fifth Amendment restrictions and just as we did in discussing Fourth Amendment limitations, we cannot stop with <em>Black-ford, </em>even though it was the compelling authority for the District Court here in <em>Huguez </em>at the time of trial. We must turn to and are necessarily bound by the later and more authoritative decisions for guidance in determining the impact of the Fifth Amendment upon intrusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>body cavity invasions conducted during border searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In doing so we emphasize it is not essential to our decision that we find a violation of the Fifth Amendment. We have already found a violation of the Fourth Amendment since the initiation of the intrusive body cavity search was unjustified because of the lack of any \u201cclear indication\u201d or \u201cplain suggestion\u201d in the minds of Dr. Salerno and his rectal invasion squad members, that Huguez had any narcotics cached in his rectal cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870 (9th Cir. 1966), the methods used and the conduct pursued therein are distinguished from the methods used and the conduct pursued in <em>Rochin. </em>The examination of Blefare and his codefendant took place in the doctor\u2019s office in San Diego some 12 miles from the border; defendant Blefare willingly acquiesced in a rectal examination and in drinking an emetic, consented to be searched by a physician and protested only at the swallowing of a tube through which a saline solution was introduced into his stomach; defendant Michel did not object to the anal examination, the saline water swallowing or the saline solution introduced by tube; and a doctor performed carefully, expertly and with medical propriety, precisely what each of the defendants proposed to do for and to himself. Blefare at 872, 874, 877-878. Further, it was clear that the officers had reliable information from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that Blefare had admitted prior smuggling from Mexico to Canada of an ounce of heroin in his stomach. The doctors, therefore, started their examinations with reasonable certainty that the narcotics were in appellants\u2019 stomachs at the time of the examinations. On this basis, the judgments of conviction in <em>Blefare </em>were affirmed despite the vigorous dissent that the facts in <em>Blefare </em>were much closer to <em>Rochin </em>than to <em>Breithawpt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Then we have the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in a nonborder case, Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), that the Fifth Amendment applies to bodily intrusions yet does not require reversal of a judgment of conviction based on the introduction into evidence of a chemical analysis for alcohol content of a blood sample extracted from the body of the defendant over his protest, by a physician in the hospital where the defendant had been taken for treatment of injuries received in an auto accident. The Court enlarged on the <em>Rochin-Breithaupt </em>test of \u201creasonableness\u201d in the following language ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s blood was taken by a physician in a hospital environment according to accepted medical practices. We are thus not presented with the serious questions which would arise if a search involving use of a medical technique, even of the most rudimentary sort, were made by other than medical personnel or in other than a medical environment \u2014 for example, if it were administered by the police in the privacy of the station-house. To tolerate searches under these conditions might be to invite an unjustified element of personal risk of infection and pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\u201cIt bears repeating, however, that we reach this judgment only on the facts of the present record. The integrity of an individual\u2019s person is a cherished value of our society. That we today hold that the Constitution does not forbid the States minor intrusions into an individual\u2019s body under stringently limited conditions in no way indicates that it permits more substantial intrusions, or intrusions under other conditions.\u201d (Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 771-772, 86 S.Ct. at 1836)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbVi\">Once again in the Ninth Circuit, <em>Rivas </em><footnotemark><em>82</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reiterates the Fifth Amendment limitations on body cavity border search<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>es by distinctions from <em>Rochin, </em>comparisons with <em>Breithaupt </em>and references to Schmerber:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">\u201cThis is <em>not a Rochin </em>case, with its physical assault on a defendant, both before the stomach pumping, and at the time of \u201cits occurrence. It was the <em>physical assault </em>in <em>Rochin </em>which caused reversal and which \u2018led to a result in <em>Rochin </em>contrary to that in Wolf [Wolf v. [People of State of] Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 [69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782] (1949)]. Although <em>Rochin </em>raised the search-and-seizure question, this Court studiously avoided it and never once mentioned the <em>Wolf </em>case. Obviously it thought the illegal search and seizure alone did not call for reversal.\u2019 Irvine v. People of State of California, 347 U.S. 128, 133, 74 S.Ct. 381, 382, 98 L.Ed. 561 (1954). See also, Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, 876-877, n. 1 (9th Cir. 1966). 1966).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cHere the evidence shows a technical physical assault (in that hands were laid upon appellant), but no degrading or shameful physical assault upon him, in the sense the Supreme Court found in <em>Rochin, </em>supra. It was a technical assault similar to that upheld as proper in <em>Blackford, </em>supra. Again, technically, the physical assault, the \u2018gentle\u2019 probing of the rectum, was not as pronounced an assault, medically, as the puncture of the skin in Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432, 77 S.Ct. 408, 1 L.Ed.2d 448 (1957). In <em>Breithaupt, </em>the blood was taken while the appellant was unconscious. But \u2018the taking of blood by a skilled technician\u2019 is not \u2018conduct that shocks the conscience,\u2019 nor such a method of obtaining evidence as offends a \u2018sense of justice,\u2019 said the Supreme Court, citing and distinguishing <em>Rochin, </em>supra, and Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682 (1936). Cf. Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).5 <footnotemark>83</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201cThe use of the evidence in this case, like <em>Rochin, Schmerber, Blackford, </em>et al. (in fact, in any case where a body cavity is gently, in a medically approved manner, searched), does not (a) involve evidence of a testimonial nature; (b) require a defendant to testify against himself; (c) constitute a denial of due process. (See discussion of these points in Schmerber, supra, 384 U.S. pp. 768-771, 86 S.Ct. 1826.)\u201d (368 F.2d at 710-711)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Applying what we may call the <em>Rochin-Breithaupt-Schmerber-Rivas </em>test of reasonableness of place, methods and conduct to the intrusive body cavity invasion here in <em>Huguez, </em>we cannot help but find that appellant has been deprived of his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Instead of fair, humane and civil treatment by federal law enforcement officers, and a medical examination in a hospital under sanitary conditions by a qualified physician with the use of scientifically and medically approved procedures, as in <em>Blackford, </em>Huguez was subjected to a brutal, painful and degrading \u201cforce process\u201d in the non-antiseptic, non-hygienic surroundings of a bare baggage room, furnished with an \u201cexamination table\u201d upon which he was thrown, pressured prone, and forcefully pulled by handcuffs that bit into his flesh, peeled his skin and cut his wrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Instead of willingly acquiescing in a rectal examination and in drinking an emetic; instead of consenting to be searched by a physician; instead of protesting only at the swallowing of a tube at the doctor\u2019s own office some 12 miles from the border; instead of a procedure performed by a doctor carefully, expertly and with medical propriety as well as precisely in a manner that the defendant proposed to do for and to himself, all as in <em>Blefare; </em>contrariwise here in <em>Hu-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>guez </em>the defendant violently resisted the rectal examination, refused to consent to the physician\u2019s probe, and vociferously protested at all stages prior to and throughout the \u201cforce process\u201d carried on in a baggage room at the border 12 miles from the doctor\u2019s office, in a procedure conducted violently, unhygienically, without medical propriety and with laughter and jokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Incidentally, the same physician was involved in both <em>Blefare </em>and <em>Huguez </em>\u2014 \u25a0 Dr. Paul R. Salerno \u2014 but operating in methods and surroundings strikingly dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Instead of the use of a medical technique by a physician in a hospital environment according to accepted medical practices as in <em>Schmerber, </em>here we are presented with serious questions of unconstitutionality arising from the use of a rudimentary medical technique in \u201cother than a medical environment\u201d, in the non-antiseptic and non-hygienie atmosphere of a baggage room with the unjustified element of personal risk of infection and pain. Surely this is no \u201cminor intrusion [s] into an individual\u2019s body under stringently limited conditions\u201d approved in Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772, 86 S.Ct. at 1836, but rather a grievous, dangerous, unjustified and unjustifiable assault upon the integrity, privacy and dignity of a human being who, for all his faults, as a person and a citizen of the United States, was entitled to but did not receive the constitutional protection of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The evidence against him so obtained should not have been admitted at the trial and for this reason, in addition to the violation of the Fourth Amendment, Huguez\u2019s conviction cannot stand. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-17\">. U.S.Const. Amend.

Referring to the possibility of the presence of narcotics in Huguez\u2019s rectal cavity, the dissenter writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">\u201cThe trial court concluded that there was evidence in the record sufficient to constitute such a \u2018clear indication\u2019.\u201d (dissenting opinion, p. 389, infra)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">As a matter of fact, the trial court did not make any such finding, and there was no reason why it should have done so. <em>Schmerber </em>had not then been decided, and this Court had not yet adopted the \u201cclear indication\u201d test announced in <em>Rivas </em>under <em>Schmerber\u2019s </em>compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\"><em>Rivas </em>was not decided until November 8, 1966, more than five months after Iluguez was tried on May 26, 1966. The three other leading cases laying down guidelines in this field of intimate body cavity searches were also decided <em>after </em>the trial of <em>Huguez </em>\u2014 Blefare on June 8, 1966; <em>Schmerber </em>on June 20, 1966; and <em>Henderson </em>on July 7, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">What the trial court <em>did </em>say was based on Judge Barnes\u2019s opinion in <em>Blackford, </em>decided nine years earlier in 1957, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>was clearly a finding of \u201csuspicion\u201d and not \u201cclear indication\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">\u201c * * * I am sure that where there is a well-founded suspicion that he is using narcotics, it follows almost as night follows day that he is carrying narcotics somewhere, because the supply is easy to get in Tijuana, it is cheap, and they are going to bring it across.\u201d (R..T. 132-133)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ELY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A3l\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">I agree with the disposition reached by Judge Hauk in his principal opinion, although his route to the end result is perhaps more winding than that which I would have selected. My concurrence stems from conviction, shared by Judge Hauk and based upon all the circumstances, that (1) the overbearing manner of the forceable bodily invasion, in the environment in which it was made, was shockingly offensive under the teaching of Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), and (2) in support of the type of search, there was not that \u201cclear indication\u201d or \u201cplain suggestion\u201d required by recent controlling precedents, principally, the Supreme Court\u2019s case of Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826,16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), and our own cases of Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980, 17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967), and Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">I am moved to record my view that the \u201cclear indication\u201d test, somewhat nebulous in concept, does not satisfy me, even though, to be sure, I do, as I must, now respect it. Judge Hauk and I have here concluded, upon the basis of a study which has been essentially factual, that \u201cclear indication\u201d that contraband was concealed in the rectum did not exist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> My Brother Barnes, whose wisdom cannot be justly questioned, disagrees. The creators of multiple-judge appellate courts contemplated that each of the judges should conscientiously apply his own independent judgment in the resolution of disputes. Here the majority reaches a conclusion favorable to Hu-guez, but it is altogether possible that had another judge sat in the place of Judge Hauk or of me, the opinion of Judge Barnes would have prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">None should deny that there should be uniformity in the application of legal principles. Huguez should not have the benefit of a decision which might possibly be denied to others in the same position. Moreover, the border police, already confronted with perplexing problems incident to their zealous efforts to protect the public, should be equipped with the clearest possible guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The foregoing considerations, which must be disturbing to all those charged with the responsibility of insuring equal, exact, and universal justice, lead me to reiterate the fixed belief which I so recently expressed in my dissenting opinion in Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, 880 (9th Cir. 1966). It is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">\u201cWhen time permits and when the contemplated search procedure is extreme, if not shockingly offensive, the search, if made without authority therefor having been sought of a magistrate, is unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">362 F.2d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">I do not maintain that the adoption of my proposed rule would always provide an ideal solution to the type of disturbing problem which is presented here and which we encounter with increasing frequency. Nor do I pretend to have devised it originally, without reliable markers set by jurists whose intellects command the utmost respect. See, <em>e. g\u201e </em>Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s dissenting opinion in United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 68, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950). See also Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s comments in <em>Schmerber. </em>384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. 1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Although my proposal was rejected by the majority in <em>Blefare, </em>it has been favorably received by some who labor in the field of legal scholarship. See Comment, Intrusive Border Searches \u2014 Is Judicial Control Desirable?, 115 U.Pa.L. Rev. 276 (1966); Note, \u201cSearch and Seizure at the Border \u2014 The Border Search,\u201d 21 Rutgers L.Rev. 513 (1967); 19 Fla.L.Rev. 374 (1966); 18 W.Res.L.Rev. 1007 (1967).

Accepting the fact that Iiuguez presented the appearance of having used narcotics, I cannot believe that this appearance, of itself, constituted the required \u201cclear indication\u201d that he was then and there concealing narcotics in a particular cavity of his body. A human derelict is no less entitled to the law\u2019s protection than the more respected individual, and the former is much more in need of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">One of the officers testified that he observed a \u201cgreasy substance\u201d on appellant\u2019s buttocks, but the doctor who conducted the rectal probe testified that no such substance was present. It can hardly be doubted that the physician\u2019s examination required the more advantageous view. A layman might easily, from visual observation alone, mistake perspiration for grease, whereas a physician conducting the closer examination would be far less likely to make such a mistake. The interrogation on this point called for expert opinion; hence, the only competent evidence, that of Dr. Salerno, favors Huguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">The majority in <em>Blefare </em>was keenly impressed with the ojunions there expressed by Dr. Salerno. In his concurring opinion, my Brother Barnes deemed it worthwhile to set forth, in detail, the doctor\u2019s qualifications. 362 F.2d at 879 n.3. Even did he not have an extensive educational background, Dr. Salerno must surely have looked at the many, many rectums which he has probed for the border police. While the lighting of the room in the baggage area may not have provided the visual aid ordinarily available in decent medical surroundings, the handicap was not such as to prevent the doctor\u2019s unequivocal testimony, given quite positively, that the greasy substance, claimed to have been seen by the officer, was not there.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b448-13\">BARNES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"A-2\">I respectfully but firmly dissent. The majority opinion, it might be said, \u201cgoes through the motions\u201d of respecting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence discloses a reasonable search (p. 13), and even purports to examine the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Government, as we are obliged to do\u201d (p. 13) and then immediately proceeds to do neither. It does this by quoting at length the self-serving language of the defendant, and finding any contradictory testimony \u201cpalpably unworthy of belief.\u201d (p. 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">It is actually impossible for me to recognize the facts, the conduct, and even certain physical objects described in the majority opinion when I compare its language with the transcript of testimony heard by the trial court. Florid, argumentative, and dramatic language is used to color judgment and to emphasize certain facts, and to de-emphasize others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>I therefore prefer to draw my own statement of facts which I sincerely believe is more accurate, and decidedly more fair, than that appearing in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Appellant Huguez (with a codefendant alleged to have aided and abetted him) was charged in two counts of a four-count indictment with knowingly smuggling four ounces of heroin into this country from Mexico, and with transporting and concealing the same heroin in this country. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1964). After a trial in the District Court for the Southern District of California, appellant was convicted on both counts. The third and fourth counts, which charged the codefendant and the appellant with failing to register as narcotics addicts or users upon entry into the United States, were dismissed as to appellant by the trial court. The sentences imposed upon appellant relating to the two counts upon which he was convicted were ordered to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Jurisdiction below rested on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1407, 3231 (1964), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1964). Our jurisdiction over this appeal is established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The only error urged by appellant concerns the failure of the trial court to grant his motion to suppress the heroin, which was introduced as evidence by the Government. Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e). Suppression was allegedly called for because:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">(a) the heroin was seized without a search warrant;</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">(b) there was no probable cause to believe that the search by means of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the heroin was discovered would yield any contraband; and</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">(c) the heroin was procured through the unconscionable use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In view of the judgment below, the record must of course be considered in the light most favorable to the Government. With this point in mind, I feel that the following facts are established:</p>\n<p id=\"As1\">Appellant entered the United States by automobile from Mexico on March 13, 1966, with one companion. The entry was made at San Ysidro, San Diego County, California. The two men declared no narcotics to the United States Customs Inspector Thomas N. Teela, who met them at the primary inspection point.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Inspector Teela, who had been a customs inspector at San Ysidro for eight years and had had experience observing narcotics violators during that period, observed that appellant\u2019s eyes, as well as those of his companion, seemed to be pinpointed and glassy. Appellant \u201cappeared to be under the influence of narcotics.\u201d R.T. 77-78, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Appellant was searched in a secondary area search room. To Inspector Teela, who with the assistance of an Inspector Lasher conducted the search, a greasy substance was \u201cplainly apparent\u201d on appellant\u2019s buttocks, near the anus. R.T. 79, 82-83. Appellant was then taken across the street to an examination room, where Dr. Paul R. Salerno examined him. R.T. 28, 31, 39. Dr. Salerno was licensed to practice medicine in the state of California and had had considerable experience in examining and identifying drug addicts.<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">An examination of appellant\u2019s arms disclosed to the doctor (a) small needle-puncture marks on the right arm, at the base of the thumb, and over the superficial vein of the lateral wrist; and (b) a two-inch scarred \u201ctract\u201d of superficial vein over the left lower forearm. Three of the marks were recent, and there was a hematoma formation. R.T. 31. A careful examination of appellant\u2019s eyes showed an incomplete and sluggish reaction of the pupils to darkness. The pupillary diameter was three millimeters in the darkness. The deep tendon reflexes of appellant\u2019s lower extremity (sic) were hyperactive, and his pulse was accelerated (130 per minte). R.T. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">On the basis of his examination, Dr. Salerno reached the opinion that appellant was a user of narcotic drugs who was then under the influence of such a drug. R.T. 31-32. After this opinion was reached, but without obtaining a search warrant, the doctor conducted a rectal examination to determine whether any material was concealed in the rectal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cavity. Using a lubricated glove finger, he located four packets of heroin, which were then similarly extricated. The probe was similar to the rectal examination that is part of any complete physical examination for an adult male, and was made \u2014 as was the removal of the packets \u2014in a medically approved manner. Appellant began to resist only when the material was palpated, after which time it was necessary for agents forcibly to restrain him while the packets were removed. No blows were struck and there was no bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Dr. Salerno testified that in the absence of voluntary resistance by contraction of the external sphincter of the anus, the sensation accompanying removal of the packets \u201cwould not be expected to be any more uncomfortable than that experienced with a constipated or hard bowel movement.\u201d R.T. 39. In his opinion, the introduction of such packets into the rectal cavity would involve greater discomfort than their removal, provided that resistance was not offered in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The doctor further testified that there would be a mechanical or chemical attack upon the rubber containers in the rectum over a period of time; that the release of the heroin into the rectum could result in death; that leaving the packets in the rectum for more than six to eight hours \u201cwould certainly be hazardous,\u201d (R.T. 43); that a man in a prison cell might possibly hold similar (though somewhat smaller) objects in his rectum for several days; that it would take approximately eight to ten hours for an oral laxative to achieve effective results; that there are sometimes health hazards involved in the use of laxatives; that an X-ray machine or a fluoroscope would not distinguish between the packaged material and normal fecal contents; that at any rate X-ray machines and fluoroscopes should be operated only by radiologists; and that no radiologist was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">After the packets were removed, appellant admitted that he had been sent from Los Angeles to pick up the heroin and that he had secreted it in his rectum; insertion of the packets was, he later testified, accomplished by the use of soap and water, which acted as lubricants. Appellant suffered a slight abrasion on one wrist, caused by handcuffs employed during the rectal search; when he made this fact known, the handcuffs were loosened. R.T. 90, 103-04. He did not complain of any other injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Between July 1, 1965, and May 26, 1966, customs officials at San Ysidro reported twenty instances in which narcotics had been recovered from body cavities. R.T. 100-01, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">II. THE UNIQUE NATURE OF A BORDER SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"asq-dedup-0\">In considering the propriety of the search thus made of appellant, I first note that it was a border search, made within a few feet of an international boundary of the United States. Such searches constitute, in terms of the application of the fourth amendment to the Constitution, a unique category. They do not require a showing of probable cause. Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, 874 (9th Cir. 1966); King v. United States, 348 F.2d 814, 817 (9th Cir.) cert. denied, 382 U.S. 926, 86 S.Ct. 314, 15 L.Ed.2d 339 (1965); Witt v. United States, 287 F.2d 389, 391 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 950, 81 S.Ct. 1904, 6 L.Ed.2d 1242 (1961);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Murgia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>v.

United States, 308 F.2d 221 (5th Cir. 1962). <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe mere crossing of the border is sufficient cause for such a search.\u201d Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967). Such border checks are also excepted \u2014 along with those incident to a lawful arrest or justified by the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d or \u201cemergency\u201d principle, see Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 770-771, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966) \u2014 from the general requirement that searches be made pursuant to judicially issued warrants; nor is consent or a \u201creliable informant\u201d or a supporting arrest required in order for such a search to be sanctioned. Alexander v. United States, 362 F.2d 379, 382 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 519, 17 L.Ed.2d 439 (1966), and cases cited therein; Thomas v. United States, 372 F.2d 252, 254 (5th Cir. 1967); Valadez v. United States, 358 F.2d 721, 722 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">This extremely flexible application of the fourth amendment finds both illustration and support in federal, border control legislation, which grants to border officials authority of the \u201cbroadest possible scope.\u201d United States v. Rodriguez, 195 F.Supp. 513, 515 (S.D.Tex. 1960) , aff\u2019d, 292 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1961) ; cf. King v. United States, 348 F.2d 814 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 926, 86 S.Ct. 314, 15 L.Ed.2d 339 (1965); Denton v. United States, 310 F.2d 129, 132 (9th Cir. 1962); Witt v. United States, 287 F.2d 389, 391 (9th Cir.) cert. denied, 366 U.S. 950, 81 S.Ct. 1904, 6 L.Ed.2d 1242 (1961); Morales v. United States, 378 F.2d 187 (5th Cir. 1967); Thomas v. United States, 372 F.2d 252 (5th Cir. 1967); Marsh v. United States, 344 F.2d 317, 324 (5th Cir. 1965); Kelly v. United States, 197 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1952); Landau v. United States Attorney, 82 F.2d 285, 286 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 298 U.S. 665, 56 S.Ct. 747, 80 L.Ed. 1389 (1936); United States v. Yee Ngee How, 105 F.Supp. 517, 519-520 (N.D.Cal.1952). Customs officials are authorized by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 (1964) to: \u201cstop, search, and examine * * * any vehicle, beast, or person, <em>on which 'or whom * </em>* * <em>they shall suspect </em>there is merchandise which is subject to duty * * (Emphasis added.) And 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a) (1964) authorizes such officials to \u201cexamine, inspect and search * * * any person\u201d on board a vessel or in any vehicle within a customs-enforcement area. See also 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1582 (1964), and, as to immigration officials, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(c) (1964). The extraordinary extent of these powers has been justified by reference to traditional principles of sovereignty and to the paramount interest of any country in \u201cnational self preservation.\u201d Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 154, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925); Fernandez v. United States, 321 F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir. 1963), and embodies congressional authorization of long standing. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the same Congress which \u201cproposed for adoption the original amendments to the constitution\u201d enacted the first statute giving broad authority to customs agents to search for and seize contraband, thus indicating that \u201cthe members of that body did not regard searches and seizures of this kind as \u2018unreasonable\u2019 * * Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 623, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">What has been said does not mean, however, that every border search, no matter what its justification, scope, or methods, is totally exempt from the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>quirements of the fourth amendment. Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967); Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703, 710-712 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980,17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967); Thomas v. United States, 372 F.2d 252, 254 (5th Cir. 1967); Marsh v. United States, 344 F.2d 317, 324 (5th Cir. 1965). Practical considerations, of course, properly play a large part in any determination whether, in particular circumstances, a search meets that amendment\u2019s requirements. See Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949); Hernandez v. United States, 353 F.2d 624, 628 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1008, 86 S.Ct. 1972, 16 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">III. THE REASONABLENESS OF THE SEARCH IN LIGHT OF THE INFORMATION KNOWN BY THE OFFICERS</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In making his argument that the search to which he was subjected was unreasonable, appellant of course emphasizes the fact that the heroin was taken from a body cavity. This factor, he contends, renders inapplicable the rules governing \u201croutine\u201d border searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966) the Supreme Court outlined its position with regard to searches below the surface of the body in a situation analogous to that involved here. In <em>Sehmerber </em>there had been a lawful arrest, a circumstance which ordinarily makes proper a thorough search of an individual arrested, even though there exists neither a warrant nor probable cause to believe that contraband, weapons, or relevant evidence will be found. In that sense, a search pursuant to a proper arrest is similar to a border search. The extraction of a blood sample that was involved in <em>Sehmerber </em>was held, however, to be governed by a somewhat more restrictive rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\u201cWe begin with the assumption that once the privilege against self-incrimination has been found not to bar compelled intrusions into the body * * * the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proper function is to constrain, not against all intrusions as such, but intrusions which are not justified in the circumstances, or which are made in an improper manner. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\u201c * * -X- * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">\u201c * * * The interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any such (bodily) intrusions on the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained. In the absence of a <em>clear indication </em>that in fact such evidence will be found, these fundamental human interests require law officers to suffer the risk that such evidence may disappear unless there is an immediate search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">384 U.S. at 768-770, 86 S.Ct. at 1834 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">In Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703, 710-712 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980, 17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967), and Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d <em>805 </em>(9th Cir. 1967), while admitting the difficulty of defining such a \u201cclear indication\u201d standard precisely, we interpreted that language to mean that something less than \u201cprobable cause,\u201d yet more than \u201cmere suspicion,\u201d is required to justify a body cavity search; and we held that rule to apply even to searches made at an international border.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">The trial court concluded that there was evidence in the record sufficient to constitute such a \u201cclear indication.\u201d I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Appellant argues that Inspector Teela\u2019s observation of a greasy substance on appellant\u2019s buttocks cannot be attributed to the officer who apparently ordered the rectal probe, see R.T. 41, 70, 89-90, and that that information therefore cannot be considered as a part of the evidence with reference to which the \u201cclear indication\u201d standard is to be applied. I may adopt this position arguendo, without passing upon the reasoning urged in sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>port of it,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> since I feel that even apart from this observation made by Teela a reasonable man could conclude there existed a clear indication that appellant was hiding narcotics within his body \u2014 and, therefore, that the resulting rectal search was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">First: appellant\u2019s arms bore the telltale needle marks that characterize the veins of an addict, or a habitual user of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Second: there was every indication that appellant and his companion were under the influence of narcotics when they crossed the border. The informed lay opinion of Inspector Teela and other officers to this effect was confirmed by Dr. Salerno\u2019s diagnosis, which was based on much substantiating data. In particular, three fresh needle marks were observed, indicating that an injection had recently been made \u2014 \u201cwithin hours.\u201d Third: appellant presented no certificate of registration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 (1964) as a narcotics user or addict. R.T. 77.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Fourth: as the experienced trial judge indicated, once the conclusion is reached that an American citizen crossing into this country at San Ysidro is a user of narcotic- drugs \u2014 particularly when he has not registered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 and when he is then under the influence of narcotics \u2014 there is a reasonable basis for the inference that he is \u201ccarrying narcotics somewhere, because the supply is easy to get in Tijuana, it is cheap,\u201d R.T. 132-33, and the value of such drugs is much greater in this country than in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Fifth: appellant\u2019s car, R.T. 79, as well as his clothes and his person, had been searched, so that the possibility of his carrying narcotics anywhere other than within his body \u2014 either in his stomach or in his rectum \u2014 was negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Bearing in mind that the \u201cclear indication\u201d standard of <em>Rivas </em>and <em>Henderson </em>is somewhat less stringent than that of \u201cprobable cause,\u201d I believe that these factors in combination provide a clear indication that appellant was hiding contraband narcotics in either his stomach or his rectum; and this conclusion justifies the rectal probe conducted by Dr. Salerno, rendering it in that respect \u201creasonable.\u201d The possibility that appellant had swallowed narcotics, intending to regurgitate them later was much less likely than that he had hidden them in his rectum. The testimony of Dr. Salerno, R.T. 38, suggests what is undoubtedly common knowledge among persons who traffic in narcotics \u2014 that the rectum is a considerably safer repository for such drugs than the stomach; the acidic nature of the gastric juices in the latter organ makes the swallowing of almost any flexible container of narcotics quite dangerous. Cf. Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, 873, 873-874 (9th Cir. 1966). It is perhaps for this reason that \u2014 insofar as the cases we have had before us over the past decade provide a basis for judgment \u2014 by far the majority of those persons who utilize body cavities in attempting to bring narcotics into this country hide the contraband drugs in their rectums (or, in the case of women, in their vaginas). Compare Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967) (vagina); Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980, 17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967) (rectum); Denton v. United States, 310 F.2d 129 (9th Cir. 1962) (rectum); Murgia v. United States, 285 F.2d 14 (9th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 977, 81 S.Ct. 1946, 6 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1961) (rectum); and Blackford v. United States, 247 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1957); cert. denied, 356 U.S. 914, 78 S.Ct. 672, 2 L.Ed.2d 586 (1958) (rectum), with Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870 (9th Cir. 1966) (stomach).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">It is true that our opinion in <em>Rivas </em>makes some mention that it would be \u201cbetter\u201d if findings of \u201cclear indication\u201d were made by the judiciary rather than by law enforcement authorities. 368 F.2d at 711. However, it is not clear how much weight should properly be given to this language, for its premise would seem to be in conflict with the holding in that case, since endorsed in Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967), to the effect that the \u201cclear indication\u201d standard is less stringent than that of probable cause. According to the fourth amendment, a warrant may issue only on a showing which meets the latter standard. In any case, I believe that the threat to appellant\u2019s health caused by the danger that the hidden narcotics would be absorbed by his body constituted an \u201cemergency\u201d- \u2014 similar to those relied on in <em>Rivas </em>and <em>Schmerber </em>\u2014 justifying a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Appellant\u2019s first two allegations of error must thus be rejected, and the only remaining question concerns whether there was an unconscionable use of force in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">IV. THE REASONABLENESS OF THE METHODS USED IN THE SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Even when initiation of a body cavity search is justified, of course, excessive or unreasonable techniques may not be used in carrying out such a search. The evidence cited in part I of this opinion indicates clearly, I believe, that the search was not improper in terms of the methods used. Of prime significance is the fact that, as was the case with respect to the blood sample in <em>Schmerber, </em>removal of the heroin was made by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>doctor using medically accepted methods. Moreover, a rectal probe is a relatively ordinary and uncomplicated procedure. It may well be that appellant experienced some pain during the extraction. However, it seems clear that to a considerable extent such pain was a direct result of his own resistance \u2014 a circumstance which certainly lessens the significance of that fact. Although the analogy is not exact, it may be noted that there are many ways in which individuals can cause normal law enforcement procedures to have painful consequences for themselves: it would not, for instance, necessarily be improper for police to refuse to remove handcuffs from a prisoner who, by vigorously twisting his hands and arms, managed intentionally to lacerate his wrists. Furthermore, although it relates primarily to the justification for continuing the probe, the fact that the appellant began to resist physically only after Dr. Salerno had palpated the packets in his rectum is not entirely irrelevant to the reasonableness of the methods used. Finally, the possibility that heroin left in appellant\u2019s rectum would seriously threaten his life \u2014 certainly bears on the reasonableness of the methods used; and the impact of this possibility is only diminished, not destroyed, by the fact that belief regarding the heroin\u2019s presence was based on inference rather than actual knowledge. Cf. Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 770-771, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), with respect to the foreseeable effects of time on the alcohol content of the arrestee\u2019s blood in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The abrasion on appellant\u2019s wrist is of relatively minor significance. It cannot be inferred that the \u201credness\u201d testified to by several witnesses was serious, or that it was anything but the incidental result of the chafing of appellant\u2019s handcuffs. Indeed, as soon as the attention of the officers was drawn to the matter, the handcuffs were loosened.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In view of these considerations, then, I cannot possibly categorize the officers\u2019 course of action here, as did Mr. Justice Frankfurter with respect to the police conduct involved in Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 210, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952), as \u201ctoo close to the rack and the screw\u201d to be permitted. The search to which appellant was subjected is quite different from those extreme measures which might be thought to \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d Cf. Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, (9th Cir. 1966); Blackford v. United States, 247 F.2d 745 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 914, 78 S.Ct. 672, 2 L.Ed.2d 586 (1958) ; D. McIntyre &amp; N. Chabraja, The Intensive Search of a Subject\u2019s Body and Clothing, 58 J. Crim.L.C.&amp;P.S. 18, 22-23 (1967).'<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Since the search was not unreasonable either with respect to its justification or in the methods used, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\">. As examples: (a) the original examination room is always described as \u201cwindowless.\u201d I see no reason why that adds anything to the opinion. Being windowless, there would be no opportunity for a suspect to dispose of smuggled narcotics, or other incriminating evidence during or prior to examination. This, I would say, serves a valuable purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">(b) The border station room in which the defendant was medically examined repeatedly becomes, for apparent purposes of persuasion, \u201conly a bare baggage room with \u2018an examination table\u2019 in it.\u201d (p.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">6) The majority, in footnote 28, tell us that although the doctor described this room as an \u201cexamination room,\u201d (R.T. 31), and an agent called it \u201ca-doctor\u2019s office\u201d (R.T. 49), \u201cit was still nothing more than a <em>bare room in the baggage </em>area with an \u2018examination table as <em>the only medical equipment,\u2019 \u201d </em>citing R.T. 49. But R.T. 49 does not support such a statement of \u201cfact\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-17\">\u201cQ. And insofar as medical equipment consists of, you had the examination table; is that my understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-18\">\u201cA. Tes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-19\">\u201cQ. And that is the extent of your medical facility down there; is that my understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-20\">\u201cA. Well, <em>there were other medical facilities there. </em>For the purpose of rectal examination, this is all that is needed. The individual bends over, flexes the body at the trunk at a ninety-degree angle and rests the upper torso or body on the examination table, supports his lower, lower body with his feet.\u201d (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-21\">Being \u201cin the baggage area\u201d does not make the room a baggage room.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(c) Again, according to the majority, Dr. Salerno \u201ctook it upon himself to conduct tlie forcible and intensive rectal cavity search.\u201d This statement simply flies in the face of reality. Why was the defendant Huguez taken to the doctor\u2019s office if not because of a prior decision that he should be rectally examined?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">(d) Again, the rectal search is always referred to as \u201cbrutal\u201d and generally as \u201cpainful.\u201d The defendant is \u201cthrown on tlie table,\u201d the handcuffs \u201cbit in his flesh\u201d and \u201chis skin was peeled.\u201d The physician and the United States Government employees \u201claughed at the defendant,\u201d and examined him \u201camid laughter and jokes\u201d! The use of such language detrends on the rejection of all prosecution testimony\u2014 a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court, who heard the testimony given and could judge the credibility of the various witnesses. The majority, to improve their factual position, accept only the non-government version.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">(e) Even when the record discloses a simple answer \u201cno,\u201d (when the doctor was asked if he had used \u201cNalline or urine tests,\u201d R.T. 7), this becomes, in tlie opinion, not Nalline or urine tests, but \u201cordinary and easily given \u2018Nalline or urine tests\u2019 \u201d \u2014 a medical characterization nowhere appearing in the record. Thus, going beyond the record, tlie majority purports to be experts on medical questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">(f) Nowhere does the majority opinion touch upon the two inch scar tract on the left forearm, indicating appellant was an addict; or at the very least, that he had been a frequent user of narcotics. This damning information is simply disregarded; and reference made only to the \u201csmall needle-puncture marks\u201d at the base of the right thumb and wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">(g) Finally, not content with resting on the defendant\u2019s conflicting testimony <em>alone, </em>the majority <em>assumes </em>certain facts exist. The opinion relies on this pure assumption of fact with not the slightest basis for it in the record \u2014 namely that the rectal insertion of the heroin was \u201cmade immediately prior to tlie border crossing.\u201d (note 62)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">The concurring opinion of my Brother Ely states that the majority opinion rests upon \u201cthe basis of a study which has been essentially factual.\u201d I am not sure I understand what <em>\u201cessentially </em>factual\u201d means in this context, but if I do understand it, it means \u201calmost factual.\u201d I can not agree it comes that close. Judge Ely\u2019s note points out that there is evidence to support the \u201cexistence of a greasy substance\u201d on appellant\u2019s buttocks when he was first examined, but then dismisses this factual evidence by saying that <em>only </em>\u201cexpert opinion\u201d will suffice to prove the existence of such substance. No case law or statute is cited in support of this strange theory, and I know of none that can be. Further, the possibility of a suspect in custody removing the telltale indicium of the rectum\u2019s use as a repository during the time between the original lay examination and the subsequent medical examination is not even mentioned, nor explained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1a\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">. Dr. Salerno testified concerning his academic training and subsequent experience in the examination of suspected narcotics violators as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">\u201cI received the Doctor of Medicine, or M.D. degree from Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1955. I also have had training in pharmacology and earned a Ph.D. or doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Chicago in 1949.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">\u00ab:\u00a1e <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">\u201cI have been engaged in both the research and the teaching of pharmacology or the mechanism of action of drugs and the biochemical aspects of drug action in the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">\u201cIn addition to the, to the (sic) routine activities as associated with the practice of medicine in San Diego, I have for the past three and a half years been called upon from time to time to examine individuals for the customs office ; examination has been requested to ascertain whether needle max\u2019ks were present on individuals; also request for examination as to the nature of the needle marks; whether the individual was under the influence of a narcotic drug or some other drug at the time of the examination; request has also been made to establish an opinion with respect to whether the individual appears to be a user of narcotic drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-18\">\u201cQ. Over what period of time, Doctor, have you been making these examinations of persons to determine whether they are using or addicted to narcotic drugs ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-19\">\u201cA. For approximately three and one half years. The number of individuals examined is, has been approximately 700 to 800 such individuals.\u201d R.T. 28-30.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. The <em>Witt </em>decision states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">\u201cthere is reason and probable cause to search every person entering the United States from a foreign country, by reason of such entry alone.\u201d 287 F.2d at 391.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Although the question may be to some extent one merely of semantics, I feel that this formulation of the principle is somewhat less accurate as a matter of logic than one which recognizes that \u201cprobable cause\u201d (to believe that a suspect possesses contraband) is not required in order for a border search to be \u201creasonable.\u201d The mere crossing of a border clearly does not constitute \u201cfacts and circumstances * * * sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u201d the individual in question possesses contraband. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(1925). But the practical difficulties connected with operating an effective customs check do create a \u201creason\u201d for and justify searches of entrants on the basis of \u201cmere suspicion,\u201d or even at random. Thus, the \u201creason\u201d exists without \u201cprobable cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-12\">. \u201cThe right of a border search does not depend on probable cause and is in a separate category from searches generally. Detention and searches are the essence of the enforcement of laws governing the detection and punishment of smuggling.\u201d 308 F.2d at 222-223.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\">. I prefer to avoid deciding this question largely because of deficiencies in the record. Were I to consider the issue, the Government might well cite the fact that Teela was \u201cassisted\u201d in his original search of appellant by Inspector Lasher, R.T. 79, who was also present in the examination room at the time of the rectal probe. R.T. 92. And, although Agent Walter A. Gates seems to have ordered the probe, this conclusion is not clear from the record, nor even if Gates did in fact authorize the search, is it clear what information he had before him at the time. Thus, Lasher, who did not testify, may have had knowledge of the substance Teela saw on appellant\u2019s buttocks, and may have participated to some extent in the decision to order the rectal probe.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Alternately, the Government might argue that Teela\u2019s decision (made jointly with Lasher) to suggest further action after his examination of appellant, R.T. 79, should be viewed as an implied communication of his general conclusions concerning appellant (if not his specific knowledge) to those who in fact took such action. True, Gates testified that no one suggested the physical examination to him. R.T. 90. Teela (and Lasher) clearly did exercise some discretion, however, in \u201cadvising the Agency\u201d and holding appellant for further proceedings of some sort. Conceivably such action contemplated as a general matter that a thorough physical examination would be made, so that Teela may have played some part in bringing about the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">I note those possibilities, of course, without endorsing either their factual or their legal aspects. I seek merely to put into context my decision, considering the state of the record before me, not to pass upon them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\">. It is true that only Inspector Teela testified as to appellant\u2019s failure to present such a certificate. I feel that this information may properly be viewed as having been conveyed by implication, however, to Agent Gates. Gates testified that he was told \u201conly\u201d of the needle marks on appellant\u2019s arms. R.T. 89. But it is a fair assumption that registration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 would be reported as a matter of course by customs inspectors, so that individuals not thus specified to be registrants would be presumed by officials making further inquiry not to have registered. It is therefore likely that, not having been told that appellant had so registered, Gates believed \u2014correctly and with justification \u2014 that he had not. A similar analysis is justified with respect to Teela\u2019s failure, referred to below, to find narcotics hidden in appellant\u2019s car. Any such discovery certainly would have been reported; indeed, appellant would in such circumstances probably have been immediately arrested. These questions are in this respect quite different from that of Teela\u2019s observation of the greasy substance on appellant\u2019s buttocks \u2014 knowledge of which it would be difficult to attribute to Gates in the absence of a specific communication of it to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b455-6\">. It should be clear that I offer no conclusion regarding the reasonableness of a hypothetical \u201cstomach search\u201d (involving, for instance, tlie use of an emetic) undertaken in circumstances similar to those present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b456-5\">. \u201cSeveral considerations may help explain why the courts are less offended by a rectal probe or enema than by stomach pumping or the administration of an emetic. As to the element of pain that may be involved, the courts weigh this aspect of a cavity search against the overall conduct of the suspect. While characterizing a rectal probe as a \u2018disgusting sequence\u2019, courts have no great difficulty, apparently, attributing the necessity for it to the defendant\u2019s choice of an equally disgusting repository in the first place. Conventional morality may thus supply the formally missing premise of distinction. This attitude appears to extend also to the suspect who resists a rectal probe, causing some degree of pain and the possibility of physical injury. The courts are not willing to place a premium on the suspect\u2019s violent resistance, especially if he is in all other respects treated civilly. Pain in such ciroum-stances indeed has been termed \u2018self-inflicted\u2019. In further support of this position, the courts point out that a rectal probe \u2018is an uncomplicated and nonhazardous procedure\u2019; with regard to the administration of an enema, courts have indicated that it is \u2018a very normal and natural thing to do.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u201cEmphasis has been placed, moreover, on the fact that the contraband in the body cavity may cause serious injury to the suspect unless promptly removed. Testimony by medical experts as to the likelihood of this eventuality has been used to \u2018 substantiate the use of force. A final point of emphasis is the court\u2019s willingness to analogize a cavity probe to forcing a suspect \u2018with narcotics in a clenched fist to open his hand\u2019 or cutting the stitches of a defendant\u2019s clothing to recover the contraband contained therein.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">See also 58 Colum.L.Rev. 565 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On Petition ORDER For Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"b457-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The petition for rehearing is denied.
