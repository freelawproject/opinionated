We agree and enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">The Trial Examiner and Board had little difficulty connecting the picketing of Altex, whose employees were Local 5 members, with the Union\u2019s dispute with Barber Brothers, a nonunion employer, whose jobsite was directly across the street from the Altex plant. Altex drivers refused to cross Union picket lines at the Barber Brothers construction site. The Union established a picket line around the Altex plant displaying signs stating: \u201cHeck [Altex owner] &amp; Altex \u2014Keep your nose out of union business that doesn\u2019t pertain to you.\u201d Altex employees, on Union orders, refused to cross the picket lines around their employer\u2019s cement plant to report to work. Several Union agents informed Altex owner, Heck, that the picketing of his plant could be terminated if he would \u201cagree not to have anything to do with [Barber Brothers].\u201d The Union business agent, Ed Partin, paid the striking Altex workers cash compensation to offset lost wages. Partin warned Heck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>he would place his company on the \u201cunfair list.\u201d Finally, Partin contacted Heck twice seeking to agree upon withdrawal of the pickets in return for Heck\u2019s withdrawal of an anti-trust suit and unfair labor practice charges against the Local.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Section 8(b) (4) of the Act was designed to prohibit \u201cpressure tactically directed toward a neutral employer in a labor dispute not his own.\u201d National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. N. L. R. B\u201e 386 U.S. 612, 623, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 1257, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). The conduct of the pickets and Local 5 agents was clearly proscribed by the Act. See Bedding, Curtain &amp; Drapery Wkrs. Union, Local 140, of United Furniture Workers of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. N. L. R. B., 2 Cir., 1968, 390 F.2d 495, 499, 503, cert. denied, 392 U.S. 905, 88 S. Ct. 2056, 20 L.Ed.2d 1363 (1968) (conduct manifestly coercive); Superior Derrick Corporation v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1960, 273 F.2d 891, 894, cert. denied, sub. nom. Seafarers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union v. N. L. R. B., 364 U.S. 816, 81 S.Ct. 47, 5 L.Ed.2d 47 (1960) (picketing carried \u201cspecial message of its own\u201d to neutral company employees). The picket sign language alone indicated an illegal objective which would override any union defense predicated on a \u201cpurely informational\u201d purpose. National Labor Rel. Bd. v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Const. Tr. C., 341 U.S. 675, 689, 71 S.Ct. 943, 952, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951); N. L. R. B. v. New York Lithographers &amp; Photo-Eng. U. No. One-P Lithographers &amp; Photo-Engravers International Union A.F.L.-C.I.O., 3 Cir., 1967, 385 F.2d 551, 554-555.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The Union attempted to invoke the proviso of Section 8(b) (4) (ii) (B) allowing publicity \u201cother than picketing\u201d to advise the public that Altex was handling products \u201c * * * produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute and [which] are distributed by another employer.\u201d Cf. N. L. R. B. v. Fruit &amp; Veg. Pack. &amp; Whse., Loc. 760, 377 U.S. 58, 84 S.Ct. 1063, 12 L.Ed.2d 129 (1964). This exemption, however, is not available under the facts of this case, where Altex does not distribute any Barber Brothers manufactured product and where the Al-tex employees are already Local 5 members. No legitimate recognitional or organizational object could be involved. The Union also contended that there existed no \u201cdirect connection\u201d between Local 5 and the picketing of Altex. This assertion must be dismissed as completely unreasonable under the facts shown in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">We have no difficulty concluding that there existed substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s decision that the Union violated Section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B). See Burr v. N. L. R. B\u201e 5 Cir., 1963, 321 F.2d 612, 617-619. We also conclude that, under the circumstances of this local Union\u2019s repeated and flagrant violation of this and other sections of the Act, the remedy adopted by the Board<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was consistent with the congressional intent to allow the Board broad discretionary power to effectuate the policies of the Act, viz., to protect neutral employers from a labor conflict not their own. Cf. Republic Steel Corp. v. National Labor Relations Bd., 311 U.S. 7, 12, 61 S.Ct. 77, 79-80, 85 L.Ed. 6 (1940); N. L. R. B. v. Bush Hog, Inc., 5 Cir., 1968, 405 F.2d 755 [Dec. 26]; Mel Croan Motors, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1968, 395 F.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Enforcement, therefore, is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\">. A companion case involving another Board order and decision, 171 N.L.R.B. No. 9, stemming from other proscribed conduct arising out of related circumstances was recently decided by us. See Teamsters Local No. 5, etc. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1968, 405 F.2d 864 [Dec. 20],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-11\">. The Board order and decision is reported at 170 N.L.R.B. No. 37. The parties seek relief pursuant to respective rights under Section 10(e) and (f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10(e) and (f). The Board adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s decision and recommended order as its own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b504-17\">. Briefly, subparagraph (i) prohibits union inducement of employees to cease work and subparagraph (ii) makes it unlawful for a union to threaten, coerce, or restrain \u201cany person,\u201d including an employer where the conduct includes one or more of the proscribed secondary objectives. A combination of prohibited action and prohibited objective is essential. See generally 3 CCH Lab.L.Rep. IT 5220.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\">. The Board ordered Local 5, <em>inter alia, </em>to cease and desist from \u201cpicketing or otherwise inducing or encouraging any individual employed by Altex or <em>any other person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce </em>to engage in a strike or refusal in the course of his employment\u201d to handle, to deal in the products of or to cease doing business with Barber Brothers. (Emphasis added.) Member Fanning of the Board dissented without reasons from the order, presumably because of its scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
