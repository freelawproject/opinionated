Secs. 151 et seq.) and 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">An examination of the record is convincing that the Board\u2019s decisions and orders, based upon the findings of the trial examiner, are sustained by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. It is, accordingly, unnecessary to recount at length the evidence on this review; but certain instances are to be emphasized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">From the beginning of the union\u2019s organizing effort, the general manager of respondent companies had shown concern about general foreman Goudy\u2019s failure to discover which employees were carrying on union activities. The general manager had directed Goudy to engage in surveillance of organizing activities by keeping watch on Phil Eiseman\u2019s house, located several doors down the street from the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-11\">In his campaign of opposition to the union, one of the general manager's principal arguments was that the designation by the Thermo-Rite employees of the union as their representative would be futile, as he would not bargain with it. General foreman Goudy frequently made this argument at the manager\u2019s express or implied command on behalf of the respondent companies. Whether Goudy made this argument, found by the Board to be an unfair labor practice, as frequently and as forcefully as the general manager desired, cannot be definitely determined, but the manager\u2019s view of the answer to this question must be inferred from his conduct toward Goudy after Thermo-Rite\u2019s loss of the election. It has also been found that Goudy was directed to threaten the loss of their employment to the part-time employees and to the girls in the plastics department and mail room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">After the election and certification of the union as bargaining agent, the general manager of both respondent companies came down to the place of business where Goudy was awaiting him after a phone call, and the manager then stated that he had talked with his attorneys and the attorneys had told him they would not take his case for review before the National Labor Relations Board \u201cunless they were convinced that somebody in management had sold him down the river.\u201d Mr. Goudy had replied that \u201cthat charge was absurd, it wasn\u2019t so,\u201d and the general manager responded that \u201cI would hate to believe it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">The foregoing conversations followed several days after the general manager had told foreman Goudy that he had found out that one of the employees had been \u201ctrying to start a Union in my plant,\u201d and that Mr. Goudy should immediately find out all that he could as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>who else might be trying to start a union. The general manager finally told him that the man who had been trying to start the union was Phil Eiseman. When foreman Goudy asked the general manager what grounds he had to dismiss Eiseman, since Eiseman had been doing extremely well and had recently been given a pay raise, the general manager said that the \u201ctime study man\u201d for respondents \u201cwould prepare facts that will stick.\u201d Later in the afternoon, the time-study man brought the foreman two slips, and told him that there could be no denying the fact that respondents had reasonable grounds for Eiseman\u2019s discharge, and \u201cthey will stick,\u201d using the same expression as the general manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Thereafter, the evidence adduced by the Board discloses that suspicious and fishy statements were allegedly procured from some employees to the effect that foreman Goudy had been trying to get the employees to vote for the union; and these claimed statements and Gou-dy\u2019s alleged conduct were the bases for the respondent companies\u2019 claim that \u201csomebody in management\u201d had sold the respondents \u201cdown the river\u201d to secure the union as bargaining agent. Goudy was discharged after the election and was told by the general manager that he could pick up his final pay cheek; that he was \u201cin a lot of serious trouble, and would have a long time to think it over.\u201d The general manager\u2019s statement that his attorneys would not take his case unless it could be shown that someone on the employers\u2019 side had \u201csold them out,\u201d explains the manager\u2019s delay in discharging Goudy and the respondents\u2019 effort, in both the objections filed to the election and in the proceedings in this case, to concoct a story of improper pr\u00f3-union conduct by Goudy; and that one of the respondents\u2019 real reasons for discharging Goudy was for failure or refusal to oppose the union in the manner and to the extent desired by the general manager. The trial examiner found that the entire evidentiary fabric of respondents\u2019 contention that Goudy was discharged for assisting the union was \u201cso sleazy and tattered that I reject it as a clumsy concoction, completely unworthy of belief\u201d; and such finding was affirmed by the Board. The substantial evidence on the record as a whole shows that all of the respondents\u2019 claims \u00e1nd proof against the discharged employees are equally contrived and spurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">In consideration of the foregoing, enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
