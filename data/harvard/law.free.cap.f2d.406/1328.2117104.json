The complaint alleged various violations of the Sherman, Clayton and Robinson-Patman Acts and requested a jury trial. An application for temporary injunction was filed and came on for hearing. After hearing three of plaintiff\u2019s five witnesses the trial judge stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Court cares to hear any more.\u201d He thereupon denied the injunction and summarily dismissed the action. He was evidently convinced from the testimony taken that the plaintiff could not support its claim for injunctive or any other relief and was apparently moved to be done with it. This appeal is from the dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-17\">We think the able and practical-minded Judge acted too quickly to deny the plaintiff its proverbial full day. Our situation is different from cases like Standard Oil Co. of Texas v. Lopeno Gas Co., 240 F.2d 504 (5th Cir. 1957) where the whole action was equitable and \u201cNothing more remained to be tried.\u201d p. 510. In those circumstances the final injunctive relief was appropriate even though the hearing was on a motion for temporary relief. In our case, the issue before the court was temporary injunctive relief which the court might very well have denied, as it surely did. But the anti-trust issues survived and a conclusive ruling thereon was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-18\">The expeditious and efficient processing of litigation is laudable and should be encouraged. But the Federal Rules provide an adequate and orderly procedure for the summary dismissal of complaints which fail to state a claim on which relief can be granted, Rule 12; and for summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d, Rule 56; or if the case goes so far, a directed verdict under Rule 50 or dismissal under Rule 41(b) may be in order. Only by adherence to the spirit of these rules can we be sure of a full hearing \u2014 the essence of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-19\">The case is reversed and remanded with directions to proceed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
