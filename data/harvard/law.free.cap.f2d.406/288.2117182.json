They took the property subject to two mortgages totaling $319,-095.97, gave a third mortgage for $125,-000 and paid $198,573.64 in cash. A year later the Litoffs organized Ambassador Apartments, Inc., to which they transferred the apartment building in exchange for Ambassador stock and a note in the amount of $193,511.56 secured by a fourth mortgage. After the transfer Ambassador listed assets of $648,187.27, liabilities of $643,187.27 and stockholders equity of only $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">The fourth mortgage note provided for monthly payments of $1,000 principal, plus interest. Only nine principal payments, with interest of $11,205, were made in 1960, however, and in 1961, only the January principal payment and interest for the year of $10,805 were paid. On its income tax returns for 1960 and 1961, Ambassador deducted the \u201cinterest\u201d paid on that note. The Litoffs, in turn, included those sums as income, but omitted the \u201cprincipal\u201d payments which they regarded as return of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">The Commissioner, on the other hand, determined that the property tranferred to Ambassador for the fourth mortgage note was a contribution to capital rather than a loan. Accordingly all payments were, to the extent of the earnings and profits of Ambassador, dividends taxable to the Litoffs and not deductible by Ambassador. The Tax Court concurred, holding that the transaction lacked the substance of a debt. It based its decision on several objective considerations, including the extremely high debt-to-equity ratio (123 to 1), but it did not discuss the taxpayers\u2019 motives. Appellants now contend that such a recharacterization may not stand, in the absence of a specific finding of tax avoidance motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">That issue, however, is well settled in this Circuit. In Gilbert v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 262 F.2d 512 (2 Cir. 1959), this court disposed of the taxpayers\u2019 charge that the Tax Court had failed to consider their tax avoidance motives by stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">\u201cThe term \u2018substantial economic reality\u2019 is merely a way of expressing the fact that the determination whether the funds advanced are to be regarded as a \u2018capital contribution\u2019 or \u2018loan\u2019 must be made in the light of all the facts of the particular case. * * * Nor does the answer depend upon the taxpayer\u2019s motive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">262 F.2d at 514. See also Motel Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 340 F.2d 445 (2 Cir. 1965), where the court affirmed, without discussion of the taxpayers\u2019 motives, the Tax Court\u2019s determination that a transfer was a contribution to capital and not a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">Appellants, however, place undue emphasis on language in Nassau Lens Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 308 F.2d 39 (2 Cir. 1962), where the same issue was under consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">\u201cIn short, a departure from normal business patterns combined' with a tax avoidance motive usually will be sufficient to justify treating the \u2018loan\u2019 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>equity. Either factor alone, however, is not enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Id. at 47. That language is best understood, however, in the context of the sentences immediately preceding it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alz-dedup-0\">\u201cTax savings motives are, of course, not irrelevant and may be considered by the Tax Court. They may not, however, be given conclusive effect but should be given weight commensurate with the extent to which \u2018they contribute to an understanding of the external facts of the situation.\u2019 Gilbert v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, [2 Cir.] 248 F.2d [399] at 407.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUFs\">Clearly the holding is not authority for the proposition that a tax avoidance motive is an indispensable element.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on Goldstein v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 364 F.2d 734 (2 Cir. 1966) is also misplaced, as the question now before this court was not treated there. Finally, to the extent that J. S. Biritz Construction Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 387 F.2d 451 (8 Cir. 1967), applies to a clear-cut \u201cthin capitalization\u201d case such as this, we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
