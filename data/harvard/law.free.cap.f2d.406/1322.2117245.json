See Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-20\">The appellant\u2019s sole contention was that it was error to impose the federal sentence while he was serving his state sentence. His presence in federal court was obtained by issuance of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, in response to his <em>pro se </em>motion for a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-9\">Trial proceedings under these circumstances are common, and have been approved in many decisions. E. g., Clark v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 367 F.2d 378; Gardner v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 274 F.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-10\">Other contentions of the appellant need not be discussed herein, since they are alleged for the first time in his appellate briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1387-21\">. In order to establish a docket control procedure, the Fifth Circuit adopted new Rules 17-20 on December 6, 1968. See Wittner v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1165, Fn 1 and Appendix thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
