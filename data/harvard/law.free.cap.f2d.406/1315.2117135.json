It is in the Federal courts solely by reason of diversity of citizenship between the parties. It has one rather unusual situation which was the sole reason for the direction of verdict below in favor of the defendant and is the only question on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-23\">The facts are simple. Plaintiff-appellant is a mechanic who on May 21, 1965 was employed by Sears Roebuck &amp; Company at its place of business in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. His main work was installing automobile tires and batteries. On the particular day he was in the process of putting four summer tires on an automobile. He first removed the four tires which were on the car. Without any complications he then put on three of the new ones. As he was adjusting the fourth tire, it exploded and threw him about six feet away. He was unconscious for a few seconds. He was later taken to the Pittsburgh Hospital where he was given emergency treatment. Robert W. Small, the Sears Service Center Manager at the time, was a witness on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>of the plaintiff. He said he was in the Service building when the explosion occurred and that he rushed from his office to the tire center. Mr. Guenther was on the floor about four feet from the tire machine. There was a tire on the machine. After Mr. Guenther was removed to the ambulance, Mr. Small had the tire taken to his office where he checked out its serial numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">In November 1966, Messrs. Drozness, plaintiff\u2019s expert, and Dunlop, the defense expert, examined the tire in Mr. Small\u2019s office. That tire was in the court at the trial. It was admitted on behalf of the defendant regarding that tire \u201cThis is our tire, our experts have told you that.\u201d Mr. Drozness was called as an expert on behalf of the plaintiff. The defense asked for an offer of proof. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that Mr. Drozness \u201chas already been identified by Mr. Small as having examined the tire involved in the accident. I am going to put him on to testify that it had a broken bead, that he went over the history of the mounting procedure used by Mr. Guenther and as a basis of that, he concludes that this is a manufacturer\u2019s defect.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s query, plaintiff\u2019s attorney continued to outline his theory of the defendant\u2019s liability, stating as to the jury, \u201cIf they accept Small\u2019s testimony and they accept the tire as given by Mr. Drozness which has a broken bead in it and if they are on the basis of a hypothetical inquiry wherein I intend to tell him, repeat how the Plaintiff put it on the machine and everything and that it had no' apparent defects (stet).\u201d The attorney went on to say he expected to develop that in the expert\u2019s opinion the tire had not been damaged by handling and that the broken bead was a manufacturer\u2019s defect. The defense attorney objected to the testimonial offer and was sustained by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">Plaintiff, as a witness, carefully outlined the steps he had taken in mounting the fourth tire. He said that after he had the tire in position and he started to put air into it \u201cWell, it started to come up, the bead, and when it hit the rim it just let loose and exploded.\u201d The tire which Mr. Small had testified was on the machine and which he had brought to his office was a \u201cwhite wall\u201d. Mr. Guenther testified that the tire he was mounting and which exploded was a \u201cblack wall\u201d. He said it was a fifteen inch and that the white wall in court was a thirteen inch. He was asked \u201cHow do you remember that the one you were mounting was black?\u201d He answered \u201cI just remember it was.\u201d He said he remembered it was fifteen inch because the automobile was a Chrysler \u201c55 or 56\u201d which takes \u201c15 inch\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">With respect to the identification of the white wall tire in court, the defense attorney, addressing the court with reference to the proposed evidence of Mr. Drozness, said \u201cHe is going to say he examined a tire, how is he going to identify it?\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel answered, \u201cSmall has already said the tire Drozness examined is the tire in Court.\u201d The judge commented \u201cThat may be sufficient identity if Drozness examined the tire Small produced.\u201d Defense counsel said, \u201cJudge, it seems to me that they are going to rely on Small to establish the identity.\u201d The judge asked \u201cWell, with that offer, do you object to his testimony?\u201d Counsel replied \u201cI certainly do your Honor.\u201d The judge sustained the motion for a directed verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-8\">Later, in denying the motion for a new trial, the judge specifically found as to the tire produced by Sears Roebuck manager Small which was marked as a trial exhibit, that, \u201cThis tire was admittedly manufactured by Defendant. It is this tire which Plaintiff\u2019s expert examined and would testify was defective.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cTo allow this is to fly directly in the face of Plaintiff\u2019s clear and unequivocal denial that this was the tire that injured him. We believe that Plaintiff is bound by this testimony.\u201d The judge therefore upheld his trial conclusion of a directed verdict in favor of the defendant. The lower court decision centered entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>upon the testimony of the plaintiff that it was a \u201cblack wall\u201d tire which exploded, threw him six feet and rendered him unconscious. The accident happened May 21, 1965. The claim was tried in December 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">According to the record, apparently the first time after his accident that plaintiff saw the tire which had been taken from his tire mounting rack was, as the court stated, \u201ca few days prior to trial.\u201d That would have been approximately a year and seven months after Guenther had been injured. Despite that and the facts that he had been knocked unconscious and taken to a hospital for emergency treatment, Guenther said that \u201che just remembered that it was (black).\u201d As a result of the direction of verdict in favor of defendant immediately after plaintiff\u2019s testimony and the offer of proof on his behalf, there was no opportunity to introduce medical testimony of the nature of plaintiff\u2019s injuries and results thereof. Consequently there is nothing in the record that might give a clue to the reason for plaintiff\u2019s alleged mistaken testimony regarding the type of tire which exploded while he was adjusting it. Nor is there anything in the evidence concerning the correctness of plaintiff\u2019s description of the car being retired, as an old Chrysler. This seems also to be subject of doubt as part of the proofs for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">Appellee seeks affirmance of the judgment here on the theory that all that was before the jury gave rise to mere conjecture; that no more than a doubt was offered in the outline of evidence for the plaintiff, which doubt the jury would have been unable to resolve. That is not this case. What we have before us is an endeavor to sustain a ruling that appellant plaintiff is bound by his own testimony'as to the type of tire involved notwithstanding the extremely strong, believable submitted testimony which clearly set out the plenary fact that a particular tire manufactured by defendant-appeljee injured him. Plaintiff\u2019s own evidence was obviously not a judicial admission. It is properly urged that plaintiff\u2019s testimony is simply incorrect in some of its detail; that part of what he stated is adverse to his own interest and if inaccurate is so because he is factually mistaken. This situation did not call for the summary dismissal of his claim. That action was in effect punishment for his patent honesty and for what is asserted to have been his error. In similar circumstances the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Alamo v. Del Rosario, 69 App.D.C. 47, 98 F.2d 328, 331 (1938) held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff in most personal injury cases was subjected, just before he was hurt, to excitement enough to explain mistakes of observation and memory. In many cases, including the present one, he was so badly hurt that he lost consciousness. And even the calmest and most disinterested witness often sees things that did not happen and remembers things that he did not see. \u2018There is no sound reason why the familiar doctrine that a party may contradict, though not impeach, his own witness, should not, if the circumstances are consistent with honesty and good faith, be applied when he is himself the witness. * * In other words, the laiw recognizes the fact that parties, as well as other witnesses, may honestly mistake the truth, and requires juries to find the facts by weighing all the testimony, whatever may be its source. It is rarely that two persons relate alike the same occurrence; and, in cases of accidental injury, it is not unusual for the person injured correctly to perceive and accurately to remember some of the circumstances, and to be unable to give a correct statement of all.\u2019 Hill v. West End Railway Co., 158 Mass. 458, 459, 460, 33 N.E. 582.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atw-dedup-0\">The above decision was followed with approval in Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Pomeroy, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 239 F.2d 435, 443 n. 9 (1957) inter alia. See 169 A.L.R. 810n. The sound principle relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>on in those opinions and which is important in this appeal is that a plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of evidence more favorable to him than his own and in contradiction thereof regarding the details of an event. Massachusetts affirmatively endorses that rule. See Horneman v. Brown, 286 Mass. 65, 190 N.E. 735 (1939). Oregon is to the same effect, Cox v. Jones, 138 Or. 327, 5 P.2d 102 (1932). We have not seen nor has our attention been called to any decisional law to the contrary. Appellee\u2019s citations are inapposite. They do not even pretend to deal with the actual tight issue. Pennsylvania is in complete accord with the principle that a plaintiff\u2019s testimony is not a judicial admission when it \u201c * * * relates to an objective matter about which he might honestly be mistaken, * * * where there is other evidence in the case, including the adverse party\u2019s, which is more favorable to him, even though it conflicts with his own testimony, since a party may be mistaken in his testimony, like any other witness; in other words, a party is regarded as not bound by his own testimony where there is contradictory evidence or circumstances which the trier of facts might fairly believe.\u201d Jerominski v. Fowler, Dick &amp; Walker, 372 Pa. 291, 294, 93 A.2d 433, 435 (1953). This holding was quoted and followed in Readinger v. Gottschall, 201 Pa.Super. 134, 139, 191 A.2d 694 (1963). See also Greater Valley Terminal Corp. v. Goodman, 405 Pa. 605, 608, 176 A.2d 408 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">The foundation of plaintiff\u2019s cause is that he was injured by a bursting tire which he had been adjusting on the tire machine in front of him and which was still on the machine after it had exploded. There is a disagreement between plaintiff and his witness Small as to whether that particular tire was a \u201cblack wall\u201d or a \u201cwhite wall\u201d. On such detail we do not think it is the function of the court to conclude plaintiff\u2019s cause of action by directing a verdict against him. In this instance no reason appears why a jury should not be able to readily resolve the problem in dispute at this time in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">It is also urged for appellant that his claim should have been allowed to go to the jury on his testimony about a black tire. This is founded on evidence that the defendant made from 75 to 80 per cent of the tires the particular Sears Roebuck store had for sale. It is true that the trial court in holding that plaintiff\u2019s evidence of identification failed, relied on Kamosky v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 89 F.Supp. 561 (M.D.Pa. 1950), affd. p. c. 185 F.2d 674 (3 Cir. 1950). It is also true that in Kamosky there was only a 10 to 15 per cent likelihood of liability of the alleged offending article. Even so as we see it there was no justification for allowing plaintiff\u2019s case on that so-called probability hypothesis to go to the jury. The latter\u2019s verdict would at best be a guess. It could not be reasonably supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
