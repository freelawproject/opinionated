S.C. \u00a7 4401 et seq. The district court found that an adding machine, a transistor radio, and $2,988 in currency \u2018 and coin had been used and possessed and intended for use in an illegal wagering business conducted by Walter Sekaly, the owner of the property. Accordingly, these items were forfeited to the Government by the judgment of the court. Having studied the briefs and record, we are firmly convinced that the appeal from the district court\u2019s decision is appropriate for summary disposition without oral argument. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Clerk of this Court has been directed to put this case on the summary calendar and notify the parties in writing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1232-11\">On the basis of the briefs and record, we proceed to the merits. Appellant\u2019s first specification of error is directed toward his arrest, the search of his person, and the search of his business establishment, the Chalet Club. He argues that the official complaint for violation of the Internal Revenue laws, the search warrant, and the warrant for arrest were all void because the United States Commissioner who signed these documents was not presented with a sworn statement embodying the facts essential to show probable cause. Although Robert Sawyer, an Internal Revenue agent, prepared \u00e1 detailed statement which was concededly sufficient to establish probable cause, appellant maintains that the statement was invalid because not sworn to by the agent. However, the agent presented the United States Commissioner with a sworn complaint and a sworn affidavit for search warrant and attached a copy of his statement to both. Moreover, both the sworn complaint and the sworn affidavit for search warrant incorporated the attached statement by clear reference. In our view appellant\u2019s objection was technical and insubstantial and therefore formed no basis for granting his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-14\"> Additionally, it is urged that the search of appellant\u2019s person was invalid because not conducted pursuant to a warrant for arrest. This search produced currency in the amount of $2,022 which was admitted in evidence over objection and forfeited to the Government by the final judgment. Agent Sawyer testified, and the record reflects, that an arrest warrant was issued before he proceeded to the Chalet Club and that he so advised appellant before searching his person. Inasmuch as an officer is not required to have the arrest warrant in his possession when he makes an arrest, we find the contention that the search was not made pursuant to an arrest warrant to be without merit. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 4(c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-15\">The final specification of error relates to the sufficiency of evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>support the finding that certain property was used and intended to be used in violation of the wagering tax provisions. While the trial judge found the evidence insufficient to support forfeiture of certain items involved in the suit, he found the testimony of Agents Sawyer and Blood more than adequate to support forfeiture of the adding machine, transistor radio, and $2,988 in currency and coin. His findings in this regard are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"ayf-dedup-2\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">RULES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">RULE 17</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">DOCKET CONTROL</p>\n<p id=\"A0j-\">In the interest of docket control, the chief judge may from time to time, in his discretion, appoint a panel or panels to review pending cases for appropriate assignment or disposition under Rules 18, 19 or 20 or any other rule of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">RULE 18</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">SUMMARY CALENDAR</p>\n<p id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">(a) Whenever the court, sua sponte or on suggestion of a party, concludes that a ease is of such character as not to justify oral argument, the case may be placed on the summary calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">(2) A separate summary calendar will be maintained for those cases to be considered without oral argument. Cases will be placed on the summary calendar by the clerk, pursuant to directions from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">(c) Notice in writing shall be given to the parties or their counsel of the transfer of the case to the summary calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">RULE 19</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">MOTION TO DISMISS OR AFFIRM</p>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">Within fifteen days after the appeal has been docketed in this court, the ap-pellee may file a motion to dismiss or a motion to affirm.
