The coverage was asserted to procure contribution from State Farm towards reimbursement of Lumbermens for its full satisfaction of a personal injury judgment against Dalton and others. It had been granted Gertrude Southern by the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Virginia on December 18, 1961, in an automobile collision case against Walter and Franklin Crigger, who were responsible for one car\u2019s operation, and Ray Dalton, the driver of the other vehicle. The District Court rejected Lumbermens\u2019 suit, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-21\">This decision was a resolution of the issue directed on remand of the first ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>peal in this case, Lumbermens Mutual Cas. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., 867 F.2d 250, 255 (4 Cir. 1966). There we held that State Farm was Ray Dalton\u2019s insurance carrier, and liable to Lumbermens for contribution, but subject to State Farm\u2019s forfeiture defense. This was that the insured had not complied with the policy\u2019s demand of notice to and cooperation with the insurer, thus cancelling any protection under its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">With comprehensive findings and upon sound conclusions, the District Judge refused Lumbermens\u2019 claim. He determined that State Farm\u2019s insured had flagrantly denied the insurer the cooperation requisite to qualify for the benefits of the policy. We affirm upon the District Court\u2019s opinion, Lumbermens Mutual Cas. Co. v. Harleysville Mutual Cas. Co., 287 F.Supp. 932 (W.D. Va.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
