The indictment is claimed to have been insufficient. This point was not raised in appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, and in any event it is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-23\">It is asserted that the statutes under which appellant was convicted are unconstitutional under Marchetti v.
