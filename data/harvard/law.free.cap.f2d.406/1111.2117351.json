He was sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a study and then appealed. He is presently on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-22\">The record clearly shows this defendant committed the offense. The only real point on appeal is that the trial judge should have applied a different standard on the defense of insanity than that in the M\u2019Naghten rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-23\">This circuit to date has followed a modified M\u2019Naghten rule. Sauer v. United States, 241 F.2d 640 (1957), cert. den. 354 U.S. 940, 77 S.Ct. 1405, 1 L.Ed.2d 1539 (1957); Ramer v. United States, 390 F.2d 564, in banc, (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-24\">Other contentions have been considered and are without merit. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-25\">Since the appellant is on bond, he should be promptly brought before the trial court, his bond exonerated and an order made committing him for the study ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
