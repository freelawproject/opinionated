In that prior art process, N02 is itself converted or reduced to nitric oxide (NO), and the latter gas, after leaving the reaction vessel and removal of water vapor therefrom, is reacted with oxygen in a separate regenerating chamber to again form N02 which is then recycled to the alkyl aromatic oxidation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-19\">Rather than synthesizing or regenerating the N02 oxidizing gas <em>ex situ </em>\u2014 outside the alkyl aromatic oxidation zone\u2014 as in the prior art, appellants feed a mixture of NO and oxygen directly into the alkyl aromatic oxidation zone, forming the desired N02 <em>in situ, </em>as reflected in claim 22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-20\">22. In a process wherein alkyl substituted aromatic compounds are oxidized with nitrogen dioxide in the presence of an inert organic solvent to form the oxidation products thereof, the improvement which comprises generating said nitrogen dioxide in situ by charging nitric oxide and oxygen to the reaction zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-21\">The NO effluent gas may be recovered and, after mixing with oxygen, is recycled directly to the alkyl aromatic oxidation zone. According to the specification, \u201cit is necessary that small increments of NO or N02 be continuously introduced into the closed system\u201d to the extent any NO gas is lost in such a continuous recycling system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>The board agreed with the examiner\u2019s application of the Fetterly,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> O\u2019Neill <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Gilman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *references to the claimed subject matter. After pointing out (1) the various reactions expressly employed by Fetterly and O\u2019Neill to generate N02 both <em>in situ </em>and <em>ex situ </em>in their oxidation processes, as heretofore noted, and (2) the knowledge in the art that NO and oxygen react to produce N02,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the board considered it \u201cclearly obvious to the chemist to employ * * * [the latter] reaction for the liberation of nitrogen dioxide <em>in </em>situ\u201d during the oxidation of the alkyl aromatic compound.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">We think the Patent Office has established a prima facie case of obviousness which appellants\u2019 arguments, unsupported by evidence in the record as they are,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are insufficient to rebut. It seems to us that the prior art of record, rather than leading away from the claimed subject matter as appellants contends, would suggest the process here claimed to one of ordinary skill. Certainly, no reference of record deprecates the use of NO and oxygen mixtures as a feedstock to form N02 under the reaction conditions present in the alkyl aromatic oxidation zone. Nor is there any evidence of record which would give those in the art cause to believe that, as appellants urge, the reaction between NO and oxygen would not take place at sufficient rate and in sufficient amount to form the requisite quantity of N02 needed to effect oxidation under the reaction conditions present in the alkyl aromatic oxidation zone. While we appreciate appellants\u2019 arguments, we are not convinced the subject matter as a whole is unobvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-22\">.

Patent 2,839,575, issued June 17, 1958. Fetterly discloses a process for oxidizing alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds which employs as an oxidizing agent a mixture of molecular oxygen and at least one compound selected from N02, organic nitrates, or organic nitrites. The amount of N02- releasing compounds present at any given time is less than 2% of the weight of the alkyl-substituted aromatic compound being oxidized. As one source of N02, Fetterly employs the \u201cmixture of nitrogen oxides,\u201d presumably N02 and NO, \u201cobtained from the oxidation of ammonia.\u201d Or he may form N02 <em>ex situ, </em>or <em>m situ </em>by thermal degradation of nitric acid vapor, organic nitrates or organic nitrites.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">.
