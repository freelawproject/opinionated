If this is not in fact the case, as asserted by applicant, the mark is then deceptively misdescriptive of the goods and equally prohibited registration under the provisions of Section 2(e) (1) of the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>Whether or not registration to applicant would prevent others from using the words \u201cchew\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d in their normal descriptive sense is not believed to be determinative of the question herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">With due respect to the board\u2019s reasoning, we are unable to agree that the instant mark is so descriptive of the <em>goods </em>to which it is applied as to preclude registration. Granted that \u201cCHEW \u2019N CLEAN\u201d might well, and doubtless does, suggest a possible manner of use of the dentifrice, it is not merely <em>descriptive </em>of the dentifrice <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">We note the board\u2019s statement that if the mark is not merely descriptive, \u201cthe mark is then deceptively misdescriptive of the goods.\u201d We do not think that necessarily follows. The board gives no reason for its conclusion, and we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1449-16\">.
