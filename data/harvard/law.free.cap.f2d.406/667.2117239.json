The sole question raised on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion under Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965), by permitting the Government to cross-examine as to Appellant\u2019s 1963 petit larceny conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-27\">We note preliminarily that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not ask for an on the record <em>Luck, </em>supra,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing. We take this opportunity to reiterate that all treatment and consideration of the Luck-Gordon<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issue must be on the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The failure to place the issue on the record unnecessarily raises the question of whether the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>discretion under <em>Luck-^Gordon </em>was meaningfully invoked.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In any event, we have carefully canvassed the record, and from all that appears we are satisfied that the trial judge gave due consideration to the policy underlying <em>Luck </em>and properly exercised his discretion under 14 D.C. Code \u00a7 305 (1967). Appellant took the stand and denied having stolen the car in question. This testimony directly conflicted with credible testimony offered by the prosecution, making Appellant\u2019s credibility the dispositive issue in the case. \u201c[I]n those circumstances there was greater, not less, compelling reason for exploring all avenues which would shed light on which of the two witnesses was to be believed.\u201d Gordon v. United States, 127 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 348, 383 F.2d 936, 941 (1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1029, 88 S.Ct. 1421, 20 L.Ed.2d 287 (1968). Petit larceny, the conviction admitted here, involves elements of \u201cdeceit, fraud, cheating, or stealing\u201d and as such reflects \u201cadversely on a man\u2019s honesty and integrity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 383 F.2d at 940.
