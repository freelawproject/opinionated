Following counterclaims charging infringement and a course of discovery proceedings, the parties, on February 3, 1967, made a settlement agreement which provided for, and incorporated, the consent decree Broadview has now been found to have violated. Some limited aspects of the patents and of the steps preceding the settlement are germane to the issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The patents cover anaerobic curing sealant compositions which serve to bond metals together in the absence of air (specifically, oxygen) \u2014 e.g., when spread upon the surface of a screw and bolt which, upon being threaded together, exclude air and are thereby made to adhere to each other through the action (polymerization) of the patented composition. In the course of discovery, responding to Loctite\u2019s interrogatories, Broadview listed the 32 formulations, designated by Roman numerals I-XXXII, of the sealant compositions it was making and selling. Thereafter, in a stipulation of facts dated May 31, 1966, the parties agreed in the following language that Loctite\u2019s charges of infringement (and the \u201cissues\u201d generated by such charges) were rested upon three patents and directed against the several formulations, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">\u201cThe claims of Loctite Corporation\u2019s patents which are in issue and are charged to be infringed by Broadview Chemical Corporation products and the Broadview Chemical Corporation products from among the formulations given in the answers to Loctite Corporation\u2019s interrogatories which are charged to infringe the Loctite Corporation patents and which therefore are in issue are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">\n<em>Claims Product Formula No.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ago-dedup-0\">1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 27 of Patent No. 2,895,950 Ill, V-XXVIII inclusive and XXX-XXXII inclusive</p>\n<p id=\"AVC\">1, 2, 4 and 11-14 of Patent No. 3,043,820 IV-VI inclusive IX-XII inclusive XVI, XXIV, XXV, XXVI, XXVIII and XXXII</p>\n<p id=\"APh6\">9 of Patent No. 3,043,820 V, VI, IX-XII inclusive XVI, XXIV, XXV, XXVI, XXVIII and XXXII</p>\n<p id=\"ADt\">1, 2 and 4-6 inclusive of Patent No. 3,046,262 II, III, V and VI\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In other words, Loctite charged that 30 of Broadview\u2019s 32 formulations (Nos. II through XXVIII and XXX through XXXII) infringed one or more of the patents. Two of the formulations, Nos. I and XXIX, were omitted from this listing of \u201cthe Broadview * * * products from among the formulations given in the answers to Loctite Corporation\u2019s interrogatories which [were] charged to infringe * * * and which therefore [were] in issue * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4a\">The settlement agreement of February 3, 1967, among its other relevant aspects, incorporated the stipulated description of the \u201ccharges\u201d and the \u201cissues\u201d in the case, and tied these to the consent decree, by providing (par. 5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ate-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Broadview formulations referred to in the Consent Decree (Exhibit 1) are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">Formulations II through XXVIII inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Formulations XXX through XXXII inclusive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">And the consent decree, as thus described, after announcing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the parties had \u201csettled their differences with respect to the matters in dispute,\u201d adjudged that Broadview had infringed \u201cPatent Nos. 2,895,950; 3,043,820 and 3,046,262 by the manufacture and sale of products made under formulations covered by said Letters Patent * *</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The decree went on to enjoin further infringement of the named patents; to provide that each party would pay its own costs and attorneys\u2019 fees; and to state that there should be no award of damages since Broadview had \u201cmade a monetary payment\u201d ($7,500) to Loctite under the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The peaceful era thus inaugurated was short. In September, 1967, Loctite moved to punish Broadview for contempt of the consent decree, charging that the latter was making and selling named products which infringed claims of Patent No. 3,043,820. Following a hearing and some discovery, Loctite filed a supplemental motion charging as further contumacious acts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">(1) Broadview had \u201cresold substantial quantities of admittedly infringing compositions more than five months after\u201d the signing of the consent decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">(2) Broadview\u2019s present formulations CP-1 through CP-9 were \u201cbut colorable imitations of\u201d prior formulations which had admittedly infringed Patent No. 3,043,820.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">(3) Broadview\u2019s formulations CP-1 to CP-7 infringed Patent No. 3,046,-262.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">After discovery proceedings and three days of evidentiary hearings, Judge Blumenfeld concluded that all the contempt charges should be sustained. He held, first, that the \u201cresales\u201d of the old, admittedly infringing formulations violated the decree. Further, he found that all of Broadview\u2019s assertedly new formulations (identified as CP-1 through CP-9), contrary to the decree\u2019s prohibitions, infringed either Patent No. 3,043,820, or No. 3,046,262, or both. In a detailed opinion, he explained the bases for these determinations and prescribed remedial sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-16\">In its appeal Broadview tenders five questions (we formulate them as four) on which it claims the District Court erred.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We reject all of these contentions save one, the effect of our ruling being to absolve only Broadview\u2019s new compositions CP-8 and CP-9 from the charge of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-18\">As is true of substantially all the District Court\u2019s fact findings, there is no quarrel by Broadview with the findings that: (1) Broadview\u2019s distributors, after the consent decree, began returning the products which had been declared to infringe; (2) Broad-view in some cases resold such returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>products to other distributors; and (3) in other cases, Broadview arranged for direct transfers of such products from one distributor to another, crediting the transferor with what amounted to returns and billing the transferee for purchases. Broadview argues, however, that these post-decree transactions were outside the terms of the injunction because Loctite, in the settlement agreement, had given a standard form of release \u201cof and from any and all actions, causes of action, claims and demands which Loctite Corporation may have against [Broad-view, its officers, customers, etc.] jointly or severally, from the beginning of the world to the date hereof.\u201d The argument is not weighty.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The consent decree adjudged that Broadview had infringed by \u201cmanufacture and sale\u201d of the condemned products. It enjoined such infringement for the future. Cf. Western Lighting Corp. v. Smoot-Holman Company, 352 F.2d 1019, 1022 (9th Cir. 1965). The release, because Broadview was making an agreed payment for the past, waived any claims for infringement, whether by \u201cmanufacture\u201d or \u201csale,\u201d up \u201cto the date\u201d of the settlement. There was no suggestion in the customary language of the release that it was intended to excuse any acts of infringement (whether by manufacture or by sale of products already in existence) after its date. There was no hint of the thought now pressed that the release gave immunity for any future sales or uses of products in existence as of its date. And Broadview introduced no evidence in the contempt hearing to suggest that the parties had intended any such unusual meaning. On the contrary, answering interrogatories during the contempt proceedings, Broad-view\u2019s President said he believed \u201cpart or all\u201d of the infringing products in Broadview\u2019s possession on the date of the consent decree had been \u201cdiscarded or destroyed\u201d and that none had been \u201ctransferred to another for consideration * * * monetary or otherwise.\u201d True or false, these answers were consistent with the terms of the decree and the release, not with the unlikely construction Broadview now proposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Insofar as Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s findings of contempt rest upon his determination that Broadview has, since the consent decree, made and sold compositions infringing Patent No. 3,043,820, Broadview attacks his decision in an elaborate argument charging (1) that he mistakenly failed to consider the prior art and (2) that he improperly limited discovery with respect to the prior art. These interrelated contentions, to which there are short answers, may be summarized briefly for our purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">As Broadview states the starting-point for this line of argument, it is that Patent No. 3,043,820 \u201ccovers compositions including (1) a dimethacrylate (monomer), (2) a hydroperoxide (catalyst), and (3) a quinone (inhibitor).\u201d Elaborating this summary, Broadview stresses that the inclusion of hydroquinone, as distinguished from quinone, \u201cwas old and in the public domain.\u201d Thus, the argument continues, \u201cby using or adding hydroquinone to the accused sealant compositions, Broadview is following the prior art and is not infringing * *</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Insofar as this argument rests upon the specific ingredients of Broadview\u2019s formulations, it is frivolous. All of the admittedly infringing formulations under the consent decree showed hydro-quinone as an ingredient; none showed quinone. Thus, it was obviously not required that quinone appear as a specific ingredient in the formulation in order to make the formulation an infringement. It is not more meritorious to contend, as Broadview does, that the quinone now to be found in its post-decree compositions can only result from the use of hydroquinone and <em>must, </em>therefore, be no more than <em>must have </em>been present in the prior art. The trouble with this undocumented assertion is that it is flatly opposed to Judge Blumen-feld\u2019s finding that Broadview\u2019s products made since the decree contain quinone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>which is not, and cannot be, accounted for by the use of hydroquinone. Without actually assailing that finding, which is solidly grounded in the record, Broad-view argues as if it did not exist. The argument must obviously fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The point about limited discovery regarding the prior art is an even shorter subject. Having examined the pertinent portions of the record, we find that Judge Blumenfeld actually placed no restrictions like those now suggested upon Broadview\u2019s inquiries. Two of the four interrogatories in question were answered to the expressed satisfaction of Broadview\u2019s attorney. The same attorney suggested that rulings on the other two be deferred. His failure thereafter to revive the matter, reflecting its essential triviality, can scarcely ground a claim of error by the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As one of its determinations that the decree had been violated, the District Court found that Broadview\u2019s new formulations CP-1 through CP-7 infringe Patent No. 3,046,262. This patent, informally labelled the \u201csaccharin patent\u201d by the parties, is sufficiently identified for present purposes by (1) its provision for inclusion of a sulfimide (e. g., saccharin) accelerator for rapid curing and (2) its teaching that the composition should \u201cexclude\u201d or be \u201cfree from amines\u201d in order to promote long shelf life. It is undisputed that Broadview\u2019s CP-1 through CP-7 contain saccharin. It is also undisputed that they contain what Broadview describes as a \u201cminor amount of amines\u201d in the range of from 0.025 to 0.05 per cent by weight. In a fruitless discourse on \u201cfile wrapper es-toppel,\u201d Broa'dview undertakes to show that this faint trace of amines, too slight to have any effect of any kind, avoids Loctite\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Coming to grips with the Patent Office history, Loctite has shown persuasively that file wrapper estoppel is not really a relevant concept at all \u2014 that the provision for having the composition \u201cfree from amines\u201d was not inserted in the requisite sense to narrow the claims \u201cin order to obtain the issuance of a patent by distinguishing the prior art * * Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 33, 86 S.Ct. 684, 702, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); see also I. T. S. Rubber Co. v. Essex Rubber Co., 272 U.S. 429, 444, 47 S.Ct. 136, 71 L.Ed. 335 (1926); Waring Products Corp. v. Lan-ders, Frary &amp; Clark, 263 F.2d 160, 165 (2d Cir. 1959). But there is no need for us to linger over that; even if there were in the file wrapper history some ground for arguing that the saccharin patent may not be read upon compositions containing some meaningful amount of amines, the argument becomes a fictional abstraction when it is related to such a tincture of physically insignificant amines as Broadview has used to avoid the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The patent, the file wrapper history, and the evidence before Judge Blumenfeld all had reference to a practice in the prior art of using amines as accelerators in the range of 0.5 to 5.0 per cent by weight. Loctite\u2019s \u2019262 patent taught that such use of amines reduced shelf life and should, therefore, be avoided \u201cwhen shelf life is desired.\u201d Seizing upon words out of context like \u201cfree from amines\u201d or that amines should be \u201cexcluded,\u201d Broadview fashions its estoppel argument by merely referring to its use of a \u201cminor amount of amines,\u201d ignoring the undisputed fact that this \u201cminor amount\u201d is as effective as no amines at all so far as its impact upon shelf life or anything else is concerned. But it is old and obvious learning that a patent may not be avoided by making \u201cunimportant and insubstantial changes and substitutions in the patent which, though adding nothing,\u201d are then put forth as answers to infringement charges. Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 607, 70 S.Ct. 854, 856, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950); see also Bewal, Inc. v. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., 292 F.2d 159, 165-167 (10th Cir. 1961). That essential principle applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>here, as elsewhere. The patent field is not the only one where due enforcement of the law requires penetrating to the substance behind \u201csophisticated as well as simple-minded\u201d devices. Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 275, 59 S.Ct. 872, 876, 83 L.Ed. 1281 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The remaining point, the one on which we sustain Broadview\u2019s appeal, is this: Broadview\u2019s new formulations CP-8 and CP-9 are identical, respectively, with its former Nos. I and XXIX. The latter two, it will be recalled, were the only ones of the total of 32 omitted when Loctite was asked in interrogatories to state which of Broadview\u2019s compositions it accused. Accordingly, when the parties came to stipulate the facts, 30 formulations (II through XXVIII and XXX through XXXII) were listed as those \u201ccharged to infringe\u201d and \u201ctherefore\u201d as being \u201cin issue.\u201d Similarly, the same 30 formulations were described in the settlement agreement as being the ones \u201creferred to in the Consent Decree (Exhibit 1).\u201d The single reference in the consent decree to which that description had to relate was paragraph 3, which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cThat Plaintiff has infringed said United States Letters Patent Nos. 2,-895,950; 3,043,820 and 3,046,262 by the manufacture and sale of products made under formulations covered by said Letters Patent * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Against that background, Broadview urged in the District Court (and here) that Loctite was \u201cestopped\u201d to claim contempt with respect to CP-8 and CP-9, the current replicas of I and XXIX. Rejecting that thesis, Judge Blumenfeld observed that he could not \u201ceither expand or contract the decree,\u201d and went on to note, correctly, that \u201c[n] either the consent decree nor the settlement agreement specifically stated that any of Broad-view\u2019s formulations were non-infringing.\u201d CP-8 and CP-9, he found, while identical to I and XXIX, were \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as former No. IV, which had been accused by Loctite in the proceedings before the decree as an infringement of Patent No. 3,043,820. Moreover, he found, the \u201cdifferences\u201d between CP-8 and CP-9 (or I, and XXIX), on the one hand, and IV, on the other, \u201care not significant.\u201d Accordingly, he concluded, CP-8 and CP-9 infringe because IV, substantially the same, was \u201cadmittedly infringing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Like Judge Blumenfeld, we find unhelpful Broadview\u2019s claim of an estoppel affecting this subject. We conclude, however, that CP-8 and CP-9 may not be held to infringe \u2014 and may not, therefore, supply part of the basis for a contempt order. We rest this conclusion upon what we believe to be a more accurate and persuasive reading of the consent decree, in its context, than that urged by Loctite.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">In the dealings leading to the consent decree the parties had Broadview\u2019s 32 formulations, clearly, explicitly, and steadily before them. Loctite reviewed all of these, and then stated specifically which of the patents (one or more) were claimed to be infringed by each one. It made no claim under any patent against either I or XXIX. The charges against the other 30 were then stipulated as defining the controversy \u2014 as identifying the products \u201cwhich therefore [were] in issue * * Then the consent decree, building upon this framework, resolved the issues by adjudging that the 30 specified formulations were infringements.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">It is true there was no recital that Nos. I and XXIX were \u201cnon-infringing.\u201d Nor was it said expressly that they were \u201cnot in issue.\u201d But the omission of these two formulas had the unmistakable effect of dropping available \u201cissues\u201d and excluding obviously available \u201cdifferences\u201d from those the consent decree was designed to settle. Such striking omissions, in a setting like this, amount to the plainest kind of tacit understanding that the two items not includ\u00e9d were distinguished deliberately and meaningfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Loctite\u2019s contrary view is not supported, but is impaired, by the finding that CP-8, CP-9 and IV (admitted to infringe) \u201care substantially the same and theif differences are not significant.\u201d The same, by definition, had to be true of I, XXIX, and IV when the first two were omitted, and the last one included, in the consent decree. That narrow distinction has every appearance, therefore, of a purposeful and bargained result rather than an oversight. In these circumstances, we cannot read the consent decree as if it included what it omitted\u2014 which is, of course, the result of the interpretation pressed by Loctite.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The order of the District Court is affirmed, except for the finding of contempt with respect to CP-8 and CP-9, which is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> Loctite filed a notice of cross-appeal, evidently designed to assert some question about the relief adjudged for tlie contempt, but was permitted to withdraw it at the oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
