Ferrell, prosecutes this appeal from a judgment of the district court which upheld the denial by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare of her application for the establishment of a period of disability and for the award of disability benefits under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 216(i) and 223(a) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) and 423(a). By direction of the court the case was submitted on briefs without oral argument. Upon review of the record and careful consideration of the briefs we reach the conclusion that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-17\">The determination of the Secretary may be overturned only if it is not based upon substantial evidence. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d has been defined by this court to mean \u201cevidence which a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support a particular conclusion. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d Laws v. Celebrezze, 368 F.2d 640, 642 (4 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-18\">In the instant case the Secretary determined that claimant was able to engage in substantial gainful activity. The district court agreed. Upon the record we find substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s order sustaining the determination of the Secretary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-20\">.
