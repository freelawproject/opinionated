Green, Jr., individually and as an agent of the corporation. The cease and desist order was issued at the close of an administrative proceeding charging the corporation, Dlutz and Green, with engaging in false and deceptive practices in the conduct of the corporation\u2019s business of advertising, repair and sale of automotive transmissions in the District of Columbia, in violation of Section 5(a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dlutz is sole stockholder of the corporation and its president, treasurer and one of three directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">The corporation and Green have not challenged the Commission\u2019s cease and desist order. Dlutz filed this <em>pro se </em>petition for review. He contends that the record does not support the Commission\u2019s findings that he directed and controlled the corporation\u2019s operations and that he had full knowledge of their unlawful nature, and urges that, for that reason, the cease and desist order should not extend to him in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-23\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the evidence supports the Commission\u2019s fact findings, and accordingly they are conclusive. General Foods Corporation v. Federal Trade Commission, 386 F.2d 936, 940 (3 Cir. 1967); Pati-Port, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 313 F.2d 103, 104 (4 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">As to Dlutz\u2019 contention that the Commission\u2019s order is too sweeping, we need only say we can see no basis for so holding in view of the prevailing circumstances. The order is certainly a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>missible one. A similar order was affirmed in <em>Pati-Port.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">For the reasons stated the Commission\u2019s order will be affirmed and enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-25\">. 66 Stat. 632, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
