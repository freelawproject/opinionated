F. Goodrich Company, plaintiff-appellant, by Northwest Industries, Inc., defendant-appellee, was clearly within the discretion of that court. It found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-23\">\u201c * * * no basis upon which it can be fairly contended that this is an instance of irreparable damage or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>jury which warrants the granting of an extraordinary injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The judgment was conditioned upon the filing of the registration statement by the appellee, Northwest Industries, Inc., covering the securities proposed to be offered for the shares of appellant\u2019s stock. Since its entry the registration statement has been filed with the S. E. C. No reason has been advanced by the appellant which would warrant an interference by this court with the District Court\u2019s exercise of discretion and the judgment is hereby affirmed. We otherwise express no opinion as to the merits of the appellant\u2019s various causes of action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
