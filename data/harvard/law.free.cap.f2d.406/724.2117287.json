The complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">The complaint attacked the constitutionality of Florida statutes requiring candidates for political party nomination to state elective office to pay a minimum filing fee and party assessment, e. g., Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 99.092, 103.121 (1967), F.S.A., under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Civil Rights Acts, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. It raised the substantial constitutional question, \u201cto what extent may a State, consistent with equal protection and the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of association, impose restrictions upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>a candidate\u2019s desire to be placed on the ballot?\u201d Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 89 S.Ct. 5, 21 L.Ed.2d 24 (1968) (Warren, C. J., dissenting). Cf. Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 1966, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azh-dedup-0\">When an application for a statutory three-judge court is addressed to a district court, the court\u2019s inquiry is appropriately limited to determining whether the constitutional question raised is substantial, whether the complaint at least formally alleges a basis for equitable relief, and whether the case presented otherwise comes within the requirements of the three-judge statute. Those criteria were assuredly met here, and the applicable jurisdictional statute therefore made it impermissible for a single judge to decide the merits of the case, either by granting or by withholding relief. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 1962, 370 U.S. 713, 715, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794. See also Jackson v. Choate, 5 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 910 [1968],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The case is reversed and remanded with instructions to request the convening of a three-judge court by the Chief Judge of this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
