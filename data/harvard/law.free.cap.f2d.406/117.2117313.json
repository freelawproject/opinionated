Escape from prison interrupts service, and the time elapsing between escape and retaking contribute nothing to the service of the sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The notation complained of is no more than a clerical entry relevant to a determination of the length of the appellant\u2019s actual service. The appellant having alleged no discrepancy between the notation and the actual period of his escapee status, the district court committed no error in denying his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-18\">. The petition was filed pursuant to' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-19\">. The court cited Lloyd v. Heritage, 199 F.Supp. 46 (N.D.Ga.1961), involving forfeiture of \u201cgood time\u201d credits, which may be restored by the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-30\">.
