We believe it clear that the defendant has no case within the statute he seeks to rely on, which involves a special exception and a very different sort of right. Georgia v. Rachel, 1966, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-21\">While, unfortunately, the defendant\u2019s apparent misunderstanding of the law is such that we may not be able to satisfy him that he is laboring under serious misapprehension, we do observe this to be the fact. He has no constitutional right to a \u201cdirect jury trial.\u201d The defendant may lose his license or registration first and get whatever hearing he is ultimately entitled to afterward. This seems to be the true effect of the state procedure, if it be assumed, which we need not decide, that he is entitled to a jury trial on this issue. Such order of events is not unconstitutional. See Wall v. King, 1 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 878, 883, cert. denied 346 U.S. 915, 74 S.Ct. 275, 98 L.Ed. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
