The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nevada. Pacheco v. State, 82 Nev. 172, 414 P.2d 100, one judge dissenting. On February 20, 1968, Pacheco filed the instant application for a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-23\">Three grounds for habeas relief were asserted, namely: (1) prejudicial information came to several members of the state trial jury through newspaper articles reporting on the trial; (2) the prosecutor in his closing argument to the jury referred to Pacheco as a \u201cmad dog,\u201d and (3) inflammatory photographs were introduced by the prosecution and admitted in evidence. These same grounds had been urged and rejected in the state appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-25\">The district court issued an order to show cause, respondent warden made return thereto and moved to dismiss the proceeding. Several exhibits, including the state trial court record, were attached to the return. Pacheco filed a reply to the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-26\">The papers referred to above presented no question of fact as to any of the asserted grounds for relief, other than the ultimate issue of whether Pacheco had a fair trial. Based upon its examination of the pleadings and exhibits, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the application. Pacheco v. Hocker, D.Nev., 295 F.Supp. 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">We affirm for the reasons stated in the district court opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
