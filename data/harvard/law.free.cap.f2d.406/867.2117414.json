Wright v. City of Montgomery, Alabama, M.D.Ala., 1968, 282 F.Supp. 291, 292. The present phase of this litigation was commenced on November 8, 1966, and on November 9, 1966, the District Court entered an order denying a temporary injunction restraining the state prosecutions. On appeal to this Court, we vacated the order of the District Court and remanded for adjudication of the issues not previously decided in Forman v. City of Montgomery, supra. Upon consideration of our order of remand, the District Court found \u2014and we agree \u2014 that the only issues not foreclosed by Forman v. City of Montgomery, supra, are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-9\">\u201c(1) Whether Sections 18, 36 and 59, Chapter 20, Montgomery City Code, are unconstitutional on their face in that they (a) are so vague and lacking in standards as to compel men of ordinary intelligence to guess at their meaning, and/or (b) are so broad in their sweep as to have a chilling and deterring effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-10\">\u201c(2) Whether this is a proper case for the exercise of federal equity jurisdiction and the granting of an injunction enjoining the prosecution of these plaintiffs under the said statutes, and further enjoining the defendants from the enforcement of or prosecution under the said statutes generally.\u201d Wright v.

Proceeding to the specific ordinances in question, the Montgomery \u201cDisorderly Conduct\u201d ordinance states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person in the city to disturb the peace of others by violent, profane, indecent, offensive or boisterous conduct or language, or by conduct calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkR\">In Hanson v. State, 42 Ala.App. 409, 166 So.2d 886 (1964) (per curiam), the Court of Appeal of Alabama interpreted a similar ordinance as not encompassing, a</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7c\">peaceful civil rights march along a public highway, where the marchers carried placards. In Mitchell v. State, 41 Ala.App. 254, 260, 130 So.2d 198, 204 (1961), the Alabama Court of Appeals stated that \u201cbeing strutty, puffing up one\u2019s cheeks and jamming one\u2019s hands into his trouser pockets as though he were Napoleon may disturb the peace of some people, <em>but the standard for disturbance must be confined to conduct which is violent, menacing, or imports provocation to make another commit an actual breach of the peace.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See Ellis v. Pratt City, 113 Ala. 541, 21 So. 206 (1897); Donahey v. City of Montgomery, 43 Ala.App. 20, 178 So.2d 832 (1965). To hold otherwise \u201c* * * would in our opinion establish a precedent which would make dangerous free expression and subject all citizens to possible harassments never contemplated by our statutes and constitutions.\u201d Murray v. State, 32 Ala.App. 305, 307, 25 So.2d 704, 705 (1946). Considering the construction given the \u201cDisorderly Conduct\u201d ordinance by the Alabama courts, a construction which in effect limits the application of the ordinance to violent and menacing conduct or conduct which tends to provoke menacing and violent conduct, we find that this ordinance is a reasonable regulatory measure which embodies a legitimate and substantial state interest without unnecessarily invading the area of protected freedoms.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, the decisions of the Alabama courts in Hanson v. State, 42 Ala.App. 409, 166 So.2d 886 (1964), and Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>v. State, 41 Ala.App. 254, 130 So.2d 198 (1961), draw a distinction between peaceful protest, which is constitutionally protected, and violent and menacing protest which is not, and this distinction is sufficiently unambiguous to give reasonable notice of what is prohibited as well as to apprise the judge and jury of the proper standards for determining culpability thereunder. See Cox v. State of Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 85 S.Ct. 453 (1965); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680 (1963); United States v. Woodard, 7 Cir., 1967, 376 F.2d 136; Devine v.

The Montgomery \u201cDisorderly Conduct\u201d ordinance is neither impermissively broad nor unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The Montgomery \u201cLoitering\u201d and \u201cFailure to Obey\u201d ordinances read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-6\">\u201cNo person, after being warned by a police officer, shall loiter on the sidewalks in the city in front of business establishments, public buildings or houses of worship, nor shall any person sit upon or lean against the walls around residences in the city, without obtaining the consent of the owner-, occupant or person in control of such premises.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for anyone to fail to obey the direction or order of a member of the police department of the city while such member is acting in an official capacity in carrying out his <em>duties.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Despite its somewhat broad language, the \u201cLoitering\u201d ordinance \u201cis clearly directed at loitering so \u2018as to obstruct free passage over, on or along [any] street or sidewalk.\u2019 \u201d Smith v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala.App. 467, 468n., 168 So.2d 35, 37n. (1964) (interpreting an ordinance substantially identical to the Montgomery \u201cLoitering\u201d ordinance). Alabama decisions \u201cmake it clear that the mere refusal to move on after a police officer\u2019s requesting that a person standing or loitering should do so is not enough to support the offense. That there must also be a showing of the accused\u2019s blocking free passage is the ratio decidendi * * * .\u201d Middlebrooks v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala.App. 525, 527, 170 So.2d 424, 426 (1964). Cf. Shelton v. City of Birmingham, 42 Ala.App. 371, 165 So. 2d 912 (1964). Thus, we reach the same conclusions as the Supreme Court reached in Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 90-93, 86 S.Ct. 211, 213-214 (1965), where that Court ruled on the constitutionality of similar Birmingham ordinances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-13\">\u201cLiterally read, therefore, the second part of this ordinance says that a person may stand on a public sidewalk in Birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of that city. The constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration. [Citations omitted.] It \u2018does not provide for government by clearly defined laws, but rather for government by the moment-to-moment opinions of a policeman on his beat.\u2019 Cox v. State of Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 559, 579, 85 S.Ct. 453, 466, 469, 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 471, 487 (separate opinion of Mr. Justice Black). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-14\">\u201cThe matter is not one which need be exhaustively pursued, however, because, * * * the Alabama Court of Appeals has not read \u00a7 1142 literally, but has given to it an explicitly narrowed construction. The ordinance, that court has ruled, \u2018is directed at obstructing the free passage over, on or along a street or sidewalk by the manner in which a person accused stands, loiters or walks thereupon. Our decisions make it clear that the mere refusal to move on after a police officer\u2019s requesting that a person standing or loitering should do so is not enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>to support the offense. * * * \u2019 Mid-dlebrooks v.

City of Montgomery, Alabama, M.D.Ala., 1968, 282 F.Supp. 291, 293. Briefly, the appellants, many of whom are either staff members or are associated with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), came to Montgomery, Alabama, in March 1965 in order to protest against discrimination in the field of voting rights, and subsequently, they were arrested and charged with violating city ordinances. In Criminal Case No. 11,727-N, 7 appellants were arrested on March 11, 1965, and charged with disorderly conduct in violation of Montgomery City Code Ch. 20, \u00a7 18. Four of these appellants refused to proceed along a route designated by city police officers and \u201cwent limp\u201d and lay down in the middle of the street. Three of these appellants, being refused permission to join the former group, \u201cwent limp\u201d on the sidewalk adjacent to the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, and refused to leave upon being ordered to do so by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">In Criminal Case No. 11,728-N, 70 individuals were arrested on March 18, 1965, \u2022for failing to obey the orders and di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>rections of a police officer when they picketed and paraded on one of the main streets of Montgomery, blocking traffic for approximately one and one-half hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">In Criminal Case No. 11,729-N, 31 individuals were arrested on March 19, 1965, and charged with \u201cloitering\u201d on a sidewalk. These appellants had marched to the Montgomery, Alabama, City Hall, to protest the arrest of the appellants named in Criminal Case No. 11,728-N, and they were permitted to picket for approximately eight hours. They were arrested only after they had ceased picketing and had begun sitting upon and blocking the sidewalks surrounding the City Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In Criminal Case No. 11,730-N, city police officers arrested 6 individuals for failing to obey an order of a police officer when they continued to parade and march on Montgomery city streets after having been warned and ordered not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In Criminal Cases Nos. 11,731-N, 11,732-N and 11,733-N, a total of 51 persons were arrested in three groups for failure to obey police officers. These appellants had been parading and picketing on Montgomery city streets near the State Capitol, and were blocking the regular flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Upon their refusal to remove themselves from the street and to use the sidewalks, they were arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b934-11\">.

Thus, if the ordinances herein attacked are reasonable regulatory measures on their face, appellants are not entitled to declaratory relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\">. The concept of reasonableness, in the context of the permissible scope of statutes regulating demonstrations and marches, has been conceived of as a balancing of interests between the state and the demonstrators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-18\">\u201cDemonstrations will sometimes conflict with the state\u2019s interest in pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>venting violence or abuse of property, and the state should be permitted to maintain the free flow of traffic and to insure that public facilities serve the needs and convenience of other citizens. * * * Although Mr. Justice Black apparently feels that the state may impose blanket prohibitions on demonstrations [citing Cox v. State of Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 559, 85 S.Ct. 453, 466 (Mr. Justice Black, concurring in part and dissenting in part)], the prevailing view seems to be that the state may impose only \u2018reasonable\u2019 restrictions on time, place, duration, or manner [citing Cox v. State of Louisiana, supra (majority opinion)]. The \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a regulatory measure must necessarily be viewed in terms of the competing interests of the demonstrators and the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Note, Regulation of Demonstrations, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 1773, 1774 (1967), citing, inter alia, Cox v.
