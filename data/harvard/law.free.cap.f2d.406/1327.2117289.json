Ltda. (Weinstock), a manufacturer in Colombia, sued American Aniline and Extract Company, Inc. (Aniline) under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act for damages, alleging that Aniline had sold it Ethylene Dimethacrylate which had polymerized and was unfit for use.

Grace pleaded the one year statute of limitations of the Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(6). The court below decided the issue in favor of Grace and dismissed the suit as to it. Aniline has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-25\">The liability of Aniline to Weinstock remains undecided. The court below en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>tered no order pursuant to Rule 54(b), Fed.R.Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C., and the suit involves multiple parties and possibly multiple claims all of which have not been adjudicated.
