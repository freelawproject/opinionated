On the basis of the briefs and record, we have concluded that the case is appropriate for summary disposition without oral argument. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Clerk of this Court has been directed to put the case on the summary calendar and notify the parties in writing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-19\">When <em>Thompson v. White </em>was first before this Court, we remanded for an evidentiary hearing in the federal district court on the ground that the evidence of record did not establish probable cause for the entry and search. 391 F.2d 724. In brief, the evidence available on the first appeal was that the police officers in New Orleans went to the Gladstone Hotel after receiving a telephone tip. There they talked with a man who said that a maid, while cleaning one of the rooms, had seen what she believed to be a narcotics outfit fall out of a shirt pocket. The officers established a surveillance and saw appellant and his wife go in the room at about 1:00 P.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>Thereafter, they decided to enter without a warrant because they were having difficulty finding a judge to sign one and feared that if they waited the evidence would be destroyed. Without announcing themselves, they entered the room through an unlocked door and found narcotics. In reversing for a hearing, we held that information from an unknown source or a source unverified as to its consistent reliability does not establish probable cause. We added, however, that the veracity of an unknown informer can be sufficiently determined by the searching officers\u2019 personal observation of some activity which is consistent with the tip but which would appear harmless without it. In order to sustain the search, it was the State\u2019s duty at the subsequent hearing to show that the police had some evidence besides a tip from a source unverified as to its reliability. After the hearing, the district court decided that a sufficient showing had been made and therefore denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">As we read the transcript from the court below, very little, if anything, was added to the evidence that was before the original panel. The officers talked to the manager of the Gladstone Hotel who said that a maid had seen what- she thought was a narcotics outfit in one of the rooms. They also questioned the maid, but she was nervous and not very helpful. They set up a surveillance and saw appellant and his wife go in the room. About forty-five minutes later, they made a warrantless, unannounced entry and search. The only additional evidence to which the State can point is Officer Pavalora\u2019s testimony that Appellant Melvin Thompson was a known addict. The State interprets this to mean that appellant was recognized as an addict before he went in the room. It is argued that this identification together with the maid\u2019s tip established probable cause. However, Officer Favalora was not on the surveillance team because he was out trying to find a judge to sign the search warrant. He rejoined the officers at the hotel in time for the entry and search, but he could not have seen appellant to identify him before he got inside the room. From the standpoint of establishing probable cause, this, of course, was too late. Officer Lamp-ard, the only other officer to testify, said nothing to indicate that he identified appellant as an addict when appellant and his wife were getting out of their car and going up to the hotel room. In fact, the only reason he gave for deciding to enter was that he feared that whatever evidence there might be would be destroyed if they waited any longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">It is our conclusion that at the hearing in the court below the State failed to develop any concrete evidence to bolster the tip from the maid, a source unverified as to reliability. Therefore, we must reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus unless the State elects to retry appellant within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">RULES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">RULE 17</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">DOCKET CONTROL</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">In the interest of docket control, the chief judge may from time to time, in his discretion, appoint a panel or panels to review pending eases for appropriate assignment or disposition under Rules 18, 19 or 20 or any other rule of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">RULE 18</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">SUMMARY CALENDAR</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-16\">(a) Whenever the court, sua sponte or on suggestion of a party, concludes that a case is of such character as not to justify oral argument, the case may be placed on the summary calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-17\">(2) A separate summary calendar will be maintained for those cases to be considered without oral argument.
