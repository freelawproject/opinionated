Thereafter, the Supreme Court announced its decisions in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967), Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968). The Supreme Court has now vacated our decision of November 20, 1967, and directed us to reconsider the petitioners\u2019 appeal in the light of its above cited decisions. Bates v. Nelson, 393 U.S. 16, 89 S.Ct. 50, 21 L.Ed.2d 21 (Oct. 14, 1968). We think it appropriate that the District Court should have the first opportunity to reconsider the problems in the light of newly announced principles which now apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The District Court\u2019s order denying the appellants\u2019 petitions for habeas corpus will be vacated, and the District Court will conduct such further proceedings as are required by the Supreme Court\u2019s directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
