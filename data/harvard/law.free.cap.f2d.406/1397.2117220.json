Appellant\u2019s opposition is based on its registration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and prior use of \u201cKitty\u201d also for cat food.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-27\">The only issue before us is whether \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d so resembles \u201cKitty,\u201d as to be likely, when both marks are applied to cat food, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive under section 2 (d) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)). Appellee attempts to introduce another issue by attacking the validity of appellant\u2019s mark and the registration thereof. Specifically, appellee asserts that \u201cKitty\u201d as applied to cat food \u201cis merely descriptive and generic * * and is incapable of exclusive appropriation,\u201d all but one page of appellee\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>en-page argument being addressed to this contention. We think it sufficient merely to point out that the validity of the registration of a mark may be tested only by a cancellation proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contour Chair-Lounge Co. v. Englander Co., 51 CCPA 833, 324 F.2d 186, 139 USPQ 285 (1963) and Manchester (Home &amp; Export) Ltd. v. Printz Biederman Co., 35 CCPA 1245, 168 F.2d 758, 78 USPQ 149 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">On the way to holding that there is no likelihood of confusion between \u201cKitty\u201d and \u201cPretty Kitty,\u201d the board stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-5\">In light * * * of the <em>obvious meaning of the word \u201cKITTY\u201d as applied to food for cats and/or kittens </em>and the fact that this word has been adopted by others as a part of their marks for eat food, opposer\u2019s mark is obviously entitled to a limited scope of protection. See: The Murray Corporation of America v. Red Spot Paint and Varnish Co., Inc., * * * and The Fleetwood Company v. Mende * * *.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">We agree with appellant that the emphasized passage is somewhat obscure, but we assume it was merely intended \u25a0to be a recognition that \u201cKitty\u201d is not entirely arbitrary as applied to cat food, inasmuch as it is one of the names often given to the ultimate consumer of the product. Clearly, however, the word \u201ckitty\u201d is not descriptive of cat food or suggestive of any quality or property thereof. Although it is sometimes meaningful to speak of marks as being \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cstrong,\u201d or \u201csuggestive\u201d or \u201carbitrary,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we should not lose sight of the ultimate question that must be answered, namely, whether there is a likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">In the present situation, notwithstanding the \u201cobvious meaning\u201d of \u201cKitty\u201d and use of this word or a misspelling thereof in marks of other eat food manufacturers, we disagree with the board insofar as it concluded that confusion is unlikely when \u201cKitty\u201d and \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d are both applied to cat food.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">The decision of the board is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1461-17\">.

Appellee did initiate sueli a cancellation proceeding (No. 8,400) to cancel the registration of \u201cKitty\u201d which appellant relies on here. The petition to cancel, however, was dismissed by the board, 151 USPQ 647, apparently because of the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-10\">Not only does the majority of [appellant\u2019s] advertising promote \u201cKITTY\u201d <em>as a trademark </em>for its products but there is evidence of record that <em>it is recognised as such by purchasers. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-22\">Appellee has not appealed from, the board\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1462-23\">. 47 CCPA 1152, 280 F.2d 158, 126 USPQ 390 (1960) and 49 CCPA 907, 298 F.2d 797, 132 USPQ 458 (1962), respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1462-24\">.
