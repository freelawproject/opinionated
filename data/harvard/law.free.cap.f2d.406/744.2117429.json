Appellants brought this action in the district court pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq., against The Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees (hereinafter \u201cBrotherhood\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They sought certain injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages for breach of the duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">The district court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Brotherhood did not act in bad faith and was not guilty of \u201chostile discrimination\u201d in failing to obtain Central Region rates of pay for Eastern Region tallymen, or in failing to seek in-junctive or other relief provided by the Railway Labor Act under the circumstances of the closing of the Philadelphia Transfer Freight Station. Having found an absence of hostile discrimination in the Brotherhood\u2019s dealings with and representation of the appellants, the district court quite properly refused to hold that the Brotherhood breached its duty of fair representation. See Gainey v. Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks Freight Handlers Exp. &amp; Station Emp., 313 F.2d 318 (C.A. 3, 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">The central issue on this appeal is whether the district court \u201cclearly erred\u201d in finding an absence of hostile discrimination. As stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-19\">\u201c * * * A finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">See also, Valdesa Compania Naviera, S.A. v. Frota Nacional de Petroleiros, 348 F.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>2d 33 (C.A. 3, 1965); Robert H. Fox Co. v. Keystone Driller Co., 232 F.2d 831 (C.A. 3, 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record in this case in light of the <em>Gypsum </em>rule, and we are constrained to hold that the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Accordingly, the order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-14\">. When appellants initiated this action in February, 1963, they sued the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as well as the Brotherhood. Both defendants subsequently succeeded in obtaining a stay of proceedings until appellants paid the costs of prior proceedings against them. Appellants paid the costs to the Brotherhood, but not to the Railroad, and there have been no further proceedings against the Railroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-18\">. In view of our disposition of this appeal we need not reach either appellants\u2019 request for a mandatory injunction or the issue of the applicable statute of limitations (or laches).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
