Anderson\u2019s only claim of error is that the court incorrectly overruled his objections to some remarks of the prosecutor during the prosecutor\u2019s summation to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-19\">The prosecutor described Anderson as a narcotics salesman who was carrying commercial quantities of contraband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s statements were supported by inferences fairly to be drawn from the evidence. When he was arrested, Anderson had in his possession almost an ounce of marijuana and over 500 pills. (Cf. United States v. Thomas (7th Cir. 1965) 345 F.2d 431.) The statements were responsive to defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury that Anderson\u2019s possession of two classes of contraband, one of which \u201ccalms you down\u201d and \u201cthe other speeds you up,\u201d was consistent with his story that he was carrying the drugs at the request of a person who purported to be a government agent. (Cf. Gray v. United States (9th Cir. 1967) 394 F.2d 96, 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-20\">The prosecutor also remarked, \u201cIf you want to accept stories like this, let the traffic continue, it is your business, it is your country.\u201d This mild and fleeting remark did not deprive Anderson of a fair trial. (United States v. Williams (6th Cir. 1963) 319 F.2d 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1121-22\">. The prosecutor said: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t a salesman have two different types of merchandise, amphetamine, benzedrine, and a little sample of marijuana? Those are commercial quantities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
