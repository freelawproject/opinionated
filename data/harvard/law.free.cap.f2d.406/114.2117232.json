Appellant, R. G. Barry Corporation, plaintiff below, is the owner of two United States trademarks, \u201cAngel Treads\u201d (used in connection with scuffs or slippers for women and men) and \u201cAngelite\u201d (used for soles for scuffs or slippers for women and men). Plaintiff began first using the \u201cAngel Treads\u201d mark in 1948 and first began using the \u201cAngelite\u201d mark in 1954. Plaintiff has engaged in extensive manufacturing and advertising with regard to products sold under these marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">Appellee, Sandler Company, first began using the term \u201cAngel Touch\u201d in 1961 (in connection with pumps and step-ins for women and misses). Although \u201cAngel Touch\u201d has never been used in connection with slippers or scuffs by appellee, the record indicates that Sandler\u2019s goods are sometimes sold in the same stores as Barry\u2019s \u2014 and in the same departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">The parties stipulated the facts in the district court action; those stipulations, along with the exhibits and the testimony of one defense witness constituted the sole evidence before the district court. The trial court, in a Memorandum consisting of twelve separately numbered findings, dismissed Barry\u2019s complaint, stating that Sandler had not infringed Barry\u2019s marks and was not in unfair competition with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">Aside from appellant\u2019s objections to certain factual findings, which we note briefly in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> its major contentions are that the district court erred in underestimating the similarity between the impressions conveyed by Barry\u2019s trademarks and Sandler\u2019s term \u201cAngel Touch\u201d, in finding that \u201cAngel Treads\u201d is not \u201carbitrary, unique or fanciful\u201d and in making the following additional findings to support its ultimate conclusion that there was no likelihood of confusion on the part of ordinarily prudent customers: (1) that \u201cAngel Treads\u201d is a weak mark; (2) that it has not acquired a secondary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>meaning; (3) that Barry\u2019s slippers and scuffs are significantly unlike Sandler\u2019s shoes; (4) that the two product lines have a marked difference in price; (5) that the two lines are merchandised differently; and (6) that the two lines are promoted with the use of the two firms\u2019 significantly different house-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We hold that the district court applied the proper standards and that its findings are consonant with both the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It is of course apparent that, standing alone, the two terms, \u201cAngel Tread\u201d and \u201cAngel Touch\u201d are similar in appearance and sound, and suggest softness and lightness. Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 729(a). Were \u201cAngel Tread\u201d a strong mark, i. e., one so arbitrary, fanciful, and unique that its use through promotion had come to symbolize the source of origin rather than a not very extraordinary description of the qualities of the product, the court might not have been justified in looking further. But it was justified in finding this a weak mark, taking into consideration its suggestiveness, Barry\u2019s own insistence before the Patent Office that its two-word combination significantly set it apart from a prior mark for the single word \u201cAngel\u201d, the plethora of other registrations of composite \u201cAngel\u201d trademarks and the use of a number of such marks in the retail clothing business. That Barry\u2019s sales and advertising expenditures were substantial did not compel a finding by the court that the mark was strong.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The court was therefore justified in going beyond a side-by-side comparison of names and considering other matters likely to influence prospective purchasers. Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 729(e). It had no evidence before it of any actual confusion on the part of customers, despite widespread use of the term \u201cAngel Touch\u201d by Sandler throughout the United States for several years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It made careful findings, supported by the evidence, that not only had Sandler not used its term on scuffs or slippers, but that its \u201cAngel Touch\u201d shoes were much more expensive, and, in contrast to Barry\u2019s \u201cimpulse-buying items\u201d (which had sometimes been advertised and sold as \u201cnotions\u201d) had to be specially fitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">A factor which appears to us to have exceptional significance is that the court found that Sandler often and Barry \u201cin almost every instance\u201d conjoined their respective \u201chousemark\u201d\u2014 \u201cSandler\u201d, \u201cMiss Sandler\u201d, \u201cSandler of Boston\u201d, or a fanciful design of a cobbler, or, \u201cBarry\u201d \u2014 with the term \u201cAngel Touch\u201d or the trademark \u201cAngel Tread.\u201d In short, the housemark rather than the trademark or product seems to have been relied upon to reveal the source of origin. Cf. John Morrell and Co. v. Reliable Packing Co., 295 F.2d 314, 317 (7th Cir. 1961). Our own viewing of the exhibits revealed not only the general practice of combining product name and housemark, but the consistent use of a simulated calligraphy by Barry and standard type by Sandler.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">What we have said with reference to appellant\u2019s mark \u201cAngel Tread\u201d applies <em>a fortiori </em>to its other mark in issue, \u201cAngelite.\u201d And in affirming the court\u2019s findings and conclusions on the trademark infringement count, we have similarly disposed of the unfair competition count, for there has been no evidence of any other factors than those we have discussed which would have bearing on such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-14\">. Finding No. 1 stated that Barry\u2019s registrations \u201cspecifically limit the marks to \u2018scuffs or slippers\u2019 \u201d. This is attacked as evidencing a belief by the court that a trademark protects no more than the precise goods specified. We think it clear that the court\u2019s language here and elsewhere is consistent with the rebuttable presumption limitation provisions of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">Findings No. 3 and 7 are attacked as having no basis in the record. Our review of the record reveals a sufficient basis for both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. To refer to some of our own prior decisions, we observe that the two terms we mainly deal with here are comparable in strength \u2014 or weakness \u2014 to the terms, \u201cJewelite\u201d and \u201cGemlite\u201d, which we considered in Pro-Phy-Lac-Tic Brush Co. v. Jordan Marsh Co., 165 F.2d 549 (1st Cir. 1948) and are weaker than \u201cEsquire\u201d to which we gave some protection in Esquire, Inc. v. Esquire Slipper Manufacturing Co., 243 P.2d 540 (1st Cir. 1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-14\">. The only evidence of confusion was the deposition of a department store copywriter who once wrote an advertisement for Sandler\u2019s product, erroneously calling it \u201cAngel Tred Kiltie\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
