We find no error, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-19\">Under its Plant Rule 7, Campbell discharged Bruno Kmiec, after his conviction on a guilty plea to a misdemeanor violation of the Illinois gambling laws for taking bets on its premises. Plaintiff Union,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by virtue of its bargaining agreement with Campbell and for the benefit of member Bruno Kmiec, filed a grievance seeking restoration of Kmiec to his position with full back pay. Campbell denied the grievance and the matter was submitted to arbitration. The stipulated arbitration issue was: \u201cWas the discharge of Bruno Kmiec * * * for cause and if not, what remedy is appropriate?\u201d The arbitrator found Kmiec was not discharged for cause and awarded him restoration to his former position without impairment of seniority, but denied him back pay. Campbell refused to reinstate Kmiec, and the Union brought this suit under Sec. 301(a) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Campbell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>answered, relying upon its authority to discharge under Rule 7 and the bargaining agreement, and counterclaimed to vacate the award as invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">Both parties made motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Campbell\u2019s motion and on authority of Local 453, Int. Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. Otis Elevator Co., 314 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1963), granted summary judgment for the Union, ordering Campbell to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s award, and ordering the arbitrator to determine what, if any, back pay is due because of Campbell\u2019s non-compliance. Campbell\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">The issue was submitted by mutual action of the parties and no claim is made that the arbitration was not conducted properly. The arbitrator found these facts: Kmiec had been a Campbell sheet metal worker since 1946, and had been a Union steward for several years before his discharge. He was arrested in the plant on February 23, 1966, under a charge of \u201ckeeping a book\u201d for gambling. He was suspended the same day. The original charge, a felony, was reduced to a misdemeanor in the Cook County Criminal Court on March 22, 1966. Kmiec pleaded guilty, was fined $100.00 and placed on probation for one year. Campbell fired him on March 31 for violation of Rule 7 of Campbell\u2019s Rules for Personal Conduct, which called for a discharge for the first offense of violating any penal law on the Campbell premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">Campbell challenges the arbitrator\u2019s authority to decide Kmiec was not discharged for cause, and to award reinstatement, find him subject to discipline but lessen the penalty imposed by virtue of Campbell Rule 7. It insists that the arbitrator\u2019s award is not drawn from the collective bargaining agreement and that he imposed his own brand of industrial justice\u201d which contravenes the rule in United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). We think it is clear from the issue submitted to the arbitrator that he was faithful to his obligation and substantially followed the Supreme Court guidelines in <em>Enterprise. </em>Local 7-644, Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers v. Mobil Oil Co., 350 F.2d 708, 711 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 986, 86 S.Ct. 563; 15 L.Ed.2d 474 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\">In considering whether Kmiec was discharged \u201cfor cause, and <em>if not, </em>what remedy is appropriate,\u201d (emphasis added) the arbitrator discussed the contentions of the Union and Campbell in relation to Company Rules 7<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 30<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which are promulgated under Campbell\u2019s reserved right in Sec. XIII of the labor agreement to \u201cdischarge or discipline for cause.\u201d He first rejected the Union contentions that Kmiec, a twenty-year employee, was unaware of Rules 7 and 30, and that there was no proof of Kmiec\u2019s offense being committed on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">The arbitrator then resolved an apparent \u201cambiguity\u201d in considering the rules together. He found that Rule 30\u2019s \u201crelatively mild punishment\u201d for a gambling offense on the Company premises \u201cpulled the rug\u201d from under the Company\u2019s contention that a gambling offense was of the \u201cutmost gravity.\u201d He decided that the reasonableness of the Rule 7 provision of discharge of \u201cany penal law\u201d could be challenged where the Illinois penal laws ranged from \u201cmurder to nuisance\u201d and the discharge applied to a minor offense as well as to a serious one. He stated that \u201cwith respect to gambling\u201d the penalties under the two rules were disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>The arbitrator upon these considerations thought it fitting to take account of the \u201cnature and extent\u201d of Kmiec's offense and his employment background with Campbell. He found one lesser offense and four warnings the only blemishes on an otherwise \u201cby and large * * * very good\u201d record of twenty years of continuous service. He recognized that Kmiec was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to some punishment. But he thought the year\u2019s probation granted at the trial of the gambling offense \u201crationalizes keeping in effect * * * at least for the probation period,\u201d the suspension imposed by Campbell after Kmiec\u2019s conviction. On the basis that Kmiec had \u201clearned his lesson\u201d the arbitrator decided that the discharge should be converted to a suspension. The award ordered forthwith reinstatement of Kmiec to his job with seniority unimpaired but without back pay from the date of his offense to the date of his reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">In Textile Workers Union of America v. American Thread Co., 291 F.2d 894, 899 (4th Cir. 1961), the court said the arbitrator found implicitly that there was just cause for the discharge. The court, Judge Sobeloff dissenting, held that the arbitrator went beyond the terms of submission and that his award which undertook to impose a lesser discipline than discharge should not be enforced. There the discharge was for failure to properly perform the work. This was specified in the bargaining agreement as just cause for discharge. The bargaining contract prohibited the arbitrator from making an award affecting a change, modification, or addition to the agreement. Those provisions are not in the agreement before us and, moreover, the arbitrator here express!y found no just cause for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">The court in Truck Drivers and Helpers Union v. Ulry-Talbert Co., 330 F.2d 562 (8th Cir. 1964), found that a narrowly restricted arbitration clause precluded the arbitrator from finding the Company justified in disciplining the employee while also finding the discharge an excessive penalty. Similarly, in the recent Local 342, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers v. T. R. W., Inc., 402 F. 2d 727 (6th Cir., Oct. 23, 1968), a restrictive arbitration clause was held to preclude the arbitrator from disapproving exercise of the employer right of discharge. The principal distinction between these cases and the case before us is that here there is no restrictive clause expressly limiting the function and power of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">We think that the parties relied upon the arbitrator to \u201cbring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution\u201d of the issue under an admittedly broad arbitration clause, \u201cespecially [in] formulating remedies.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.C.t. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). Campbell argues that the arbitrator ignored parts of the agreement which obligated employees to conduct themselves properly so as to enhance its public image<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and which reserved to Campbell the \u201csole responsibility\u201d for maintaining discipline.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It does not fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>low, from the award itself, that these parts of the agreement were ignored. The arbitrator could have thought with good reason, as he apparently did, that sustaining the discharge in the light of Kmiec\u2019s record, of the modern tolerant view of gambling, and of the \u201cdisproportionate\u201d sanctions in Rules 7 and 30, might adversely affect employee morale and even Campbell\u2019s public image. There is nothing in the parts of the agreement referred to, or in the decisions, that preclude this reasoning by the arbitrator, presumably selected because he was informed about identical matters which fitted him for the kind of reasoning he used in resolving the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">While there are some factual differences between the case before us. and the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Local 453, Int. Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. Otis Elevator Co., 314 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1963), we think the district court could well have found substantial support, as we have, in the court\u2019s reasoning in that decision, with respect to double punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">We see no merit in Campbell\u2019s argument that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in deciding that the \u201creasonableness of the punishment\u201d could be challenged and that the conviction was of a lesser .offense, or that Kmiec had learned his lesson. Under the broad clause in the bargaining agreement and the direction in the submission the arbitrator was free to do what he did in the award. We have no power to substitute our judgment for that of the arbitrator on the merits. Local 7-644, Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers v. Mobil Oil Co., 350 F.2d 708 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 986, 86 S.Ct. 563, 15 L.Ed.2d 474 (1966). The decision in Local 217, Int. Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. Holtzer-Cabot Corp., 277 F.Supp. 704 (D.Mass.1967), cited in support of its argument, is of no aid to Campbell. There again the restrictive arbitration clause was similar to those in the <em>Textile Workers </em>and <em>Truck Drivers </em>cases, <em>swpra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">Finally, we think that Campbell\u2019s public policy arguments are without merit. We have already indicated in this opinion that the award could reasonably be expected to further federal policy of industrial peace; and while we \u2014 as the Second Circuit in <em>Otis Elevator </em>\u2014 cannot condone employee gambling activities on the employer\u2019s premises, we have been referred by Campbell to no federal policy that required the arbitrator, in exercising his lawful contract power, to approve the discharge of Kmiec or to compel the imposition of harsher sanctions than the award provided under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">With respect to the Illinois policy against gambling, we are persuaded by the Second Circuits\u2019 thesis in <em>Otis Elevator, </em>314 F.2d p. 29, that employee Calise\u2019s conviction there had \u201cvindicated\u201d the requirement of New York\u2019s gambling law and that the award may have further vindicated justice, and that employment plays an important role in implementing the public policy of rehabilitating those convicted of crime which overrides any policy of precluding reinstatement of those \u201cconvicted, fined, and subjected to serious disciplinary measure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court, enforcing the award, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">.
