Approximately one year later appellants, acting in <em>propria persona, </em>moved to reopen the judgment and modify the award, alleging fraud and collusion by their attorneys and the opposing parties. This motion was denied on October 2, 1964, and appellants appealed. The California District Court of Appeal affirmed and appellants were ordered to pay $200.00 in damages for bringing a frivolous appeal. When petition to the California Supreme Court proved unsuccessful, appellants filed a petition for removal to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1443. The United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the petition and appellants challenge that decision in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">Any one of several reasons would be sufficient to bar appellants\u2019 removal petition. It would seem obvious that to remove an action to the federal courts from a state court, it must first be pending in the state court. Since appellants\u2019 motion was dismissed by the state supreme court, appellants are actually attempting to obtain a federal forum by characterizing an appeal as a removal petition, an imaginative but unacceptable maneuver. Even assuming appellants to be the possessors of a cause of action pending in state court, other obstacles to removal are readily discernable. Appellants cannot allege either diversity of parties or a non-frivolous federal question. They therefore fail to meet the initial requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, that the action be one which might have been filed originally in federal court. Further, appellants are not \u201cdefendants,\u201d another fundamental \u00a7 1441 prerequisite, since the original suit has long been terminated and they are the plaintiffs and initiators of the current action. See, e. g., Gully v. First Nat. Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936). Civil rights are in no way involved in appellants\u2019 action. Therefore, appellants\u2019 reliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 is misplaced. See, City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">After holding that appellants\u2019 removal petition was without merit, the district court, acting on its own motion, remanded the case to the state court, stating that because appellants lacked a pending state action, remand was \u201cquestionable.\u201d We think it not only questionable, but impossible. We hold that, as a matter of logic, if appellants had not existing cause of action to remove, the fact that the district court has determined that appellants lacked a removable cause of action creates no cause of action that can be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">With their appeal, appellants have filed a complaint for declaratory relief and injunction which is directed against the parties who originally brought suit against appellants and all courts in which appellants have appeared. The complaint reargues the merits of appellants\u2019 case. We reject this complaint for the same reasons we affirm the dismissal of appellants\u2019 action for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 attempt to gain a federal forum under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1443 and we reverse the district court\u2019s decision to remand appellants\u2019 claim to the state court. Treating appellants\u2019 \u201cComplaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunction\u201d as an application for a writ of mandamus, we deny and dismiss it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
