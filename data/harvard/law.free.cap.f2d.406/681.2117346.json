The asserted grounds for the writ are that as an indigent person petitioner was constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel at the hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207 which resulted in the revocation of his mandatory early release. He says in effect that he was entitled to a trial-type evidentiary hearing with confrontation and cross-examination of adverse witnesses in the geographic area where the alleged parole violations occurred. .The District Court denied the writ relying principally on Hyser v. Reed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225(1963) which held that \u201cdue process does not require that indigent parolees be provided with appointed counsel when they appear before the Parole Board in revocation proceedings.\u201d See also Jones v. Rivers, 338 F.2d 862 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-23\">We begin with the long established proposition that early release (be it mandatory release, parole or probation) and revocation hearings are matters of legislative grace not constitutionally mandated. Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935).J This being so the courts have been virtually unanimous in holding that there is no constitutional right to retained or appointed counsel at a parole revocation hearing. Fleming v. Tate, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 156 F.2d 848 (1946); Washington v. Hagan, 287 F.2d 332 (3rd Cir. 1960); Lavendera v. Taylor, 347 F.2d 989 (10th Cir. 1966); Gonzales v. Patterson, 370 F.2d 94 (10th Cir. 1966); and Williams v. Patterson, 389 F.2d 374 (10th Cir. 1968). Nor does the most recent case of Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967) require a different result. As we ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>served in Williams v. Patterson, supra p. 375, Mempa dealt with the right to \u201ccounsel \u2018at the time of sentencing where the sentencing has beep deferred subject to probation,\u2019 \u201d none of which is here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The thrust of counsel\u2019s argument is that since the statutory \u201copportunity to appear,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> though, eoncededly not constitutionally required, has been administratively construed and applied<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to afford a mandatory releasee an opportunity to be represented by retained counsel with voluntary witnesses in his behalf, he may not be constitutionally denied counsel because he is financially unable to retain one. Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956) and Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Despite disagreement among the circuits,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are satisfied that if we were only confronted with the construction of the statutory \u201copportunity to appear\u201d we would have no difficulty affirming the District Court in light of our position in Lavendera v. Taylor, supra, adopting Judge Goodrich\u2019s view in Washington v. Hagan, supra, 287 F.2d at p. 334. As he expressed it, for the Third Circuit: \u201cThe period of contentious litigation is over when a man accused of crime is tried, defended, sentenced and, if he wishes, has gone through the process of appeal. Now the problem becomes one of an attempt at rehabilitation. The progress of that attempt must be measured, not by legal rules, but by the judgment of those who make it their professional business. So long as that judgment is fairly and honestly exercised we think there is no place for lawyer representation and lawyer opposition in the matter of revocation of parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">But at issue here is the question whether an agency of the Federal government can administratively afford counsel at revocation hearings to those- financially able to retain one while refusing appointed counsel to those financially unable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To pose the question is to answer it, for Griffin and its progeny have made it clear beyond doubt that where liberty is at stake a State may not grant to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>even a non-constitutional, statutory right such as here involved and deny it to another because of poverty. And it goes without saying that a Federal agency may not, consistently with Fifth Amendment due process, do that which a State is forbidden to do by Fourteenth Amendment due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Of course, absolute equality between the rich and the poor is not required. The discrimination must be invidious and the right asserted must be of substance and not of form. Cf. Kennedy v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kan., 377 F.2d 339, 344 (10th Cir. 1967). But implicit in the regulations which afford an opportunity to have counsel is the recognition of its efficacy. A hearing where witnesses may be heard is contemplated and revocation may very well turn on the resolution of disputed facts or the emphasis to be placed on admitted facts. Ameliorating circumstances may tip the scales against revocation. In these circumstances a revocation hearing is no \u201cperfunctory formality <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.\u201d Nor can it be said that the assistance of counsel at such a revocation hearing is an empty ritual.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It may very well spell the difference between revocation and forgiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"A7T\"> This is not to say, of course, that a trial-type hearing with compulsory process for witnesses is either contemplated or required. Indeed, nothing in the statutes or regulations indicate that such a hearing is contemplated for anyone nor does it mean that confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses are constitutionally required. Gonzales v. Patterson, supra. It does mean that the Board is required to provide substantially the same type hearing for one violator as another. So long as the Board allows retained counsel at revocation hearings it must provide such for those financially unable to hire one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">We are not unaware of the Parole Board\u2019s lack of authority to appoint counsel for indigent parolees or the lack of express authority in the courts to make such appointments. Nor are we unmindful of the administrative difficulties incident to the administration of the parole statutes under circumstances requiring the appointment of counsel. But conceding that informality and administrative flexibility are essential to the proper functioning of the parole system it is only fair to observe that if time is to be taken for hearings where retained counsel appear no valid objection can be made to the time consumed in hearings with appointed counsel. Be that as it may, constitutional mandates may not be sacrificed in the interest of time or procedural difficulties. Whatever is essential to due process must be done. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 60, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932). Where, as here, liberty is involved the courts are not impotent to take whatever steps are deemed necessary to insure con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>stitutional guarantees. See Chief Judge Bazelon (dissenting in part and concurring in part) in Hyser v. Reed, supra, 318 F.2d at p. 255, footnote 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The judgment is reversed and remanded with instructions to fashion a remedy as \u201claw and justice require.\u201d Section 2243 of Title 28, United States Code.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207 provides that \u201cA prisoner retaken upon a warrant issued by the Board of Parole, shall be given an opportunity to appear before the Board, a member thereof, or an examiner designated by the Board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. In pertinent part 28 C.F.R.. \u00a7 2.41 provides that \u201cEach alleged * * * mandatory release violator shall be advised that he may he represented by counsel * * *; <em>Provided, </em>That the alleged violator arranges for the appearance of eoun-se! * * * \u201d [emphasis original]. In the Rules U.S. Parole Board, effective July 1, 1965, it expressly states that \u201cThe Board is not required to furnish counsel or witnesses and will not undertake to do so under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Routinely the Parole Board requests the alleged parole violator to sign a form advising the Board that he intends to hire counsel or that counsel is waived. This form specifically sets out that \u201cCounsel will not be furnished by the Government.\u201d At all times herein relevant, the petitioner refused to sign the form and requested that counsel be appointed for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The regulations also provide that \u201cIf the prisoner requests a local hearing * * * he shall be afforded [one] reasonably near the place of the alleged violation.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.40. In his petition Earnest admits he was requested to sign a form electing a local or institutional revocation hearing which he refused to sign. Having been offered the regulatory alternatives he cannot now be heard to complain. Cf. Phillips v. U. S. Board of Parole, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 235, 352 F.2d 711 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-17\">. Representative of cases holding the statutory \u201copportunity to appear\u201d includes the right to retained counsel are the following: Boddie v. Weakley, 356 F.2d 242 (4th Cir. 1966); Fleming v. Tate, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 156 F.2d 848 (1946) ; and Robbins v. Reed, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 51, 269 F.2d 242 (1957). Representative of the opposite view are Washington v. Hagan, supra, and Hodge v. Markley, 339 F.2d 973 (7th Cir. 1965). Cf.

Hodge, 334 U.S. 24, 35-36, 68 S.Ct. 847, 853, 92 L.Ed. 1187 (1948) where Chief Justice Vinson succinctly stated: \u201cWe cannot presume the the public policy of the United States manifests a lesser concern for the protection of * * * basic rights against discriminatory action of federal courts than against such action taken by the courts of the States.\u201d See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). See also 48 Minn.L.R. 1, 7 and 43 Cornell L.Q. 1, 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\">.
