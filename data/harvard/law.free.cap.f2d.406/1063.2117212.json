The Board\u2019s order, which in pertinent part rejected the recommended order of the Trial Examiner, found that respondent violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by awarding employees at its Alamo, Tennessee plant a ten cent per hour wage increase and ordered respondent to cease and desist from any like or related action in the future and required the posting of cognate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-22\">A review of the record, including the finding of the Trial Examiner, convinces us that the factual conclusions of the Board are without support on the record, considered as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Enforcement is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
