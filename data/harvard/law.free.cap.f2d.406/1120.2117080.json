We find no authority for the action of the district court and vacate its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">The facts show that in 1962 the defendants formed the Baxter Lumber Company and became its major stockholders. The company, which had plants in Iowa, Texas and Tennessee, engaged primarily in the assembling of ammunition boxes. The plaintiff, United Forest Product's Company, Inc., supplied pre-cut component parts of wooden boxes to the Baxter Company. Early in 1967 the parties commenced negotiations for the purchase of Baxter Lumber Company by United Forest. On April 24 of that year a final agreement was entered into whereby United Forest agreed to purchase the company for $2,180,000. Payment was to be made in four installments, ranging from $500,000 to $600,-000 each. The contract also contained a forfeiture provision which provided that upon default of payment the plaintiff would lose all previous payments and return the stock and management of the company to the defendants. Under the contract plaintiff was required to put $500,000 working capital into the business the first year. This investment was also to be forfeited upon default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-16\">Shortly before the first installment was due in August of 1967, United Forest brought suit in federal district court alleging fraud and misrepresentation by defendants in the sale of the lumber company. United Forest, stating that the forfeiture provisions made rescission impractical, affirmed the contract, but sought actual damages of $1,180,000 and exemplary damages of $1,000,000. Plaintiff then requested leave of court to deposit the first installment into the registry of the court alleging that some of the defendants were nonresidents, and that unless the monies were sequestered none of the defendants would ever be able to respond to plaintiff for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-17\">After an evidentiary hearing, the court determined that there existed evidence demonstrating misrepresentations of a substantial nature and, relying upon Fed.R.Civ.P. 67,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ordered all monies due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>and payable under the contract to be deposited into the registry of the court. At the same time the court ordered plaintiff relieved from an attachment bond, but nevertheless required it to deposit an additional sum of $44,800 \u201cwhich additional sum shall be held as security for such right of action, if any, as the individual Defendants might have under Iowa law for <em>wrongful attachment </em>* * (Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">In November of 1967, defendants moved for disbursement of the funds. Plaintiff then requested leave of court to. deposit the second installment, due December 31, 1968. After another hearing, the court held that the portion of the installment payments owed to three of the defendants would not be disbursed until decision of the case on the merits. The court also noted that since the plaintiff had made no direct allegations of fraud against the three other shareholders, they could not be charged with exemplary damages. He therefore ordered their shares of the first two installments to be disbursed, stating orally, however, that their shares of the last two installments would be held. At the time of appeal the total amount of money paid into court was $691,200.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">Initially we must decide whether the district court\u2019s, order is appropriate for appellate review. The district court properly refused to certify \u201cthat there is no just reason for delay\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). This rule applies only to multiple claims, wherein there has been an adjudication of less than all claims and a party desires \u201cfinality\u201d for purposes of appeal. Procedure for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), was not followed and is not applicable. Nor does the off-shoot, \u201cirreparable injury\u201d rule of the <em>Forgay-ConracL </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> case render the matter appeal-able. This rule relates only to the ap-pealability of a partial adjudication of a single claim and is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">If the court\u2019s order is reviewable at all, our jurisdiction can only be premised upon the so-called \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine which disposes of a right auxiliary to the merits of a claim filed. The United States Supreme Court in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546-547, 69 S.Ct. 1229, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) stated that the appealability of a collateral order depends upon (1) whether the rights decided are collateral to the merits of the claim (cf. Western Steel Erection Co. v. C. H. Leavell &amp; Co., 384 F.2d 764 (8 Cir. 1967)), (2) whether the order is \u201ctoo important to be denied review,\u201d (3) whether the order is \u201ctoo independent of the cause itself\u201d to defer appellate review until the whole case is decided, and (4) whether the order involves an adjudication of an important question of law or is only an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. The above factors are to be weighed with Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s statement in DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 126, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962), that under proper application the \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine is applied \u201cwhen the practical effect of the order will be irreparable by any subsequent appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-10\">In focus is the specific question whether the court was correct in refusing to require plaintiff to post security under and otherwise adhere to the Iowa law of attachment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 64.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If review of the court\u2019s authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>to sequester funds were required to await appeal of the merits on protracted litigation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> compliance with the Iowa law of attachment would come too late to assure protection of the defendants\u2019 property rights involved. In order to attach monies before judgment the Iowa Code requires (1) that in a non-contract action the amount attached must be approved by a court of competent jurisdiction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) that plaintiff demonstrate statutory grounds for such attachment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) that a bond be required in an amount double the value of the property to' be attached.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The policy reasons behind these statutory provisions are self-evident. Under Iowa law the amount of the attachment bond was not left to the discretion of the trial judge. The legislature required a bond double the value of the property attached not only as protection to the property owner but undoubtedly as an added deterrent to. those who seek to attach property upon a mere statement of a contingent claim. See discussion in n. 10, infra. Of particular significance is the prerequisite of judicial approval as to the amount to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>attached in a tort action, as involved here. Under Iowa law a party cannot arbitrarily govern the amount attached by inflating the prayer for damages in the complaint. The value of the property attached must have some realistic relationship to the damages theoretically sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">The issue here is not one related to the proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion as to the amount of security to be posted. The question which makes this matter reviewable is whether the law permits a trial court to circumvent the Iowa law of attachment altogether. A similar issue of review was involved in the <em>Cohen </em>case where the district court had refused to apply New Jersey law requiring security for costs in a stockholders derivative action. Cf., e. g., Swift &amp; Co. Packers v. Componia Columbiana Del Caribe, 339 U.S. 684, 70 S.Ct. 861, 94 L.Ed. 1206 (1950) (reviewed order vacating attachment) ; Phelps v. Burnham, 327 F.2d 812 (2 Cir. 1964) (reviewed order requiring the posting of security); McDonnell v. Birrell, 321 F.2d 946 (2 Cir. 1963) (reviewed order requiring party to make payments, to determine whether order conformed with requirements of. state law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">We find the district court\u2019s order is reviewable under the <em>Cohen </em>rule. We now consider the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">Plaintiff seeks to avoid Rule 64 by reasoning that sequestering the funds did not involve \u201cattachment\u201d because the funds were never owned by the defendants. This argument is inconsistent with its asserted action. If the money does not belong to defendants, plaintiff has defaulted in its payment and is subject to the forfeiture terms of the contract. However, plaintiff has specifically elected to affirm the contract and has deposited the installment payments into court in order to avoid the forfeiture provision of the contract. Plaintiff cannot pursue inconsistent forms of relief to the prejudice of the defendants. See Myzel v. Fields, 386 F.2d 718, 740 n. 15 (8 Cir. 1967). Upon plaintiff\u2019s election to affirm the contract, the money paid under the contract legally belongs to the defendants. The fact \"that the money has been paid into the registry of the court does not deprive the defendants of ownership of the funds, since the court merely holds the money as trustee for the rightful owner. See In re Moneys Deposited, etc., 243 F.2d 443, 445 (3 Cir. 1957). Plaintiff has no recognizable interest remaining in those funds. Mere allegations of tortious injury cannot give plaintiff any specific interest in defendants\u2019 property. Plaintiff at this juncture is not entitled to any kind of lien, equitable or otherwise, on said monies which could place its interest above that of defendants\u2019 general creditors. At this point, plaintiff does not even enjoy the status of a general creditor. The district court itself tacitly recognized that the fund belonged to the defendants by disbursing a small portion of it to some of the defendants and by requiring plaintiff to post a $44,800 bond in case the defendants wished to sue for wrongful attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 64 governs seizure of a person\u2019s property in a federal diversity action. The Advisory Committee comment on Rule 64 relates to the necessary application of state law in discussing the origin of the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1189-10\">\u201cThis rule adopts the existing federal law, except that it specifies the applicable state law to be that of the time when the remedy is sought. Under U.S.C.A., Title 28, former \u00a7 726 (Attachments as provided by state laws) the plaintiff was entitled to remedies by attachment or other process which were on June 1, 1872, provided by the applicable state law, and the district courts might, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such state laws as might be in force. This statute is superseded as are district court rules which are rendered unnecessary by the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">The \u201cexisting law\u201d refers to the Conformity Act of 1872 which provided that in all cases at common-law, the procedure as to \u201cattachment or other process should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>conform to the state practice.\u201d See Big Vein Coal Co. v. Read, 229 U.S. 31, 36, 33 S.Ct. 694, 57 L.Ed. 1053 (1913). Thus, with respect to such provisional remedies the federal courts are required to apply state law. See, e. g., Bernstein v. Van Heyghen Freres Societe Anonyme, 163 F.2d 246 (2 Cir. 1947); General Elec. Credit Corp. v. Waukesha Bldg. Corp., 259 F.Supp. 958 (W.D.Ark.1966); Hisel v. Chrysler Corp., 90 F.Supp. 655 (W.D. Mo.1950); 7 Moore, Fed.Practice If 64.-01.-09 at 1501-1507 (2 ed. 1966). Rule 64, however, does make state law subject to any existing statute of the United States which might be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The question then is whether there exists any applicable federal statute which authorized the district court\u2019s action. The trial court relied upon the \u201cliteral\u201d language of Rule 67. The history of Rule 67, however, demonstrates that it is not intended as an \u201cequitable\u201d alternative to the applicability of state law under Rule 64. Rule 67 was intended to apply only to a fund that is in dispute. See discussion in United States v. Balfour, Gutherie &amp; Co., 192 F.Supp. 60 (S.D.N.Y.1961). When a disputed <em>res </em>or \u201csum of money\u201d is deposited into the registry, the court holds the money in trust; it is \u201cheld for the benefit of whomsoever in the end it should be found to belong,\u201d Branch v. United States, 100 U.S. 673, 674, 25 L.Ed. 759 (1879). However, here the seized money is not in contest. Plaintiff\u2019s election to' sue in tort and keep the bargain confirms this. The plaintiff seeks relief from material misrepresentation which has caused it damage since its bargain retained allegedly is less valuable than was represented. The damage, if any, <em>arises out of </em>the alleged excess consideration paid on the contract; the damage is not <em>the </em>consideration itself, since the bargain has been affirmed and rescission has not been elected. Plaintiff simply wants its bargain and its money too. At the same time it seeks to deprive defendants of their right to claim forfeiture or to sue for a breach of contract. Cf. General Pencil Co. v. George N. Kahn Co., 246 F.Supp. 60 (S.D.N.Y.1965); Dinkins v. General Aniline &amp; Film Corp., 214 F.Supp. 281 (S.D.N.Y.1963). Rule 67 was not intended for such a one-sided before-judgment consequence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">The sole question remaining is. whether the court has an \u201cinherent power\u201d to. allow the plaintiff to deposit the monies into court. Argument is made from cases relying upon the All Writs statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651(a), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-9\">\u201cThe Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">However, these cases and statute are not helpful here. This statute was not intended to be used to subvert the specific requirements governing attachment under state law. Section 1651 relates only to writs \u201cagreeable to * * * principles of law.\u201d This brings us directly back to Rule 64. In De Beers Consol. Mines v. United States, 325 U.S. 212, 65 S.Ct. 1130, 89 L.Ed. 1566 (1945), which involved an analogous situation, the government sought a preliminary injunction under \u00a7 262 of the Judicial Code which preceded \u00a7 1651(a). The injunction sought restraint from withdrawal by defendant foreign corporations of any properties located in the United States of America and from \u201cselling, transferring or disposing\u201d of any of its properties until the determination of the merits of the suit. The complaint sought equitable relief under the Sherman Act and the government claimed the injunction necessary to enforce the court\u2019s ultimate decree. The district court entered the injunction. The Supreme Court vacated the same. The government admitted Rule 64 inapplicable because under New York law attachment could only issue in an action at law. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>concluding remarks of Mr. Justice Roberts demonstrate, we feel, the error of the district court in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-5\">\u201cTo sustain the challenged order would create a precedent of sweeping effect. This suit, as we have said, is not to be distinguished from any other suit' in, equity. What applies to it applies to all such. Every suitor who resorts to chancery for any sort of relief by injunction may, on a mere statement of belief that the defendant can easily make away with or transport his money or goods, impose an injunction on him, indefinite in duration, disabling him to use so much of his funds or property as the court deems necessary for security or compliance with its possible decree. <em>And, if so, it is difficult to see why a plaintiff in any action for a personal judgment in tort or contract may not, also, apply to the chancellor for a so-called injunction sequestrating his opponent\u2019s assets pending recovery and satisfaction of a judgment in such a law action. No relief of this character has been thought justified in the long history of equity jurisprudence.\u201d </em>325 U.S. at 222, 65 S.Ct. 1130, at 1135. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">The effect of plaintiff\u2019s action here is to obtain such a \u201cso-called injunction\u201d for an action at law. The situation is no different than if defendants were paid the monies directly and then were enjoined from \u201cdisposing\u201d of them until the determination of the merits. Provisional remedies of attachment before judgment were not recognized at common law. They are statutory remedies in derogation of the common law and strict compliance with the statutory requirements is therefore necessary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>However, even more cogent is the fact that before a person\u2019s property can be sequestered, basic principles of due process require adherence to recognized legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">One reason plaintiff urged sequestering defendants\u2019 funds during the pendency of the claim was it's concern for defendants\u2019 bankruptcy. Plaintiff\u2019s action in retaining the business sold and depriving defendants of the consideration during pendency of the litigation would almost guarantee this ominous result. The law does not recognize such leverage in the hands of litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Judgment reversed with directions to vacate the court\u2019s order in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1186-13\">.

By simply providing that the complainant might proceed in his action by attachment, without prescribing any special mode of procedure different from that which is set forth in the general attachment law of the state, it must be presumed that it was the intention of the legislature that the requirements of that law should be observed, and strictly pursued. The proceeding by attachment being extraordinary in its nature, and designed for application to secure the ends of justice in cases specified, and when the ordinary process of law would be unavailing, it is not presumable that the legislature would have authorized a plaintiff to resort to it without protecting the interests of the defendant by the usual and necessary guards.

Greene, 387, at page 390, this court, referring to an attachment proceeding, said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-13\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe proceeding being in derogation of the common law, and of a violent character, it should affirmatively appear by the officer\u2019s return, that the provisions of the statute had been strictly observed, as the jurisdiction of the court over the property depends entirely upon a legal levy. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-14\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cIn proceedings in attachment, the jurisdiction of the court is obtained by special authority, derived from the legislature, and hence the doctrine of presumption, as applicable to courts in the exercise of common law powers, cannot apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-15\">\u201c \u2018The late Justice DeGraff, speaking for this court in Edwards v. Tracy, 203 Iowa, 1083, at page 1084, 212 N.W. 317, 318, said: \u201cProceedings in attachment are ancillary or auxiliary to the main action and are statutory, being unknown to the common law. Curry v. Allen, 55 Iowa, 318, 7 N.W. 635; Eads v. Pitkin, 3 G. Greene, 77; Delaplain &amp; Co. v. Armstrong &amp; Ulrich, 21 W.Va. 211; Penoyar v. Kelsey, 150 N.Y. 77, 44 N.E. 788, 34 L.R.A. 248. An attachment is not the leading process. Its only office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>is to hold the property attached under it for the satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s demand. In a sense, it is an execution by anticipation. It is in derogation of the common law, but, under our statute, the proceedings are to be liberally construed. Section 12143, Code 1924. A court, however, cannot proceed by attachment unless the power rests upon express statutory sanction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-22\">\u201c \u2018Attachment proceedings are wholly statutory and we must look to the statute to find when an attachment may issue. A court of equity has no general jurisdiction to order an attachment without bond. * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
