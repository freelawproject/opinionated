Prior to the adoption by the Congress of the 1958 Amendment to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292, by adding Section (b), no appeal could be taken from such an order by the trial court because it was not a \u201cfinal order.\u201d Now, however, this court has jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal when the provisions of Section (b) are complied with.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Here the trial court made the required certificate and this court, on December 7, 1967, entered its order granting the application provided for under Section 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">At the outset, it may be appropriate to sound a caveat with respect to the action taken by this court in granting the application for interlocutory appeal, lest every unsuccessful litigant in the trial court should consider this action as a precedent requiring or even suggesting the advisability of seeking such an interlocutory appeal upon the <em>denial </em>by the trial court of his motion for summary judgment. The subject matter of this litigation, involving, as it does, the very serious and timely question of how far the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press may still be impinged upon by actions for libel, places some cases in a somewhat different category. This follows when the trial court and this court jointly consider that the failure to dismiss a libel suit might necessitate long and expensive trial proceedings, which, if not really warranted, would themselves offend the principles enunciated in Dom-browski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22, because of the chilling effect of such litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">In this suit, in which the plaintiff demands a recovery of one million dollars actual and five million dollars punitive damages, and in which the plaintiff established a substantial record by taking depositions from several alleged sources of information relied upon by the publisher of the offending article, this court concluded that it would be appropriate to grant the request for an interlocutory appeal. This is appropriate because the Supreme Court has heretofore resolved, at the appellate level, in a number of cases, the question whether facts alleged and proved in the trial court met the standard laid down by it as to what nature of public official or public action would withdraw from a complaining party protection of the libel laws of the state absent a showing of \u201cactual malice,\u201d and has also decided as a matter of law whether proof actually made upon the trial met that standard. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412; Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (considered by the Supreme Court in connection with the cited case of Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094, and St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that there are before us two questions for consideration: (1) Do the constitutional guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments deny recovery to the plaintiff in this case unless he can show that the appellant published statements about him with \u201cactual malice\u201d? (2) If so, does the record established by the plaintiff demonstrate that there is no issue of fact from which the jury could find \u201cactual malice\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In order to understand the-basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim of injury at the hands of the appellant, it is necessary to relate briefly the facts surrounding the publication of the article. We avoid repeating part of the factual recitation by dealing with the above two questions in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The issue of Life Magazine for February 3, 1967, contained a fifteen-page article entitled \u201cThe Scandal in. the Bahamas.\u201d The article was written by William Lambert and Richard Oulahan, but so far as this record is concerned the responsibility for its preparation falls on Lambert._ The record discloses that Lambert was an associate editor of Life and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. He had started work on the article in the early fall of 1966. In connection with its preparation he called on the press officer of the Department of Justice, who referred him to a lawyer, Robert Peloquin, a member of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department of Justice. .During the course of this discussion, Peloquin told Lambert that gamblers who had formerly operated in Havana under the Batista regime had moved to the Bahamas. Included in the names mentioned by Peloquin was that of Mike MeLaney. Peloquin stated that MeLaney was \u201cone of the Havana gamblers who had moved into the Bahamas at one time or another, and he was mentioned as having operated a casino at Cat Cay, and that was his [sic] \u2014 it was brushed over. It was relatively unimportant.\u201d Lambert made no notes of this conversation, and in the original writing of the article he made'/ no mention of MeLaney. However, he devoted a good deal of the article to discussing the influx of U. S. gangsters, paying particular attention to the activities of three men, Courtney, Ritter and Brudner, who were described as \u201cthree Lansky henchmen.\u201d Immediately preceding the paragraph that mentions the plaintiff the single time, is this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">\u201cCourtney, Ritter and Brudner are all fugitives from the United States justice under indictment for violating the federal anti-racketeering statute as well as gambling tax evasion and failure to buy the annual $50 gambling stamp (they once operated the nation\u2019s largest bookie network, inherited from the' late Frank Erickson).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">Then there follows the paragraph which is the subject matter of the lawsuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">\u201cWhatever the Pindling government decides to do about these three gamblers, one of their colleagues has turned up in the midst of Pindling\u2019s party. He is Mike MeLaney, who managed one of Havana\u2019s big casinoes in the days when Lansky was a top mobster in the Cuban capital. During the recent election campaign, MeLaney showed up in the Out Islands, providing free airlifts for PLP candidates. The mob always tried to hedge its bets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">The thrust of the article was that with connivance of the officials, the Bahaman government was actually a puppet government controlled by the United Bahamian Party (UBP). It described Sir Stafford Sands as the principal power in UBP. It developed the thesis that Sands arranged for the development of Grand Bahama Island through the Grand Bahama Port Authority, Ltd., headed by Wallace Groves. According to the article gambling was introduced to boost tourism, and Lansky and his \u201cmobsters\u201d arrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>with the acquiescence of Sands, Groves and the UBP.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The article then described the current election that ended January 10, 1967, by the election of Lynden Pindling, head of the predominantly Negro Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), as premier of the Bahamas and the rejection of Sands and the UBP. The article commented on the fact that in his campaign Pindling had made the presence of the gambling mob, notably Lansky\u2019s lieutenants, Courtney, Bitter and Brudner, his basis for attacking the existing government and its allies. The Life article described the Pindling campaign as an effort to rid the Bahamas of the Havana gambling group.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Lambert\u2019s article was practically completed at the time of the election on January 10th, at which time, either a day or two before the election, or a day or two following it, (the two participants to the conversation disagree as to the time) a public relations man named Mc-Crary, from whom Lambert had obtained some earlier reports about conditions in the Bahamas, called, according to Lambert\u2019s deposition, or was called and responded, with the information that Mc-Laney had lent helicopters to Out Island candidates (Lambert\u2019s testimony identified these as candidates for the PLP party). McCrary also testified that in a telephone conversation, a man named Joe Abrell, told him that a man named Pro-binski had introduced the new Prime Minister Pindling to McLaney. In his testimony McCrary emphasized: \u201cAll of this [was] hearsay and during this period it was my purpose to run down rumors.\u201d He also testified that he reported to Lambert that he had heard a rumored story around town that McLaney had introduced Lansky to Groves and another that McLaney, introduced Lansky to Sands.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">Lambert testified that upon receiving the report from McCrary that McLaney was assisting in the Pindling campaign, he recalled having previously heard Mc-Laney\u2019s name as a Havana gambling operator and he searched the Life Morgue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>and cheeked information to ascertain whether this would disclose any connection between McLaney and other gamblers. Having found several articles that identified McLaney as being active in Havana gambling at the time Lansky was described as practically the partner of Batista in controlling gambling, he thereupon undertook to check with the Department of Justice again. He telephoned Mr. Peloquin and found that he was away from his office on naval training. He got the call through to him at a distant point where he asked him, \u201cMcLaney has come into this election campaign. I remember you mentioned his name. What can you tell me about him?\u201d He testified that Peloquin said: \u201cWell, it is coming off the top of my head, because I have no notes or information here with me.\u201d Peloquin then told him about McLaney being the manager for the Cat Cay Casino that belonged to an estate. Lambert testified that Pelo-quin gave him other information about his age, and his notes showed that he was a golf \u201cprof,\u201d and then his notes showed \u201clightweight.\u201d In his testimony Lambert reconstructed this as Peloquin\u2019s having said, \u201cHe is a professional golfer, and that he was a golf hustler,\u201d and that he said, \u201cHe makes his living by his wits and he is a gambler,\u201d adding that \u201che is a lightweight.\u201d In his testimony, subsequently taken, Peloquin did not remember making any comments about McLaney\u2019s being a professional golfer or a golf hustler. However, he did testify twice that the notes, copies of which had been sent to him prior to his deposition, \u201care relatively accurate as to the information I had as to McLaney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Lambert stated that Peloquin then suggested that he discuss the matter with United States Attorney Morganthau and Executive Assistant Gaynor, in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Thereupon Lambert called Mr. Mor-ganthau, who, aside from stating that he knew of McLaney in connection with the Carrousel Casino in Las Vegas, was unable to do more than suggest that he call Mr. Gaynor.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Although Lambert\u2019s notes indicated that he obtained some additional information from Gaynor, including for the first time, mention of an association between McLaney and Carroll Rosenblum, the only undisputed testimony, since Gay-nor did not recall these facts, is Gaynor\u2019s answer, \u201cWhat I testify to, and my best recollection is that he asked me about the Nacional in Havana, and I replied to him that I had read things about that, and that could be checked very easily by newspaper morgue clippings and things of that sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Lambert testified that during the course of these inquiries he had read the morgue references to McLaney and the Nacional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Life\u2019s folder also included numerous articles which discussed Lansky\u2019s dominant position in control of gambling in Havana during this corresponding period of time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Thus the record appears to be undisputed that at the time the paragraph dealing with MeLaney was written, substantial investigation had been made into the question whether MeLaney was a professional gambler who had operated in Havana, Cuba, at a time when numerous press reports agreed that such an operation in the Cuban capital could be carried on only with the agreement or protection of Lansky.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Thereupon, Lambert sought to check out McCrary\u2019s statement to him that MeLaney had helped in the Pindling election. This he did by calling the new Prime Minister direct. The latter confirmed the fact that MeLaney had made transportation available to the candidates in the \u201cOut Islands,\u201d running as PLP candidates. Lambert testified that after completing this investigation he added the paragraph concerning MeLaney to the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">There is no suggestion that Lambert knew of any fact or circumstance which would cause him to doubt the truth of the statements made by him. Much is made by the appellee of the fact that, in his deposition, McCrary stressed the fact that much of what he told Lambert was hearsay \u2014 that is to say, rumors that he had heard around the Bahamas. This included the rumor, repeated by McCrary to Lambert, that MeLaney was boasting in the bars of the Bahamas that he was going to take over the gambling business when the new government ousted the three Lansky henchmen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">We are not here dealing with the correctness of all of the statements made in the paragraph complained of. We are concerned with the means by which Lambert obtained the basis for the statements, and, if required by the standard set down by the Supreme Court, the efforts he made to check the information. Finally, we must determine whether it is permissible for this court to conclude, as a matter of law, whether there was any fact put in issue on the record in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>trial court which would require submission to a jury the question whether the plaintiff had carried his burden of showing not only the falsity of the statement, but, if false, that it was motivated by \u201cactual malice,\u201d as defined by the recent Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">As we have shown, the record is undisputed that Lambert had ample justification for whatever statements were made to the effect that Meyer Lansky was head of a \u201cmob\u201d of gamblers in Havana; that this was with the connivance of dictator Batista, and that no one could carry on a major gambling operation in Havana without the consent of Lansky; that Ritter and Courtney and Brudner were operating openly in Havana at this time. It is equally clear that there was ample information available to Lambert to warrant his statement that McLaney was, at a time during and after the Batista regime, either the owner or operator of' the casino at the Hotel Nacional. We attach no significance to the use of the word \u201cran,\u201d which Lambert explains was a compromise between what he had found in the newspaper clippings saying in the one place that McLaney was \u201cowner\u201d and in another that he was \u201coperator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Moreover, Lambert testified that in an inquiry made to the Department'of Justice lawyer Peloquin in the early fall of 1966, the latter told him that this organized gamblers group had moved from Havana to the Bahamas, and he named McLaney as one of these gamblers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Also, appellee emphasizes the differences between Lambert\u2019s testimony and McCrary\u2019s recollection of what was said on the occasion of McCrary\u2019s informing Lambert of McLaney\u2019s assistance given to the Pindling party in the election. These differences are irrelevant to the consideration before us now. The information furnished by McCrary relevant to the present inquiry included: (1) the basic fact that McLaney had injected himself into the election of the new govment which was committed to put an end to the control of the gambling fraternity over governmental affairs in the Bahamas ; (2) at a time when the records disclosed, without reference to whatever Mc-Crary may have said, McLaney himself was a gambler, both as an individual and as an operator; (4) who had been operating a substantial gambling establishment in Cuba at a time when, according to reliable newspaper reports, such activity required such a person to be in league, directly or indirectly, with the overlord of all gambling, Meyer Lansky.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Drawing a conclusion therefrom that such a person was a \u201ccolleague\u201d of the other three Havana gamblers, clearly identified as Lansky henchmen, required no further checking or verification, since \u201ccolleague\u201d is merely a conclusionary word drawn from the basic facts which had been subjected to investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">As we have previously stated, courts, federal courts in particular, are reluctant to deprive a litigant of the opportunity to present his case to a jury. Particularly under the Federal Constitution are the courts denied the right to do so if there be a disputed issue of fact, which, if found in favor of the losing party, would entitle him to have a verdict by the jury sustained. Where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>however, it is plain that the record has been fully developed by depositions and affidavits on a motion for summary judgment, and such record demonstrates that, construing all of the facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom in favor of the party against whom the judgment is entered, he would not be entitled to have a jury verdict stand, we have not hesitated to hold that the grant of summary judgment is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">What, then, is the standard against which the facts of this case must be tested? The basic rule, denying full protection of the state libel laws because limited by the First Amendment, was set forth in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412. This court in New York Times Co. v. Connor (5th Cir., 1966) 365 F.2d 567, discussed the Sullivan Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u201cThis case is admittedly governed by the legal standards enunciated in the recent Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 1964, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed. 686 [95 A.L.R.2d 1412] since Connor is clearly a public official. As such, he is prohibited \u2018from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u201cactual malice\u201d- \u2014 -that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u2019 Id. at 279, 84 S.Ct. at 726, 11 L.Ed.2d at 706. The showing of malice may not be \u2018presumed but is a matter for proof by the plaintiff * * *. [S]ince the question is one of alleged trespass across \u2018the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated\u2019 * * * <em>we </em>[rnwsi] <em>\u2018examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under ivhich they were made to see </em>* * * whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment, as adopted by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, protect.\u2019 The court concluded that <em>\u2018the proof presented to show actual malice lacks the convincing clarity which the constitutional standard demands </em>* * * \u2019 and reversed the libel conviction. Id. at 284-286, 84 S.Ct. at 728-729, 11 L.Ed.2d at 709-710. Additional explanation of the actual malice standard is found in Garrison v. Louisiana, 1964, 379 U.S. 64, 74-79, 85 S.Ct. 209, 216-218, 13 L.Ed.2d 125, 132-135 in which the Court stated that: (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">\u2018 * * * since \u201c * * * erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and * * * it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the \u2018breathing space\u2019 that they \u2018need * * * to survive\u2019 * * only those false statements made with the high degree of awareness of their probable falsity demanded by New York Times may be subject of either civil or criminal sanctions.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIW\">\u2022X- _ X -X- * X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-15\">\u2018The test which we laid down in New York Times is not keyed to ordinary care; defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">The standard was later enunciated in Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 87 S.Ct. 534, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 and then in Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094; St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262, and finally in Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">While the principle has been stated somewhat differently by majority, concurring and. dissenting opinions, we note that throughout, as stated in the opinion in St. Amant, supra, \u201cThere must be sufficient evidence to permit the con-y/ elusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d 390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">So, too, the Supreme Court, in the Sullivan case, determined for itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>that there was no issue of malice to be submitted to the jury. Being guided by the same test, we note that in this case there is a complete absence of any indication that the writer of the article had any suspicion of the falsity of the statements made by him, and there is a total lack of proof that he had before him any contra-indications as to the correctness of his conclusions. Thus, we answer the second question by deciding that this record, fully developed by affidavits and depositions taken at the instance of the plaintiff, demonstrated that no proof was adduced that had \u201cthe convincing clarity which the constitutional standard demands.\u201d New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, 376 U.S. at 286, 84 S.Ct. at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We come next to the first question: \u201cDo the established facts make applicable this standard of actual malice?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The cases already cited make clear that the thrust at state libel laws is proper in other varying situations in vfrhich matters of great public interest are involved. In Walker and Butts, supra, the standard of New York Times was applied to \u201cpublic figures\u201d, and in Hill, supra, to suits for invasion of privacy based on false statements where a \u201cmatter of public interest is involved.\u201d Furthermore, we agree with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which in its recent case, United Medical Laboratories, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., et al. (9th Cir.) D.C., 404 F.2d 706, November 18, 1968, said: \u201cThe standard of New York Times was not to be regarded as having had \u2018its outer limits * * * marked out\u2019 so as not to be open to further definition.\u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">We conclude that the constitutional privilege extends to discussions by specific individuals, not associated with any government, if those individuals are involved in matters of important /\u2019public concern. Such was the case of the plaintiff here. He had injected himself into an election campaign in a small foreign country in which the announced policy of the opposition to the present government was the elimination of racketeer gambling. He had supported the effort of this reform government by contributing substantial material aid,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thus lent a direct influence to the election of a national government for the country. Such activities as he engaged in, and his conduct as such a participant, are the proper subject of inquiry and of public interest. It seems clear, that he, as much as General Walker in the Walker case, supra, acted in a manner that amounted to a \u201cthrusting of his personality into the \u2018vortex\u2019 of an important public controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">We conclude, therefore, that the defendant was entitled to a summary judgment because, following a motion for such judgment, and after proof was taken to show, if possible, the existence of malice, the record is silent as to any facts which would permit a fact finder to conclude that the standard laid down by the Supreme Court had been met by the plaintiff. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The judgment denying motion for summary judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court with directions that a summary judgment for the defendant be entered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(b): \u201cWhen a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial .ground for difference of opinion, and that / an immediate appeal from the order may / materially advance the ultimate terminas tion of the litigation, he shall so state \\ in writing such order. The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion. permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: provided, however, that application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals, or a judge thereof, shall so order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\">. In the St. Amant case the trial court set aside that part of the jury verdict based on a claim for punitive damages, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ground that punitive damages could be awarded only where \u201cmalice\u201d had been proved. Thus the trial court excluded the issue of malice, based on the proof introduced to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">. Since it is clear that the paragraph relating to McLaney originated entirely with McCrary\u2019s statement that McLaney was lending helicopters to assist in the Pindling campaign, the entire passage from his deposition relating to a possible connection between Lansky and McLaney is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cQ. Did you tell Mr. Lambert that Mr. McLaney introduced Lansky and Groves?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">A. It was the story around. A story was spread around that presumably Sands and Bidwell (phonetically)\u2014that Bidwell was Sands\u2019 man. A public relations guy for the Sands\u2019 party, whatever it was, U.B.P., or whatever it was. Among the stories was the fact that Mr. McLaney was working, and I was working for Chesler, going to bring Chesler back into power. That story was printed in the Miami Herald.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">Q. Is it your testimony that a story appeared in the Miami Herald linking your name, Mr. McLaney\u2019s name and Chesler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">A. Xes, that is why I was in the campaign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">Q. Did you see the article yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">A. Yes, I was there. I got the clipping. The other story was that I had brought\u2014you see, Lansky was even linked in everybody\u2019s mind with Courtney, Ritter and Bidwell,\u2014and that I had brought Lansky to Groves. In the course of conversation with Mr. Lambert, the Groves name came in. Whether or not it was\u2014wait a minute, you asked a specific question. Did I say that Mr. McLaney brought Mr. Lansky to Groves, or Sands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">Q. I said Groves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">A. I did not. I said that there was a story but the other story that I heard was that Mr. McLaney had come in with Lansky to see Sands long before Groves took up gambling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">Q. Mr. McCrary'\u2014\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-19\">A. And Lansky had come in to see Sands. That is the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-20\">Q. It is your testimony that you heard a rumored story around town that Mr. McLaney was the one that introduced Lansky and Groves?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-21\">A. That was one story. The other was that Mr. McLaney introduced Lan-sky to Sands. Steve Barber confirmed Lansky came in with Sands too. Along with the whole Havana crowd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-22\">Q. Did you report this to Mr. Lambert that this was something you heard rather than your own words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-23\">A. Definitely. I would have no knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-11\">.

There was also a May 4, 1963 clipping from the Washington Post, written by a well known columnist, in which McLaney was referred to as \u201can American gambler who ran a casino in Havana and stayed on for 18 months after Castro\u2019s takeover.\u201d -</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-14\">.

Lambert testified that this was stated to him by McCrary but that when he first heard it he gave no significance to it because it had come to him from an English newspaperman who had picked it up second hand. However, he testified that when he made his call to Prime Minister-Elect Pindling, he specifically put the question to him (presumably, he meant whether there was an agreement that Me-Laney was to take over the gambling under the new government) and Pindling answered, \u201cWell, no, MeLaney \u2014 we don\u2019t have any\u201d \u2014 he said MeLaney has just been helpful, and I don\u2019t know any of these things.

In appellee\u2019s brief here, this personal conversation with Peloquin is ignored. It is implied, rather, that the sole source of Lambert's information from Peloquin was the telephone call made to him in January of 1967, after having learned from McCrary of McLaney\u2019s activity in the election campaign. Appellant\u2019s counsel, in cross-examining Lambert as to his telephone conversation with Peloquin, sought to show that Peloquin did not discuss the removal of the gambling mob to the Bahamas nor that the word \u201cmob\u201d was ever used or that Lambert asked him whether or not McLaney was a Lansky associate. The point of the matter is this does not create any dispute of fact between Lambert\u2019s testimony and that of Peloquin, because Lambert\u2019s testimony about Peloquin having told of McLaney being a gambler in Havana and having moved to the Bahamas related to a conversation with Peloquin several months earlier, as to which no inquiry was made of him when his deposition was taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b637-15\">.
