He confines his appeal to an attack on the search of his house, urging that his motion to suppress evidence should have been granted. Having studied the briefs and record, we have determined that this appeal is appropriate for summary disposition without oral argument. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Clerk of this Court has been directed to put this case on the summary calendar and notify the parties in writing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number> On the basis of the briefs and record, we proceed to the merits of the case. In a nutshell, appellant contends that an Internal Revenue agent committed a fatal error when he entered appellant\u2019s house and commenced a search without first announcing his authority and purpose as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The testimony reflects that the Internal Revenue agent with the search warrant approached the front of the house while another agent found appellant in back, arrested him, went inside, and commenced a search. The agent with the warrant came inside and served it after the search had begun. The arresting officer did not make an official announcement of authority and purpose before entering the house. However, we believe this case is governed by the rule that a formal announcement of authority and purpose is nob essential to the validity of an entry and search where such an announcement would be a useless gesture. Miller v. United States, 1958, 357 U.S. 301, 310, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 1196, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332; Der Garabedian v. United States, 5th Cir. 1966, 372 F.2d 697. Appellant knew he was being arrested, knew why he was being arrested, and knew why he and the officer were going inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Appellant relies on the recent case of Sabbath v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 585, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828, which reaffirmed that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 governs unannounced entries by police whether with a warrant or without, forcible or nonforcible. In that case, however, the police entered the defendant\u2019s house through an unlocked door without announcing their authority and purpose and before the defendant had seen them. He was not aware of the entry until it had been accomplished. In the case at bar, on the other hand, appellant was apprehended outside of his house and was obviously aware of the agent\u2019s authority and purpose prior to entry. Hence, a formal announcement of authority and purpose would have been a useless gesture. The failure to make one ought not to be held to have been a fatal error and will not be. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">RULES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">RULE 17</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">DOCKET CONTROL</p>\n<p id=\"aic-dedup-0\">In the interest of docket control, the chief judge may from time to time, in his discretion, appoint a panel or panels to review pending cases for appropriate assignment or disposition under Rules 18, 19 or 20 or any other rule of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">RULE 18</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-13\">SUMMARY CALENDAR</p>\n<p id=\"ATV\">(a) Whenever the court, sua sponte or on suggestion of a party, concludes that a case is of such character as not to justify oral argument, the case may be placed on the summary calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-14\">(2) A separate summary calendar will be maintained for those eases to be considered without oral argument.
