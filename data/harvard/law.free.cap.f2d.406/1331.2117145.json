These prerequisites are the transitionary short steps which must be taken now and the planning for the long steps that must be taken in 1969-70/1970-71 to effect lock-stock-and-barrel desegregation. More than two years after Jefferson,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this Court is still not able to get the message through to these school boards that the standard for determining the effectiveness of a desegregation plan is an objective one: Does it work?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fidelity to our earlier holding in these very cases now consolidated in three appeals,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>delity to other decisions of this Court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and of the Sureme Court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> indeed fidelity to federal judicial process command summary reversal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">These thirty cases, consolidated in three appeals, were among forty-four cases consolidated on appeal in Adams v. Mathews, No. 26501. In <em>Adams, </em>on August 20, 1968, we set deadlines for action by the school boards and by the district court. We did so to prevent the delay here granted by the district court and now blessed by a majority of this Court. Our object was to forestall the ubiquitous contention that it is too late <em>this </em>school term to make extensive changes in the next school term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">The order in Adams is short. It is quoted, in pertinent part, in the footnotes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We required the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>to \u201ctreat school desegregation cases as entitled to the highest priority and conduct a hearing in each case at the earliest practicable time, no later than November 4, 1968\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, in a particular case, the district court concluded that the existing freedom of choice plan was not working but that it was not administratively feasible for the board to shift \u201cimmediately\u201d to other alternatives the court was directed to require the board</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajm-dedup-0\">(1) \u201cto take forthwith such steps toward full desegregation as may be practicable in the first and second semesters of the 1968-69 school year, and (2) <em>to formulate and submit to the Court by November 28, 1968, </em>a plan to complete the full conversion of the school district to a unitary, non-racial school system for the 1969-70 school year\u201d. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap1\">We directed the district, court to \u201cen-fer an order by such date as will permit effective review, if review is necessary, of the court-approved actions the Board will institute in the 1968-69 year as well as the 1969-70 year\u201d. Unfortunately for the constitutional rights of Negro students, the 1968-69 term will be over by the time this case is heard and decided on \u201cexpedited\u201d appeal. Full desegregation in the 1969-70 term is made difficult, if not impossible, by the unwillingness of the school boards to take effec-five transitionary action.</p>\n<p id=\"Ami\">On remand, the district court found that the \u201cschool boards are acting in good faith\u201d. But good faith does not excuse non-compliance; it is relevant only as a necessary ingredient of an acceptable desegregation plan,</p>\n<p id=\"avm-dedup-0\">The district court\u2019s major finding was that the decree under which the boards have been operating since the fall of 1967 has \u201creal prospects for dismantling the dual system \u2018at the earliest practicable date\u2019\u201d \u2014 whenever that is. ' Apparrently because of this finding, the district court did not require the school boards to \u201ctake forthwith\u201d any steps for the 1968-69 school year. And instead of requiring the boards to submit by November 28, 1968, specific plans for full conversion to a unitary, non-racial system, the district court required each board to \u201cre-assess its own system and on or before March 1, 1969, make a rePort * * * as to what additional courses are open to it to bring about the end result required by the Supreme Court in <em>Green.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"abb-dedup-0\">I turn now to the Supreme Court\u2019s con-elusions as to what does <em>not </em>constitute \u201creal prospects for dismantling the dual system\u201d. In <em>Green, </em>the Supreme Court found the following criteria relevant to workability of a school desegregation plan (1) A school board\u2019s adoption of a freedom of choice plan 11 years after <em>Brown </em>I was decided and 10 years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number><em>Brown </em>II raises the inference that the board deliberately perpetuated the unconstitutional dual system. \u201cSuch delays are no longer tolerable * * The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now\u201d; not at \u201cthe earliest practicable date\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) Freedom of choice is not acceptable if its effect is to shift the burden of desegregating schools from the school board to the children and their parents.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (8) Existence of an all-Negro school<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (4) the fact that 85 percent of the Negro children attend all-Negro schools demonstrate, as a matter of law, that a desegregation plan is not working.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (5) <em>Green </em>does not deal with faculty desegregation. The Supreme Court has held, however, that students in public schools have a constitutional right to attend schools where teachers have not been assigned on the basis of race.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As to faculty, <em>Jefferson </em>held that nothing less is required than \u201cthat the pattern of teacher assignment to any particular school not be identifiable as tailored for a heavy concentration of either Negro or white pupils in the school\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Bessemer </em>set a date for \u201cC-day\u201d, the first day of the 1970-71 term, for full compliance with the requirement of faculty integration.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Fourth and Tenth Circuits require, as a remedy to eliminate faculty segregation, \u201cthe same approximate percentage of non-white teachers in each school as there now is in the system\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">This Court has held that \u201cschool authorities bear the burden of justifying an apparent lack of progress\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the November 12 hearing the school boards came forward with no suggested steps that might ease the transition from a dual to a unitary system. They relied on the so-called <em>Jefferson </em>reports to the courts, statistical records showing the degree of desegregation. These reports show that there is no basis for the district court\u2019s findings. On the contrary, there is not one case where a desegregation plan meets the <em>Green-Jefferson </em>criteria and none that offers any hope of \u201cworking\u201d without substantial additions and changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-14\">There are seven school districts involved in the cases consolidated in No. 27,087.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here are the facts as to those districts, (a) The 37 traditionally Negro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>schools remain all-Negro schools, (b) The number and percentage of Negroes attending formerly all-white schools is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">STUDENT DESEGREGATION - NO. 27,087</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">School System No. of Negroes Percentage No', of of Negroes Negroes attending at former former No. of white white whites schools schools</p>\n<p id=\"Aub\">Union Parish 2300 2700 17 0.5</p>\n<p id=\"anr-dedup-0\">City of Monroe 5300 54 1</p>\n<p id=\"ASa5\">Concordia Parish 3400 37 1</p>\n<p id=\"a9m-dedup-0\">Claiborne Parish 23 1</p>\n<p id=\"AzfQ\">Ouachita Parish 4500 12,300 79 1.5</p>\n<p id=\"AM_\">Winn Parish 1520 2400 69 3.8</p>\n<p id=\"ama-dedup-1\">Jackson Parish 1500 83 5</p>\n<p id=\"adr-dedup-1\">* according to choice forms</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">(c) The figures on faculty integration are unclear, e. g. they do not reflect the courses taught by teachers or whether an arts teacher for several schools is treated as a member of the faculties in the several schools.

In some areas, because of residential patterns based on race, court-approved school zoning would legalize the Southern equivalent of Northern de facto segregation. In many school districts freedom of choice has not worked because school boards have thought that they complied with the law simply by opening the doors of white schools to Negro children bold enough to apply for entrance. That is not the law. This Court and the Supreme Court have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>that the dual system must be done away with, root and branch. There is nothing necessarily unconstitutional about freedom of choice or geographic zoning or a combination of the two. Whatever plan is used, transfers should be favored when a transferee is from a school where the transferee\u2019s race constitute a majority and he is transferring to a school where students of his race are in the minority; minority to majority transfers should not be favored. Principals are enormously important, especially in rural areas. They should be rotated or assigned to schools where students of the opposite race are in the majority. All athletic activities should have been desegregated years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-4\">The statistical evidence points plainly to the fact that in a freedom of choice system white students will not attend a school having a Negro principal and all-Negro faculty. One remedy is for the school authorities to assign teachers on the basis of race, so that the faculty of each school will substantially reflect the racial composition of the total number of teachers in the system. The rule should not be inflexible. The proportion of teachers and staff in a school should <em>substantially </em>reflect the ratio of Negro teachers in a school to all teachers in the system such as would have resulted if, in the past, teachers had been assigned without regard to race. As this Court has held in other cases, race may be considered when it is necessary in fashioning a remedy to undo past unconstitutional discrimination.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The purpose is not to achieve racial balance as an end in itself but to use it as a means of ending the dual system based on segregated faculties in segregated schools. As the Seventh Circuit recently pointed out in a decision upholding a district court\u2019s order requiring bussing of children from one Chicago school to another, \u201cThis is not done to achieve racial balance, although that may be the result, but to counteract the legacy left by the Board\u2019s history of discrimination.\u201d United States v.

One alternative to freedom of choice is the assignment of students on the basis of geographic attendance zones.
