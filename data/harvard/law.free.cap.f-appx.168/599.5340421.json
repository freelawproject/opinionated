Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Romero first challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a 16-level enhancement for a prior felony conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>As </em>the enhancement of Romero\u2019s sentence was based on a prior conviction, there was no Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error. Nevertheless, in light of <em>Booker, </em>the application of the Guidelines as mandatory was error, which this court has termed \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). We review for harmless error, and we reject Romero\u2019s contention that \u201cFanfan\u201d error is structural and, therefore, insusceptible of harmless error analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The Government has failed to carry its burden of showing harmless error as it has failed to point to anything in the record that demonstrates \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced [the defendant] differently had it acted under an advisory Guidelines regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376-77 (5th Cir.2005). The Government\u2019s assertion that the sentence was reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), is insufficient to carry the Government\u2019s burden. <em>See, e.g., Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 465-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">Romero also asserts that the enhanced penalty provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(b) are unconstitutional. Romero\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Romero contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Romero properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Romero\u2019s conviction. We VACATE his sentence and REMAND to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
