Guzman correctly notes that his argument, made for the first time on appeal, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict and sentence him because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Guzman also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a condition of supervised release that requires him to cooperate in the collection of his DNA. Guzman\u2019s claim is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
