Gonzalez-Martinez argues that there was error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because he was sentenced under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. He asserts that the Government cannot show that the <em>Booker </em>error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the error is structural and not subject to harmless error analysis. His argument that the error was structural is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Gonzalez-Martinez also argues that, even if the error was not structural, the error cannot be shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government concedes that Gonzalez-Martinez has preserved the issue for appeal. Our review is thus for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). The Government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced Gonzalez-Martinez differently under an advisory guideline sentencing regime. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">The instant record fails to provide clear commentary from the district court regarding whether it would have imposed the same sentence in a <em>post-Booker </em>environment. <em>See id. </em>The Government thus has not carried its burden of showing harmless error. <em>See id. </em>We therefore remand Gonzalez-Martinez\u2019s case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">Gonzalez-Martinez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gonzalez-Martinez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.2003). Gonzalez-Martinez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-18\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
