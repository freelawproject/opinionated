He challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a 16-level enhancement for a prior felony conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, arguing that the enhancement violates the rule announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">As the enhancement was based on a prior conviction, there is no Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error. Rather, the error was the application of the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, which we have termed \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir. 2005). As with <em>Booker </em>error, when \u201cFan-fan\u201d error is preserved in the district court, this court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless [the court] can say the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). As Villafuerte objected to the application of the Guidelines to him, we review for harmless error. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. We reject Villafuerte\u2019s contention that \u201cFanfan\u201d error is structural and, therefore, insusceptible of harmless error analysis. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">To show harmless error, the Government must demonstrate \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced [the defendant] differently had it acted under an advisory Guidelines regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376-77 (5th Cir.2005). In light of <em>Walters, </em>we reject the Government\u2019s contention that the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-16\">The Government has not met its burden. The record contains no indication as to what the district court would have done had it been aware that it was not bound to apply the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s sentence at the low end of the Guidelines reflected that the court considered the Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and took into account Villafuerte\u2019s objection that his criminal history was over-represented is unavailing. Those facts tell us nothing more than that, within the then-mandatory Guidelines framework, the district court believed that the sentence was appropriate. They shed no light on what sentence the district court would have imposed had it been given the greater discretion afforded by an advisory Guidelines scheme. As we cannot say that the mandatory application of the Guidelines did not affect Villafuerte\u2019s sentence, Villafuerte\u2019s sentence must be vacated and the case must be remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-17\">Villafuerte also asserts that the enhanced penalty provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(b) are unconstitutional. Villafuerte\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Villafuerte contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Villafuerte properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Villafuerte\u2019s conviction. We VACATE his sentence and REMAND to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b29-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
