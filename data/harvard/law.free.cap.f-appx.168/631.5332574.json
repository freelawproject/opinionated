Council challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon and for using, carrying, or possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime. We have determined that a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established Council\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to both counts. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Thus, we AFFIRM Council\u2019s conviction as to these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Council argues that the district court enhanced his sentence based on his career offender status in violation of the Sixth Amendment. We have held, however, that a judge\u2019s determination of career offender status does not implicate <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because, except for the defendant\u2019s age, \u201c[cjareer offender status is not \u2018a sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a fact other than a prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 s.ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d- (2006) (No. 05-7643). The Government concedes, however, that it cannot meet its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error in sentencing Council pursuant to a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme, so-called \u201cFanfan\u201d error, was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Council\u2019s sentence, which included alternative sentences, is VACATED in its entirety and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
