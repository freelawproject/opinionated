Sanchez argues that his sentence should be vacated and remanded because the district court sentenced him under the mandatory guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-29\">Because the district court sentenced Sanchez under a mandatory guidelines regime, it committed error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Government concedes that Sanchez\u2019s objection below preserved his claim. We cannot affirm the erroneous sentence unless the Government shows that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285-86 (5th Cir.2005). We conclude that the Government has not met its burden. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 171 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore VACATE Sanchez\u2019s sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Sanchez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Sanchez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Sanchez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Sanchez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
