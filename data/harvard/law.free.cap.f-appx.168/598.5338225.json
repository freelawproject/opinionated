He contends that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional because they do not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be treated as an element of the offense and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Cisneros-Jimenez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Cisneros-Jimenez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cisneros-Jimenez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Cisneros-Jimenez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Cisneros-Jimenez also argues that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). By sentencing Cisneros-Jimenez under a mandatory guidelines regime, the district court committed what this court refers to as Fanfan error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The Government concedes that CisnerosJimenez preserved his Fanfan claim for appellate review, that the district court\u2019s actions are reviewed for harmless error, and that it cannot show that the error was harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 463-64. The sentencing transcript supports the Government\u2019s concession. We therefore we VACATE Cisneros-Jimenez\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b624-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
