Castaneda asserts that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the Sentencing Guidelines for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, based on a letter written by Castaneda to his codefendant. He has not established that the district court erred in its assessment. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 363 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 375, 163 L.Ed.2d 163 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Castaneda also contends that the district court should have awarded him a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. He has not established that the district court\u2019s denial of that reduction was \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005); \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Castaneda asserts that he is entitled to resentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court made factual findings that led to enhancement of the applicable guideline range. After <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[t]he sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Therefore, Castaneda\u2019s contention that the district court was precluded from enhancing his sentence based on judge-found facts is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited, circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
