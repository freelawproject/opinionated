Torchia appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his declaratory judgment action on <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine grounds, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to amend his complaint. Because we agree that the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine bars Torchia\u2019s claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>The State of Florida\u2019s Office of Financial Regulation (the \u201cState\u201d) brought Torchia before an administrative court to answer for his selling, as an unregistered dealer, unregistered securities, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 517. The administrative hearing officer found that Torchia had violated the statute multiple times, and recommended fining him $120,000. Torchia appealed to Florida\u2019s Fourth District Court of Appeal, which affirmed the administrative hearing officer\u2019s findings. Torchia then sought discretionary review from the Florida Supreme Court, which declined to hear his case. Torchia did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Four months later, Torchia filed this declaratory judgment action, alleging that \u201cChapter 517 as applied in light of Chapter 626 is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d (R.-l at 14 \u00b634.); <em>Torchia v. State of Fla., Office of Financial Regulation, </em>2005 WL 2007105 at *2 (11th Cir.2005). The State filed a motion to dismiss, asserting, among other things, that based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court granted the motion. The court also denied Torchia\u2019s request for leave to amend his complaint to substitute an individual party for the State to avoid an Eleventh Amendment dismissal. Torchia now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine jurisdictionally bars federal district courts from reviewing state court decisions. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1522-23, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). This circuit has applied the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to hold that district courts have no subject matter jurisdiction to review claims not raised in state court, but \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court judgment. <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 466 (11th Cir.1996). This application is limited by the further rule that a claim that the plaintiff had no opportunity to raise in state court cannot be barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman. Id. </em>at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">In this case, as in <em>Powell, </em>Torchia\u2019s as-applied constitutional claims are inextricably intertwined with the state-law litigation that resulted in his fines. <em>See id. </em>If we decide that Section 517 of the Florida Statutes was unconstitutionally applied to Torchia, as he claims, we necessarily nullify the state court judgment that resulted in his fine under that section. It is clear that, under Florida law, Torchia should have brought his as-applied constitutional challenge as part of his state court litigation. <em>See Key Haven Assoc. Enter, v. Board of Trustees, </em>427 So.2d 153, 158 (Fla. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Our conclusion that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine moots the other issues presented by Torchia on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
