He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on his Texas prior conviction for kidnapping under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Because he did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005). Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by 16 levels if he was previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence. Kidnapping is one of the enumerated offenses listed in the application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 as a crime of violence. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). A prior conviction will qualify as a crime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>lence if it is specifically enumerated in the commentary definition, regardless of whether it has the use of force as an element. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 273-75 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). We use a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to determine whether a defendant\u2019s offense qualifies as an offense enumerated in \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Garcia-Gonzalez has not shown that the district court\u2019s increase in his offense level based on his prior Texas kidnapping conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 was a \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error. Under Texas law, a person commits the offense of kidnapping if he \u201cintentionally or knowingly abducts another person.\u201d Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 20.03(a)(2005). The elements of the Texas kidnapping offense are consistent with the ordinary, contemporary, and common understanding of the term as defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. The district court\u2019s determination that Garcia-Gonzalez\u2019s offense level should be increased based on his prior kidnapping offense under \u00a7 2L1.2 was not a \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error. <em>See Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d at 273-75; <em>Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Garcia-Gonzalez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises the argument to preserve it for further review. We have \u201crepeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Garcia-Gonzalez] and ... held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi[ v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).]\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
