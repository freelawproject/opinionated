On October 28, 1988, after a jury trial, Petitioner was convicted of indecency with a child and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which was suspended with the imposition of ten years probation. In 2004, Petitioner was served with a Notice to Appear that alleged removability based on Petitioner\u2019s conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, pursuant to \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the INA. On July 8, 2004, after several hearings, the Immigration Judge (IJ) determined that Petitioner was eligible for waiver of the ground of admissibility under former INA \u00a7 212(c) and granted relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the BIA held that, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.44(b)(2) and 1212.3(h) (2004), which were amended and revised after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>IJ\u2019s decision, Petitioner is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The Court reviews questions of law <em>de novo. Silwany-Rodriguez v. INS, 975 </em>F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). However, this review \u201c \u2018is limited,\u2019 and the Court \u2018accord[s] deference to the [BIAJ\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless there are compelling indications that the [BIA]\u2019s interpretation is wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., citing Campos-Guardado v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 285, 289 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cOn review, an agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id., citing Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">8 C.F.R. 1212.3(h) clearly provides that an alien seeking \u00a7 212(c) relief must have pleaded guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>to the crime for which they were convicted. In the instant case, Petitioner did not plead guilty, but rather, was convicted after a jury trial. Therefore, there are no compelling indications that the BIA was wrong to find that the regulations precluded \u00a7 212(c) relief for Petitioner. Petitioner has not challenged the BIA\u2019s construction of the regulation, and the constitutionality of the regulation is not before the Court. Thus, the Court will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision to apply the relevant regulatory provisions to Petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-24\">.
