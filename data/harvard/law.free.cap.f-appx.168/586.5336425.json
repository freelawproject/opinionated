Williams has appealed the district court\u2019s order modifying the conditions of his supervised release to require his placement in a community corrections center. Williams has also appealed the district court\u2019s orders denying his motions for statewide travel authorization during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>2004-05 holiday season and to have grand jury proceedings unsealed and transcribed and to unseal and transcribe all records. These three appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Williams\u2019s appointed counsel, the Federal Public Defender, has moved for leave to withdraw, pursuant to <em>Anders v. State of California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that the appeal from the modification of the conditions of Williams\u2019s supervised release presents no nonfrivolous issue. Williams has filed a response to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). After this appeal was filed, Williams\u2019s supervision was revoked on the basis of new and continuing violations of the conditions of his supervised release and he has been sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment with no further supervision. Because Williams is no longer under supervision and will not be subject to supervision after he has served his additional term of imprisonment, the appeals from the orders modifying the conditions of his supervised release and denying Williams\u2019s request for leave to travel out of state are moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7-14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The motions to have grand jury proceedings unsealed and transcribed, and to unseal and transcribe all records were predicated on the reinstatement of Williams\u2019s then pending appeal in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>142 Fed.Appx. 205 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Because that appeal has been decided, the appeal from the order denying those motions is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Because the consolidated appeals are moot, this court lacks jurisdiction. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
