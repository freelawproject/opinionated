However, that provision is inapplicable to \u00a7 4B1.4, <em>see United States v. Sanders, </em>372 F.3d 1183, 11866 (10th Cir.2004), and the denial of Kelley\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">Kelley contends for the first time in a letter pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), submitted after the Government filed its brief, that U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 674, which became effective November 1, 2004, should apply to his case and result in reduction of his sentence. We need not consider Kelley\u2019s argument, as it was raised for the first time in a Rule 28(j) letter. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 577 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1142, 163 L.Ed.2d 1000 (2006). Kelley has filed a \u201cmotion to compel performance pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.\u201d Kelley\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO COMPEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
