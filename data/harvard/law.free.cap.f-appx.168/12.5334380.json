The defendants argue that the prosecution intentionally provoked them into moving for a mistrial and that the district court erred by misapplying the principles given in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-24\">The appellants have not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss was erroneous. The district court\u2019s finding that the prosecution did not intentionally provoke the defendants into moving for a mistrial was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 675-76, 102 S.Ct. 2083; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>76 F.3d 1339, 1342 (5th Cir.1996). To the contrary, the record strongly supports the district court\u2019s findings concerning the inadvertence of the error that led to the mistrial and the parties\u2019 desires, or lack thereof, for the mistrial. Our review of the record and the district court\u2019s detailed reasons for judgment also refutes the appellants\u2019 contention that the denial of their motion was grounded in a misapplication of <em>Kennedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The appellants have shown no error in the judgment of the district court. Accordingly, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
