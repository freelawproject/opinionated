He argues that this was constitutional error in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The Government argues that the appeal should be dismissed because, as part of his plea agreement, \u00d1ap\u00f3les waived his right to appeal his sentence or the manner in which it was determined. \u00d1ap\u00f3les did not address the waiver in his brief or in a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The record reflects that Napoles knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 502, 163 L.Ed.2d 365 (2005). Because the waiver is valid, the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Counsel Everto A. Villarreal is warned that pursuing an appeal despite a valid appeal waiver provision in the plea agreement and failing to address the waiver in a reply brief after it was raised by the Government in its brief is a needless waste of judicial resources and will invite sanctions. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
