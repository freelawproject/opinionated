Marks argues that his guilty plea was involuntary because the trial court did not advise him that he faced a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. He contends that he should be allowed to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because \u201che has not had an unobstructed shot at getting his conviction or sentence vacated.\u201d Marks cites to <em>Dretke v. Haley, </em>541 U.S. 386, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed.2d 659 (2004) and <em>United States v. White, </em>371 F.Supp.2d 378 (W.D.N.Y.2005) in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-21\">Marks has not shown that his claim meets the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d He has not shown that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that such claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in his trial, appeal, or first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001). Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Marks\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
