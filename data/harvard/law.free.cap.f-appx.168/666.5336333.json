Casta\u00f1eda-Salgado raises a Fourth Amendment challenge to the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of his supervised release. As Castaneda-Salgado concedes, such a claim is not ripe for review, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). Accordingly, that portion of the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Casta\u00f1eda-Salgado also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Castaneda-Salgado\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Casta\u00f1eda-Salgado contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Casta\u00f1eda-Salgado properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
