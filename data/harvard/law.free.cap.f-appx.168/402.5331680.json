On appeal, Battle asserts that his indictment contained no allegations regarding the nature of his prior criminal offenses \u2014 in particular, the indictment did not allege that the offenses satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 924(e). Battle further alleges that the fact of a prior conviction is an element of the offense that must be included in the indictment and proved to the jury. Battle notes that his position conflicts with our recent decision in <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005), that the Sixth Amendment is not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced on the basis of prior convictions. He states that he nevertheless seeks to preserve this issue in order to raise it at the appropriate time.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">As an initial matter, Battle does not dispute the calculation of the armed career criminal provision as a violation of the guidelines in his initial brief on appeal. Rather, he argues only that the imposition of the enhancements violated his Sixth Amendment rights and contradicted the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Accordingly, we need not address the imposition of the enhancement, as any argument in this regard has been abandoned. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1300 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Because Battle raised a <em>Booker </em>objection at his sentencing, we review the issue <em>de novo, </em>and we will reverse \u201conly if any error was harmful.\u201d <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. The Court explicitly reaffirmed that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756. After <em>Booker, </em>the Guidelines range is now advisory and no longer dictates the final sentencing result, but it is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court should consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 764-65. We have explained that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) Sixth Amendment error based upon sentencing enhancements neither admitted by the defendant nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt that are binding on the sentencing judge; and (2) statutory error based upon sentencing under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government is not required to allege in its indictment, nor must it prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to properly use those convictions to enhance a sentence. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1233, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). After <em>Booker, </em>we held that the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was \u201cleft undisturbed by <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)], <em>Blakely [v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) ], and <em>Booker, \u201d </em>and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Recently, in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to establishing a predicate prior conviction for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and held that, when the prior state conviction resulted from a guilty plea, federal sentencing courts making the career-offender determination may only consider the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement, the transcript of a plea colloquy with the judge during which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or some comparable judicial record of this information, but not other underlying documents such as police reports. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1259-1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). In a separate section, a plurality of the Court explained that, while a disputed fact as to whether a burglary was a violent felony for purposes of the Act because it was committed in a building or enclosed space (\u201cgeneric burglary\u201d) could be \u201cdescribed as a fact about a prior conviction, it [was] too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to <em>Jones [v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) ] and <em>Apprendi, </em>to say that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 1262. After <em>Shepard, </em>we have held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005) and <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Here, Battle\u2019s sentencing hearing occurred after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, there was no statutory <em>Booker </em>error here, as Battle\u2019s sentence was imposed under an advisory guidelines scheme. Furthermore, the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement was appropriately applied. Insofar as the district court\u2019s enhancement of Battle\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.4 merely involved determinations that he had prior qualifying convictions, the enhancement did not implicate the <em>Booker </em>line of cases, as those cases clearly exempt prior convictions from the types of facts that must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a sentence enhancement. Moreover, we have indicated that, until the Supreme Court holds otherwise, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>See e.g., Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 963. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>Shepard </em>have not overruled its previous holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>that prior convictions may be considered in enhancing sentences. Thus, after <em>Booker, </em>a judge still is able to impose enhancements on the basis of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Battle also argues that the district court violated <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), by characterizing his prior convictions as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under \u00a7 924(e). However, we conclude that Battle\u2019s argument is without merit because there were no <em>disputed </em>issues with respect to Battle\u2019s prior drug offenses. Battle conceded at his change-of-plea hearing that he had been convicted of the necessary predicate offenses for the enhancement. Moreover, he did not object to the descriptions of the prior convictions in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), and, thus, these facts should be deemed \u201cadmitted\u201d for <em>Booker </em>purposes. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330 (holding that a defendant admits to the PSI\u2019s factual statements about his relevant conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>where he raises no objections to those statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">After the district court determined that \u00a7 924(e) was applicable here, it sentenced Battle to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years or 180 months of imprisonment. This sentence was appropriate, because, <em>post-Booker, </em>district courts remain bound by statutory mandatory minimum sentences. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10. Thus, we affirm Battle\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
