The district court dismissed Dolan\u2019s petition as time-barred by the one-year limitations period of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">To obtain a COA, a prisoner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). \u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-16\">Dolan challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his conviction became final on October 21, 2001, which is 30 days after the state appellate court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal and the date that the statutory time for filing a petition for discretionary review (\u201cPDR\u201d) expired. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), the limitations period commences on the date that the judgment in question \u201cbecame final by the conclusion of direct review <em>or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(l)(A)(emphasis added). Under Texas law, \u201ca PDR is considered to be part of the direct review process, which ends when the petition is denied or when the time available for filing lapses.\u201d <em>Salmas v. Dretke, </em>354 F.3d 425, 428 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1032, 124 S.Ct. 2099, 158 L.Ed.2d 714 (2004). In Dolan\u2019s case, the time available for filing a PDR lapsed when the extension of time granted by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for filing a PDR expired on December 21, 2001. Thus, the district court erred in finding that Dolan\u2019s conviction became final before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">Dolan had one year, or until December 21, 2002, to file his federal petition. Dolan filed a state habeas application on December 15, 2001, thereby stopping the federal clock with six days remaining. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The federal limitations period remained tolled until the state habeas application was denied on May 7, 2003. Because Dolan did not file his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition until May 20, 2003, the petition was time-barred absent tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Dolan argues that under the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d his state habeas application should be deemed filed on December 5, 2002, when he presented it to prison authorities for mailing. We have already rejected the application of the mailbox rule for determining the filing dates of state habeas corpus petitions. <em>See Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Dolan argues further that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period for (1) the delay between the date he presented his state habeas application to prison authorities for mailing and the date when the application was stamped in the state court, and (2) the delay from the date that the state habeas court denied his application and the date that he received notice that the application had been denied. Equitable tolling may be appropriate for these delays. <em>See Phillips v. Donnelly, </em>216 F.3d 508, 511 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g granted and modified in part on other grounds, </em>223 F.3d 797 (2000); <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>184 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The district court did not address Dolan\u2019s equitable tolling arguments, however, and we have no district court decision denying equitable tolling to review. We conclude that Dolan has shown that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Based on the materials of record, it is impossible to determine whether reasonable jurists would also debate whether the claims raised by Dolan in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition are valid claims of a constitutional deprivation. <em>See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004). We therefore GRANT a COA, VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment, and REMAND the matter to the district court to consider in the first instance Dolan\u2019s equitable tolling claims. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). The district court should determine inter alia when Dolan first received notice of the denial of his state habeas application and whether he diligently pursued his federal habeas rights. <em>See Phillips, </em>216 F.3d at 511. Dolan bears the burden on remand to prove the factual predicates for equitable tolling. <em>Phillips, </em>223 F.3d at 797. If the district court determines that equitable tolling is warranted, it should then consider the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">COA GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b37-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
