Nunez argues that the district reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">There was no <em>\u201cBooker\u201d </em>error or Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement to Nunez\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error by sentencing Nunez pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2005). We have previously rejected Nunez\u2019s claim that such error is \u201c \u2018structural\u2019 in nature.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">The Government concedes that Nunez preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>argument. As such, this court reviews the claim for harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 464. There is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">Nunez next argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Nunez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Nunez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Nunez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Nunez\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
