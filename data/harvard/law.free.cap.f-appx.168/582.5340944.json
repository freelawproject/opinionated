Mondragon argues that the district reversibly erred under <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. There was no <em>\u201cBooker\u201d </em>error or Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement to Mondragon\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error by sentencing Mondragon pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2005). We have previously rejected Mondragon\u2019s claim that such error is \u201cstructural\u201d in nature. <em>See id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The Government concedes that Mondragon preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>argument. As such, this court reviews the claim for harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 464. As the Government further concedes, there is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>Because we vacate Mondragon\u2019s sentence due to the mandatory application of the guidelines, it is not necessary to address his additional claim that the district court committed reversible error by assessing a 12-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Finally, Mondragon argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Mondragon\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Mondragon contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mondragon properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Mondragon\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
