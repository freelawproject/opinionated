Beazley, a Florida prisoner serving a total 34-year sentence for attempted manslaughter with a firearm, discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of another person, shooting at or into a dwelling, and being a felon in possession of a firearm, appeals the denial of his <em>pro se </em>habeas corpus petition, which he filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In his petition, Beazley claimed, among other things, that the state trial court violated his constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses by refusing to allow him to call Robert Martin, a co-defendant who pled guilty to the same offenses and whose testimony would have been relevant to impeach the state\u2019s witness, Shannon Knight, another of Beazley\u2019s co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">At trial, Domello Bolware testified that, on September 30, 1997, as he was walking in the front yard of his brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s house at 919 Cone Avenue, several shots were fired at him from a red Mustang with tinted windows. Knight testified that on September 30th: (1) she was driving her friend\u2019s red Mustang while Beazley sat in the passenger seat, and Martin sat in the back seat; (2) Beazley told her where to drive, to roll down her window, and to drive slowly; (3) Beazley started firing his gun and told her to drive faster; (4) the first time that she saw that Beazley had a gun was when he started firing it; (5) she did not see what Martin was doing; (6) after the shooting, they went to McDonald\u2019s, where she got out of the car and started yelling; and (7) then, Beazley and Martin dropped her off at her apartment. She denied that a weapon went off in the car on the way to Cone Avenue and created a hole in the floorboard. George Perkins testified that, on September 30th, Beazley: (1) came over to his house with Martin, told him that he \u201cwas going to fire some warning shots\u201d at someone who had \u201cripped him off,\u201d and took a .357 firearm; (2) returned later that night with Martin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>two firearms, and a handful of empty cartridges and asked Perkins to \u201chold onto\u201d the firearms; and (3) told Perkins that he had \u201cfired some warning shots to send out a message, let him know not to rip him off again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">During his case-in-chief, Beazley indicated that he wished to call Martin as a witness, to which the state objected that Beazley was calling Martin for the sole purpose of impeaching him. Out of the hearing of the jury, Martin proffered that he would have testified, among other things, that: (1) he participated in the drive-by shooting with Beazley and Knight; (2) they left from Beazley\u2019s apartment; (3) he had two .357 guns with him and fired \u201ca few\u201d shots; (4) he did not think that Knight knew that he had a gun, but she could see that Beazley had a gun; (5) as they were on their way to Cone Avenue, one of the two guns went off and blew a hole in the floorboard of the Mustang; and (6) after the shooting, they went to Perkins\u2019s apartment to get rid of the guns and the car. He denied that they went to McDonald\u2019s and that Knight got out of the car. When asked whether he had written a letter to Beazley, apologizing for \u201cl[ying] on him\u201d and stating that it was just he and Knight in the car, Martin testified that he had copied the letter from a letter that Beazley had sent him and he previously had contacted the state about the effect of changing his story on his plea bargain and sent the state\u2019s response to Beazley. He denied telling other inmates that Beazley had nothing to do with the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The court sustained the state\u2019s objection to Martin\u2019s testimony on the grounds that the primary purpose of calling Martin would be to impeach him by introducing evidence of prior inconsistent statements. The jury found Beazley guilty as to all five counts and he appealed his convictions. The state appellate court considered the exclusion of Martin\u2019s testimony, but summarily affirmed Martin\u2019s convictions. Beazley petitioned for habeas corpus and the district court found that exclusion of Martin\u2019s testimony did not violate Beazley\u2019s federal constitutional rights because Martin\u2019s testimony was \u201cuseless\u201d for both the state and Beazley. Accordingly, the district court denied Beazley\u2019s petition for habeas corpus. However, the district court granted Beazley a certificate of appealability on the following issue only: \u201cwhether petitioner is entitled to relief on the ground that the exclusion of the testimony of Robert Martin was unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">On appeal, Beazley argues that the state court violated his constitutional rights when it excluded the testimony of Martin, whose testimony would have (1) called into question Knight\u2019s testimony, which was the only direct evidence that Beazley fired the shots; (2) contradicted testimony about the guns that were found in Perkins\u2019s apartment; and (3) permitted Beazley to call several inmates to testify that Martin told them that Beazley was innocent. He argues that he was not attempting to impeach Martin, but to elicit Martin\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">A district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is reviewed <em>de novo. Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). A habeas petition \u201cshall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim-(l) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). However, the deferential standard of \u00a7 2254(d) does not apply \u201cwhen there is grave doubt about whether the state court applied the correct rule of governing federal law.\u201d <em>Romine v. Head, </em>253 F.3d 1349, 1365 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThe state court\u2019s failure to cite the relevant Supreme Court precedents does not mean that AEDPA deference does not apply.\u201d <em>Parker v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>331 F.3d 764, 776 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAll that is required under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is an adjudication on the merits, not a full state court opinion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">\u201cA state court\u2019s decision is \u2018contrary to\u2019 our clearly established law if it \u2018applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases\u2019 or if it \u2018confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.\u2019 A state court\u2019s decision is not \u2018contrary to ... clearly established Federal law' simply because the court did not cite our opinions.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Esparza, </em>540 U.S. 12, 15-16, 124 S.Ct. 7, 10, 157 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The Fifth and Sixth Amendments guarantee a criminal defendant the rights to obtain favorable witnesses by compulsory process and an opportunity to present evidence in his favor. <em>United States v. Hurn, </em>368 F.3d 1359, 1362 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor is violated when the defendant is arbitrarily denied the right to present a witness who is capable of testifying and \u201cwhose testimony would have been relevant and material to the defense.\u201d <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 23, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1925, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">We conclude from the record that the state appellate court\u2019s decision that the testimony should be excluded because its probative value was outweighed by the improper impeachment purpose was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, \u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d Moreover, any error in excluding Martin\u2019s substantive testimony was harmless because, even without considering the testimony of Knight, sufficient evidence supported Beazley\u2019s convictions. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
