He argues that the district court committed plain error by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>sentencing him as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C), based upon his two prior Texas state convictions for burglary of a habitation. As Stewart concedes, this issue is reviewed only for plain error because he did not object on this basis in district court. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 363 (5th Cir.2005). The district court did not commit plain error on this basis. <em>See United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Stewart also contends that, because his sentence was increased based upon the finding that he was a career offender, his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and he should be resentenced under the mandatory federal Sentencing Guidelines without reliance upon the career-offender finding. As he concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and by <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
