We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-23\">This court\u2019s review of the decision of the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) \u201cis limited to determining whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995). If substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings, the ALJ\u2019s decision must be affirmed. <em>Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 173 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 135 (5th Cir.2000). In applying this standard, this court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Apfel, </em>230 F.3d at 135; <em>Ripley, </em>67 F.3d at 555. Conflicts in evidence are for the ALJ to resolve. <em>Apfel, </em>230 F.3d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-24\">We find that the ALJ correctly applied the proper legal standards in evaluating the medical evidence; in assessing Fuentes\u2019s credibility with regard to his alleged disability, including reports of pain; and in determining Fuentes\u2019s residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>functional capacity. Further, the record shows that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Fuentes at no time was disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. Additionally, Fuentes\u2019s case is not of the type which requires the ALJ to make a separate, specific finding that Fuentes is able to maintain employment over a significant period of time. <em>See Watson v. Barnhart, </em>288 F.3d 212 (5th Cir.2002). Fuentes has presented no evidence that his condition \u201cwaxes and wanes\u201d in such a manner as to be inadequately taken into account in the ALJ\u2019s determination of residual functional capacity. <em>See Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 619-20 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b27-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
