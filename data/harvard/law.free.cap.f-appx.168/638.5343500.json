Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 274-75 (5th Cir.1998). Texas law provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy for property loss occasioned by prison employees through the administrative grievance process and through the court system. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 501.007, 501.008 (Vernon 2004); <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Aguilar v. Chastain, </em>923 S.W.2d 740, 743-44 (Tex.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">The record contains administrative grievance responses which indicate that Dye refused to accept the items which he had ordered from an outside vendor and refused to fill out an administrative form declining such items. As a result, they were destroyed in accordance with administrative policy. Dye offers no explanation in his brief with respect to the administrative responses, arguing instead that the administrative grievance procedure was \u201ccontemptuous\u201d and \u201cirrelevant.\u201d His conclusional assertions are insufficient to demonstrate that the grievance procedure was inadequate and that his due process rights were violated. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">Dye argues that the district court erred in failing to allow him to amend his complaint and requests that the district court grant him additional time in the law library to conduct discovery. Dye\u2019s contentions are meritless because he fails to explain what new arguments he would have made to preclude dismissal. Accordingly, Dye\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Dye is cautioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
