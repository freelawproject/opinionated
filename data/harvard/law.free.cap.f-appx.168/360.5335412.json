The 135-month sentence De Armas received was the lowest possible term within the applicable 135 to 168 months\u2019 advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">On appeal, De Armas argues that: (1) his sentence was unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence and retroactive application of <em>Booker </em>violated <em>ex post facto </em>and due process principles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>We \u201creview for unreasonableness\u201d a sentence imposed <em>post-Booker. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 765 (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>see also United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that <em>\u201cBooker </em>established a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard for the sentence finally imposed on a defendant\u201d). In making our reasonableness review, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (\u2018We do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>a defendant\u2019s claim that his sentence violated <em>ex post facto </em>principles. <em>See United States v. Abraham, </em>386 F.3d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 417, 163 L.Ed.2d 318 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">First, De Armas argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As for his claim that the district court did not adequately consider <em>all </em>of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we recently held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, a district court\u2019s failure to express reference each and every one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not constitute error under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">In any event, here, at the sentencing hearing, the district court expressly stated that it had considered <em>all </em>of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Although the district court did not detail the weight that it had accorded to each individual sentencing factor, it was not required to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. On this record, we are satisfied with the district court\u2019s express statements that it had considered De Armas\u2019s codefendants\u2019 sentences, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), as well as the facts that De Armas had no equity interest in the drugs, no role in the distribution of the drugs, and no role in the planning of the conspiracy. All of these facts were raised before the district court and plainly the court considered them. Simply put, De Armas\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable and is fully supported by the district court\u2019s sentencing considerations and factual findings. We can find no <em>Booker </em>error in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors here.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We likewise are unpersuaded by De Armas\u2019s argument that the district court violated <em>ex post facto </em>and due process principles when it sentenced him to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment because the maximum sentence that the district court could have imposed based solely on the facts charged in the indictment was 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> De Armas recognizes that we rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). In that case, the defendant argued that retroactively applying the remedial holding of the <em>Booker </em>decision \u2014 which allows for sentence enhancements based upon judicial fact-finding so long as the guidelines are applied in an advisory manner \u2014 did not give him \u201cfair warning\u201d of the potential sentence, and thus, acted as an <em>ex post facto </em>law, in violation of his due process rights. <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In <em>Duncan, </em>like here, the essence of the defendant\u2019s argument sought retroactive application of Booker\u2019s Sixth Amendment holding, but not its remedial holding. <em>Id. </em>at 1306. We concluded Duncan had \u201csufficient warning\u201d that life imprisonment was a potential consequence to his actions to satisfy due process and <em>ex post facto </em>concerns because, at the time of the offense, (1) the applicable statute provided for a sentence of life imprisonment; (2) the Guidelines provided that a judge would engage in fact-finding to determine sentence and could impose a sentence of life imprisonment; and (3) although mandatory Guidelines were in place, the law of this Circuit then recognized the United States Code as the source of the maximum sentence, which, in Duncan\u2019s case, was a life sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> De Armas recognizes that our holding in <em>Duncan </em>is dis-positive here and suggests that <em>Duncan </em>was wrongly decided. According to our well-established prior-precedent rule, \u201c[o]nly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially override a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005). Thus, pursuant to <em>Duncan, </em>we find no <em>ex post facto </em>or due process violation based on application of the <em>Booker </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">. We have already rejected the government's argument that we do not have jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1319 (11th Cir.2006) (rejecting government's argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742); <em>see also United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050, 1051 (8th Cir.2006) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\">. As for De Armas\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the instant case because the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\u201cMDLEA\u201d) represented an <em>ultra vires </em>exercise of Congressional power under the Piracies and Felonies Clause of the Constitution, we discern no plain error. <em>Cf. United States v. Williams, </em>121 F.3d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1997) (reviewing challenge to constitutionality of statute, based on assertion that Congress exceeded its authority in enacting statute, for plain error). Because there was no precedent on point from the Supreme Court or this Court, any alleged error could not be plain. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that \"an error cannot meet the 'plain' requirement of the plain error rule unless it is \u2018clear under current law.\u2019 ... [Wjhen neither the Supreme Court not this Court has ever resolved the issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to the issue.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Moreno-Morillo, </em>334 F.3d 819, 824 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that Congress acted within constitutionally conferred authority in enacting MDLEA). Moreover, we have noted that \"this circuit and other circuits have not embellished the MDLEA with [the requirement of] a nexus [between a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct and the United States].\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1035, 124 S.Ct. 2110, 158 L.Ed.2d 720 (2004). Simply put, the district court did not commit plain error by failing to hold <em>sua sponte </em>that the MDLEA was unconstitutional because Congress had exceeded its authority under the Piracies and Felonies Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">We also must reject DeArmas's argument that the MDLEA is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). As De Armas recognizes, we expressly addressed and rejected his position in <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088 (11th Cir.2002). Because \u201conly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision,\u201d we must follow <em>Tinoco. See United States </em>v. <em>Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004) (discussing prior-precedent rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-13\">. In support of this claim, De Armas highlights the presence of the following factors as supporting a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range: (1) he has no criminal history; (2) the sentence that he suggested, 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, adequately would have reflected the seriousness of the offense and provided both specific and general deterrence; (3) he played a small role in a large conspiracy; (4) he received a significantly higher sentence than his codefendants based solely on the fact that he was the captain of the vessel; and (5) his base offense level was the same base offense level as that of a \" 'kingpin' of a large-scale organization,\u201d even though he had no equity or ownership interest in the drugs, was not earning a commission off of the sale of the drugs, and did not have a leadership position in the larger drug organization</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">. To the extent De Armas suggests that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based on facts that were not alleged in his indictment or admitted by him, the district court did not err by finding facts supporting extra-verdict enhancements since it sentenced De Armas under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that, under an advisory guidelines scheme, the Sixth Amendment prohibits a sentencing court from finding facts supporting extra-verdict enhancements).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\">. The \"fair warning\u201d factors of <em>Duncan </em>also are present here. When De Armas committed the drug offenses, (1) the maximum term of imprisonment for De Armas' offenses was life imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii); (2) the Guidelines informed De Armas that a judge would engage in fact-finding to determine his sentence and could impose a sentence of up to life imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551, <em>et seq. </em>(providing that the sentencing court could consider specified factors, including the guidelines, in imposing sentence); <em>and </em>(3) the relevant maximum at the time when De Armas committed his offense was the statutory maximum enacted in the United States Code, not the maximum established pursuant to the guidelines. <em>See Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
