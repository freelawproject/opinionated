Appellant contends that no reasonable jury could have found that she knowingly participated in the conspiracy because all that the evidence established was that she was merely present at the scene of a drug sale on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">In resolving this sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue, we determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable jury could have found the essential elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>313 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-23\">To obtain a conviction in this case, the Government had to prove that (1) two or more persons agreed to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; (2) appellant was aware of the agreement; and (3) appellant knowingly and voluntarily joined in the agreement. <em>Charles, </em>313 F.3d at 1284. Where, as here, the Government\u2019s case is based on circumstantial evidence, \u201creasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). A defendant\u2019s mere presence at the scene of the crime, while a probative factor, is insufficient in itself to support a conspiracy conviction, as the Government must also prove that the defendant \u201cknew the essential nature of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-24\">In this case, there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude that appellant knowingly participated in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Unlike the defendant in <em>Charles, </em>who took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>part in a burglary and was not faced with evidence that he knew that the goal of the conspiracy involved narcotics, appellant\u2014 on two separate oceasions-arrived in a parking lot to exchange large amounts of money for small quantities of a white object wrapped in a paper towel. Additionally, when talking to the police, appellant indisputably referred to the June 16 and 18 transactions as a \u201cdeal.\u201d Therefore, it was not unreasonable for the jury to find that appellant was not merely present at the scene of a drug transaction, but knowingly and willingly participated in it. <em>Cf. Charles, </em>313 F.3d at 1286 n. 6 (defendant\u2019s statement that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d that goal of conspiracy involved narcotics was not enough evidence to uphold conviction).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-16\">. Appellant\u2019s citation of <em>United States v. Lopez-Ramirez, </em>68 F.3d 438, 441 (11th Cir. 1995), and related cases, is unpersuasive. Those cases involved third persons who actually delivered or sold the drugs. Here, however, there was no third person delivering drugs, and appellant was indisputably the only person present in the car when she directed Malopolski to exchange the money for the white objects.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
