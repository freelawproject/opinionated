Martinez-Gonzales argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a minimal-role or minor-role reduction and that his sentence is unreasonable. The government responds that the district court did not clearly err in declining to grant Martinez-Gonzales a minimal- or minor-role reduction. The government also argues that we lack jurisdiction over Martinez-Gonzales\u2019s challenge that his sentence is unreasonable because the sentence imposed was within the advisory guideline range and therefore is not appealable within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">According to the presentence investigation report, a United States Coast Guard helicopter spotted a \u201cgo-fast\u201d vessel carrying numerous bales of cocaine. Upon observing the helicopter, the crew members began jettisoning the cocaine. A team from a nearby Coast Guard vessel boarded the \u201cgo-fast\u201d and arrested the eight crew members, including Martinez-Gonzales. Sixteen bales of cocaine, containing a total of 320 kilograms of cocaine, were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">Martinez-Gonzales first argues that the district court erred in declining to grant a minimal- or minor-role adjustment. We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">A defendant who is a minimal participant is one who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. A defendant is a minor participant if he \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s mitigating role in the offense should be informed by two modes of analysis!)]\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. First, the defendant\u2019s role must be measured \u201cagainst the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing[.]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Second, the defendant\u2019s role may be measured against that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Here, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Martinez-Gonzales\u2019s role was not minimal or minor. Applying the first part of the <em>De Varon </em>analysis, Martinez-Gonzales was held accountable for the possession of the 320 kilograms of cocaine that were jettisoned from the boat. Therefore, his actual and relevant conduct were the same. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">With respect to the second part of the <em>De Varon </em>analysis, there is insufficient evidence to show that Martinez-Gonzales was a minor or minimal participant in comparison to others. In determining whether a defendant was less culpable than others, \u201cthe district court should look to other participants only to the extent that they are identifiable or discernible from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Here, the only persons identifiable from the evidence are Martinez-Gonzales and the seven other crew members of the vessel. Martinez-Gonzales argues that there were other individuals involved, but \u201cwhere the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a [mitigating-role] adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Further, Martinez-Gonzales has provided no evidence that he was the among the least culpable of the crew members. He claims only that he was a \u201cdeck hand\u201d whose role was limited to take turns driving the vessel. However, he has not shown that his responsibilities aboard the vessel were less vital to the enterprise than those of any other crew members. Therefore, Martinez-Gonzales has failed to show that he was entitled to a mitigating-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Martinez-Gonzales also argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue because a sentence imposed within the guidelines range is not appealable for reasonableness within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">We review questions of jurisdiction de novo. <em>See Milan Express, Inc. v. Averitt Express, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 975, 978 (11th Cir. 2000). We have previously rejected the government\u2019s position with regard to jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050 (8th Cir.2006) (rejecting the government\u2019s position that appellate courts lack jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness under \u00a7 3742(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Because we have jurisdiction to entertain appellate review, we now turn to the reasonableness of Martinez-Gonzales\u2019s sentence. \u201cWe review [Martinez-Gonzales\u2019s] final sentence, in its entirety, for unreasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>434 F.3d at-; <em>see also United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u2018We do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; rather, we review the final sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). \u201c[O]rdinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable,\u201d although such a sentence is not per se reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Here, the sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment is not unreasonable. This sentence was at the low end of the guidelines range, a range that takes into account Martinez-Gonzales\u2019s offense conduct, his personal characteristics and history, just punishment, and adequate deterrence. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). The record reveals nothing to indicate that such a sentence was unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Therefore, the district court did not err in sentencing Martinez-Gonzales.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating-role reduction or in the sentence imposed. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\">. \"Relevant conduct\u201d is the conduct for which the defendant is held accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
