Cruz-Alvarado argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is in doubt in light of later Supreme Court cases such as <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). We need not decide the applicability of the waiver provision in this case because the issue that Cruz-Alvarado raises is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Cruz-Alvarado\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States. </em>Although Cruz-Alvarado contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cruz-Alvarado properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
