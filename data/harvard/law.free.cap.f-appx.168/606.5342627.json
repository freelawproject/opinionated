In light of the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance, we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-23\">Maredia fails to show that substantial evidence supports that she has an objective fear of being persecuted if she returns to India. She has not shown that she will be singled out for persecution if she returns or that there is a pattern of discrimination against Muslims that she cannot avoid by moving to another part of the country. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306-07 (5th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 203.13(b) (2) (iii); <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 193-94 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-24\">Because Maredia did not make the showing required to establish eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>asylum, she cannot meet the more stringent standard necessary to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir. 2002). Nor does the record compel a finding that Maredia met her burden of showing that more likely than not she would be tortured if she returned to India, such that she is entitled to relief under the CAT. <em>See Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Accordingly, Maredia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
