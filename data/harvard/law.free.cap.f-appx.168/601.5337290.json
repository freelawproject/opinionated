Miranda argues that the district committed reversible error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">There was no <em>\u201cBooker\u201d </em>error or Sixth Amendment violation because the only enhancement to Miranda\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244-45, 267-68, 125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Nevertheless, the district court committed \u201cFanfan\u201d error by sentencing Miranda pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Although Miranda contends that such error is structural, he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent; he raises the issue merely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-26\">As the Government concedes that Miranda preserved his Fanfan claim, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>view Miranda\u2019s argument for harmless error. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Sentencing Guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, we vacate Miranda\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Miranda also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Miranda\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Miranda contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Miranda properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, Miranda\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
