Angel-Leonardo was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 27 months to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">Angel-Leonardo argues that the enhancement provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), which provides for increased sentences based on prior convictions, are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He contends that his conviction should be reduced to the lesser included offense in \u00a7 1326(a)(2) and that his sentence should be reduced to no more than two years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">Angel-Leonardo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Angel-Leonardo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Angel-Leonardo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
