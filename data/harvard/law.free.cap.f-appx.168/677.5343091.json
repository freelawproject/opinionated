California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). De Leon-Garcia was informed of his right to file a response, but he has not done so. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
