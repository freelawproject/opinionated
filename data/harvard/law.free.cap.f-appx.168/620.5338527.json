Fisher also moves for appointment of counsel; his motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Fisher does not contend that the district court erred by dismissing his mandamus petition for lack of jurisdiction. Fisher thus has failed to brief the sole relevant issue for appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, the district court lacks jurisdiction to compel the state court to allow Fisher to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See Moye v. Clerk, DeKalb County Superior Court, </em>474 F.2d 1275, 1275-76 (5th Cir.1973); <em>see also Santee v. Quinlan, </em>115 F.3d 355, 356 (5th Cir.1997). Fisher\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous; neither the district court\u2019s dismissal of the mandamus petition nor our dismissal of Fisher\u2019s appeal counts as a strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED. APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
