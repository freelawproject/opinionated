Medina argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-24\">The erroneous application of the Guidelines as mandatory is technically a \u201cFanfan error.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>see Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. The Government concedes that Medina preserved his Fanfan claim for appeal and that the issue is reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). The Government also concedes that, given the district court\u2019s acknowledgment that Medina raised good points challenging his criminal history computation and the court\u2019s statement that it \u201cgot no satisfaction\u201d in sentencing Medina, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>court\u2019s error in sentencing Medina under mandatory Guidelines was not harmless. Because the Government fails to meet its burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacate the sentence and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Medina also argues 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
