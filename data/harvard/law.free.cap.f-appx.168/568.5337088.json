Mendez argues that the district court improperly enhanced his base offense level because his prior state conviction for possession of marijuana did not constitute an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). This assertion is without merit. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-27\">Mendez also argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats prior felony and aggravated felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>convictions as sentencing factors. Mendez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Mendez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mendez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Mendez also contends that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory guideline regime held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-65, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, and, therefore, the Government has not borne its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">AFFIRMED. Case remanded for the district court to decide whether to resentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
