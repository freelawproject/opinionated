On June 7, 2005, the court, having determined that appellant is a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 151 months. He now appeals his sentences as unreasonable on two grounds. First, the court should not have treated him as a career offender because his previous offenses (on which his career offender status was based) over represented his propensity for recidivism; moreover, appropriate consideration of the sentencing purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) required a lesser sentence. Second, in determining his sentence range under the Guidelines, the court should have reduced his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because he was less culpable than his co-conspirators.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no merit in either ground and therefore affirm appellant\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">In determining whether a sentence is unreasonable, we first determine whether the district court correctly determined the sentence range the Guidelines prescribes. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). Given appellant\u2019s criminal record \u2014 which is extensive \u2014 we could not fault the court for treating appellant as a career offender under U.S.C.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. And, since <em>United States v. Jeter, </em>329 F.3d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.2003), instructs that a career offender may not receive a role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, the court committed no error in refusing to adjust appellant\u2019s offense level downward for his role in the criminal activity. In sum, the court correctly applied the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Once we conclude that the Guidelines were correctly applied, we determine whether the court considered the sentencing purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Appellant says that a proper consideration of those purposes would have yielded lesser sentences than the ones he received. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">When we take into account that included in appellant\u2019s criminal history were convictions for three drug-related offenses \u2014 possession of cocaine, trafficking in phenethylamines, and dealing in MDMA;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that appellant committed the Counts One and Five offenses while serving sentences of probation for the latter two offenses; and that the district court obviously concluded that the sentences it handed down served the specific deterrence purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C) \u2014 especially (C), the need to protect the public from the defendant\u2019s pronounced propensity to commit criminal acts, we must conclude that appellant\u2019s sentences, which are at the bottom of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>prescribed Guidelines sentence range, are not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">. The Government argues that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because appellant's sentences were not below the Guidelines sentence range. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2005) forecloses this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\">.
