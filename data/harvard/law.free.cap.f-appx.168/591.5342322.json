Over Angon\u2019s objection, which was based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court enhanced Angon\u2019s sentence because he had previously been deported following a felony drug trafficking conviction. Ang\u00f3n was sentenced to a 41-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-24\">Ang\u00f3n, relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), argues that the district court committed reversible error by imposing sentence pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government concedes that Angon\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court preserved the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Ang\u00f3n contends that the district court committed \u201cstructural error,\u201d that is not susceptible to harmless error analysis. As Angon concedes, however, this court has rejected the argument that a <em>Booker </em>error or the application of the then-mandatory guidelines is a structural error. <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Ang\u00f3n also contends that the district court\u2019s error was not harmless. It is the Government\u2019s burden to \u201cshow that the sentencing judge would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory sentencing scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005). Our review of the record shows that the Government correctly concedes that the error was not harmless. Accordingly, we will vacate Angon\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Ang\u00f3n challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ang\u00f3n contends that his conviction should be reduced to one under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(2) and the judgment reformed to reflect conviction only under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Angon\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Angon contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ang\u00f3n properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
