We must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-26\">Generally, this court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The denial of appointed counsel does not conclude litigation and is therefore not a final decision. <em>Marler v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Adonis Health Prods., </em>997 F.2d 1141, 1142 (5th Cir.1993). Risby\u2019s case is a civil action against the Government. <em>Pena v. United States, </em>122 F.3d 3, 4 (5th Cir.1997). As such, this court does not have jurisdiction over an interlocutory order denying appointment of counsel. <em>See Marler, </em>997 F.3d at 1143. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Risby\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
