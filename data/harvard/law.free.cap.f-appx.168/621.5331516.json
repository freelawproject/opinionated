Fletcher focuses solely on his indigency. By failing to direct his motion to the district court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision, Fletcher has effectively abandoned the only issue that is properly before this court. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Fletcher\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim each count as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Fletcher is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
