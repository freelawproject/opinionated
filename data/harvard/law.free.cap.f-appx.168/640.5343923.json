Arce argues that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). In <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2005) (No. 04-41152), this court held that a prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a prior conviction for a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because it was equivalent to the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling. Arce asserts that <em>Garciar-Mendez </em>is inapposite to the present case because the issue in that case was reviewed for plain error and because this court did not apply the categorical analysis mandated by <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-21\">Although review of this issue in <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>was for plain error, this court clearly held that a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d at 456-57. Arce\u2019s argument that this court did not properly apply the categorical analysis of <em>Taylor </em>in <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>is tantamount to arguing that <em>Garcia-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Mendez </em>was incorrectly decided, and is unavailing. <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>resolved the issue raised in this case, and one panel of this court may not ignore the precedent set by a prior panel. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Arce\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arce contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arce properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
