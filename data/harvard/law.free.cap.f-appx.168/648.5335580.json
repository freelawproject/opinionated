Alvarez argues that he should be allowed to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate to raise his <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) claim. He argues in the alternative that the district court should have construed his petition as an amendment to his initial \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">A \u00a7 2241 petition must be filed in the district where the prisoner is incarcerated; as the sentencing court, the district court indeed lacked jurisdiction to entertain Alvarez\u2019s pleading as a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999). Alvarez\u2019s pleading challenged his conviction and sentence based on errors that allegedly occurred during the criminal proceedings; these claims should have been brought in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>Davis v. Fechtel, </em>150 F.3d 486, 490 (5th Cir.1998). Alvarez has already unsuccessfully sought \u00a7 2255 relief, and, therefore, the instant pleading, which raised claims that were or could have been raised in a prior motion, was successive. <em>United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 867 (5th Cir.2000). Alvarez had not received prior permission from us to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion; consequently, the district court was without jurisdiction to construe his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Hooker, </em>187 F.3d at 681-82. The dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Finally, Alvarez\u2019s contentions that (1) the district court erred in withdrawing the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b) reference of his case to the magistrate judge; (2) the district court abused its discretion in denying him an evidentiary hearing; (3) his \u00a7 2241 petition was supported by facts which demonstrate his entitlement to relief; and (4) the district court abused its discretion in failing to consider the merits of his claims are inadequately briefed and are therefore waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
