The Honorable Theodore McMillian died on January 18, 2006. This opinion is being filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>by the remaining judges of the panel pursuant to Eighth Circuit Rule 47E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Damarius Asim Simmons (Simmons) pled guilty to conspiring to distribute, \u25a0within 1,000 feet of a protected location, crack cocaine, a mixture containing cocaine, and a mixture containing marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1)\u2014 (b)(1), 846, and 860. Pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines), which were mandatory at the time of sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced Simmons to 860 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the calculated sentencing range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. On appeal, we affirmed Simmons\u2019s convictions and sentence. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 600 (8th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1109, 125 S.Ct. 1018, 160 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2005). Simmons then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which the Court granted on January 24, 2005. The Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1109, 125 S.Ct. 1018, 160 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Because Simmons did not raise any Sixth Amendment issue or object to the application of mandatory Guidelines during sentencing, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 548-49 (8th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 266, 163 L.Ed.2d 239 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">While the district court plainly erred in sentencing Simmons under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, we conclude the error was not prejudicial because the record does not establish a reasonable probability Simmons would have received a more favorable sentence under an advisory Guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 550-53. Although the district court sentenced Simmons at the bottom of the calculated sentencing range, we have repeatedly recognized \u201c[a] sentence at the bottom of the Guideline range \u2018is insufficient, without more, to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence absent the <em>Booker </em>error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Barth, </em>424 F.3d 752, 765 (8th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Pirani, </em>406 F.3d at 553). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Noriega, </em>418 F.3d 809, 814 (8th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the record suggests the district court would not have imposed a lesser sentence. The district court denied a downward departure for overstated criminal history, and noted there was \u201ca very high likelihood of recidivism,\u201d Simmons had \u201cshown violent tendencies in his criminal history,\u201d and other courts\u2019 efforts to show leniency to Simmons had \u201cnot deterred [him] from his criminal conduct.\u201d Because the district court\u2019s statements do not support a finding of prejudice, we conclude Simmons has not demonstrated plain error warranting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">We also find the sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66 (appellate courts now review sentences for unreasonableness; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sets forth factors that guide sentencing and in turn will guide appellate courts in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">Therefore, we reaffirm Simmons\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-17\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
