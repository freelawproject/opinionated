(Quotient), defendant's current employer, by plaintiff Catalina Marketing Corporation, his former employer. After terminating defendant during a \"reduction in force,\" plaintiff filed a verified complaint alleging defendant violated \"post-employment restrictive covenants\" in his separation agreement and the New Jersey Trade Secrets Act, N.J.S.A. 56:15-1 to -9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court entered an order to show cause as to why preliminary restraints should not issue. Prior to the return date, plaintiff issued subpoenas duces tecum and ad testificandum to Quotient, domesticated the New Jersey subpoenas in accordance with New York law, and served them at Quotient's Monsey, New York address. The subpoenas were returnable at counsel's office in Manhattan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant moved to quash the subpoenas, alleging that Quotient was amenable to service in New Jersey because it did\n   business in, and, he resided in, the state, and that attendance at a deposition in New York was unduly burdensome. Defendant also alleged that the subpoenas sought irrelevant information, including, for example, \"the terms and conditions\" of his hiring and employment with Quotient. Finally, defendant alternatively urged the court to enter a protective order under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-3 addressing some of these concerns. Defendant did not request oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff opposed the motion. It certified that Quotient had no New Jersey address or registered agent for service, and New York was the nearest state where the company had a serviceable presence. Although Quotient had been cooperating with plaintiff's counsel, it now refused to comply with the subpoenas until the court decided the motion to quash.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:14-7(c) (\"[I]f the deponent is notified that a motion to quash the subpoena has been filed, the deponent shall not produce or release the subpoenaed evidence until ordered to do so by the court or the release is consented to by all parties to the action.\"). The judge then handling the case agreed to adjourn the return date \"to afford the court and the parties adequate time to address the motion to quash.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the judge retired, a different judge assumed control of the litigation. She entered the February 14, 2019 order now subject to our review. In her written statement of reasons, the judge accepted that defendant's residency in New Jersey did not make Quotient amenable to service because defendant was not \"an officer, registered agent, or any other person authorized to accept service on behalf of Quotient.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:4-4(a)(6) (explaining the requirements of service upon a corporation in New Jersey). She reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:11-5, reflecting New Jersey's adoption of the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (the UIDDA), controlled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The judge dismissed defendant's motion without prejudice, concluding \"th[e] court lack[ed] jurisdiction to rule on defendant's motion to quash an out[-]of[-]state subpoena.\" Instead, both subpoenas were governed by the \"procedures authorized by the foreign state[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:11-5(c), and, pursuant to New York law,\n   challenges to out-of-state subpoenas must be brought \"to the court in the county in which discovery is to be conducted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20CPLR%20%C2%A7%203119\">\n     N.Y.

Defendant filed an emergent application for a stay and permission to file a motion for leave to appeal on an emergent basis. Our colleagues granted defendant's motion for leave to appeal but did not stay further proceedings in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the interim, plaintiff issued two similar New Jersey subpoenas, properly domesticated them in California, and served them on Quotient in California. Defendant again moved to quash with the same result. The judge dismissed the motion without prejudice, noting that California, like New York and New Jersey, adopted the UIDDA. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    California Civil Procedure Code\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2029.600(a), \"any request for a protective order or to enforce, quash, or modify a subpoena, or for other relief may be filed in the superior court in the county in which discovery is to be conducted and, if so filed, shall comply with the applicable rules or statutes of this state.\" Defendant again sought emergent relief from this March 15, 2019 order, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between entries of our two orders, the judge filed a written amplification of reasons.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:5-6(c). She explained, \"[t]o clarify, the court did not mean it lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits of the motions to quash, but instead lacked jurisdiction over out-of-state non-party witnesses to compel their appearance at out[-]of[-]state locations.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   4:11-4, 4:11-5 and 4:14-7, the judge reasoned that New Jersey, like New York and California, \"require[s] motions related to enforcement, modification, or quashing of a foreign subpoena be submitted to a court in the discovery state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant argues that New Jersey has never adopted the UIDDA and the judge has jurisdiction to consider his arguments\n   about the scope of discovery sought from Quotient,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2, and whether to issue a protective order.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:10-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff\n   reiterates that under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:11-5(c), New Jersey lacks jurisdiction to quash the subpoenas and further advised us at oral argument that Quotient has presently refused to comply with the subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We reject defendant's assertion that New Jersey has not adopted, at least in part, the UIDDA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pressler &amp; Verniero,\n   <em>\n    Current N.J.

Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act \u00a7 6 (Nat'l Conference of Comm'rs on Unif. State Laws 2007).

Although plaintiff advised us at argument that Quotient refuses to comply with the subpoenas, nothing in the record confirms that assertion. Plaintiff is free to litigate the issue of Quotient's refusal to comply with the subpoenas, and Quotient has the ability to move to quash the subpoenas, in both New York and California, in accordance with the respective procedures and laws of those states.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Quinn v.

We agree she can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although the UIDDA provides a party with the ability to enforce subpoenas in a foreign jurisdiction, and a non-party witness the ability to modify or quash a subpoena in the foreign jurisdiction, it was never intended to divest a New Jersey court of jurisdiction to resolve discovery disputes between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Nothing in [the UIDDA] limits any party from applying for appropriate relief in the trial state. Applications to the court that affect only the parties to the action can be made in the trial state. For example, any party can apply for an order in the trial state to bar the deposition of the out-of-state deponent on grounds of relevance, and that motion would be made and ruled on before the deposition subpoena is ever presented to the clerk of [the] court in the discovery state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [UIDDA, cmt. on \u00a7 6.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We conclude, as apparently did the judge, that a New Jersey court has jurisdiction to consider whether the discovery sought \"is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party ... [or] if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence ....\"\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(a).

As Judge Pressler and Justice Verniero have consistently noted, \"[b]ecause of the protective order practice of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-3, the\n   notice technique\n   ... provides an opportunity for a pre-deposition judicial determination of terms and conditions for the taking of the deposition.\" Pressler &amp; Verniero, cmt. 1.1 on\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:11-5 (2014-19).
