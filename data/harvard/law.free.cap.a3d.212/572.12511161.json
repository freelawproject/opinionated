Cox, Jr. (Cox) appeals from the Cambria County Common Pleas Court's (trial court) August 8, 2018 order affirming the Johnstown Housing Authority's (Authority) decision terminating his housing assistance and dismissing his appeal. Essentially, the issue for this Court's review is whether substantial record evidence supported the trial court's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2013, Cox applied to participate in the federally funded, tenant-based\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Housing Choice Voucher Program pursuant to Section 8 of the United States (U.S.) Housing Act of 1937,\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (Housing Act) (Section 8 Program),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program the Authority operates in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (HUD Regulations).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Cox is a veteran, he applied for the Section 8 Program through the Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC), and the Veteran's Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) Program screened and approved him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Original Record (O.R.), Notes of Testimony, July 20, 2018 (N.T.)

On October 1, 2013, Cox entered into a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contract (HAP Contract) with a private landlord to lease 200 Southmont Boulevard, Apartment 4, Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T.

While speaking with Cox, Johnstown Police Officers determined that Cox was intoxicated; he became disorderly with the officers, swore in front of children and resisted arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T.

Item 1, Ex.

Cox admitted that he had alcohol in his system at the time of the September 2, 2017 CamTran Station incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T. at 13, 15, 23-24. Cox disputed that his conduct on September 2, 2017 violated his Section 8 Program obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court admitted into evidence the Google maps page reflecting that the CamTran Station is located 1.9 miles from Cox's residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T. at 23, 26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.T. Cox Ex. 1. The trial court also admitted into evidence Cox's Cambria County Court Summary that reflected Cox's June 1994 guilty pleas to charges of theft by unlawful taking and receiving stolen property, a March 1995 guilty plea for terroristic threats, a September 1997 guilty plea for receiving stolen property, and a November 2012 no contest plea for defiant trespass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T.

The trial court made the following findings of fact (FOF):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1. [The Authority] presented credible evidence that Cox's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   2. [The Authority] exercised its discretion to permissibly terminate Cox's benefits pursuant to its [Administrative Plan] mandated by [HUD]. [N.T.

The issue of whether the incident at the [CamTran Station] was in the immediate vicinity of Cox's residence is not relevant to whether [the Authority] produced evidence of abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by Cox that may threaten the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Trial Ct. Op. at 2. The trial court concluded that \"[the Authority] had the authority and discretion to terminate benefits in this case and the [trial c]ourt will not substitute its discretion [for] that of [the Authority].\" Trial Ct. Op. at 3. On September 7, 2018, Cox appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Cox argues that the trial court erred and misapplied the law in affirming the Authority's decision to terminate his Section 8 Program assistance. He specifically contends that substantial evidence did not support the trial court's conclusion that Cox's behavior on September 2, 2017 at the CamTran Station violated his HAP Contract, and the trial court's conclusion was overbroad since the incident did not occur at or near his leased premises, it did not impact other residents' health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and he was properly vetted before receiving his Voucher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Authority rejoins that \"[t]he only requirement for termination of benefits is that the pattern of alcohol abuse threatens the health, safety and right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents[,]\" Authority Br. at 10, and that \"HUD [R]egulations also allow [the Authority] to terminate Section 8 [Program] assistance if a family member has engaged in criminal activity, 24 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 982.553(c) [,]\" which the Authority proved. Authority Br. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court has recognized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The relevant provisions of the Housing Act and its associated regulations, which apply throughout the country, provide particularized standards and criteria that all public housing authorities must consider and follow when reviewing an application for public housing. These criteria assure that housing authorities will use only those factors deemed permissible for consideration by the Housing Act and its associated regulations when reviewing applications for public housing and limit the discretion that a public housing authority may exercise in deciding whether to deny applications for public housing. Because a public housing authority's decision to grant or deny applications\n   must be in accordance with the statutory and regulatory criteria, the public housing authority's discretion is certainly not 'unfettered' and, therefore, should not be 'unassailable.'\n   <em>\n    Caba\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Based thereon, the trial court found that the Authority properly exercised its discretion to terminate Cox's assistance since Cox's purported \"abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of other residents,\" and that the vicinity of the CamTran Station incident was not relevant.

Accordingly, Cox participated in criminal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, based upon all of the language in Section 8 of the Housing Act, HUD Regulations, the HAP Contract, the Tenancy Addendum, the Voucher and the Administrative Plan, it is clear that\n   <strong>\n    criminal activity and/or alcohol abuse alone is not a sufficient basis upon which to terminate Section 8 Program benefits\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Congress did not state in Section 8 of the Housing Act that\n   <em>\n    any and all\n   </em>\n   criminal activity, wherever it occurs, is grounds to terminate Section 8 Program benefits. Neither did the HUD Regulations, the HAP Contract nor the documents that Cox signed place him on notice that\n   <em>\n    any and all\n   </em>\n   criminal activity and/or alcohol abuse no matter where it takes place constitute grounds upon which the Authority could end his benefits. Rather, based upon Section 8(d)(1)(B)(iii) of the Housing Act and applicable HUD Regulations, the Authority must prove, and the court must find that the tenant: (1) engaged in criminal activity (and/or alcohol abuse); and (2) such activity threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of residents and/or persons in the immediate vicinity thereof.
