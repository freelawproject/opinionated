On remand, the second habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the amended petition, concluding that the petitioner failed to establish that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Central to its conclusion was the court's determination that\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   did not apply because the applicable statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 54-193a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had\n   been tolled by General Statutes \u00a7 54-193 (c), now \u00a7 54-193 (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a result of the petitioner's relocation outside\n   Connecticut. In a subsequent articulation, the second habeas court found that the petitioner was elusive, unavailable, and unapproachable when he left Connecticut and that he had failed to present evidence that the state could not demonstrate that the delay in executing the warrant was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this certified appeal, the petitioner claims that the second habeas court improperly (1) determined that \u00a7 54-193 (d) tolled the statute of limitations in analyzing whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise a statute of limitations affirmative defense, (2) concluded that the petitioner was elusive, and unavailable to and unapproachable by the police, (3) concluded that he failed to demonstrate that the state would have been unable to show that the police had acted reasonably in executing the warrant, and (4) rejected his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the petitioner's first two claims but reject the latter two. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the second habeas court albeit on different grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On direct appeal from the petitioner's underlying criminal conviction, our Supreme Court concluded that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts on the basis of the evidence presented.

The pertinent statute of limitations was ... \u00a7 54-193a, which permitted prosecution for such crimes within a period of five years from the time when the victims notified law enforcement officials of the ... assaults.

Even though we conclude that both courts incorrectly analyzed the statute of limitations affirmative defense pursuant to \u00a7 54-193 (d), their analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   performance prong was reasonable and proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The first habeas court found that Cosgrove \"did not consider challenging the warrant delays in executing or serving the warrant because he did not believe that there was a basis for doing so.

Cosgrove opined that, without proof of actual prejudice to the petitioner caused by the delay, no viable statute of limitations affirmative defense existed.... Cosgrove explained his legal opinion to the petitioner, and he declined to present such a defense at trial.\" The second habeas court found that Cosgrove represented the petitioner within the bounds of effective assistance by deciding not to raise a statute of limitations defense. The court's finding was predicated in part on its conclusion that \"Cosgrove's assessment of the law regarding execution of a stale warrant was correct, that is, the running of the allotted time for service of the arrest warrant was tolled by virtue of ... \u00a7 54-193 (d), in light of the petitioner's location outside Connecticut. The result was that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the issuance and the service of the arrest warrant occurred within the five-year period as expanded by the petitioner's absence from Connecticut.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The findings of both the first and second habeas courts reveal that Cosgrove was aware of a possible statute of limitations affirmative defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court found that Cosgrove reviewed the applicable statute of limitations, \"did the math,\" and determined that the warrant had been executed within the statute of limitations.

The second habeas court also found that on the basis\n   of Cosgrove's knowledge of the underlying facts, his knowledge of the law, research, and consultation with other lawyers, Cosgrove made the correct strategic decision not to file a motion to dismiss or to assert a statute of limitations affirmative defense because service of the warrant was timely under a proper reading of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner has not shown that Cosgrove's decision was objectively unreasonable in that it fell below the standard of reasonableness as measured by prevailing professional practice.

Indeed, it appears to have been entirely reasonable. The record does not reveal that at the habeas trial or on remand the petitioner presented expert testimony to contradict the opinions of Cosgrove and the appellate lawyers with whom he consulted. Moreover, two judges of the Superior Court agreed that Cosgrove's decision to forgo a statute of limitations affirmative defense was legally sound. In view of those facts, we conclude that the second habeas court properly found that Cosgrove's representation of the petitioner did not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness. Although we disagree with the statutory routes by which the habeas courts reached their ultimate conclusions that Cosgrove did not render deficient performance, the underlying procedural history does not support a conclusion that Cosgrove's performance was deficient. The petitioner, therefore, cannot prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , as his claim fails to satisfy the performance prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Moreover, the petitioner has not carried his burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was prejudiced by Cosgrove's representation. The habeas court noted that in his criminal appeal, the petitioner\n   claimed that the delay by the police in applying for the arrest warrant violated his constitutional right to due process pursuant to the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roger B.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088263\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/607/#p609\">\n    297 Conn. at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20752\">\n    999 A.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the present case, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the state would not have been able to prove that the delay in the execution of the warrant was reasonable.
