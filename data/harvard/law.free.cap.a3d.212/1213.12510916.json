In this appeal, we are asked to recognize a common-law private right of action for damages resulting from the unjustified disclosure to a third party of information obtained by medical personnel during treatment. Plaintiff alleges in her lawsuit that she incurred damages as the result of an emergency room nurse informing\n   a police officer that she was intoxicated, had driven to the hospital, and was intending to drive home. The trial court granted defendant Central Vermont Medical Center (CVMC) summary judgment based on its determination that nothing in the record supported an inference that the nurse's disclosure of the information was for any reason other than her good-faith concern for plaintiff's and the public's safety. In this opinion, we recognize a common-law private right of action for damages based on a medical provider's unjustified disclosure to third persons of information obtained during treatment. Like the trial court, however, we conclude that CVMC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because, viewing the material facts most favorably to plaintiff and applying the relevant law we adopt today, we conclude that no reasonable factfinder could determine that the disclosure was for any purpose other than to mitigate the threat of imminent and serious harm to plaintiff and the public. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. The following facts are taken from the parties' statements of undisputed material facts, viewing them most favorably to plaintiff, the nonmoving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the early morning hours of May 10, 2014, plaintiff drove herself to CVMC after lacerating her arm. She arrived at the emergency room at 2:12 a.m. The charge nurse (Clinical Nurse Coordinator) detected a heavy odor of alcohol on plaintiff's breath, and it became apparent to the nurse that plaintiff had been drinking. Members of the treatment team administered an alco-sensor test to assess plaintiff's level of intoxication. The test revealed a breath-alcohol concentration of .215, over two and one-half times the legal limit, at 2:40 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Based on information provided by plaintiff, the charge nurse understood that plaintiff did not have a ride home. After her laceration was treated, plaintiff did not meet the criteria for admission to the hospital and was cleared for discharge. She was discharged at 3:05 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. A police officer was on duty in the emergency room pursuant to a contract between CVMC and the Berlin Police Department. Shortly before plaintiff was discharged, the charge nurse approached the officer and informed him that plaintiff was blatantly intoxicated,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that she had driven herself to the hospital, and that she was about to drive herself home. After receiving this information from the charge nurse and communicating with plaintiff, the officer arrested her on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. The resulting criminal charge was later dismissed by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In July 2016, plaintiff filed a complaint against the charge nurse and CVMC, alleging that she incurred damages as the result of (1) the nurse's negligent disclosure of information obtained during plaintiff's medical treatment, in violation of the standard of care applicable to medical providers; and (2) CVMC's inadequate training and failure to develop policies\n   regarding the disclosure of information obtained during medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In December 2017, following discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment. Regarding plaintiff's negligence claim against the charge nurse, defendants argued that this Court has never recognized a duty enforceable in a tort action not to disclose information obtained during medical treatment and that, even if such a duty existed, the nurse's disclosure of information in this case fully complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6 (concerning wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information), because it was done to avert an imminent threat to plaintiff's and the public's safety. Defendants further argued that plaintiff could not prevail on her claim against CVMC because that claim was dependent upon the underlying claim against the charge nurse. In opposing summary judgment, plaintiff noted that the vast majority of jurisdictions have recognized a private right of action for damages resulting from the disclosure of information obtained during medical treatment. She argued that there were disputed material facts concerning whether the disclosure of the information in this case was necessary to protect plaintiff or the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. In May 2018, the trial court granted summary judgment to CVMC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After noting that the patient's privilege set forth in 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 1612 is an evidentiary privilege applicable only in judicial proceedings, see\n   <em>\n    Kuligoski v. Brattleboro Retreat\n   </em>\n   , 2016 VT 54A, \u00b6 60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454561\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/203/328/\">\n    203 Vt. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489323\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/436/\">\n    156 A.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that plaintiff had failed to identify any Vermont authority in support of a greater rule of confidentiality than that set forth in HIPAA, the court ruled that the disclosure at issue here did not violate HIPAA. In so ruling, the court relied on a HIPAA regulation permitting the disclosure of information based on the presumed good-faith belief that the disclosure was necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public. In the court's view, there was no record basis for any reasonable inference that plaintiff's disclosure to an onsite police officer was for law enforcement purposes or any reason other than a good-faith concern for plaintiff's and the public's safety. Having found no negligence, the court granted CVMC summary judgment on both counts set forth in plaintiff's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. The Claims of Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. On appeal, plaintiff argues that: (1) the trial court erred in holding that there is no common-law remedy for a health care provider's breach of a duty of confidentiality; and (2) assuming there is such a remedy, the court erred in granting CVMC summary judgment insofar as there are material facts in dispute as to whether the nurse breached the duty of confidentiality regarding information obtained during the course of medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Private Right of Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. Plaintiff first argues that this Court should recognize a common-law private remedy for breach of a medical provider's duty of confidentiality concerning the disclosure of information obtained during medical treatment. Plaintiff seeks a common-law remedy because neither Vermont law nor HIPAA provides a private right of action to obtain damages incurred as the result of a medical provider's disclosure of information obtained during treatment.

By requiring disclosure under certain circumstances and in some cases providing immunity for the disclosure, statutes such as these implicitly acknowledge that medical providers have a general duty of confidentiality and that a violation of that duty may subject them to liability.\n   <em>\n    McCormick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511439\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/328/627/\">\n    494 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   439 ;\n   <em>\n    Brandt v.

Also, the Legislature abrogated this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kuligoski\n   </em>\n   , which had expanded mental health providers' duty to warn of a patient's dangerous propensities, and instead \"limit[ed] mental health professionals duty to that as established in common law by\n   <em>\n    Peck v.

Given the Legislature's reliance on HIPAA, and medical care providers' familiarity with the law, we conclude that the federal statute and its implementing regulations should inform the standard of care and establish the framework for exceptions to medical care providers' duty of confidentiality.\n   <em>\n    Byrne I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20A.3d%2032\">\n    102 A.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that because health care providers are familiar with HIPAA procedures in rendering care to patients, HIPAA and its implementing regulations may be used to inform standard of care applicable to tort claims arising from allegations of negligent disclosure of patients' medical records).

CVMC does not contest that it is a covered entity and that the information provided to the onsite police officer was protected health information. Nor does plaintiff contest that, assuming there was a threat justifying disclosure of the information, the police officer was a person reasonably able to prevent the threat. The point of contention is whether the record demonstrates, as a matter of law, that the nurse had a good-faith belief that all the information provided to the officer was necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of plaintiff or the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 26. In answering this question, we first reexamine what the nurse told the officer. As stated above, the nurse indicated that plaintiff was blatantly intoxicated, that she had driven herself to the hospital,\n   and that she was about to drive herself home. Given the record before us, if the nurse had told the officer only that plaintiff was blatantly intoxicated and was about to drive herself home, CVMC would surely be entitled to summary judgment. But we must also consider that the nurse also told the officer that the blatantly intoxicated plaintiff had driven herself to the hospital, thereby suggesting that plaintiff had committed a crime. In considering this particular statement, we recognize that the disclosure exception in \u00a7 164.512(j)(1)(i) is directed at preventing future conduct, in the sense that it allows disclosures based on a good-faith belief that doing so is necessary to prevent the threat of imminent and serious harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27. The critical question, then, is whether, as a matter of law, and based on the evidence viewed most favorably to plaintiff, the nurse had a good-faith belief that telling the officer the intoxicated plaintiff had driven herself to the hospital was necessary to prevent the imminent and serious threat of her driving in an intoxicated state away from the hospital. In answering this question, we consider the meaning of the term \"good faith\" in this context, as well as the record evidence in light of that meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28. \"Good faith\" is undefined in the HIPPA regulations that we rely on in establishing the scope of, and exceptions to, the duty we are recognizing today. Although the term \"good faith\" is ubiquitous in the law, \"its meaning varies somewhat with the context.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 205 cmt. a (1979); see\n   <em>\n    Good Faith\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (quoting description of good faith in R.

In connection with the qualified immunity defense, Vermont has adopted the federal objective \"good faith\" test whereby we evaluate the objective reasonableness of the official's conduct in relation to settled, clearly established law. See\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

Notably, numerous courts have applied a subjective good-faith standard with respect to statutes providing immunity from civil or criminal liability for persons disclosing medical information in good faith while reporting or aiding in the investigation of child abuse.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

Because we have adopted the standards in HIPAA as framing the contours and limits of a cause of action for breach of the duty not to disclose protected health information, to answer the pivotal question in this case we must determine how \"good faith\" is defined for purposes of \u00a7 164.512(j)(1), (4) -and, in particular, whether to apply a subjective or objective test. For the following reasons, we conclude that the applicable test in this case is a subjective one. That is, whether the nurse's motivation for disclosing the protected health care information was based solely on her belief that the disclosure was necessary to protect or lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety, or whether the nurse sought to satisfy some other purpose, even a well-intentioned one, apart from this narrow legal exception to her general duty of nondisclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 33. First, the HIPAA regulation that frames our analysis specifically hinges on the actor's good faith in connection with the actor's actual beliefs, rather than on whether the actor acted in a manner that is objectively in good faith. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.512\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(1) (\"A covered entity may, consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduct, use or disclose protected health information, if the covered entity, in good faith, believes the use or disclosure ... [i]s necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the\n   public ....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This wording suggests a subjective understanding of \"good faith\" focused on the actor's intentions and beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 34. Second, the regulation's basis for a presumption of good faith supports the view that the standard of good faith in this circumstance is subjective. In particular, \u00a7 164.512(j)(4) provides that \"[a] covered entity that uses or discloses protected health information pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of this section is presumed to have acted in good faith with regard to a belief described in paragraph (j)(1) ... if the belief is based up on the covered entity's actual knowledge or in reliance on a credible representation by a person with apparent knowledge or authority.\" The focus of this presumption is on the subjective knowledge underlying the belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 35. Finally, by its terms, this exception will normally apply in emergency situations involving serious safety concerns when medical providers must make quick decisions about what information is necessary to prevent the imminent risk of harm. As noted above, we are reluctant to impose the specter of liability for misjudgment on a health care provider weighing whether to make a discretionary disclosure to prevent imminent and serious harm to public health and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 36. Applying the subjective standard, we conclude that plaintiff has not met her burden of production to rebut the applicable presumption of good faith. Through case law and Vermont Rule of Evidence 301, we have adopted a bursting-bubble theory of presumptions in civil cases, unless otherwise provided by law.\n   <em>\n    Chittenden v.

Thus, CVMC bears the ultimate burden of persuasion as to the applicability of the good-faith exception to the general rule prohibiting health care providers from disclosing protected health information. But the presumption of good faith in HIPAA, \u00a7 164.512(j)(4), which we adopt for purposes of analyzing the common-law tort we recognize in this decision, shifts the burden to plaintiff to make some showing that the nurse's disclosure that plaintiff had driven to the hospital and was blatantly intoxicated was not made in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 38. Although the burden of production is not a heavy one, plaintiff did not meet hers in this case. Nothing in the record suggests that the nurse supplied the information to the officer for any reason other than her good-faith belief that the information was necessary to prevent plaintiff from driving drunk from the hospital and endangering herself and the public. Plaintiff made no proffer suggesting that the nurse hoped inclusion of the arguably superfluous information about how plaintiff got to the hospital would lead to plaintiff's censure, arrest, or prosecution or that she had any ulterior motive beyond the permitted one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did she challenge defendants' statement of undisputed fact, the\n   nurse's affidavit, or the nurse's deposition testimony indicating that the nurse provided the information to the officer solely in the hope that he would give plaintiff a ride home. Thus, the record unequivocally shows that defendant's intent in disclosing all of the information provided to the officer was consistent with the exception set forth in \u00a7 164.512(j)(1)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 39. In light of the presumption of good faith, which was bolstered by the record, plaintiff had the burden of proffering some facts or information indicating that the nurse had other motives. She did not do so. Accordingly, CVMC was entitled to summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Zullo v.

The court surmised that the parties may have intended to preserve the claim as against CVMC on a respondeat superior theory; however, the court determined that it did not need to clarify the matter any further because the nurse's breach of a duty is a necessary predicate to the negligent supervision claim against CVMC. When asked at oral argument on appeal about a respondeat superior theory, CVMC's attorney acknowledged that the parties' attorneys had agreed in an unrecorded conversation during the trial court proceedings that if the nurse were dismissed from the case, CVMC would not take the position that respondeat superior was inapplicable here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The court also noted, with respect to plaintiff's second count, that plaintiff had not provided an expert opinion regarding what policies or training CVMC should have had in place and that such matters require expert support because they are not within the ordinary knowledge of laypersons.

Under \u00a7 874A, when a statute protects a class of persons by prohibiting certain conduct but does not explicitly provide a civil remedy, a court may afford a remedy to a person protected by the statute-either under an existing tort or by recognizing a new cause of action-as long as the remedy furthers the purpose of the statute and is needed to assure the effectiveness of the statute. See Restatement (Second) of Torts 874A cmt. i (1979) (stating that plaintiff must be member of protected group and must show that \"the interest invaded, the harm resulting to that interest and the hazard producing the harm were all within the purview of the legislative provision\"). The Restatement identifies the following six factors for consideration, with the primary test being whether a private tort remedy would be consistent with and promote the effectiveness of the policy underlying the statute: the specificity of the statute, the adequacy of existing remedies, the extent to which a tort action would supplement or interfere with other existing remedies, the significance of the legislative purpose, the extent of the change in tort law, the burden that the new tort would create on the judicial system, and whether plaintiffs would be able to show that they are in a protected class.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12509488\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/208/609/\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12509488\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/208/609/\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    \u00a7 874A cmt. h. Although we reiterate that 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 1881 is not directly applicable in this case, we see nothing in these tests or factors that would caution us against recognizing a common-law private right of action for breach of the duty of patient confidentiality, given the absence of an express remedy in \u00a7 1881. Indeed, the common-law private remedy we recognize today furthers the purposes of \u00a7 1881 and is also consistent with and complimentary to HIPAA, upon which \u00a7 1881 relies.
