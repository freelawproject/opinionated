(temporarily assigned).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Elmer Branch and the putative class of similarly situated truck drivers appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Cream-O-Land Dairy (\"COL\") and dismissal of their class-action complaint alleging a failure to pay overtime wages in violation of the New Jersey Wage and Hour Law (\"WHL\"), N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a to -56a38. The trial court determined that defendant was entitled to the WHL's good-faith defense, N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2, based on its reliance on three determinations made by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (\"DOL\") officials in response to complaints brought by individual employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having reviewed the contentions advanced on appeal in light of the applicable legal principles, we hold that such discrete determinations by DOL officials, which are subject to further administrative appeal, do not constitute an \"administrative practice or enforcement policy\" and are insufficient to invoke the good-faith defense. N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 29, 2016, plaintiff filed a putative class action complaint in the Law Division against COL. The class is defined to include: \"All individuals that performed truck driving functions in the State of New Jersey for [d]efendant[ ] from 2014 to present.\" Plaintiff alleged that the class members worked approximately\n   sixty to eighty hours per week without being paid one-and-one-half times their hourly rates for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week in violation of the WHL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a4(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant answered the complaint, denying the allegations and asserting, among other defenses, the statutory good-faith defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2. After the parties exchanged some written discovery, on August 4, 2017, defendant moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it was immunized from liability under the good-faith defense. At the time of the motion, the discovery end date was scheduled to elapse on November 16, 2017, and the discovery end date had not been previously extended. In support of its entitlement to the good-faith defense, defendant cited to three determinations made by DOL officials in response to employee complaints involving COL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, John Callahan, a hearing and review officer in the DOL's Division of Wage and Hour Compliance, issued a handwritten investigation report dated July 27, 2007. The report stemmed from a complaint by a truck driver employed by COL alleging a failure to pay appropriate overtime wages. After \"a full field investigation and internal review,\" the DOL initially assessed a penalty of $40,000 for failure to pay overtime wages. Following an administrative appeal by COL, however, Callahan conducted an informal settlement conference with COL. As a result of the conference, Callahan issued his report and overturned the penalty. The report determined that COL was considered a \"trucking industry employer\" and was required only to pay its drivers one-and-one-half times the state minimum wage for overtime hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a4(f). The report concluded that COL was meeting this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, in June 2014, counsel for COL emailed Santiago Zayas, then a senior investigator for the DOL, asking if any follow-up was needed from COL regarding\n   an investigation of an employee's overtime complaint. Zayas replied via email, stating in full: \"It's been determined that [COL] falls under the Federal Trucking guidelines of overtime exemption. The claimant was briefed of our\n   finding, and referred to the [United States Department of Labor] for questions and concerns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, in April 2017, COL's counsel emailed David Schraeger, then section chief of the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance, inquiring about the status of a truck driver's overtime complaint. Schraeger replied via email, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The inspection report indicated that [COL] is considered a transportation company rather than a dairy. Since the complainant consistently made above 1 1/2 times minimum wage - currently $8.44 - which equals $12.66 - per hour, we did not find the company to be in violation of [the] law at this time. We have sent the complainant a letter advising him of his right to pursue his claim at a formal [w]age [c]ollection proceeding, but he has not replied. The complaint has to be a moving party in order for a [w]age [c]ollection proceeding to go forward. Failing to hear from him, we shall take no further action on this matter at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant also provided two certifications in support of its motion for summary judgment. Scott Stoner, the vice president of operations for COL, certified that COL has a fleet of over 200 trucks that \"warehouse[ ] and convey[ ] ... refrigerated and non-refrigerated products (including but not limited to milk, dairy, juice, and non-dairy products, mechanical plastic, and baked products) from one place to another by highway[.]\" Stoner emphasized: \"The company does not manufacture or produce any products. It owns no dairy farms, and does not produce any of the products in delivers.\" Stoner noted that there are products affixed with the COL label, but \"that is done for branding/logistical purposes, and/or at customer request.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Michael P. McCarthy, an employee of the DOL for thirty-seven years and the former Director of the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance, certified as to the qualifications of the individuals involved in the DOL's three previous investigations of COL. He certified that \"COL has justifiably and in good faith, relied upon the results of these three (3) investigations as contemplated by N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff opposed the motion for summary judgment, primarily contending that the three informal determinations relied on by COL were insufficient to entitle it to the good-faith defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff also argued that defendant's motion was premature because discovery was outstanding and requested the opportunity to depose Stoner and McCarthy regarding the veracity of their certifications. On September 7, 2017, following oral argument, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of COL and dismissed the complaint with prejudice based on the good-faith defense. The trial court reasoned that the three investigations and determinations by the DOL were adequate to establish an \"enforcement policy\" with respect to COL's industry, thereby entitling COL to the good-faith defense. The trial court did \"not make any substantive determinations regarding defendant's status as a trucking industry employer ... [because] it need not for purposes of determining that the good-faith defense applies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff moved for reconsideration, asserting that the class members were entitled to \"trucking industry overtime\" at the rate of one-and-one-half times the minimum wage even if the good-faith defense barred the claim for regular overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a4(f). On October 27, 2017, following oral argument, the trial\n   court denied reconsideration. It reasoned that the class members were entitled to one-and-one-half times the minimum wage for each hour worked and that COL met this requirement by compensating plaintiff with a flat rate of $180 per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff appealed from the trial court's orders granting summary judgment and denying reconsideration. On March 11, 2019, we held oral argument in this appeal. Following oral argument, defendant filed a motion to supplement the record with a June 19, 2006 opinion letter from McCarthy, who at that time was the Director of the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance. Plaintiff opposed the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The 2006 opinion letter was sent by McCarthy to an attorney in response to a \"fax inquiry on the acceptable method of computation for 'day rate employees' in the trucking industry.\" The letter does not reference any employer, nor does defendant certify that\n   the letter was provided in response to an inquiry by COL. The letter generally sets forth the formulas used by the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance to determine compliance with the WHL for non-exempt employees and trucking industry employees. The letter also provides a brief history of the trucking industry employer overtime requirements in New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 26, 2019, we granted defendant's motion to supplement the record and indicated that \"[t]he supplemental materials will be considered by the court to the extent it may find them relevant.\" We also invited the Attorney General to participate as amicus curiae with respect to the State's interpretation of the good-faith defense. The Attorney General accepted the invitation and filed a letter brief on April 26, 2019. The parties each responded to the Attorney General's brief on May 6, 2019. On May 13, 2019, we again held oral argument with the Attorney General appearing as amicus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff raises the following points for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT DEFENDANT COL COULD AVAIL ITSELF OF THE [WHL]'S \"GOOD FAITH\" DEFENSE IN THIS ACTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. The [WHL] Is a Remedial and Humanitarian Legislation That Must Be Construed Liberally to Effectuate Its Purpose of Prohibiting Employers From Evading Their Obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   B. Defendant COL's Purported \"Proofs\" Do Not Establish Applicability of the [WHL]'s \"Good Faith\" Defense As a Matter of Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   C. The Trial Court Erred In Relying Upon\n   <em>\n    State v. Frech\n   </em>\n   Rather than\n   <em>\n    Keely v. Loomis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   D. Guidance From the Federal Courts Construing the [Fair Labor Standards Act]'s \"Good Faith\" Defense Supports Plaintiff's Position That Defendant COL Should Not Be Able to Avail Itself of the [WHL]'s \"Good Faith\" Defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    POINT II\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED PLAINTIFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEPOSE MESSRS. STONER AND McCARTHY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   PRIOR TO ENTERING SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSING PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    POINT III\n   </em>\n   : EVEN IF THE [WHL]'S \"GOOD FAITH\" DEFENSE APPLIES, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT IN TOTO BECAUSE PLAINTIFF WOULD STILL HAVE A VIABLE CLAIM FOR UNPAID \"TRUCKING INDUSTRY OVERTIME.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition, plaintiff argues that defendant is not entitled to the good-faith defense based on the 2006 opinion letter because: (1) the letter was not part of the summary judgment record; (2) there is no evidence in the record supporting that COL actually relied on the letter; and (3) the trial court's ruling on the good-faith defense did not involve a determination of the actual compensation paid by COL to plaintiff and the putative class of truck drivers during the relevant time period. For these reasons, plaintiff maintains that the 2006 opinion letter is irrelevant to the issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant contends that the three previous DOL determinations constitute an enforcement policy upon which it reasonably relied and are sufficient to invoke the good-faith defense. Defendant similarly argues that the 2006 opinion letter represents the DOL's enforcement policy. Defendant also argues that federal case law interpreting the good-faith defense under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   supports its entitlement to the good-faith defense. Finally, defendant maintains: (1) no additional discovery would affect its entitlement to the good-faith defense; and (2) the good-faith defense is absolute, obviating the need to address whether COL met the definition of a trucking industry employer and paid its truck drivers one-and-one-half times the minimum wage for hours worked over forty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Attorney General argues that the three initial determinations relied on by COL do not meet the requirements for establishing the good-faith defense. The Attorney General notes that the three initial determinations arose from the early stages of the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance's investigations into discrete matters and were subject to further administrative appeal or\n   the employee brining a wage collection proceeding. As such, the Attorney General contends, the three initial determinations \"are not high-level final determinations that carry the imprimatur of the agency head, as is required to establish the good-faith defense.\" The Attorney General maintains that in terms of the DOL's enforcement investigations, only the Commissioner's final decisions rendered after an OAL hearing are sufficient to invoke the good-faith defense. The Attorney General argues that even taken together, the three initial determinations do not constitute an \"administrative practice or enforcement policy ... with respect to the class of employers which he belonged[,]\" N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2, because the determinations clearly were not intended to \"apply uniformly or automatically to a particular industry; they were discrete communications by subordinate members of the department regarding investigations based on information received from the employer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the other hand, the Attorney General argues that the 2006 opinion letter would be sufficient to invoke the good-faith defense because it \"broadly discussed the Division's policy and interpretation of the law as a whole ... and described the means by which the [DOL] determined compliance with the WHL.\" The Attorney General contends that \"[o]n its face, the letter reflects an interpretation of the law that applies to an entire class of employers\n   or employees.\" Although the Attorney General notes that the 2006 opinion letter offers the DOL's interpretation of the WHL at the time it was issued, the Attorney General declines to take a position on whether the 2006 opinion letter reflects the DOL's current interpretations and policies. The Attorney General also declines \"to take a position on whether defendant[ ] can demonstrate that [it is] a 'trucking industry employer' or [is] currently in compliance with the WHL with respect to the plaintiffs or any other employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

When considered in the context of WHL's enforcement structure, we agree with the Attorney General that in terms of the DOL's enforcement investigations, only either the Commissioner's final agency decision rendered after an OAL hearing or a Wage Collection Referee's final decision qualifies as a \"written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation by the Commissioner of the [Department of Labor and Workforce Development] or the Director of the Wage and Hour Bureau[.]\" N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2. This interpretation is consistent with both the plain language of N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2 and the enforcement structure of the WHL.

We read this statutory language sensibly alongside the first portion of N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.2 and the WHL's enforcement provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiProspero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186159\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/183/477/#p492\">\n    183 N.J. at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186155,1186159\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/1039/\">\n    874 A.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
