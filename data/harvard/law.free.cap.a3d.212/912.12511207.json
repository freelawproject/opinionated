At sentencing, the circuit court enhanced Mr. Bailey's sentence as a subsequent offender of \u00a7 21-902(b)(1) of the Transportation Article (hereinafter\n   \"TR\") of the Maryland Code. Prior to trial, the State served Mr. Bailey with a notice of his subsequent offender status as required by Maryland Rule 4-245. However, this notice was sent ten days prior to trial in the circuit court which was five days less than required by Maryland Rule 4-245. At no point did Mr. Bailey object to the punishment enhancement. Now, we consider whether this belated notice resulted in an illegal sentence requiring correction, or instead, whether the late notice was a procedural deficiency subject to harmless error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts underlying Mr. Bailey's conviction are not essential to review in order for us to consider the merits of Mr. Bailey's appeal. However, in order to provide context, we note the following as to the underlying offense. Mr. Bailey was driving on the Capital Beltway, Maryland Interstate 495, in Prince George's County, when his vehicle crashed into the rear of another vehicle on March 4, 2017. A police officer was nearby and heard the crash. As the police officer was investigating the crash, he noticed Mr. Bailey showed signs of intoxication. Mr. Bailey performed field sobriety tests but refused to consent to a breathalyzer or a blood test. Mr. Bailey was arrested and charged with various traffic offenses, including driving while impaired by alcohol in violation of TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Bailey prayed a jury trial in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Prince George's County on June 16, 2017. Thus, his jury trial prayer transferred jurisdiction to the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. The trial was scheduled on the circuit court docket for October 16, 2017. Subsequently, Mr. Bailey filed a consent motion with the State to continue the trial date. The trial was reset for December 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State served its notice of increased penalty as a subsequent offender to Mr. Bailey on December 1, 2017. However, the notice was sent five days later than required by\n   Maryland Rule 4-245. The enhanced penalty was available under the subsequent offender statute because Mr. Bailey had a prior conviction for driving under the influence on January 24, 2017, in the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A two-day jury trial in the circuit court commenced on December 11, 2017. The jury found Mr. Bailey guilty of driving while impaired and other related offenses. Mr. Bailey was sentenced in February 2018 to one year of incarceration with all but eight weekends suspended plus two\n   years of probation. As a subsequent offender, Mr. Bailey's potential exposure to incarceration increased by ten months. During the trial and sentencing hearing, Mr. Bailey did not object to the imposition of the subsequent offender enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Then, Mr. Bailey timely appealed his sentence to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the court split by a 2-1 vote to affirm the sentence of the circuit court. The majority opinion concluded that even though the \"failure to give any notice before trial is substantive and gives rise to an illegal sentence,\" in this case the \"failure to give\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   notice is a procedural error ... subject to harmless error analysis\" and, in fact, did \"not give rise to an illegal sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12507912,12507913\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/463/144/\">\n    463 Md. 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12507912,12507913,12507910,12507911\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/204/188/\">\n    204 A.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). Mr. Bailey presented two questions for this Court to consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the trial court did not illegally impose an enhanced sentence after the State failed to serve timely notice under Maryland Rule 4-245(b) ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) If Mr. Bailey's sentence was not illegal, did the Court of Special Appeals misapply the test for determining whether Mr. Bailey received ineffective assistance of counsel?\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With regard to the first question, we hold that the State's belated notice did not result in the trial court imposing an illegally enhanced sentence. Instead, the State's belated notice to Mr. Bailey was a procedural deficiency subject to preservation requirements and not an illegal sentence that may be challenged pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a). As a result, we review for harmless error Mr. Bailey's claim and hold\n   that Mr. Bailey was not prejudiced by the belated notice. As for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we decline to review that issue on direct appeal. Instead, Mr. Bailey's ineffective\n   assistance of counsel claim should be considered within a post-conviction proceeding. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sentence enhancement pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-245(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The primary question in this case is whether enhancement of a subsequent offender's sentence is legal when the State files a belated notice of the enhancement that did not comply with Maryland Rule 4-245(b). Mr. Bailey was convicted of driving while impaired by alcohol in violation of TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(1). As a first-time offender, Mr. Bailey would have been subjected to \"imprisonment not exceeding 2 months or a fine not exceeding $500 or both.\" TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(1)(ii)(1). However, as a subsequent offender, Mr. Bailey's potential exposure under the enhanced sentence increased to \"imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or a fine not exceeding $500 or both.\" TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(1)(ii)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-245 articulates procedures the State is required to follow in order to potentially subject a defendant to an enhanced penalty as a subsequent offender. In relevant part, this rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Definition.\n   </strong>\n   A subsequent offender is a defendant who, because of a prior conviction, is subject to additional or mandatory statutory punishment for the offense charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Required Notice of Additional Penalties.\n   </strong>\n   When the law permits but does not mandate additional penalties because of a specified previous conviction, the court shall not sentence the defendant as a subsequent offender unless the State's Attorney serves notice of the alleged prior conviction on the defendant or counsel before the acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or at least 15 days before trial in circuit court or five days before trial in the District Court, whichever is earlier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Required Notice of Mandatory Penalties.\n   </strong>\n   When the law prescribes a mandatory sentence because of a specified\n   previous conviction, the State's Attorney shall serve a notice of the alleged prior conviction on the defendant or counsel at least 15 days before sentencing in the circuit court or five days before sentencing in the District Court. If the State's Attorney fails to give timely notice, the court shall postpone sentencing at least 15 days unless the defendant waives the notice requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Determination.\n   </strong>\n   Before sentencing and after giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard, the court shall determine whether the defendant is a subsequent offender as specified in the notice of the State's Attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Bailey acknowledges that he would qualify as a subsequent offender under the statute. As TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(1)(i) did not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the court to impose an enhanced sentence-i.e., the enhancement was not mandatory, the State was required to send notice to Mr. Bailey pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-245(b). However, the State's notice was five days late. In this appeal, the State concedes that the notice was not timely pursuant to the Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Bailey contends before this Court that under Maryland Rule 4-245(b), the sentencing judge had no discretion to enhance Mr. Bailey's sentence as a subsequent offender because of the State's failure to serve timely notice of the enhanced penalty. Further, under\n   Maryland Rule 4-345(a), if a trial court has no discretion to impose the sentence, then the imposed sentence is illegal. Therefore, Mr. Bailey asserts that his sentence was illegal because the trial court did not have discretion to impose the enhanced penalty and thus must be vacated under Maryland Rule 4-345(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals correctly concluded that Mr. Bailey's enhanced sentence for driving while impaired was not an illegal sentence for purposes of Maryland Rule 4-345(a). The State posits that non-compliance with the notice requirement was a procedural error that was subject to preservation and waiver. Moreover, Mr. Bailey did not adequately preserve his objection and this\n   matter is subject to harmless error review. The State argues the belated notice amounted to harmless error because Mr. Bailey has not alleged any prejudice from the belated notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    i. Review of Mr. Bailey's sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a threshold question, we must determine whether the circuit court's application of the enhancement after the State's belated notice was an imposition of an \"illegal\" sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(a). Pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a), \"[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\" If the sentence is illegal, it is not subject to preservation requirements and may be corrected even if: \"(1) no objection was made when the sentence was imposed, (2) the defendant purported to consent to it, or (3) the sentence was not challenged in a timely-filed direct appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney v.

In this case, Mr. Bailey never objected to the imposition of the enhancement in the circuit court. Therefore, in order for Mr. Bailey to secure review of his unpreserved objection, this Court must determine the sentence was illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The legality of a sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(a) is a question of law reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The failure to provide notice impacts substantive rights and undermines completely the purpose of the notice requirement. However, when there is a procedural defect with the notice, such as untimely notice or other defects, the enhancement is subject to harmless error analysis.

State\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \"harmless\" and a reversal is mandated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1881315\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/276/638/#p659\">\n    276 Md. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=350%20A.2d%20665\">\n    350 A.2d 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). Despite the fact that in cases such as this one, the error does not influence the jury's verdict, we have previously stated that the harmless error analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   applies to proceedings involving sentences after convictions as well.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n    300 Md. at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n    477 A.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reviewing for harmless error in this instance, we are examining whether the State's belated notice in any way influenced Mr. Bailey's pre-trial decisions. Here, Mr. Bailey had actual notice and he has not argued that he sustained prejudice as a result of the late notice. Although ten days was not fifteen days, Mr. Bailey was still afforded adequate time to determine how he wished to proceed in this matter. Had Mr. Bailey received the notice five days earlier, it is highly unlikely he would have proceeded any differently in this case. Therefore, the error in this matter was harmless and we affirm the Court of Special Appeals as to this first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals' assertion that Mr. Bailey's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is moot.

Under prevailing professional norms, Mr. Bailey's attorney should have been aware of applicable sentencing\n   laws and rules. Therefore, Mr. Bailey contends that if counsel was aware of the notice requirement, there was no conceivable tactical reason not to object during the sentencing, as a successful objection would have limited Mr. Bailey's exposure under TR \u00a7 21-902(b)(1)(ii) to a\n   maximum of two months' incarceration instead of one year of incarceration.

However, I believe that the notice provision in Rule 4-245(b) serves as a condition precedent to the trial court's sentencing authority. In acting contrary to the parameters of its authority, the trial court imposed an \"inherently illegal\" sentence that can only be remedied by vacating Petitioner's sentence.

In the instant case, the State sought to sentence Petitioner as a subsequent offender, relying on an earlier January 24, 2017 conviction for driving under the influence. The State was obligated to serve notice \"at least 15 days before trial in circuit court[,]\" but provided notice only ten days before Petitioner's trial. Given the express language of Rule 4-245(b), which operates as a condition precedent to the trial court's imposition of an enhanced sentence, the trial court lacked the requisite authority to impose Petitioner's sentence. No doubt, Rule 4-245(b) creates a procedural notice requirement.

When this Court heard\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , the precursor rule to 4-245(b), Rule 734 b, was substantively similar but had an additional provision. Rule 734 b read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [N]o defendant shall be sentenced as a subsequent offender unless prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or [\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   ] or at least 15 days prior to trial, whichever is earlier, the State's Attorney serves a notice on the defendant or his counsel that the State will seek increased punishment as authorized by law.\n   <strong>\n    The notice shall set forth each prior conviction to be relied upon.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n    at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n    477 A.2d at 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The State served King with timely notice of its intent to seek enhanced penalties, but the notice was substantively defective because it did not contain King's prior conviction. The\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   Court observed that, though the notice was defective, \"[t]he record establishes that the State served notice of its intent to seek the maximum ten year sentence for second offenders\n   <strong>\n    at least fifteen days before trial\n   </strong>\n   , as required by Rule 734 b.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n    300 Md. at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979987\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/218/\">\n    477 A.2d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   Court premised its holding on the\n   <strong>\n    sufficiency\n   </strong>\n   of notice, not the timeliness of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Furthermore, the construction of Rule 734 b is telling: the first sentence of the rule provided that if the State failed to abide by the notice period, then a defendant \"shall [not] be sentenced as a subsequent offender[.]\" However, the second sentence of the rule, providing that \"notice shall set forth each prior conviction[,]\" did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   provide any express consequences for the State's failure to abide by the provision. Therefore, the holding in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   relied upon the second sentence, which was silent on the consequence of the State's failure to provide prior conviction information. In contrast, the instant case relies upon the express provision in the first sentence-the trial court has no authority to impose an enhanced sentence if the State fails to abide by the explicit notice periods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   does not govern the instant case.
