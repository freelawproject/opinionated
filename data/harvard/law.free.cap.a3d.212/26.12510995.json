Navarro. In November 2013, as a result of appellee's alterations to a prescription for Percocet tablets, he pleaded guilty to two counts of forgery graded as first-degree misdemeanors and the court sentenced him to twenty-four months' probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometime thereafter, appellee learned PSP had recovered his stolen firearm and he submitted an application for its return pursuant to Pennsylvania's Uniform Firearms Act (\"UFA\"), 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6101 - 6128.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.1(b)(4) (\"The Pennsylvania State Police and any local law enforcement agency shall make all reasonable efforts to determine the lawful owner of any firearm confiscated or recovered ... and return said firearm to its lawful owner if the owner is not otherwise prohibited from possessing the firearm.\"). Although the UFA expressly precludes persons who are convicted of certain enumerated crimes from possessing firearms, forgery is not an enumerated crime under the UFA and no other precluding classifications exist under Pennsylvania law to bar appellee from firearm possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6105(b), (c) (enumerating specific prohibiting offenses and persons). However, PSP denied the application because a Pennsylvania Instant Check System (\"PICS\") report indicated appellee had disqualifying convictions under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellee challenged the denial, and by letter dated December 23, 2016, PSP confirmed\n   denial was based on federal law. Specifically, PSP relied on Section 922(g) of the Federal Gun Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 931 (\"GCA\"), which makes it unlawful for any person \"who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). PSP further explained appellee's 2013 forgery convictions - punishable by up to five years' imprisonment - were \"prohibiting\" under Section 922(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellee timely appealed the PSP determination to the Office of the Attorney General (\"OAG\"), and at a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), the Commonwealth presented evidence that appellee's guilty pleas to two counts of forgery were confirmed by the PICS report. Additionally, a PICS supervisor testified the denial of appellee's request for return of the firearm was upheld on the basis of \"the federal law, 18 U.S.C., Subsection 922(g) for his conviction of forgery.\" N.T. 7/7/17, at 13. Notwithstanding the ALJ's failure to make any findings regarding whether the firearm had \"been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce,\" the ALJ affirmed the PSP's decision to deny return of appellee's firearm based on Section 922(g) of the GCA. Findings And Reasons For Denial of Request for Relief, 8/21/17 at 2 (unpaginated original). Appellee then filed a timely appeal to the Commonwealth Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commonwealth Court vacated and remanded for further factual findings.\n   <em>\n    Navarro v. Pa.

Cmwlth. filed May 17, 2018). The panel first acknowledged that, before returning a firearm to its owner pursuant to UFA procedures, PSP has a duty under Section 6111.1 to review the criminal history of \"potential transferees\" and determine whether such person is prohibited from receipt or possession of a firearm under federal or state law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.1 (PSP shall review criminal history and fingerprint records to determine if potential purchaser or transferee is prohibited from receipt or possession of a firearm under Federal or State law). The panel next recognized PSP's denial in this case was based on federal law, and explained Section 922(g) of the federal GCA requires \"proof of two things: (1) a disqualifying conviction, and (2) that the firearm in question was involved in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The panel then determined, \"per the language of the [federal] statute, without proof that the firearm sought to be purchased, possessed, or received moved in interstate commerce, GCA Section 922(g) would not apply regardless of whether or not the individual in question had a[n otherwise] disqualifying criminal offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The panel noted that although proof of an interstate or foreign commerce connection need not be extensive, it must nonetheless be present in some form to trigger application of Section 922(g) and prohibit return of appellee's firearm. Accordingly, because the ALJ made no findings with regard to the interstate or foreign commerce status of the firearm appellee requested be returned to him, the panel vacated the decision of the ALJ and remanded for further findings in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We granted discretionary review based on PSP's petition for allowance of\n   appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSP claims \"the decision of the Commonwealth Court is both legally and practically untenable and must be reversed.\" Appellant's Brief at 15. Specifically, PSP challenges the panel's conclusion appellee could be denied return of his firearm only if PSP established the firearm \"moved in interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2. PSP insists no such proof is required and the only issue to be determined by the ALJ pursuant to Section 6111.1(e) of the UFA was \"whether the record PSP relied upon is accurate.\" Appellant's Brief at 10-11. PSP relies on the language in Section 6111.1(e)(1) that any person denied the right to receive or possess a firearm as a result of \" 'the procedures established by this section may challenge the\n   <strong>\n    accuracy\n   </strong>\n   of that person's criminal history,' \" and maintains the duty of the PSP under the statute is simply to \" 'conduct a review of the\n   <strong>\n    accuracy\n   </strong>\n   of the information forming the basis for the denial[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.1(e)(1), (2) (emphasis added). PSP insists \"[t]he statutory language in \u00a7 6111.1(e)(1) is unambiguous and its plain language controls[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (\"[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit\");\n   <em>\n    Shafer Elec. &amp; Constr. v.

Thus, PSP argues it was only required to produce evidence at the hearing before the ALJ that the PICS record upon which it relied was accurate. PSP suggests, because the PICS report accurately indicated appellee had two forgery convictions, each punishable by up to five years in prison, PSP met its burden under Section 6111.1 that transfer to appellee was prohibited under Section 922(g)(1) of the federal GCA and was \"not required to prove anything further.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moreover, PSP argues if the \"Legislature had intended for PSP to prove, in some or all cases under [ Section] 6111.1(e), whether a firearm moved in interstate or foreign commerce, it would have provided a mechanism for PSP to receive this information each time a background check is processed for the sale or transfer of a firearm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PSP asserts, \"nowhere in the UFA itself\" are firearms dealers or law enforcement officers \"required to report to PSP the make and model of a firearm for which a background check is being requested, at the time the check occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thus, PSP argues, reading the sections of the UFA \"\n   <em>\n    in para materia\n   </em>\n   ... compels the conclusion that PSP is not required by the UFA to prove a firearm moved in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PSP insists \"the decision of the Commonwealth Court in this case effectively imposes that requirement upon the PSP (at least when federal law is at issue).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. In sum, PSP asserts \"[t]he Commonwealth Court's decision effectively amends the statute by adding a new requirement not provided for by the plain language of the statute and places an additional evidentiary burden on the PSP, in contravention of the rules of statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to practical considerations, PSP maintains the panel's decision \"is problematic due its potential impact on the PSP in their operation of PICS[,]\" because \"PSP processes hundreds of thousands of checks through PICS each year[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. PSP argues, without elaboration or explanation, if it is required to \"gather more information, such as the make and model of a firearm ... (so that PSP can check if the firearm moved in interstate or foreign commerce),\" the additional strain \"on to an already strained system ... could lead to more approvals made in error,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , more prohibited people gaining access to firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief to this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   appellee argues if Section 6111.1 does not require the PSP \"to conduct the commerce history of the firearm in question[,]\" the background check and verification procedures codified in the UFA violate principles of Due Process because the federal firearm prohibition requires proof of interstate or foreign commerce in order to be enforced. Appellee's Brief at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties agree the issue presented is a pure question of law.

Here, in the face of a challenge, PSP communicated to appellee the decision to deny him a return of his firearm was upheld on the basis of the \"federal law,\" citing section 922(g) of the GCA. The communication explained appellee's forgery convictions were \"prohibiting\" under that law. Accepting the plain and unambiguous meaning of these provisions, we must now decide whether PSP sufficiently established it complied with its statutory obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our research has revealed no binding case with similar facts that addresses the issue raised here. However, the panel below and the parties cite to an unpublished decision of the Commonwealth Court,\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Pa. State Police\n   </em>\n   , No. 390 C.D. 2010, unpublished memorandum,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2010843320\">\n    2011 WL 10843320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. filed Feb. 18, 2011). In that case, Taylor attempted to purchase a firearm and submitted an application on the PICS system. His application was held as \"undetermined\" and he was advised he had 30 days to provide additional information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Taylor responded; his application was subsequently denied and he received a letter from PSP stating his prior conviction for Firearms Carried Without a License was prohibiting under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Taylor appealed to the OAG and a hearing was conducted before an ALJ. At the hearing, the PSP's representative testified Taylor's conviction was for a first-degree misdemeanor under state law carrying a potential maximum sentence of up to five years' imprisonment. Taylor was not charged with a federal crime and the PSP did not establish whether Taylor was involved in interstate commerce. Taylor's attorney argued the federal prohibition codified at Section 922(g) did not apply, in part, because Taylor was not engaged in interstate commerce. The ALJ nevertheless affirmed the PSP's decision to deny the firearm purchase, specifically determining the firearm had been manufactured in Florida. Taylor appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed. Judge Patricia A. McCullough authored a Concurring Opinion addressing, in part, Taylor's argument he was not personally involved in interstate commerce, and the Section 922(g) prohibition should therefore not apply to him. She noted \"the requirement of interstate or foreign commerce was clearly satisfied by the ALJ's determination that the firearm was, as the Majority noted, manufactured in Florida.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at *6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (McCullough, J., concurring).

PSP clearly presented \"accurate\" record information to the extent it included a conviction for a crime punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. However, the information was incomplete to the extent it failed to show the firearm in question moved in interstate or foreign commerce, a required element of the prohibition under federal law on which PSP relied. As the Commonwealth Court here properly found, the federal prohibition of Section 922(g) simply cannot apply absent some proof the firearm at issue moved in interstate or foreign commerce. We agree with the panel's conclusion the evidence relating to such commerce need not be extensive and may be satisfied by showing the gun was manufactured outside Pennsylvania (or that the gun otherwise crossed state lines).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Shambry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Order affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Chief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer, Todd, Donohue, Wecht and Mundy join the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Forgery, graded as a first-degree misdemeanor, is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1104, 4101(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    PSP sought a determination of whether the Commonwealth Court erred \"when it reversed a decision of the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General upholding a decision of the Pennsylvania State Police to deny a firearms background check, based on a failure of the ALJ to determine if a firearm had moved in interstate commerce, when the statute, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.1(e), does not require such a finding[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Navarro v.
