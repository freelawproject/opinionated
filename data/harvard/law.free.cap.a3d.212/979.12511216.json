When their business relationship deteriorated amidst dueling accusations\n   of misconduct, they engaged in extensive litigation in Florida and New Jersey related to winding down their companies, Direct Wholesale, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Unlimited Pins, LLC\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the companies).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 2, 2013, they entered into a global settlement agreement (May 2013 agreement) that settled the pending lawsuits and established a mediation/arbitration mechanism to resolve any disputes encountered during the parties' wind-down\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   efforts. Under the mediation/arbitration mechanism, disputes would first be submitted for informal mediation to Michael Marotte, Esq., who had served as the companies' corporate counsel for about ten years. If Marotte was unable to resolve the dispute, then the dispute would be submitted for\n   binding arbitration to a panel of three arbitrators (the three-person panel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The three-person panel consisted of one arbitrator chosen by each party and Marotte, who served as the neutral arbitrator. In this role, Marotte could withdraw at any time and was subject to dismissal by either party in the party's sole discretion. In that event, a replacement neutral third arbitrator would be selected by the two remaining arbitrators. The parties executed an arbitration agreement on August 8, 2013, and a superseding agreement on March 16, 2015 (collectively, arbitration agreement), to ratify and effectuate the May 2013 agreement. The arbitration agreement, among other things, specified that the arbitration procedure was governed by the New Jersey Uniform Arbitration Act (the Act), N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-1 to -32. The arbitration agreement also waived\n   the provision of the Act prohibiting an individual with a \"known, existing, and substantial relationship with a party\" from serving as a neutral arbitrator, N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-11(b), and permitted each arbitrator to bill for services at an hourly rate of $ 600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over time, the mediation/arbitration mechanism proved expensive and posed numerous scheduling difficulties for the three-person panel. As a result, on May 28, 2015, the parties entered into another settlement agreement (May 2015 agreement), naming Marotte as the sole decision maker responsible for resolving disputes between the parties related to the collection of outstanding debts owed to the companies. Thereafter, on July 23, 2017, plaintiff dismissed Marotte as the neutral arbitrator on the three-person panel as permitted under the May 2013 agreement. The following month, Marotte's partner informed the parties that Marotte could no longer serve as the decision maker under the May 2015 agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the parties were unable to agree on a replacement for Marotte, in September 2017, plaintiff filed an order to show cause and verified complaint against defendant, seeking to compel the appointment of a replacement for Marotte to adjudicate the collection disputes pursuant to the May 2015 agreement. Defendant filed a contesting answer and asserted various affirmative defenses, including invoking \"the doctrines of frustration of purpose and impossibility\" in order to void the May 2015 agreement. Defendant's pleading also included a counterclaim for declaratory judgment, requiring the two remaining arbitrators on the three-person panel to select a replacement for Marotte in accordance with the May 2013 agreement, or, in the alternative, requiring the court to select a replacement to resolve the remaining wind-down disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After granting plaintiff's motion to proceed as a summary proceeding pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-7 and\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:67-1(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial judge conducted a plenary hearing \"on the sole issue of the parties' state of mind and intention when they entered into the\n   May 2015 [a]greement and selected ... Marotte to resolve the outstanding collection disputes[.]\" During the hearing, the judge heard testimony from the parties, but refused to hear testimony from Marotte. On December 8, 2017, the judge entered an order, declaring the May 2015 agreement \"null and void[,]\" relegating the parties to the arbitration agreement to resolve the remaining disputes, and dismissing the complaint and counterclaim without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff now appeals from the December 8, 2017 order, raising the following points for our consideration:\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n   - THE TRIAL [JUDGE] ERRED IN PREVENTING MICHAEL MAROTTE, ESQ.

CAUSED MULTIPLE DELAYS IN WINDING DOWN THE CORPORATIONS AND IS THUS GUILTY OF COMING TO THE COURT WITH UNCLEAN HANDS[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    POINT V\n   </em>\n   - THE TRIAL [JUDGE] SHOULD HAVE DENIED [DEFENDANT'S] REQUESTED RELIEF AS THERE WAS NO CONTROVERSY YET BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS TO THE MAY [ ] 2013 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Having considered the arguments and applicable law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The focus of the plenary hearing was the May 2015 agreement, which was entitled \"settlement agreement\" and established a mechanism by which the parties would select a \"dispute,\" defined as \"the net total of all debts and obligations collectively owed by a single debtor\" to the companies, for which plaintiff or defendant \"[would] be primarily responsible as the 'Responsible Collector.' \" The \" 'Responsible Collector' ... [would] devote all reasonably\n   necessary time and efforts towards collection of the amounts owed for the matters for which he [was] responsible.\" Under the May 2015 agreement, \"[a]ll offers of settlement of any such dispute for less than immediate payment of the full amount owed\" had to be approved by both parties. If the parties could not agree, \"then the dispute [would] be submitted to [Marotte] for final binding decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Further, pursuant to the May 2015 agreement, for debts exceeding $ 5000, \"the Responsible Collector ... [would] receive as a commission ... 15% of the net amount received,\" less fees, costs, and offsetting payments, and Marotte would decide \"through a final binding decision\" any commission-related disputes. Debts less than $ 5000 would \"be submitted to a collection agency for collection.\" However, if the parties were unable to agree on a collection agency, \"then [Marotte] shall make a final binding decision.\" If either party \"believe[d] the other [was] not providing a proper level of supervision or assistance to counsel and/or a collection agency retained in a collection effort for which the other [was] responsible and eligible for a commission,\" was \"spending more in legal fees and costs than [was] warranted by the amount at issue,\" or \"[was] otherwise not performing his collection responsibilities with respect to a collection effort,\" then the dispute could be submitted to Marotte who would \"make a final binding determination[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The May 2015 agreement also specified that if Marotte determined there was a failure to \"cooperate in good faith\" by \"either action or inaction,\" then Marotte would \"provide the non-cooperating [party]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   with time \"to take whatever corrective action(s)\" Marotte deemed necessary.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [A]fter the end of the cure period[,] [Marotte would] make a binding final determination as to whether the non-cooperating [party] took all of those corrective actions to [Marotte's] satisfaction .... If [Marotte] determine[d] that [the party] failed to timely take all of those corrective actions to [Marotte's] satisfaction ... [,] then the non-cooperating [party would] forfeit[ ] his right under the [May 2015] [a]greement to any equal distribution of funds collected as part of the subject collection[s] \"dispute\", and all of those collected funds from that dispute shall instead be paid directly to the other [party] in addition to any commission that\n   other [party] may have earned under the [May 2015] [a]greement with respect to that collection effort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, the May 2015 agreement imposed strict time limitations to complete the actions delineated therein and provided that \"[w]ith respect to each time limitation in the [a]greement, time [was] of the essence.\" The agreement also provided that its interpretation and enforcement was \"governed under the substantive and procedural laws of the State of New Jersey.\" Further, \"[a]ny disputes concerning th[e] [a]greement, the subject matter of th[e] [a]greement[,] or the interpretation of th[e] [a]greement shall be submitted to [Marotte] for a final and binding decision.\" Finally, each party acknowledged executing the May 2015 agreement \"of his own free will and accord,\" \"after receiving full advice from counsel of [his] own selection,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"understand[ing] the terms and conditions of th[e] agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the hearing, plaintiff testified about the circumstances under which the May 2015 agreement was entered, explaining that the parties had appeared on May 28, 2015, for a scheduled arbitration hearing before the three-person panel as prescribed in the May 2013 agreement. According to plaintiff, one of the issues he intended to present for arbitration was the need to \"start collecting money owed to [the companies,]\" amounting to \"several million dollars.\" Although the three-person panel had addressed collection issues in the past, instead of proceeding with the scheduled arbitration hearing, the parties spent \"the entire day\" negotiating and drafting the May 2015 agreement to specifically address the collection disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to plaintiff, the only reason they entered into the May 2015 agreement was \"[t]o find a less expensive way to handle all the collection issue[s] and to do it in an easier or faster fashion than going through the three-[person] arbitration panel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   responding to specific questions regarding whether the May 2015 agreement was a settlement agreement or an arbitration agreement, plaintiff was vague and equivocal. Although plaintiff acknowledged that there were three prior drafts before the parties agreed on the final version, he had no recollection of the word \"arbitrator\" appearing in the prior drafts, and was \"not sure\" whether the final version of the six-page agreement they ultimately agreed upon identified Marotte as an \"arbitrator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff testified Marotte was selected as the decision maker in the May 2015\n   agreement because he was \"the neutral arbitrator\" on the three-person panel, and he had been \"the corporate counsel for the compan[ies] for about ten years[.]\" Plaintiff acknowledged that, unlike the arbitration agreement, a mechanism to replace Marotte if he was unable or unwilling to serve under the May 2015 agreement \"was never discussed.\" Likewise, \"[t]here was no discussion\" that \"[Marotte] was the only person who was capable of deciding a dispute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff denied that the entire May 2015 agreement was based on the fact that Marotte would act as the decision maker, and stated he would not have signed the May 2015 agreement if he believed that it could be voided if Marotte was unable to serve. Plaintiff did not believe that Marotte had any \"[u]nique knowledge\" of the companies' collection matters that would prevent any other individual from serving as his replacement. In fact, according to plaintiff, Marotte only \"knew ... a very small percentage\" of \"[t]he companies['] ... hundreds of clients[,]\" and there were other attorneys with whom plaintiff had a similar long-standing relationship. Plaintiff's understanding was that any attorney or retired judge could serve as the decision maker \"[i]f something happened to ... Marotte[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff explained his intention in entering into the agreement, stating that \"[they] had already been trying for over two years, in\n   some instances, four or five years[,] to collect money from debtors,\" but defendant had \"obstruct[ed]\" the process. According to plaintiff, the \"new agreement on how to handle the process of collecting money\" allowed them to move forward in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. Although plaintiff acknowledged terminating Marotte from the three-person panel, he denied knowing why Marotte resigned as the decision maker under the May 2015 agreement, and claimed that Marotte's resignation had nothing to do with the termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In contrast, defendant believed the May 2015 agreement was a settlement agreement, not an arbitration agreement. Initially, defendant was not agreeable to all the terms in the final version of the May 2015 agreement. However, he relented because Marotte was going to be the decision maker and that \"was the most significant issue\" to him. He wanted Marotte to be the sole decision maker because \"[Marotte] had been general [c]ounsel for [their] companies for a number of years.\" Additionally, Marotte \"had assisted [them] in numerous activities[,]\" and \"had been on many, many, many phone calls involving both [parties] ... individually.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on that relationship, defendant believed Marotte had specialized knowledge about the parties and the companies that no other attorney possessed. Because defendant \"felt that it would be beneficial both to [him] and to the compan[ies] if [Marotte] was the decision maker,\" he \"was willing to give up on some of the other items for [Marotte] specifically to be there and to stay on board.\" Unlike plaintiff, defendant testified that \"[he] would not have entered into th[e] agreement[ ] if ... Marotte was not the decision maker.\" He believed that if Marotte was unable to serve as decision maker, the agreement \"would be voided\" and they would revert back to the May 2013 agreement, which encompassed \"any wind[-]down disputes\" between the parties. According to defendant, he signed the May 2015 agreement because it specifically named Marotte as the decision maker, and, unlike the May 2013 agreement, did not provide for any replacements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant acknowledged that since the May 2015 agreement was executed, he had not collected any monies as the Responsible\n   Collector while plaintiff had. Defendant also acknowledged that to date, plaintiff had not received any commissions for those matters. Further, defendant admitted that if the May 2015 agreement was voided and the parties relied on the May 2013 agreement to resolve their disputes, the Responsible Collector would not be entitled to a commission because the May 2013 agreement made no such provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Following the hearing, the judge issued an oral decision, declaring the May 2015 agreement null and void. As a result, plaintiff's request to appoint a replacement for Marotte as the decision maker under the May 2015 agreement was denied. In his decision, the judge found the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties here entered into two separate and distinct agreements. The first agreement, identified on its face as a settlement agreement term sheet, was entered into on May 2[ ], 2013. This agreement specifically called for binding arbitration and set forth procedures for the selection of arbitrators and provided for the procedure to replace the neutral arbitrator who, ... in this case was Michael Marotte.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   This term sheet was formalized on March 16[ ], 2015[,] in a document entitled arbitration agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This agreement, drafted on ... Marotte's firm's letterhead spelled out in detail the procedures to follow in arbitrating the seemingly intractable disputes between ... plaintiff and ... defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ... [T]he arbitration law was specifically mentioned and made part of this agreement. [Seventy-three] days later on May 28[ ], 2015[,] a second agreement was entered into between the parties. This agreement was also drafted on Marotte's firm's letterhead and was entitled settlement agreement. The apparent objective of this agreement was to carve out from the March[ ] 2015 arbitration agreement certain issues and to have Marotte be the sole and ultimate decider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Conspicuously, nowhere in the [May 2015] agreement is the word arbitration mentioned ... nor is there any specific agreement for arbitration. This agreement was to handle specifically collection matters that existed and were the source of conflict between the two principals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [I]n August[ ] 2017[,] ... plaintiff terminated Marotte as the neutral arbitrator under the [arbitration] agreement. Marotte thereafter withdrew from ... the\n   May[ ] 2015 agreement[, which] .... was silent on the procedure for replacing Marotte ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The judge posited that \"[t]he issue before the [c]ourt [was] whether it should rework the [May 2015] agreement and provide ... a substitute for Marotte or declare the agreement void under the legal principles of impossibility of performance ... and/or frustration ... of purpose.\" In making the determination, the judge evaluated the parties' intent in entering the May 2015 agreement thusly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Plaintiff] testified essentially there was no specific intention with respect to the selection of Marotte. He portrayed Marotte as one of a myriad of attorneys who had worked for the parties and brought no special expertise to the project. He indicated that the purpose of the May[ ] 2015 agreement was essentially to save fees ... that would have been incurred if the arbitration process as set forth in the [arbitration] agreement was followed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   He testified that it took a better part of a day to draft and negotiate the May accord and various drafts were prepared. Unlike the prior agreement between the parties, ... no specific provisions were made to substitute Marotte in the event he was unable to discharge his duties under the May[ ] 2015 agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Despite [plaintiff's] attempt to minimize Marotte's prior business relationship between the parties, he did concede that Marotte had worked with the parties for ten years and fulfilled the role of corporate counsel. He was familiar with the companies, its principals, and the debts and accounts receivable, which were the focal point of the May[ ] 2015 agreement. [Plaintiff's] efforts to downplay Marotte's unique knowledge about the parties and the relationship to the parties were not credib[le].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Defendant's] testimony, not surprisingly, differ[ed] from [plaintiff's]. He pointed out that Marotte had been involved with the companies they owned and had been involved in the present dispute since 2013 when the initial term sheet of settlement was executed. Per [defendant], Marotte had spent numerous hours working with both principals. In his view[,] Marotte had specialized knowledge about the individuals, the companies, and the companies' business transaction[s]. It was Marotte, according to [defendant], who suggested the carve-out of the collection matters that was the subject of the May[ ] 2015 agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The procedure set forth in [the May 2015] agreement departed significantly from the procedures previously negotiated by the parties in the course of their prior conduct. Per [defendant], without Marotte[,] there would be no [May] 2015 agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The judge determined that \"New Jersey case law require[d] the [c]ourt to give the May[ ] 2015 agreement its plain and ordinary meaning[,] thus respecting the parties' intent to designate Marotte as the sole decision maker and deliberately omitting a mechanism\n   for replacing Marotte.\" Applying the applicable legal principles, the judge concluded that Marotte's withdrawal \"from the [May] 2015 agreement, which followed his discharge from the [arbitration] agreement by [plaintiff],\" \"substantially negated and frustrated\" \"the intent of the parties\" because \"his selection and participation in the May[ ] 2015 agreement was the most significant factor that ... produced that agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The judge elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Marotte] possessed unique knowledge and experience with the parties and their disputes. The May[ ] 2015 agreement was specifically carved out from the [arbitration] agreement, which was equipped to handle collection issues within the framework of the ... agreement. A separate procedure was intended with respect to collection matters and Marotte's participation was a critical part of this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The May[ ] 2015 agreement was completely void of any mention of arbitration or invocation of the arbitration law. Where a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault[,] the party's remaining duties are discharged unless the language or circumstance indicate to the contrary .... There is a basic principle of contract law that the [c]ourt cannot rewrite the terms of the agreement. The [c]ourt's role is to discern the parties' intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The [c]ourt is fully cognizant that this type of relief should not be lightly granted .... The [c]ourt is satisfied that the evidence after considering the testimony is clear and convincing that Marotte was\n   an integral part of the [May 2015] agreement and his withdrawal frustrated the intent and purpose of the parties and, therefore, the May[ ] 2015 agreement should be declared null and void under the principles of frustration [of] purpose and impossibility of performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   This means that the parties are relegated to their [arbitration] agreement to resolve what appears to be their intractable disputes. They are free to draw up a new agreement to deal with collections if they so desire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The judge entered a memorializing order and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff argues that \"based upon well-settled principles of contract interpretation law, the language of the [May] 2015 [a]greement demonstrates that the trial judge erred [in] voiding the [May] 2015 [a]greement in its entirety.\" According to plaintiff, in voiding the agreement, the judge ignored the agreement's provision that \"expressly precluded any modification or amendment ... except through the execution of a written instrument[,]\" and disregarded the \"severability clause\" that allowed \"the remaining portions\" of the agreement to \"remain in full force and effect\" in\n   the event \"any part or portion ... shall be held to be illegal, unenforceable[,] or contrary to ... public policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, plaintiff contends that \"[b]y accepting [defendant's] testimony ... that without ... Marotte[ ] ... , it was impossible to carry out the [May] 2015 [a]greement when no such language was contained in the [May] 2015 [a]greement, the trial court relied upon impermissible parol[ ] evidence as its basis to void the [May] 2015 [a]greement in its entirety.\" Plaintiff continues that since \"[t]he [May] 2015 [a]greement was put in place ... to prevent and minimize future conflicts[,] ... cancelling it goes against the intent of the [a]greement.\" Moreover, according to plaintiff, \"the [May] 2015 [a]greement was not merely an agreement to arbitrate claims, it was expressly identified as a settlement agreement between the parties\" and \"[s]ettlement of litigation ranks high in our public policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We agree that there is a strong public policy favoring settlement of litigation,\n   <em>\n    Nolan v.

In voiding the agreement, based on the testimony of the parties as well as the terms contained within the four corners of the agreement, the judge determined that Marotte's selection and participation as the decision maker \"was the most significant factor that ... produced [the May 2015] agreement.\" Based on Marotte's \"unique knowledge\n   and experience with the parties and their disputes[,]\" the judge found that \"[his] participation was a critical part of [the May 2015] agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because there was no provision in the May 2015 agreement for the selection of a replacement, as contained in the May 2013 agreement, the judge concluded that Marotte's resignation rendered performance of the May 2015 agreement impossible and frustrated the purpose of the agreement. We are satisfied that the judge's factual findings are fully supported by the record and, in light of those facts, his legal conclusions are sound. Contrary to plaintiff's assertion, the judge did not void the May 2015 agreement\n   by revising the agreement to add a requirement that Marotte's participation was indispensable.

The supervening event of Marotte's unavailability as the decision maker fundamentally changed the nature of the parties' overall bargain and rendered performance under the May 2015 agreement impossible. Based on the contentious and acrimonious relationship of the parties, undoubtedly, collection disputes would abound, thus necessitating a procedure for their amicable resolution. Because Marotte was responsible for definitively deciding those disputes, including issues related to the selection of debts, approval of settlement offers, commissions earned, collection efforts, and bad faith, as well as deciding issues related to the subject matter and interpretation of the May 2015 agreement itself, his unavailability frustrated the nature of the parties' overall bargain and rendered performance of the contract obligations impossible. Further, based on the judge's fact-findings, which are supported by the record, the unavailability of Marotte as the decision maker was not a risk defendant assumed under the contract, nor was it contemplated by the parties, as evidenced by the fact that a replacement decision maker was never addressed as in the May 2013 agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff argues that based on the severability clause, the provisions within the May 2015 agreement that were unaffected by the identity of the decision maker could have been severed from the agreement, and any disputes arising from those provisions could have been decided by a third party or the court. However, \"[s]everability is only an option if striking the unenforceable portions of an agreement leaves behind a clear residue that is manifestly consistent with the 'central purpose' of the contracting parties, and that is capable of enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP of Camden Cty.
