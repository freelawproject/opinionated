In this appeal, the plaintiff claims that (1) the trial court improperly concluded that it was required to appeal to the city's Zoning Board of Appeals (board) and, thus, failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, and (2) the defendant is estopped from applying the\n   current regulations to the plaintiff's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff owns property at 510 Farmington Avenue in Hartford. On December 10, 2012, the plaintiff submitted a special permit application, which the plaintiff describes as a \"hastily submitted\" placeholder application \"in order to preserve its rights,\" proposing the construction of a small fast food restaurant with a drive-through. On December 11, 2012, the defendant made changes to the city zoning map causing the classification of the plaintiff's property to change from a B-3 zone that allows drive-through operations to a B-4 that does not. In response to the plaintiff's application, Kim Holden, the city's chief staff planner, sent a letter dated December 19, 2012, to the plaintiff, stating in relevant part: \"A site plan with minimal information was attached to the application which is not sufficient to review with respect to the zoning regulations.... The application is considered incomplete and as such, the time clock on the application has been stopped.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff appealed the defendant's zoning map change to the Superior Court,\n   <em>\n    Peck, J.\n   </em>\n   , which invalidated the commission's December 11, 2012 zoning map change because the commission failed to comply with prehearing and posthearing statutory notice requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Farmington-Girard, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV-13-6038698-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204815345\">\n    2014 WL 4815345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (August 19, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 23, 2014, the defendant amended the text of the regulations, resulting in the plaintiff's inability\n   to use its property for a fast food restaurant with a drive-through. The plaintiff appealed this amendment to the Superior Court in a complaint dated February 18, 2015, on the\n   ground that the defendant failed to comply with procedural notice requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to Holden's letter, stating that the plaintiff's December 10, 2012 application was incomplete, Michelle Carlson wrote a letter dated October 20, 2014, on behalf of the plaintiff to Khara L. Dodds, the director of the city's planning division. According to the plaintiff, it had waited until after the court invalidated the 2012 zoning map change to complete its application. Carlson's letter purportedly supplied all of the required information outlined by Holden and requested that the time clock on the application run and that a public hearing for the application be set. In an affidavit, Carlson attested that she verbally was informed by the city that a new application was required and that the supplemental materials would not be accepted. Dodds responded to Carlson in a letter dated October 28, 2014, stating: \"We are contacting you with regard to a site plan review application submitted December 10, 2012 and your desire to re-activate this application with your current plan submittal. After our initial review, it was clear that the original site plan application, #2012-6263 filed in December 2012, lacked the required materials to be considered valid. The application was submitted without site and architectural elevation plans: as a result the application is void. A new site plan application with the required materials must be submitted. Please note several changes to the City of Hartford Zoning Regulations have occurred since your last submittal. Please review these changes to ensure that all required materials are submitted with your new application.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dodds' October 28, 2014 letter coincided with the defendant's adoption of another zoning map change that blocked the plaintiff's plan to build a drive-through\n   fast food restaurant. The plaintiff appealed the October 28, 2014 zoning map change to the Superior Court in a complaint dated November 14, 2014, on the ground that the defendant failed to comply with procedural notice requirements. The plaintiff filed a variance application on October 28, 2014, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff additionally appealed to the Superior Court, in complaints dated December 15, 2014 and April 28, 2015, respectively, from the defendant's December 9, 2014 zoning map change and its April 14, 2015 text amendment to the regulations. The defendant amended its December 9, 2014 zoning map and its April 14, 2015 text in the same manner as it had on September 23, 2014 and October 28, 2014, respectively. In its appeals, the plaintiff again asserted that the defendant failed to comply with procedural notice requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 20, 2015, the board denied the plaintiff's variance application. The plaintiff's appeals challenging the defendant's October 28 and December 9, 2014 zoning map changes were filed before the board denied the plaintiff's variance application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the plaintiff filed the four appeals that constitute the present matter, the defendant adopted new regulations on January 12, 2016, that place the plaintiff's property in a MS-1 zone. The plaintiff has not appealed from the new zoning scheme or designation of its property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 4, 2016, the defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiff's appeals as moot due to the passage of the new zoning scheme. The trial court, however, concluded that \"if the plaintiff's particular application was complete on October 20, 2014, and the zone change was improper because of the failure to provide proper notice, then [the plaintiff] may have had a viable complete application that was in conformance with the applicable zoning regulations at that time.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the parties filed briefs, including additional briefing on the exhaustion issue as requested by the court, and the court heard the appeals, the court made various findings. First, the court found that the defendant failed to comply with the procedural requirements for the September 23, October 28 and December 9, 2014, and April 14, 2015 zoning map changes and text amendments to the regulations. The court, therefore, concluded that the zoning map changes and text amendments were void. Second, the court concluded that the plaintiff had an application pending on or about October 20, 2014, as it found that \"[w]hile the December 19, 2012 letter from the planning division informs [the plaintiff] that the application is incomplete, there is no evidence that [the] application was rejected or deemed void until 2014. The language of the December 19, 2012 letter was less than unequivocal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted). Third, the court found that, contrary to the plaintiff's arguments, Dodds had the authority to declare the application void and that she had articulated \"a clear and definite interpretation of the zoning regulations in her letter declaring the plaintiff's application void ....\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Therefore, the court concluded that the plaintiff had a statutory right to appeal Dodds' decision to the board and had failed to do so. As a result, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeals for a failure to exhaust its administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiff filed a motion to reargue on September 25, 2017, which the court granted. At the February 8, 2018 hearing, the court rejected the plaintiff's argument that an appeal to the board was not necessary because the futility exception applied, and denied the plaintiff relief from the dismissal of its claims. The plaintiff thereafter appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that it was required to appeal Dodds' decision\n   to the board and thus that it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Specifically, the plaintiff makes three arguments: (1) Dodds had no authority to deny the application, (2) there was no statutory authority requiring an appeal from an unsuccessful special permit application, and (3) an appeal would have been futile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n   \"As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review.... Because the exhaustion [of administrative remedies] doctrine implicates subject matter jurisdiction, [the court] must decide as a threshold matter whether that doctrine requires dismissal of the [plaintiff's] claim....

The trial court rejected the plaintiff's argument because it concluded that the plain language of the regulations gave Dodds the authority to reject the application. It stated: \"Section 66 of the regulations provided that they 'shall be administered and enforced by the [D]epartment of [D]evelopment [S]ervices' and that the director of planning had 'overall responsibility for the administration of the regulations, and shall be the zoning administrator.' ... Pursuant to \u00a7 67 [of the regulations], the director of the planning division had the authority to designate the zoning enforcement officer who was responsible for enforcement of the regulations and for the issuance of zoning permits....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Section 68 (a) [of the regulations], in relevant part, provided that '[p]rior to the issuance [of a zoning permit], the zoning administrator must find that the application and plans conform to all provisions of these regulations.' ... Section 68 (c), in relevant part, required that each zoning permit application shall include 'an administrative review plan as well as such\n   information and exhibits as are required in these regulations or may be reasonably required by the zoning administrator in order that the proposal of the applicant may be adequately interpreted and judged as to its conformity with the provisions set forth in these regulations.' ... Section 68 (e) (1) required a special permit application to include a site plan ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Section 163 (h) [of the regulations] provided ... 'All projects requiring a special\n   permit as outlined in the table of permitted uses shall be referred to the [c]ommission for review....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Section 875 [of the regulations] provided ... 'Every application for the use of property subject to conditions set forth in this division shall be filed with the zoning administrator in accordance with the provisions of section 68 (relating to applications for zoning permits) and shall be subject to approval by the zoning administrator and any other commission, board or agency stipulated in this division.' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[Section] 913 [of the regulations] was entitled, 'Eating places with drive-in or curb service,' and, in relevant part, provided: '(a) The zoning administrator shall refer each application for an eating place with drive-in or curb service in the B-3 zoning district to the commission.

We are unpersuaded, as none of the authorities on which the plaintiff relies states that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the commission had the authority to declare an application, which does not include the information as required by the regulation, void as incomplete after a public hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sections 66 and 67 of the regulations, however, give the director of the city's planning division the \"overall responsibility for the administration of the regulations,\" and designate the director \"the zoning administrator.\" Furthermore, \u00a7 68 of the regulations explicitly provides that a permit may not issue until the\n   <em>\n    zoning administrator\n   </em>\n   finds\n   that the application and plans conform to all provisions of the regulations. Finally, \u00a7 913 of the regulations, on which the\n   plaintiff relies, requires compliance with \u00a7 68. We, therefore, agree with the court that the regulations provide Dodds with the authority to declare the application, which did not conform to the applicable regulations, void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff next argues that there was no statutory or regulatory avenue for appeal of Dodds' decision voiding its application. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \"[ Section] 8-6, in relevant part, provides: '(a) The zoning board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties: (1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement or decision made by\n   <em>\n    the official charged with the enforcement\n   </em>\n   of this chapter or any bylaw, ordinance or regulation adopted under the provisions of this chapter ....' ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The plaintiff argues that it could not have appealed Dodds' determination because she was not 'the official charged with the enforcement' under \u00a7 67 of the regulations. Nevertheless, our Supreme Court has 'not disagree[d], in principle, with the ... contention that appeals under \u00a7 8-6 may be taken from decisions made by someone other than the designated zoning enforcement officer, if that other person in fact exercised, and was authorized to exercise, the relevant authority.' ... Dodds had 'overall responsibility for the administration of the regulations' under \u00a7 66.... More importantly, she rendered 'a clear and definite interpretation of zoning regulations' in her letter declaring the plaintiff's application void ... that ultimately affected the plaintiff's ability to use its property.... Thus, the plaintiff\n   had a statutory right of appeal under \u00a7 8-6 (a) (1).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We agree with the court that Dodds' letter voiding the plaintiff's application was an appealable decision because the letter had both a legal effect and contained a clear and definite interpretation of the regulations. \"[W]hen there is a written communication from a zoning official relating to the construction or application of zoning laws, the question of whether a 'decision' has been rendered for purposes of appeal turns on whether the communication has a legal effect or consequence.... The obvious examples of such appealable decisions would be the granting or denying of building permits and the issuance of certificates of zoning compliance.... This interpretation is consistent with the terms used in relation to 'decision' under \u00a7\u00a7 8-6 and 8-7 -'order' and 'requirement'-which similarly import legal effect or consequence.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Reardon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Board of Appeals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20356\">\n    311 Conn. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 365-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%201070\">\n    87 A.3d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). \"[W]hen a landowner obtains a clear and definite interpretation of zoning regulations applicable to the landowner's current use of his or her property, the landowner properly may appeal that interpretation to the local zoning board of appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Piquet\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20173\">\n    306 Conn. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20977\">\n    49 A.3d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ; contra\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zoning Board of Appeals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062094\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/114/13/#p29\">\n    114 Conn.

We, therefore, reject the plaintiff's argument that it could not have appealed from Dodds' decision to void its application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiff's third argument is that an appeal to the board would have been futile because Dodds made two determinations in her letter: (1) that the application was void, and (2) that a reapplication must conform to the zoning map changes and text amendments in place at the time of the letter. The plaintiff argues that the \"significance of the first determination in ... Dodds' letter is wholly dependent on the validity of the second determination.\" Thus, the plaintiff contends that its claim can be reviewed only by a court of law as the validity of the zoning map and text amendments were under question and could not be resolved by the board. This argument is unpersuasive because, contrary to the plaintiff's argument, Dodds' second determination relies on her first determination-that the application was void and a new application needed to be submitted.
