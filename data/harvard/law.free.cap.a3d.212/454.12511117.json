The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) uncovered the violations after a lengthy and thorough investigation of the NPD, which led to the entry of a consent decree in a federal lawsuit. The creation of the CCRB is the City's decisive legislative policy response to the DOJ's findings, which tackled the problem head on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City appeals from an order granting summary judgment to plaintiff Fraternal Order of Police, Newark Lodge No. 12 (FOP). FOP is the exclusive collective negotiations representative for NPD officers. The order permanently enjoined the City from\n   \"implementing and/or enforcing\" the Ordinance, \"except to the extent\" that the Ordinance authorized the CCRB to \"serve strictly in an oversight capacity ....\" The practical effect of the order stopped the CCRB from functioning as intended because it precluded the CCRB from investigating alleged police misconduct, prevented the CCRB from utilizing subpoena power, and thwarted implementation of the City's policy decision, which was intended to definitively promote accountability, transparency, and public confidence in the NPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We must address numerous legal questions, especially whether the City validly set policy. We acknowledge that N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 expressly authorizes the City to create a board - such as the CCRB - to investigate and examine allegations of police misconduct. But the same statute charges the Chief of Police (the Chief) with responsibility for efficient and routine day-to-day operations of the police force. Therefore, one of the primary legal questions on this appeal is whether the Ordinance has infringed upon the Chief's statutory mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Understanding that the Ordinance also cannot alter the NPD's obligation to follow the Attorney General Guidelines (AG Guidelines) when undertaking its own internal affairs (IA) investigations, we hold that the Ordinance is valid on its face with two exceptions. First, the Ordinance infringes upon the Chief's statutory rights by making the CCRB's findings of fact binding, absent clear error, and second, the Ordinance improperly permits disclosure of complainant and police officer identities. Otherwise, we conclude that the CCRB can function as intended under the Ordinance, including providing an oversight role by investigating alleged police misconduct, conducting hearings, participating in the development of a disciplinary matrix, making recommendations, and issuing subpoenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2011, the DOJ, in conjunction with the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's\n   Office for the District of New Jersey, opened an investigation of the NPD. It did so after receiving \"serious allegations of civil rights violations\" by NPD officers. The investigation spanned a period of three years.\n   In July 2014, upon the conclusion of its investigation, the DOJ released a forty-nine page report that communicated its findings and recommendations to City officials and the NPD (the DOJ report). The DOJ acknowledged the \"skills and dedication of the many [NPD] officers who abide by the rule of law and commit themselves daily to the difficult, and too often thankless, job of protecting public safety.\" Indeed, the DOJ report expressly states that the DOJ's findings \"are not meant to detract from these officers' efforts.\" We also do not intend to undermine the important work that police officers perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nevertheless, the DOJ report reflects that its investigation\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   showed a pattern or practice of constitutional violations in the NPD's stop and arrest practices, its response to individuals' exercise of their rights under the First Amendment, the [NPD's] use of force, and theft by officers. The investigation also revealed deficiencies in the NPD's systems that are designed to prevent and detect misconduct, including its systems for reviewing force and investigating complaints regarding officer misconduct. The investigation also identified concerns that do not appear to amount to patterns of constitutional misconduct, but which nonetheless are significant and warrant consideration by the NPD. These concerns relate to the NPD's practices in dealing with potentially suicidal detainees, the NPD's sexual assault investigations, and the impact of the NPD's policing on the [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] LGBT community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The DOJ found recurrent problems with the IA function of the NPD,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   such as the failure to collect evidence from complainants, to \"probe officers' accounts or assess officer credibility,\" and to give witness statements \"sufficient weight.\" The DOJ identified instances of needless and unnecessary use of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings when interviewing complainants and witnesses with the effect of\n   intimidating and discouraging their participation. And it determined that the disciplinary system lacked \"transparent [and] objective criteria,\" resulting in arbitrary decisions. The DOJ report concluded that the NPD failed to investigate \"officers with high numbers of credible complaints,\" and that these officers \"continued to work on the force ... without any discipline or other corrective action[.]\" The DOJ concluded that these patterns and practices undercut the community's trust and confidence in the NPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Like the DOJ, the New Jersey Attorney General (AG) has similarly recognized that a failure in the IA function leads to a \"negative impact on the administration of criminal justice and the delivery of police services,\" which inevitably erodes \"the respect and support of the community\" and possibly results in civil lawsuits. AG Guidelines on Internal Affairs Policy &amp; Procedures, at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to its finding that the constitutional violations resulted in a significant lack of accountability, the DOJ report stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The NPD has neither a functioning early warning system nor an effective [IA] structure\n   </em>\n   . Those inadequacies undermine the Department's ability to identify and address officer misconduct. The NPD's data collection and analysis, and\n   its system for regular review of officer use of force, are similarly deficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    One indication of the ineffectiveness of the NPD's [IA] system is that the [IA] Unit ... sustained only one civilian complaint of excessive force out of hundreds received from 2007 through 2012.\n   </em>\n   While there is no \"right\" rate at which force complaints should be sustained, only one finding of unreasonable force out of hundreds of complaints over a six-year period is symptomatic of deeply dysfunctional accountability systems. The NPD also has failed to adequately collect or analyze data about officers' use of force, stops, or arrests. Nor has the NPD taken adequate steps to implement an early warning system that would track and identify officers' problematic behavior. As a result of these systematic deficiencies, the NPD does not discern or respond to problematic trends in officer conduct that could constitute or lead to misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The DOJ determined that the IA system \"tacitly permit[ted] [police] officers to engage in such conduct,\" and crucially, that the NPD knew about the problems but failed to address them. The DOJ report itself reflects that the City agreed in principle to \"establish a civilian oversight entity for the NPD\" and to \"revise\n   its [IA] practices to ensure effective complaint intake, objective investigations of misconduct, and fair and consistent discipline.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 3, 2016, the United States of America filed a complaint against the City in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the City was liable for the acts or omissions of the NPD. The complaint referenced the DOJ report and its investigative findings and conclusions. By filing the complaint, the United States attempted to remedy the \"pattern or practice\" of the NPD that \"has deprived persons of rights, privileges, and immunities secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" The United States sought to enjoin the NPD from further alleged misconduct, and requested that the City \"adopt and implement policies and procedures to remedy the pattern or practice of unconstitutional and unlawful conduct described [in the complaint].\" This litigation was resolved a few weeks later, on March 30, 2016, with a consent decree, which was subsequently revised on April 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 17, 2016, fourteen days after the federal complaint was filed, the City enacted the Ordinance, establishing the CCRB. In creating the CCRB, the City joined multiple other cities nationwide with similar boards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ordinance is the embodiment of the City's legislative policy decision to enable transparent\n   investigation and examination into allegations of police misconduct. The Ordinance\n   details the CCRB's structure, power, and duties, which we will outline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to its structure, the CCRB shall consist of eleven members of the public, appointed by the Mayor, with the advice and consent of the Municipal Council. Newark, NJ, Code (Code) 2:2-86.1(a)(2)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   One member shall be the City's Inspector General, who will \"serve as the administrative head of the Board,\" Code 2:2-86.1(a)(2)(c); three members shall be elected members of the Municipal Council, or their designees; and the remaining seven members shall be selected from individuals recommended by seven organizations identified in the Ordinance. Code 2:2-86.1(a)(2)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In selecting representatives to serve on the CCRB, nominators are encouraged to consider potential members' professional experience in law, civil rights or law enforcement.\" Code 2:2-86.1(a)(2)(a). But \"[n]o member of the [CCRB], excluding the Inspector General, shall be former employees of the NPD.\" Code 2:2-86.1(a)(2)(c). Training for CCRB members \"shall be predominately obtained from such independent, third party bodies or institutions that have experience with regard to [IA] and civilian review investigations and audits.\" Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to the CCRB's powers and duties, the Ordinance authorizes the CCRB to \"consider and make recommendations to the Public Safety Director,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Mayor, Municipal Council, and the public [pertaining]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   to policies and procedures concerning the general investigation of complaints by the Division of Police as well as its [IA] procedures.\" Code 2:2-86.3(d). It authorizes the CCRB to \"investigate and make recommendations regarding practices and/or patterns of behavior that are problematic with regard to\" police interactions with the public. Code 2:2-86.3(d). Along these lines, the CCRB must request certain information from the NPD on a quarterly basis. Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-21(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Ordinance also authorizes the CCRB to review the findings, conclusions, and recommendations arising from the NPD's internal investigations of individual complaints of police misconduct, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   At the conclusion of the [NPD]'s investigation of a complaint or behavior, the [CCRB] shall have the power to conduct a review of the findings, conclusion and recommendations of the Division of Police (Investigation Review). The [CCRB] shall report its findings of the Investigation Review to the Public Safety Director. A semi-annual report of the Investigation Reviews shall be submitted to the Mayor, Public Safety Director and the Municipal Council. The [CCRB] may utilize all the powers set forth in this Section 2:2-86 to carry out the Investigation Reviews.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.3(b) and Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-02(d).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The City expressly declared that the Ordinance was intended to allow the CCRB to make recommendations to the Public Safety Director. The City did not\n   create the CCRB to impose discipline on police officers. Specifically, the City, via the Ordinance, empowered the CCRB to consider and make recommendations as to policies and procedures concerning\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   the general investigation of complaints by the Division of Police as well as its [IA] procedures, and with regard to evidence of practices or patterns of behavior or practice that is problematic with regard to the interaction of the Division of Police with the public at large, as well as any failures of communication with regard thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-02(c).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Ordinance authorizes the CCRB to conduct its own investigations of complaints filed by members of the public (including NPD members) against any member of the NPD. The CCRB can do so not to adjudicate complaints or impose discipline - as it lacks such power under the Ordinance - but rather to investigate alleged police misconduct and make recommendations. The Ordinance\n   therefore gives the CCRB concurrent jurisdiction with the NPD to investigate complaints or behavior. Code 2:2-86.3(c). More specifically, the ordinance states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The [CCRB] shall have the power to receive, investigate, hear, make findings and recommend action upon complaints by members of the public (including, but not limited to[,] complaints made by other police officers or personnel) against uniformed and sworn personnel of the NPD that allege misconduct involving inappropriate behavior or actions, including but not limited to[,] excessive use of force, abuse of authority, unlawful arrest, unlawful stop, unlawful searches, discourtesy or use of offensive language, including, but not limited to, slurs relating to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and disability, theft, and any other categories protected under law. Any member of the public is intended to have the broadest possible meaning and interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.3(a).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The CCRB shall notify the NPD of any complaints it receives and indicate whether it will (1) \"contemporaneously initiate a parallel investigation of the [c]omplaint or behavior with the Division of Police; and/or\" (2) \"not investigate the [c]omplaint or behavior but will conduct an Investigation Review upon the Division of Police's conclusion of its investigation ....\" Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-06. The Ordinance prevents the CCRB from \"constrain[ing] or chang[ing] ... the obligations of the Division of Police to conduct appropriate and timely investigations of NPD uniform and sworn members of [the] NPD and to be compliant and consistent with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 40A:14-147.\" Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-16(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To make its own investigation meaningful, the CCRB enjoys subpoena power under the Ordinance. \"Upon a majority vote of members of the [CCRB], the [CCRB] may issue subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum, which may be served\n   <em>\n    to the extent permitted by law\n   </em>\n   .\" Code 2:2-86.3(f) and 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-10(e) (emphasis added). Under the Ordinance, the CCRB may: (1) make written or oral requests for information or documents; (2) interview the complainant, witnesses, and the subject officer to the extent consistent with the rights afforded to officers by law, the NPD, and in collective negotiations agreements (CNAs); and (3) make field visits to the site of the alleged misconduct. Code 2:2-86.5 \u00a7\u00a7 1-10, 1-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to interviews of police officers and other individuals, the Ordinance importantly refers to officers' constitutional protections and their rights set forth in CNAs.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (a) It is the intent of these Rules not to alter the rights afforded to police officers by the NPD in standing orders or other rules and procedures or in collective negotiations contracts with respect to interviews so as to diminish such rights, if any, including but not limited to[,] any existing right to notice of an interview, the right to counsel, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate oneself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (b) A member of the Division of Police who is the subject of a complaint shall be given two business days' notice prior to the date of an interview, to obtain and consult with representatives. A member of the Division of Police who is a witness in an investigation of a complaint shall be given a period of time, up to two business days, to confer with [his or her] representatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (c) All persons interviewed may be accompanied by up to two (2) individuals to act as their representative, inclusive of their chosen counsel. Such counsel or representative may advise the person interviewed as circumstances may warrant, but may not otherwise participate in the proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    Prior to the commencement of the interviewing of a police officer, the following statement shall be read to such officer\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   You are being questioned as part of an official investigation of the [CCRB].

If possible, an interview with a police officer shall be scheduled when such officer is on duty and during daytime hours. Interviews may be conducted at the [CCRB's] offices or other locations designated by the [CCRB].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (f) The interviewer shall inform the interviewee of the name and position of the person in charge of the investigation, name and position of the interviewer, the identity of all persons present at the interview, whether the interviewee is a subject or a witness in the investigation, the nature of the complaint and information concerning all allegations, and the identity of witnesses and complainants, except that addresses need not be disclosed and confidential sources need not be identified unless they are witnesses to the alleged incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (g) The interviewer shall not use off-the-record questions, offensive language or threats, or promise of reward for answering questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (h) The interviewer shall regulate the duration of question periods with breaks for such purpose as meals, personal necessity and telephone calls.

No other recordings are permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (j) If an interviewee needs an interpreter, he or she shall advise the interviewer of such need as soon as possible after being notified of the date and time of the interview. A qualified interpreter will be obtained from an official registry\n   of interpreters or another reliable source.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (k) Reasonable accommodations shall be made for persons with disabilities who are participating in an interview. Persons requiring such accommodations shall advise the [CCRB] of such need as soon as possible after being notified of the date and time of the interview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.5 \u00a7 1-11 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Ordinance requires the CCRB to report its review of every complaint to the Public Safety Director, as well as \"all relevant forms, memoranda and background information to assist the Public Safety Director in making [his or her] final disciplinary determination.\" Code 2:2-86.5 \u00a7 1-17(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Ordinance contemplates that the CCRB will make findings of fact and propose disciplinary recommendations to the Public Safety Director. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The [CCRB] shall use an established discipline matrix and guidelines to recommend discipline for outcomes resulting from investigations and complaints filed with the [CCRB] and/or the NPD. Said discipline matrix and guidelines shall act as safeguards to ensure the consistent application of discipline and should include aggravating and mitigating factors. The discipline matrix and guidelines should be developed by the Public Safety Director and affected bargaining units, in conjunction with the CCRB, and must accord with any Consent Order or Judgment with the United States [DOJ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.3(j).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   But the Ordinance violates the law, as we will later explain, by requiring the Public Safety Director to accept the CCRB's findings of fact. This part of the Ordinance improperly provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The [CCRB] shall provide its findings of fact to the Public Safety Director and, absent clear error, the Public Safety Director shall accept those findings of fact. The [CCRB] shall also make disciplinary recommendations, and the Public Safety Director shall make all disciplinary decisions based on the CCRB's findings of fact, absent clear error, and consistent with the matrix and guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.3(k).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   According to the Ordinance: \"Clear error exists when the CCRB's findings of fact are based upon obvious and indisputable errors and cannot be supported by any reasonable interpretation of the evidence.\" Code 2:2-86.5 \u00a7 1-17(b). The practical effect of this\n   requirement, as we will explain later, is that it interferes with the Chief's statutory responsibility for the routine day-to-day operations of the force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Notwithstanding the binding nature of the CCRB's findings - which we invalidate - the Public Safety Director nevertheless retains the authority and discretion to make final disciplinary determinations. Code 2:2-86.4(d) and 2:2-86.5 \u00a7 1-16(a). This is so because the Ordinance specifically limits the CCRB's authority.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit or impair the authority of the Public Safety Director to discipline members of the NPD nor obviate the responsibility of the NPD to investigate citizen complaints or incidents to which NPD is made known, involving uniformed and sworn members of the NPD, and to promptly inform the CCRB of all such complaints or incidents.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Nor shall the provisions of this\n   section be construed to limit the rights of members of the NPD with respect to disciplinary action, including, but not limited to[,] the right to notice and a hearing, which may be established by any provisions of law or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Code 2:2-86.4(d).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Ordinance further states that it should not be construed to interfere with other external investigations of NPD members:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   e. The provisions of this Ordinance shall not be construed to prevent or hinder the investigation or prosecution of a member of the NPD for violations of law by any court of competent jurisdiction, a grand jury, [c]ounty or [s]tate [p]rosecutor or any other authorized officer, agency or body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   f.

FOP alleged ultra vires creation of subpoena power by the Ordinance, in violation of N.J.S.A. 40:48-25 and the Faulkner Act, N.J.S.A. 40:69A-36 (Count One). It contended that there existed an inconsistency between the Ordinance and the AG Guidelines and discipline of police officers by the IA division, in violation of the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 (Count Two). It alleged that the Ordinance deprived officers of due process, in violation of N.J.S.A. 40A:14-147, N.J.S.A. 11A:2-13, and\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const.\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00b6 1 (Count Three). Finally, FOP claimed that the Ordinance violated N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, by infringing on the Chief's rights (Count Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The judge entertained cross-motions for summary judgment and invalidated the Ordinance with two exceptions: (1) the CCRB could perform an oversight function, and (2) the CCRB could consult with the Public Safety Director and NPD in the creation of the discipline matrix. In his oral opinion, the judge \"expressly prohibited\" the CCRB \"from engaging in investigations, hearings, adjudications, or the issuance of subpoenas relating to police misconduct and/or discipline[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On appeal, the City argues that the Ordinance does not violate N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 ; the judge erroneously concluded (sua sponte) that the Ordinance violates due process rights; N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 and the AG Guidelines do not preempt the Ordinance; and the judge erred by concluding that the CCRB's subpoena power was invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The ACLU joins the contentions made by the City. The ACLU emphasizes that neither N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 nor the AG Guidelines\n   preempt municipal regulation in the field of civilian complaints of police misconduct. Additionally, the ACLU maintains that the City correctly implemented its own police power - relying on its home rule authority - and properly established legislative policy consistent with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   FOP maintains that the Ordinance contravenes N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 because it transfers the power to administer and discipline police officers from the Police Chief to the CCRB; disregards police officers' due process rights; violates N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 and the AG Guidelines; and improperly empowers the CCRB with subpoena power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The AG, who accepted our invitation to appear as amicus, primarily contends that the Ordinance violates N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 by giving the CCRB's findings dispositive weight unless clearly erroneous. The AG argues the Ordinance \"impermissibly assigns to the CCRB functions that the [statute]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   assigns to the [Chief],\" maintaining that the CCRB's purported authority to \"conduct investigations, find facts, and make recommendations for the discipline of officers and members of the police force falls within the ambit of the [C]hief's authority under the statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We begin by addressing the City's argument that the Ordinance is consistent with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118. We agree, with one exception: the Ordinance interferes with the Chief's statutory rights by making the CCRB's findings of fact binding, absent clear error. To analyze this argument, we must interpret the statute, giving the Ordinance a presumption of validity. Indeed, our standard of review is well settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \"In matters of statutory interpretation, our review is de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Verry v. Franklin Fire Dist.

Pursuant to the statute, the police chief is responsible for the department's day-to-day operations, and\n   reports to the \"appropriate authority\" within the municipal government, who is responsible for promulgating rules and regulations for the control of the police force.

Here, the City addressed \"fundamental\n   principles\" pertaining to constitutional violations and related problems uncovered by the DOJ by developing a system for transparent investigations into police misconduct. It did so while simultaneously employing the City's express right, under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, to investigate and examine the police force and its members. And the City's local determination to create a board, such as the CCRB, concerns the City's \"sensitive responsibility\" to ensure law-enforcement accountability, which is not subject to change by the discretion of the Chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Notwithstanding the express statutory authority to investigate and examine the operations of the police force or any officer/member, and even though the City responsibly set local policy enabling transparency and police accountability, FOP correctly maintains that the CCRB interferes with the Chief's day-to-day routine operations of the force in one limited way. As previously discussed, and as counsel conceded at oral argument before us, the Chief's day-to-day routine operations of the force include supervising the IA Department, through the chain of command, administering the disciplinary process, and imposing any resulting discipline. That part of the Ordinance requiring the Director of Public Safety to accept as binding the CCRB's findings of fact,\n   absent clear error violates N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 to the extent it makes the CCRB's factual findings paramount to the findings of the IA department. In this respect, the Ordinance impermissibly undermines the Chief's statutory authority to run the NPD's day-to-day operations by rendering the results of the IA Department's investigation nugatory and commandeering the disciplinary process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Ordinance expressly provides that it \"shall not be construed to limit or impair the authority of the Public Safety Director to discipline members of the NPD ....\" Code 2:2-86.4(d). And the CCRB rules provide that as to the recommendations of the CCRB, \"[t]he Public Safety Director shall retain in all respects the authority and discretion to make final disciplinary determinations.\" Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-16(a). The CCRB can only make\n   <em>\n    recommendations\n   </em>\n   to the Public Safety Director as to the appropriate discipline. It cannot\n   <em>\n    impose\n   </em>\n   discipline. By imposing binding findings on the Public Safety Director - and by extension, the Chief - this part of the Ordinance does more than establish policies, rules, and regulations. We conclude, though, that the CCRB can still meet its objectives even without imposing such a requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The statute expressly authorizes municipalities to set rules and regulations for their police departments. It is essentially undisputed that participating in the creation of a disciplinary matrix does not interfere with the Chief's routine day-to-day operations of the force. Indeed, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 contemplates that a governing body may \"provide for the maintenance, regulation and control\" of a police force, including \"the adoption and promulgation by the appropriate authority of rules and regulations for the government of the force and for the discipline of its members.\" But by \"expressly prohibit[ing]\" the CCRB \"from engaging in investigations, hearings, ... or the issuance of subpoenas relating to police misconduct and/or discipline,\" as the judge ordered, the CCRB cannot examine or investigate alleged police misconduct as contemplated by N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, or the policy set by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   FOP maintains that the CCRB renders the IA process meaningless and divests the Chief of his powers. But the\n   Ordinance plainly states that the Public Safety Director \"shall retain in all respects the authority and discretion to make final disciplinary determinations.\" Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-16(a). As such, the City is correct in classifying the CCRB as \"solely a [B]oard of fact finding, investigatory review and public transparency, designed to provide civilian oversight [in]to the [NPD], and to make\n   <em>\n    recommendations\n   </em>\n   to the Public Safety Director as to what discipline the Public Safety Director should impose within his authority, and at his discretion.\" The CCRB has no power to impose \"minor or major discipline\" upon NPD officers. It can only make recommendations to the Public Safety Director after reaching its own findings and by using a disciplinary matrix developed by the Public Safety Director, bargaining units, and the CCRB. Thus, absent the binding nature of its findings, the CCRB will not interfere with the Chief's oversight role of investigations by IA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In concluding that the Ordinance violates N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, the judge relied on\n   <em>\n    Gauntt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"923413\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/194/468/#p486\">\n    194 N.J.

On its face, we see no evidence of such bias on the part of prospective CCRB members, or an inability of the CCRB to be neutral or detached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   It is important to remember that the CCRB does not adjudicate cases. It operates as an investigatory and oversight body. It has no authority to discipline officers. Based upon the investigations performed by staff members, the CCRB produces a report, consisting of findings of fact and recommendations for disciplinary action, which it provides to the Director of Public Safety. However, the CCRB does not take disciplinary action against any officer, nor does it make any disciplinary rulings. It also does not interfere with the NPD's internal investigatory and disciplinary procedures, or the court's role in reviewing cases under the civil service law. The CCRB does not function as an adversarial board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   After receiving the investigation report, it is the Director of Public Safety, and not the CCRB, who determines the appropriate disciplinary action, if any. If disciplinary charges are appropriate, officers will be subject to the internal disciplinary proceedings of\n   the NPD. Thereafter, they may pursue appeals through any available administrative and judicial processes, and they may pursue any rights they might have under their CNAs. On its face, the Ordinance does not interfere with any due process rights that officers may have in these other proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Based upon an IA investigation report, or a CCRB investigation report, or both, the Director of Public Safety may decide to file disciplinary charges against an officer. In making that decision, the Public Safety Director is not bound by the CCRB's findings, as the Ordinance provides.

The Ordinance requires the Public Safety Director to provide an explanation, in writing, and potentially in person before the CCRB, when he or she disagrees with the CCRB's findings of fact, or chooses to impose discipline that is of a lower level than that recommended by the CCRB. Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-17(c). On its face, such a requirement does not violate due process, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, or Newark's Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Requiring the Public Safety Director to explain his or her reasons for rejecting the CCRB's findings or recommendations serves a legitimate public interest because the Public Safety Director's responses will assist the CCRB in performing its oversight functions, including as required under the consent decree. This provision of the Ordinance serves the legitimate public interests of transparency and improving the critical relationship between the NPD and the Newark community. And it is consistent with that part of N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 allowing for investigations by boards like the CCRB, it promotes police accountability in ways beyond those contemplated by the IA function, and it complements the Public Safety Director's general obligation to\n   report to the Mayor. Indeed having the Public Safety Director - under the circumstances described in the Ordinance - explain his or her reasons to the CCRB cannot interfere with the Chief's day-to-day operations of the police force because it is the Public Safety Director - not the Chief - who may have to appear before the CCRB. Nevertheless, as the CCRB gets up and running, as applied challenges to this part of the Ordinance may be made on a more fully developed record if warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   We now move to the subject of preemption. A local government, like the City, may not act contrary to State law. FOP maintains that the City acted contrary to State law by enacting an Ordinance that purportedly conflicts with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 and the AG Guidelines. Therefore, FOP argues that the doctrine of preemption requires that we invalidate the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 and the AG Guidelines do not expressly address the Ordinance's grant of oversight authority to the CCRB. Indeed, the statute is directed towards law enforcement agencies (which the CCRB is not), and the AG Guidelines\n   are designed to assist law enforcement agencies, enhance their integrity, improve delivery of police services, and ensure proper consideration of police misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 states in part that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Every law enforcement agency\n   </em>\n   , ... shall adopt and implement guidelines which shall be consistent with the guidelines governing the \"[IA] Policy and Procedures\" of the Police Management Manual promulgated by the Police Bureau of the Division of Criminal Justice in the Department of Law and Public Safety, and shall be consistent with any tenure or civil service laws, and shall not supersede any existing contractual agreements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The text of this statute does not expressly state that an executive or legislative agency is barred from concurrently investigating police misconduct - as part of a CCRB with broad oversight authority to statutorily investigate and examine complaints of police misconduct - when a law enforcement agency has adopted\n   and implemented guidelines consistent with those promulgated by the AG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   To be sure, the AG has issued guidelines pursuant to this statute, and as chief law enforcement officer of the State, N.J.S.A. 52:17B-98, these guidelines are binding upon local\n   <em>\n    law enforcement agencies\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    O'Shea v.

Our conclusion does not undermine the importance of the AG Guidelines, or their applicability to\n   <em>\n    law enforcement agencies\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   We cannot say with confidence that the Legislature clearly intended to immobilize municipalities from promoting police accountability in ways\n   <em>\n    beyond\n   </em>\n   those contemplated by the IA function. Neither N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 nor the AG Guidelines\n   preclude municipalities from implementing a CCRB with oversight power to investigate and examine civilian complaints of police misconduct. Therefore, in that sense, the Ordinance does not permit what the Legislature has generally forbidden, or forbid what the Legislature has authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Furthermore, reading the AG Guidelines to preclude civilian municipal investigations of police departments ignores not only the City's right to set policy, but also the City's express rights contained in N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118. As we previously stated, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 expressly permits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   the appointment by the governing body of committees or commissions to conduct\n   <em>\n    investigations of the operation of the police force\n   </em>\n   , and the delegation to such committees or commissions of such powers of inquiry as the governing body deems necessary or to conduct such hearing or investigation authorized by law[; and] the appropriate authority, or any executive or administrative officer charged with the general administrative responsibilities within the municipality, [to] examin[e] at any time the operations of the police force\n   <em>\n    or the performance of any officer or member thereof\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   We make every effort to read N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 and the Guidelines, adopted pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181, as compatible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petition for Referendum on City of Trenton Ordinance 09-02\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145388\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/201/349/#p359\">\n    201 N.J. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145388\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/201/349/#p359\">\n    990 A.2d 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (stating that when reviewing two separate statutes addressing the same subject matter, courts must read the statutes in\n   <em>\n    pari\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    materia\n   </em>\n   and attempt to reconcile them). Here, the Ordinance does not replace an IA investigation with an investigation performed by the CCRB. Rather, the Ordinance provides for the possibility of concurrent investigations, and, as we have determined in this opinion, the upshot of the investigation performed by the CCRB cannot bind the Public Safety Director when it comes to law enforcement disciplinary determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Under the second factor, we conclude that there is no evidence that State law intended, either expressly or impliedly, to be exclusive in the field. That is, we do not read\n   N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 or the AG Guidelines as providing the exclusive means for the investigation of civilian complaints of police misconduct. The AG Guidelines do not preclude municipalities from creating separate entities to investigate complaints (solely in an oversight function). Once again, any such reading of N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 or the AG Guidelines would violate N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, which expressly empowers investigation and examination of police forces by boards like the CCRB, and contravenes the City's fundamental right to set local policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Under the third factor, there is no need for uniformity in the conclusions reached by separate IA and CCRB investigations. Regardless of whether the conclusions and recommendations made by the IA department and the CCRB conflict, it is the Public Safety Director who determines -\n   <em>\n    without limitation\n   </em>\n   - whether any disciplinary action should be taken. We have already invalidated that part of the Ordinance that provided that the CCRB's findings would be binding. Thus, the Public\n   Safety Director still determines disciplinary action, and does so by considering the entirety of the evidence. In this sense, the CCRB's investigation is consistent with State law and vitally promotes transparency and law enforcement accountability of the NPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   (4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Under the fourth factor, the state scheme is not so pervasive or comprehensive that it precludes the coexistence of municipal regulation. N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 and the AG Guidelines do not preclude civilian municipal investigations into the police department or individual members of the police department. That is primarily so because such a reading ignores N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118, which explicitly permits such civilian investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 requires law enforcement agencies to adopt guidelines that are consistent with the AG Guidelines, any tenure or civil service law, and existing contractual agreements. The\n   oversight role of the CCRB does not interfere in any way with a law enforcement agency's obligation under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-181 or the AG Guidelines. Thus, there exists room for important municipal regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   (5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Under the fifth factor, the Ordinance importantly does not stand \"as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\" of the Legislature. The AG Guidelines state that \"[t]he goals of the policy are to enhance the integrity of the State's\n   <em>\n    law enforcement agencies\n   </em>\n   , improve the delivery of police services and assure the citizens of New Jersey that complaints of police misconduct are properly addressed.\" (AG Guidelines, at p. 3) (emphasis added). The goal of the Ordinance is to further the same objectives, particularly in light of the NPD's past failures, as set forth in the DOJ's report. In our view, the CCRB furthers, rather than impedes, the Legislature's objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Moreover, the City's powers should not be constrained in an area in which the Legislature has expressly permitted municipalities to act.\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const.\n   </em>\n   art. IV, \u00a7 7, \u00b6 11 ; N.J.S.A. 40:48-2, N.J.S.A. 40:42-4, N.J.S.A. 40:69A-30. In establishing an independent body to perform oversight of the NPD - in furtherance of quality policing and a trusting relationship between the community and the police - the City squarely acted within the authority granted to it by the Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Furthermore, the Ordinance does not permit CCRB investigations to interfere with or taint criminal prosecutions of police officers. Both the Ordinance and the AG Guidelines require coordination with the prosecutor's office, and deferral to the prosecutor's office, where potentially criminal conduct is at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AG Guidelines at pp. 20-22, 24, 32-38,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Code 2:2-86.4(e)-(f)). The only difference is that the Ordinance requires deferral of case processing only if a request for deferral is made by the prosecutor, federal law enforcement agency, or by court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The AG Guidelines and the Ordinance require training of investigatory staff. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AG Guidelines, at p. 13,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Code 2:2-86.3(h), and 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-23). Also, the Ordinance requires the recusal of any Board members who have a conflict of interest. Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-24. To be sure, IA officers may have greater tools at their disposal for the investigation of complaints, based upon their access to the officer's workplace and their existence within the chain of command of the police department. (AG Guidelines, at pp. 25-31). However, that does not mean that CCRB investigations stand as an obstacle to accomplishing\n   and executing the full objectives of the AG Guidelines. To the contrary, the fact that IA officers are police officers is a double-edged sword. Their experience creates the possibility of both better-informed analysis of the evidence, as well as potentially biased analysis of the evidence. Civilian review provides a different perspective in furtherance of the same legislative objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The AG Guidelines provide that in publishing reports on IA investigations, law enforcement agencies \"shall not\" publish the names of complainants and subject officers. (AG Guidelines at p. 44). As to confidentiality of officers, like the AG Guidelines mandate for IA investigations, the Code requires that the identity of a police officer must remain confidential in any of the CCRB's public reporting. Code 2:2-86.5 \u00a7\u00a7 1-17(d), 1-20(a), 1-21(a). By contrast, the Ordinance provides that if a complaint is substantiated and referred for a CCRB hearing, \"the complainant's identity may be released in the course of any public hearing about the alleged misconduct.\" Code 2:2-86.5, \u00a7 1-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Disclosure of a complainant's identity could thwart an IA investigation, criminal investigation, or prosecution, or could disclose the name of an informant, and could taint an officer who was wrongfully accused. It could also discourage complainants from coming forward, or encourage unwarranted complaints from people seeking notoriety. For this reason alone, we elect to invalidate that part of the Ordinance allowing disclosure of a complainant's identity. But we uphold the remainder of the Ordinance sans the\n   binding nature of the CCRB's findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brunetti v.

Such a conclusion is consistent with the severability paragraph of the Ordinance, which provides that if any part of the ordinance is declared unconstitutional or illegal, the remaining provisions shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code 1:1-10. Any other purported discrepancies between the AG Guidelines and the Ordinance can be addressed, if warranted, on an as applied challenge on a more fully developed record once the CCRB commences its oversight role under the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Finally, the City has widespread authority to issue and delegate subpoena power to the CCRB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This power is incidental to the City's policy and express statutory power under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 to create a CCRB for the limited purpose of providing oversight in investigating and examining complaints of police misconduct. Without such power to issue subpoenas, its effectiveness will be undermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Code 2:2-86.3(f) authorizes the CCRB to issue subpoenas. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   The [CCRB] may require the production of ... records and other materials as are necessary for the investigation of complaints submitted to the [CCRB], pursuant to this section [of the Ordinance] through the issuance of subpoenas.

Where such delegation occurs within the legislative branch, State law expressly anticipates the delegation of subpoena power.

Here, the City established the CCRB by Ordinance with appointed members,\n   not voter initiative. Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   court drew that distinction by stating, \"what is involved here is not whether the Newark council had the power to enact an ordinance for civilian review of police conduct, but whether it can be done by initiative in a Faulkner Act city.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20563\">\n    364 A.2d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   , the court recognized that \"the subpoena power of a municipal investigative body is set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:48-25.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20563\">\n    364 A.2d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not consider whether municipal executive and legislative bodies were authorized to issue subpoenas, or delegate the authority to issue subpoenas, under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 because the relevant language of N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 was not adopted until after\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   was decided. Here, the City seized its power and acted decisively by creating the CCRB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   In summary, the CCRB's findings are not binding and the identity of complainants and police officers must remain confidential. The Ordinance is valid on its face and cannot alter the NPD's obligation to follow the AG Guidelines when undertaking its own IA investigations. Consequently, the CCRB can function as intended under the Ordinance, including providing an oversight role by investigating alleged police misconduct, conducting hearings, participating in the development of a disciplinary matrix, making recommendations, and issuing subpoenas.
