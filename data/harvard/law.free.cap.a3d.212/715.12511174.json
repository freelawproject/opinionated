In February, 2012, Donna Bouffard invited a homeless couple, the defendant, Elizabeth K. Turner, and her husband, Claude\n   Turner, to live with her in her home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June of the same year, Turner brutally murdered both Bouffard and her adult son, Michael Perkins, in Bouffard's Watertown home. The defendant appeals from the judgments of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of two counts of felony murder in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of criminal attempt to possess narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 and General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 21a-279 (a), one count of larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124 (a), one count of burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a), one count of hindering prosecution in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-166 (a), two counts of forgery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a) (1), two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1), one count of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3), one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a), one count of tampering with evidence in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 53a-155 (a) (1), one count of conspiracy to commit larceny in the third degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-124, one count of accessory to larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-124, one count of larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123, and one count of using a motor vehicle without the owner's permission in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119b. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly allowed the jury to consider a legally invalid but factually supported theory for the robbery and felony murder convictions, specifically, that a larceny by false pretenses that is part of a continuous course of larcenous conduct culminating in a murder can provide the predicate felony for a robbery and felony murder, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction of attempted possession of narcotics. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n   The record discloses the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found on the basis of the evidence presented at trial. In February, 2012, Christine Perkins, Bouffard's daughter, and Christine Perkins' then husband, David Ortiz, met the Turners at the Waterbury mall. Christine Perkins recognized Turner from previously having seen him in a Salvation Army food line. As the defendant was noticeably pregnant at the time, Christine Perkins and Ortiz invited her and Turner to stay with them in Bouffard's home. As a result, the Turners moved into Bouffard's home. Eventually, the relationship between the Turners and Bouffard deepened, and the defendant and Turner started calling Bouffard, \"mom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In April, 2012, Bouffard received a disability settlement of $13,000, which she put in an envelope that she hid under her mattress. When money began to disappear from the envelope, she moved it into a safe. Her relationship with the Turners soured, and Bouffard accused the defendant of stealing from her. On April 19, 2012, the same day that she left for vacation, Bouffard served eviction papers on\n   Christine Perkins and Ortiz so that Michael Perkins, who had moved out of her house due to a conflict with Ortiz, could return to the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the end of April, 2012, upon returning from vacation, Bouffard noticed that the safe had been moved and pried open, and approximately $6000 was missing. Bouffard accused the defendant of taking the money. The defendant later admitted to police that she had told Turner to take money from under the mattress and from the safe. The defendant explained that Turner did everything for her, that he did all he could to try to keep her happy, that she and Turner used the stolen money to buy drugs, and that she was \"in her glory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As indicated, the relationship between Bouffard and the Turners deteriorated. The defendant, on more than one occasion, expressed her desire to put rat poison\n   into Bouffard's and Michael Perkins' food because they were \"always in her business.\" The defendant also mentioned to a stranger that she and Turner didn't like Bouffard and Michael Perkins. After Bouffard had been killed, the defendant explained to police that Bouffard would lecture her about how she, Bouffard, was unhappy, which the defendant described as \"[c]ondescending. Poor me, poor me.... Everyone needs to wait on me.\" The defendant admitted to having arguments with Bouffard, and that when Bouffard would start \"running her mouth,\" the defendant would \"usually go upstairs because [she didn't] want to hear it because [she would] cuss [Bouffard] out and make her cry.\" Bouffard asked the defendant and Turner to leave in May, 2012, but they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June, 2012, only Bouffard, Michael Perkins, Turner, and the defendant lived in the home. On June 28, 2012, the defendant directed Turner to tell Bouffard that she was in jail and needed $50 for bail, which was untrue. After Bouffard gave Turner the $50, Turner and the defendant used the money to buy drugs. The defendant and Turner performed the ruse one more time that evening, with Turner explaining to Bouffard that the bond was actually $100, and he needed another $50 to get the defendant out of jail. Bouffard gave Turner the additional $50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the Turners returned to Bouffard's home in the early hours of June 29, 2012, Michael Perkins was asleep on the couch and Bouffard was awake in her bedroom. The defendant later stated to police that Bouffard was \"running her mouth\" and \"she didn't want to listen to [Bouffard] run her mouth, so she went upstairs, but she was curious about what might be taking place downstairs, so she lowered the sound on the television so\n   that she could listen in.\" She heard some banging and Michael Perkins yelling, and went downstairs. She saw Turner stabbing Michael Perkins in the stomach, but did not protest or intercede. Michael Perkins was saying, \"please stop, I love you.\" Bouffard did not come out of her room, which led the defendant to believe that Turner had already killed her. Turner told the defendant to go back upstairs, which she did. A short while later, Turner went upstairs and handed the defendant Bouffard's purse. The defendant went through the purse and took money, gift cards, and the keys to Bouffard's Lincoln town car. The defendant went downstairs and walked past the lifeless bodies of Bouffard and Michael Perkins, each with numerous stab wounds, to go into Bouffard's room and look for the paperwork for Bouffard's car.\n   The Turners took Bouffard's car and picked up Anthony Acosta, a friend of Turner's; Turner stopped to buy marijuana and cocaine. They returned to the house, at which point Acosta saw the bodies of Bouffard and Michael Perkins lying on the floor. The three proceeded to use the drugs. The defendant told Acosta that she regretted telling Turner to kill the victims. When the defendant was rifling through the victims' belongings, she discovered that Bouffard had been served with an eviction notice, and commented to Acosta, \"good for them. They deserved it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the following days, the Turners, accompanied by Acosta, sold Michael Perkins' scooter, guitar, and Wii system, as well as Bouffard's camper, phone, and jewelry. They also attempted to sell a television and took a gun from Bouffard's home. The defendant later admitted to police that both she and Turner had the idea to sell Bouffard's camper and other items. The defendant also made an effort to take money out of Bouffard's bank account by means of a check that she had forged. She additionally took Michael Perkins' debit card, and\n   because she knew his pin number, took money out of his account and got cash back on items purchased with the card. The Turners continued to use Bouffard's Lincoln town car and ultimately sold the car for $400. The defendant spent the money she procured from the sale of Bouffard's and Michael Perkins' possessions on food, hotels, and cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Turners then traveled to Baltimore, where they were arrested. The defendant was interviewed by Watertown police in Baltimore, after which the Turners were extradited to Connecticut. After a follow-up interview with police in Watertown, the defendant was seen kissing Turner through the bars of her cell. While in prison awaiting trial, she wrote a letter to a friend in which she acknowledged that she \"made a huge mistake\" that resulted in \"lives [being] lost.\" Following a jury trial, the defendant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of sixty years. Additional facts, as they reasonably could have been found by the jury, will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant has conflated some of her arguments and legal theories in a way that requires us to recharacterize them. The defendant claims that her due process rights were violated because the trial court improperly allowed the jury to base a guilty verdict on a legally invalid but factually supported theory that a completed larceny\n   <em>\n    by false pretenses\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   that precedes a use of force, and is part of a continuous course of larcenous conduct, can be the predicate felony for robbery and felony murder. The larceny by false pretenses accomplished by the bail scheme ended\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the murders, the defendant contends, and was not accompanied by force. Consequently, the bail scheme lacked a nexus to the murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The essence of the defendant's claim is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury in this regard, and, as such, the defendant's robbery and felony murder convictions may have been predicated on an inadequate legal theory that was purportedly argued by the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The larceny by\n   false pretenses, the defendant contends, could not have provided the basis for a predicate felony for a robbery because it was not accompanied by force, but the court's charge, in light of the state's position\n   during trial and in its closing argument, mistakenly created the impression that it could.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although it is possible to construe the defendant's claim that the court permitted the state to make a legally\n   invalid but factually supported claim to be, in reality, a camouflaged claim of prosecutorial impropriety, the defendant specifically disavows that she is raising a prosecutorial impropriety claim and does not provide briefing on prosecutorial impropriety. Similarly, the defendant's claim could be construed that the court abused its discretion by allowing the state to make an improper closing argument, but, again, the defendant has not briefed such a claim. Consequently, any claim that the court improperly allowed the state's argument\n   is, therefore, inadequately briefed and will not be considered. Appellate courts \"are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this\n   court through an inadequate brief.... Analysis, rather than [mere] abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.... We do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    McClancy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490815\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/658/#p414\">\n    176 Conn.

Thus, we are left with the defendant's claim that the court erred in its instruction to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because the jury instruction included a definition of larceny by false pretenses, the defendant argues that the jury might have found her guilty of robbery and felony murder under the misguided understanding that a completed larceny by false pretenses that preceded the use of force can be the predicate crime of a robbery and felony murder. Thus, the defendant in essence makes an instructional error claim and argues that her conviction may have resulted from a legally invalid but factually supported theory.

Once the property was obtained, the defendant argues, the larceny by false pretenses was complete and any subsequent use of force would not have a nexus to the larceny. According to the defendant, the theory that the larceny by false pretenses could support the felony murder and robbery conviction was not legally valid and, thus, her convictions must be reversed. The state argues that, at most, the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   of this case would not support the legal theory, but that that the theory itself is legally valid. The state argues that because there were other facts that the defendant concedes support the felony murder and robbery convictions, the defendant's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The United States Supreme Court and our Supreme Court have discussed the significant difference between a legally invalid basis and a factually unsupported basis for a conviction.

The Supreme Court reasoned, that \"[j]urors are not generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to them is contrary to law-whether, for example, the action in question is protected by the Constitution, is time barred, or fails to come within the statutory definition of the crime. When, therefore, jurors have been left the option of relying upon a legally inadequate theory, there is no reason to think that their own intelligence and expertise will save them from that error. Quite the opposite is true, however, when they have been left the option of relying upon a factually inadequate theory, since jurors are well equipped to analyze the evidence ....\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217781\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/46/#p47\">\n    Id., at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217781\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/46/#p47\">\n    112 S.

See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 (\"[a] person commits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of ... the retention [of the property] immediately after the taking [of the property]\"). Although we agree with the defendant that, in the present case, the killings did not occur until after the bail scheme was completed, this does not mean that there could never be a circumstance in which a use of force has a proper nexus to a larceny by false pretenses in order to constitute a\n   robbery. We set forth the following hypothetical as an example. Suppose that during the course of the bail scheme, Michael Perkins glanced out the window and saw the defendant in the car. If he exclaimed, after Bouffard has handed over the money, that the defendant was not in jail but was outside, and Turner immediately used physical force in order to retain possession of the money, then the larceny by false pretenses could have been a proper predicate for a robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We, therefore, view the defendant's claim as alleging an improper charge to the jury that was legally valid but was unsupported by the evidence.

In particular, the evidence supported the conclusion that the Turners had, either together as equal partners or, more likely, with the defendant as the brains of the operation, planned to kill the victims in order to take, and obtain through the sale of the victims' possessions,\n   money for drugs. Some of the evidence that provides support for this inference includes: the defendant repeatedly expressed the desire to put rat poison in the victims' food; she told police that Turner would do anything for her in order to keep her happy; she had directed Turner to steal money from under the mattress and in the safe; she personally orchestrated the bail scheme; she described Bouffard as condescending and \"running her mouth\"; she did not intercede when she witnessed Turner stabbing Michael Perkins; she rifled through Bouffard's purse immediately following the murders, taking Bouffard's money, gift cards, and keys; she walked past the victims' bodies to look for the paperwork for the car, and, shortly thereafter, she and Turner left to acquire drugs; the Turners later used the drugs at the home with the two bodies lying there; she had mentioned to Acosta that she regretted telling Turner to kill the victims; she was glad to find out that the victims had been facing eviction; and she admitted in her letter from jail that she had made a huge mistake, resulting in lives lost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   These facts, and others, provided a basis for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that at least the killing of Bouffard was planned in\n   advance and was designed to gain possession of her money and property, and that Michael Perkins was killed because he was a witness and/or attempted\n   to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusion is also supported by the verdict for the counts alleging felony murder as to Michael Perkins, larceny in the third degree, and robbery in the first degree as to Michael Perkins, in which the jury found the defendant guilty of larceny for actions that took place\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the murders, which factually supports the robbery and felony murder convictions.

When charging the jury on that count, the court stated that, \"[i]n this case, the property allegedly stolen is a Wii game system, guitar, television, jewelry, cell phone, moneys, gift cards, camper, gun, and scooter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, by finding her guilty on\n   that charge, it is quite clear that the jury found that the defendant committed larceny immediately\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the murders through the theft of Bouffard's and Michael Perkins' property, which, as the defendant concedes in her brief and in oral argument to this court, serves as a proper predicate for the robbery and felony murder convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, the jury found the defendant guilty as to the counts that charged her with felony murder and robbery as to Michael Perkins. In its charge to the jury on the count alleging felony murder as to Michael Perkins, the court instructed that \"the defendant, acting alone or with one or more other persons, committed or attempted to commit the crime of robbery of ... Michael Perkins ....\" Similarly, in its charge to the jury on the count alleging robbery as to Michael Perkins, the court instructed that \"the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that ... the defendant wrongfully took property from an owner ... Michael Perkins ... of the property or to appropriate such property\n   to [herself] or a third person.\" In so doing, the court instructed the jury that to find the defendant guilty of both counts, the jury would need to find that the defendant took property specifically from Michael Perkins. Because his property was not involved in the bail scheme, it is clear that the jury, in finding the defendant guilty of those counts, based its verdict on the larcenies that occurred immediately\n   <em>\n    following\n   </em>\n   the murders, and not on any larceny by false pretenses. We, therefore, conclude that there was a firm and proper factual basis for the jury's verdict in the present matter because it is clear, in the context of the charge, that the jury based its verdict on the larcenies that occurred immediately\n   <em>\n    following\n   </em>\n   the murders.\n   \"Our task on appeal is not to second guess the jury's findings ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1016909\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/39/82/#p91\">\n    39 Conn.

Rather, the state argued: \"But a robbery with force, the evidence that supports that here, is that ... the defendant ... admitted that she had come up with this ... bail scheme whereby [the Turners] were going to get money out of [Bouffard]. And what happened was, she said to [Turner], got to get fifty bucks. Tell her that I've been arrested. [Bouffard] gives him fifty bucks. Off they go. They use the money for drugs, according to what [the defendant] said. Next, she sends [Turner] back. You've got to get some more money. Sends him back to get another $50. [Bouffard] gives up the $50.

She heard [Turner]-her statement was that she heard banging, she came downstairs, she saw him stabbing Michael [Perkins], and she knew that [Bouffard] must be dead because she didn't come out of her room. You can infer that the only reason the defendant would think that [Bouffard] is dead at that point was because she knew that [Bouffard] had already been stabbed by [Turner]. Why would she think that [Bouffard] was dead at that point in time just because she heard some thumping or bumping? We know ... that [Bouffard] died from multiple stab wounds.

The court charged the jury on felony murder and robbery in part as follows: \"The defendant is charged in count one as to [Bouffard] and in count two as to Michael Perkins ... with felony murder. The statute defining this offense reads in pertinent part as follows: 'A person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, she commits or attempts to commit robbery, and in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, she, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants.'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \"For you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: The first element is that the defendant, acting alone or with one or more other persons, committed or attempted to commit the crime of robbery of [Bouffard], as to count one, [and] Michael Perkins, as to count two....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \"[Section] 53a-133 of the Penal Code defines robbery as follows: 'A person commits robbery when she, in the course of committing a larceny, she or another participant in the crime uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.'

The immediate murder of a person to eliminate a witness to the crime or to avoid detection is also 'in the course of the commission.'

Although the defendant previously made statements that she did not object to the language in the court's charge, the defendant specifically objected to the larceny by false pretenses being presented as a predicate for felony murder and argued that the facts did not support the bail scheme as a predicate felony. Thereafter, during a charging conference, the court ruled that whether the bail scheme, as part of a continuous course of conduct, was a predicate felony was a question of fact that was properly left for the jury, and the defendant objected again for the record. This is a close question and we, therefore, presume the issue to be preserved and review the merits of the defendant's claim.

The statute defining larceny reads in pertinent part as follows: A person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another ... of the property or to appropriate the same to herself or a third person, she wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner .... 'Larceny' simply means theft or stealing. Larceny also includes 'obtaining property by false pretenses.' 'False pretense' means a false representation of fact. Since nothing to happen in the future can properly be referred to as a fact, the representation must relate to past or present circumstances and not to future events. A representation may be made in writing, verbally, or even by actions or conduct. It is an expression ... of a fact upon which it is expected that others will rely. Usually a representation takes the form of a statement of fact, oral or written, but it may involve conduct only. Because a false pretense refers to past or existing facts, a mere promise to do something in the future is not a false pretense. Furthermore, a mere statement of opinion, as distinguished from a statement of fact, is not a false pretense. Puffing, exaggeration, praise of an article for the purpose of selling it, or giving an opinion as to the value or worth of property are not ordinarily a specific basis for a charge of false representation.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In the defendant's brief, she states, \"[t]o be sure, the theft of money and gift cards from Bouffard's purse immediately after her death can support a [conviction of] robbery and felony murder.\" Likewise, during oral argument, the following exchange occurred between Judge Prescott and defense counsel:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \"Q.
