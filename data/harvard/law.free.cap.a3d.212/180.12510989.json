In this appeal, we address whether plaintiff, a substantially prevailing self-represented litigant in a case brought under the Vermont Access to Public Records Act (PRA), is entitled to attorney's fees because he is an attorney. The civil division of the superior court denied plaintiff's request for attorney's fees. On appeal, plaintiff argues that he is entitled to attorney's fees based on the plain language of the relevant PRA provision, the purpose of the Act, and the public policy underlying the Act. We join the vast majority of jurisdictions construing similar acts in concluding that the PRA's plain language and purpose foreclose granting attorney's fees to substantially prevailing self-represented litigants, regardless of whether they happen to be attorneys. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The facts are not in dispute. In May 2015, plaintiff submitted a PRA request to defendant, the Vermont Attorney General at the time, seeking, among other things, several years of responsive records from multiple employees and officials in the Office of the Attorney General (AGO) regarding communications with, or documents related to, various individuals and domain names. Plaintiff's request included communications received or sent on state employees' private email accounts. The AGO retained an outside contractor at plaintiff's expense to identify emails subject to plaintiff's request and produced records on a rolling basis but ultimately denied the request with respect to communications sent through its employees' private emails. Plaintiff filed a PRA action in superior court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The superior court granted the AGO's motion for summary judgment, and plaintiff appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. On appeal, we reversed the superior court's summary judgment ruling and remanded the matter for further proceedings. We held \"that the PRA's definition of 'public record' includes digital documents stored in private accounts, but ... only [those] documents that otherwise meet the definition of public records.\"\n   <em>\n    Toensing v. Attorney General\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20VT%2099\">\n    2017 VT 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Vt.%201\">\n    206 Vt. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492193\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/1000/\">\n    178 A.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Recognizing the need to strike a balance between protecting state workers' privacy and making state agencies accountable for their actions, we determined that an adequate search would require the AGO to have in place policies: (1) minimizing the use of personal accounts to conduct agency business; (2) training employees to distinguish between private and public records; (3) requiring employees to provide public records within their control and to explain how those records were segregated from nonpublic records; and (4) providing for the disclosure of requested nonexempt public records submitted by state employees from private email accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 36. Accordingly, we required the AGO in this case \"to ask specified state employees to provide public records from their personal accounts in response to plaintiff's public records request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. On remand, plaintiff filed a motion for costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 1 V.S.A. \u00a7 319(d)(1), which provides that \"the court shall assess against the public agency reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.\" Defendant opposed the motion, arguing\n   that self-represented litigants may not recover attorney's fees under the plain language of the statute, that neither party substantially prevailed in the litigation, and that plaintiff may not recover the costs that he seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. The superior court granted plaintiff's motion in part and denied it in part. The court concluded that plaintiff had substantially prevailed in the litigation and thus was entitled to costs other than computer-assisted research costs, which the court considered to be a component of attorney's fees. However, upon examining the language of \u00a7 319(d), analogous federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) cases, and the U.S. Supreme Court case relied on in those cases, the superior court concluded that substantially prevailing self-represented plaintiffs may not recover attorney's fees under the PRA, even if they happen to be attorneys. Accordingly, the court denied plaintiff's request for attorney's fees. The court also ruled that plaintiff is not entitled to recover attorney's fees for work performed by his law firm colleagues at his direction because there was no independent attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the superior court erred in ruling that \u00a7 319(d)(1) does not allow the assessment of attorney's fees to a self-represented licensed attorney who substantially prevailed in a PRA action. Defendant supports the superior court's decision with respect to attorney's fees and does not challenge the court's conclusions that plaintiff, as the substantially prevailing party, is entitled to costs other than computer-assisted research costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7.

Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to the plain meaning of the provision because \u00a7 319(d)(1), which is applicable in this case, makes the award of attorney's fees mandatory and does not include an explicit exception for attorneys representing themselves. He finds support for his argument from the 2011 Amendment that made the award of attorney's fees mandatory under \u00a7 319(d)(1) and from the legislative command that the PRA be \"liberally construed.\" 1 V.S.A. \u00a7 315(a). He also argues that both the legislative history and public policy underlying the statute militate in favor of awarding attorney's fees to substantially prevailing self-represented attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10. We do not find any of these arguments persuasive. The key terms in \u00a7 319(d)(1) are defined in Black's Law Dictionary as follows. Attorney's fee is \"[t]he charge to a client for services performed for the client, such as an hourly fee, a flat fee, or a contingent fee.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).

Plaintiff's arguments seeking to undercut the plain language of the statute are unavailing. He first points out that the Legislature has explicitly indicated that the PRA is to be liberally construed. In its statement of purpose set forth in \u00a7 315(a), the Legislature recognizes both individuals' right of privacy in their personal and economic pursuits, as well as the public's interest in being able to review and criticize governmental decisions even though it might cause inconvenience or embarrassment. Consistent with these principles, the Legislature \"declares that certain public records shall be made available to any person as hereinafter provided,\" and then pronounces that \"the provisions of this subchapter shall be liberally construed to implement this policy.\" \u00a7 315(a). But liberally construing the PRA provisions does not mean ignoring the plain meaning of the language within those provisions, which we assume imparts the legislative intent. The provisions are to be liberally construed to implement the policy that public records are to be made available for inspection as set forth in the PRA. Even if we were inclined to liberally construe \u00a7 319(d) in a manner that was contrary to the common definitions of its terms, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that not allowing self-represented attorneys to recover attorney's fees-the same as for other self-represented litigants-would undermine the policies set forth in \u00a7 315(a). See\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Young v. Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8666961\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/165/276/\">\n    165 Wis.2d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8666961\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/165/276/\">\n    477 N.W.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991) (stating that \"it is not necessary that [attorney's] fees be awarded to [self-represented] litigant-attorneys\" to achieve \"[t]he primary purpose of the open records law[, which] is to ensure an informed electorate\"); cf.\n   <em>\n    Pease\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701210\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/639/\">\n    2011 VT 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701210\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/639/\">\n    190 Vt. 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701210\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/639/\">\n    35 A.3d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While plaintiff is correct that the PRA requires liberal construction to facilitate disclosure, plaintiff makes no argument as to how a determination that the Zoning Administrator was the [Development Review Board's] record custodian in any way hindered disclosure and in fact admits he has received all requested documents.\" (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. Plaintiff also argues that the Legislature's use of the word \"shall\"-and more particularly the fact that the Legislature amended \u00a7 319(d) in 2011 to substitute the word \"shall\" for the word \"may\"-demonstrates that the Legislature intended attorney's fees to be mandatory for prevailing parties. This argument runs counter to plaintiff's position that only prevailing self-represented attorneys-and not other prevailing self-represented litigants-are entitled to recover attorney's fees. In any event, whether attorney's fees are mandatory or discretionary is unrelated to the question of whether self-represented attorneys may recover attorney's fees under \u00a7 319(d). The 2011 Amendment made attorney's fees mandatory for substantially prevailing plaintiffs unless, within the time allowed for service of an answer, the public agency conceded that the requested records were public and provided the records\n   to the plaintiff, in which case attorney's fees were discretionary with the trial court. See 2011, No. 59, \u00a7 5. Compare \u00a7 319(d)(1), with \u00a7 319(d)(2). Thus, pursuant to the 2011 Amendment, whether attorney's fees are mandatory or discretionary for prevailing plaintiffs depends on the response of the agency and has nothing to do with the status of the person who requested the records. Indeed, whether attorney's fees were mandatory or discretionary in public records laws construed by other courts had no impact whatsoever on those courts' determinations that self-represented attorneys could not recover attorney's fees under those laws.

We find no merit to plaintiff's argument that allowing prevailing self-represented attorneys to recover attorney's fees is supported by the PRA's legislative history. To the extent that we even need to consider the Act's legislative history in light of the common meaning of its terms, plaintiff has failed to cite any legislative history that supports the notion that the Legislature intended self-represented attorneys to recover attorney's fees. Plaintiff states that when the 2011 Amendment was proposed, the then-governor's counsel told the Senate Committee on Government Operations that making attorney's fees obligatory was necessary to \"help give the law teeth.\" He cites comments by the state archivist to the same committee indicating that changing the fee provision from permissive to mandatory would improve access to public records. He also points to a rejected amendment that would have weakened the fee provision in several ways, including by not allowing the assessment of fees unless the public agency unreasonably withheld the requested records.

In support of this\n   argument, plaintiff points to the exception for mandatory attorney's fees in \u00a7 319(d)(2), which makes fees permissive if the agency has turned over the requested records before filing an answer to a complaint seeking the records. The fact that \u00a7 319(d) sets forth different circumstances in which attorney's fees are either mandatory or permissive does not demonstrate that the Legislature must have intended to award attorney's fees to self-represented attorneys because \u00a7 319(d) does not explicitly state otherwise, especially considering the commonly understood terms in the provision relative to this question.

In this case, the language in the federal FOIA's fee provision is not meaningfully different from the language in the PRA's fee provision; thus, the federal courts' interpretation of FOIA's fee provision, as well as other state courts' interpretation of comparable state provisions, may provide persuasive, but not controlling, reasoning for us to consider in construing the PRA's fee provision. In fact, we find persuasive the reasoning by the consensus of federal and state courts on the question of whether \u00a7 319(d) allows substantially prevailing self-represented attorneys, but not other self-represented litigants, to recover attorney's fees. The common definition and plain meaning of the key words in \u00a7 319(d)(1), whether read in isolation or considered together, make the recovery of attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiffs dependent upon the existence of an agency relationship in which an attorney charges fees for representing a client seeking to obtain public records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23. To the extent we need to look beyond the common definitions of the language in the fee provision, nothing in the other sections of the PRA or its legislative history suggest the existence of a public policy with respect to the award of attorney's fees that differs from that discussed in\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   and other federal and state courts construing comparable acts. The policy underlying the PRA's fee provision, as other courts have found with respect to their comparable fee provisions, is not to reward successful litigants or punish recalcitrant agencies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but rather to encourage objectively well-informed, meritorious claims by awarding mandatory or permissive attorney's fees, depending on the agencies' response to the requests, to defray the cost of incurring those fees needed to obtain public records. In short, we discern no basis, either in the language of \u00a7 319(d) itself or the public policy underlying the PRA, to interpret the fee provision to grant attorney's fees to self-represented attorneys, but not to other self-represented litigants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The secondary definition is \"[s]omeone who practices law.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942895\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/303/#p306\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"942895\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/172/303/#p306\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Nothing about this definition gives us pause with respect to our above analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Plaintiff argues that the term \"reasonably incurred\" in \u00a7 319(d)(1) refers only to the term \"litigation costs\" and not to the previous term \"attorney's fees,\" which itself is proceeded by the word \"reasonable.\" Applying the term \"reasonably incurred\" to both \"reasonable attorney's fees\" and \"litigation costs\" does not necessarily create a redundancy, insofar as the amount of attorney's fees could conceivably be reasonable based on the number of hours invested while at the same time fees might not be reasonably incurred based on the nature of the work done. To be sure, the sentence is grammatically ambiguous as to whether \"reasonably incurred\" applies only to \"litigation costs\" or to both \"litigation costs\" and \"attorney's fees.\" On the other hand, it is difficult to comprehend why costs, but not attorney's fees, would need to be incurred.
