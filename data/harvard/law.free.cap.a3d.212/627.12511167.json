This case asks us to examine that strange procedural device, the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO), and how it intersects with the statute of limitations for actions on judgments. The parties divorced in November 2004. As part of the divorce, the court ordered wife to transfer funds from her retirement account to husband. In 2006, the court approved a proposed QDRO to effectuate the transfer of said funds. The order was never \"qualified,\" however, because there was no money in the retirement account that wife identified. The court approved another proposed QDRO in February 2007 specifying a different retirement account identified by wife. In August 2017, husband filed a motion to enforce, asserting that the owed funds were never transferred to him and that there were no funds in the second retirement account that wife identified. The court denied husband's motion to enforce, finding it barred by the eight-year statute of limitations for actions on judgments. As set forth below, we do not consider husband's attempt to effectuate a transfer of these retirement funds by QDRO to be an action on a judgment, and we therefore reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. We begin with an overview of the relevant law governing the division of retirement accounts. A court must engage in a two-step process to divide retirement accounts governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1461.

With this overview in mind, we turn to the facts. The parties here divorced in November 2004 after a twenty-five-year marriage. The court ordered an equal division of the marital assets. Both parties had pensions and various retirement accounts. As relevant here, the court ordered wife to transfer $ 27,655 from one or both of her retirement accounts to husband within forty-five days of the date of the final divorce order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. No funds were transferred to husband within this period by QDRO or otherwise. In mid-2006, husband's attorney filed with the court a proposed QDRO, drafted by wife's attorney and edited by husband's attorney, to effectuate the transfer. The court approved the proposed QDRO in May 2006, identifying a particular retirement account from which a lump-sum payment should be made to husband as the \"alternative payee.\" This order was then presumably sent to the plan administrator to determine if it should be qualified; if it was deemed qualified, the plan administrator would segregate the retirement funds and transfer them to husband's retirement account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. In September 2006, husband moved for enforcement of the divorce order and contempt. He asserted that there were no funds in the retirement account that wife identified in the proposed QDRO and, thus, there were no funds available to transfer to him. Wife's attorney acknowledged that wife had removed the funds from the retirement account she identified. She proposed a modified QDRO that identified a different retirement account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. The parties then engaged in a back-and-forth over the proposed QDRO's\n   terms. Husband objected to the use of a QDRO at all, arguing that he was entitled to an immediate lump sum payment from wife. If a QDRO was warranted, husband argued that he was entitled to interest given wife's delay in transferring the funds to him. In late February 2007, at the parties' request, the court clarified that the final divorce order contemplated a transfer by QDRO from one retirement account to another. The following month, the court approved the second proposed QDRO drafted by wife's attorney; the order stated it was intended as a QDRO requiring wife to transfer the $ 27,655 from her retirement account to husband. The court denied husband's request to include accrued interest. The proposed QDRO, approved by the court, stated, among other things, that the court \"shall retain jurisdiction with respect to this Order to the extent required to maintain its qualified status and the original intent of the parties as provided herein.\" There is nothing in the record to show that a plan administrator ever approved this proposed QDRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. Ten years later, in August 2017, husband filed a motion to enforce the final judgment of divorce. See generally V.R.F.P. 4.2 (describing process for filing post-judgment proceedings in divorce actions, including motions to enforce). He recounted the history of the two proposed QDROs. Husband averred that wife had forwarded the proposed QDRO to her plan administrator and that husband had assumed that the transfer occurred. He stated that he had recently learned that no retirement funds were transferred to him and that there were no funds available for transfer in the second retirement account that wife identified in the 2007 QDRO. Husband asked the court to compel wife to transfer the retirement funds to him with interest. Wife opposed the motion, arguing that husband's request was time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. The court construed husband's motion as seeking enforcement of the November 2004 final divorce order and concluded that it was time-barred. The court determined that the eight-year limit for actions on judgments applied. See 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 506 (\"Actions on judgments and actions for the renewal or revival of judgments shall be brought by filing a new and independent action on the judgment within eight years after the rendition of the judgment, and not after.\"). It found that unlike child-support orders, there was no specific statute shielding enforcement actions in divorce cases from the eight-year limit set forth in \u00a7 506. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 606(a), (c) (addressing enforcement of child-support orders).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. The court also looked to a Nevada case applying similar statutes. It found compelling the Nevada Supreme Court's holding that a judgment-action limitations period applied to the enforcement of a divorce decree's property distribution, regardless of whether enforcement was brought \"through motion practice or through an independent action.\"\n   <em>\n    Davidson v. Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n    382 P.3d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884, 884 n.2 (Nev. 2016) (stating that court did \"not distinguish between a motion and an independent action to enforce a divorce decree because a party is not bound by the label he puts on his papers,\" and that \"[a] motion may be treated as an independent action or vice versa as is appropriate\" (citation and brackets omitted)). But cf.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Russo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693030\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/184/550/\">\n    2008 VT 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693030\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/184/550/\">\n    184 Vt. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3693030\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/184/550/\">\n    956 A.2d 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.), holding, as now made clear in 12 V.S.A. \u00a7 506, that to be an \"action\" for renewal of judgment under \u00a7 506, party must file \"new and independent suit commenced in accordance with [Vermont Rule of Civil Procedure] 3\" and motion does not suffice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. The\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   court considered the timeliness of a wife's action to enforce a\n   provision in a divorce decree requiring her ex-husband to pay her one-half of the equity in the marital home. The court concluded that, \"other than child support orders,\" Nevada law did not exclude family division orders from the state's six-year limitation for actions on judgments.\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n    382 P.3d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It reasoned that had the legislature \"intended to vest the courts with continuing jurisdiction over property rights in divorce cases, it would have done so expressly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n    . at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation and brackets omitted). The court emphasized the need for finality and certainty and noted that the wife could have renewed her judgment and \"avoid[ed] the harsh results that could accompany the expiration of a statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   It found its holding \"consistent with several other states that apply limitations periods to enforcement of property distribution provisions in divorce decrees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.3d%20880\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. Finally, the court in this case cited\n   <em>\n    Iannarone v. Limoggio\n   </em>\n   , where we held that the doctrine of claim preclusion barred the wife from filing successive motions to enforce her ex-husband's obligation to pay her a certain sum under a final divorce order.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    2011 VT 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    190 Vt. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    30 A.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It noted that in\n   <em>\n    Iannarone\n   </em>\n   , we described the wife's second motion to enforce the terms of the final divorce order as beginning \"a new or 'subsequent' case\" for claim preclusion purposes and characterized the first motion to enforce as an \"action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 18. The court here reasoned that analogous policy considerations encouraged a similar result in this case because claim preclusion and statutes of limitation both ensured timely finality of disputes. It concluded that husband was trying to do by motion what would be barred by the statute of limitations for actions on judgments. It found this inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Iannarone\n   </em>\n   's characterization of these types of motions as beginning new cases. The court thus found husband's motion to enforce barred by \u00a7 506. Husband appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. Husband challenges the trial court's decision on multiple grounds. He first argues that the court erred in relying on claim preclusion to deny his request. He argues that claim preclusion is inapplicable here because he lacked a prior opportunity to litigate his claim. Husband further argues that \u00a7 506 should not apply because he filed a motion to enforce, not an \"action on a judgment.\" He asserts that applying \u00a7 506 ignores the proposition, referred to favorably in our cases, that a trial court retains indefinite jurisdiction to enforce its own orders. Husband also contends that the Legislature and this Court have never expressly stated that \u00a7 506 governs motions to enforce a court's own order. Finally, husband cites various equitable principles and argues that wife should not be allowed to benefit from repeatedly disobeying a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17. First, we find it unnecessary to address claim preclusion because it is inapplicable\n   here and because the trial court did not rely on claim preclusion (other than by analogy) to deny husband's claim. We agree with husband, however, that this case is not like\n   <em>\n    Iannarone\n   </em>\n   , where one spouse could have, and should have, raised her current theory of recovery in a prior proceeding and failed to do so. Cf.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    2011 VT 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    190 Vt. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    30 A.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (crediting husband's argument that \"wife's 2005 enforcement proceeding preclude[d] consideration of the 2008 enforcement action because the theory of the 2008 proceeding was available to her and recognized in 2006\"); see also 3 B. Turner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 9:19 (\"Principles of issue and claim preclusion clearly apply to enforcement of property division orders. Rulings on enforcement issues are binding if the same exact issue is raised by a later motion.\"). This is husband's first attempt to enforce the 2007 proposed QDRO, brought when he discovered that the transfer anticipated to occur pursuant to that order did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18. We note, moreover, that the statute of limitations for actions on judgments was not at issue in\n   <em>\n    Iannarone\n   </em>\n   , nor did we discuss QDROs and their unique role in transferring retirement funds. Instead, we considered if the trial court's denial of the wife's first motion to enforce payment of a certain sum reflecting her share of the value of the marital home constituted \"a previous final judgment on the merits,\" one of the elements of claim preclusion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    2011 VT 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    190 Vt. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701061\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/190/272/\">\n    30 A.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that the first denial was a final appealable judgment. We rejected the wife's argument that claim preclusion was inapplicable because her second motion should be considered a \"subsequent case[ ] ... in continuing litigation in the same action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 18. It was in this context that we stated that the wife's second motion to enforce \"began a new or 'subsequent' case\" and that \"it was not a continuation of the action that [the] wife began when she filed her [first] motion to enforce\" three years earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We do not find this language particularly helpful here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19. We thus turn to husband's remaining arguments. We review de novo whether the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 506 bars husband's motion.

We reach a similar conclusion here. As discussed at the outset of this opinion, the trial court's division of the parties' assets and its approval of a DRO is only the first step in obtaining the transfer of retirement funds under ERISA; a spouse has no right to payment from a particular retirement account until a plan administrator determines that a QDRO has been created, that is, the court's DRO is qualified. Thus, although husband was awarded the right to a particular amount of retirement funds in the 2004 divorce order, he had no effective ability to enforce that portion of the order through an \"action on the judgment.\" See\n   <em>\n    Koerber v.

We rejected the notion that the court was modifying the order, finding that the court's order was \"necessary to enforce the correct terms of the divorce decree, and the court had jurisdiction to issue it.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702695\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/192/79/\">\n     2012 VT 57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 10,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702695\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/192/79/\">\n     192 Vt. 79\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702695\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/192/79/\">\n     54 A.3d 525\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Some states have enacted laws explicitly providing courts with continuing jurisdiction to establish, maintain, or revise DROs to ensure that they are qualified, or stating that divisions of retirement benefits are not final until a DRO is qualified by the plan administrator.
