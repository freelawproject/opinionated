On June 17, 2014, at around 9:45 in the morning, B.M.D., driving her SUV, struck decedent Schrope as Schrope was riding her bicycle on the right-hand side of a residential road. B.M.D. approached Schrope from behind and saw her in the distance. Visibility was clear and there were no cars approaching from the other direction. At the scene of the accident, B.M.D. gave a recorded statement to police. The officer conducting the interview asked B.M.D. if she was being treated for any medical conditions, and she responded \"mild depression.\" She reported to the officer she had taken Paxil that day and had a glass of wine the prior evening. There is no evidence in the record that the police conducted a field sobriety check. The police did not request a blood draw or an Alcotest. A police report concluded, \"[B.M.D.] made no attempt to move over to the left and safely pass Mrs. Schrope. [Even though] [t]he width of the roadway was measured [twenty] feet [nine] inches[,] which would have allowed ample space for [B.M.D.] to move over and safely pass Mrs. Schrope.\" Despite the fact that Schrope suffered fatal injuries, B.M.D. was only charged with and convicted of careless driving, N.J.S.A. 39:4-97, after a trial in municipal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 4, 2015, plaintiff filed a wrongful death and survivorship claim against B.M.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through discovery, plaintiff learned B.M.D. was under the care of psychiatrist Stefan Lerner, M.D, and plaintiff named him as a defendant in a first amended complaint. During B.M.D.'s deposition, she was asked about what medications she took. At the time of the crash, B.M.D. was prescribed at least six psychiatric medications, including: (1) duloxetine (Cymbalta );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) lamotrigine (Lamictal ); (3) lithium carbonate (Lithobid ); (4) trazadone; (5) dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride (Focalin ); and (6) methylphenidate (Concerta ). B.M.D. admitted she took duloxetine, lamotrigine and lithium carbonate on the morning of the crash. When asked if she took trazodone the night before the crash, she testified she did not know, and, when asked if it was possible, she answered \"it's possible.\" She also consumed some wine the night before. B.M.D. also testified she did not experience side effects from her medications except for Focalin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Focalin is a central nervous system stimulant used to treat Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). B.M.D. admitted Focalin made her \"feel a little speedy\" as if she was \"on speed.\" She initially denied taking Focalin on the day of the crash because \"[i]t had such bad ramifications, I didn't want to bring it up,\" but later admitted it was possible she \"took half of the dose I should have.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 8, 2014, Lerner mailed B.M.D. a prescription for Concerta without meeting with her in person. Concerta is also a central nervous system stimulant. B.M.D. testified she did not complain to Lerner of any adverse reaction to Focalin, and Lerner did not document why he wrote her a new prescription. In her deposition, B.M.D. could not recall whether she took either one, neither or both Focalin and Concerta on the morning of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lerner began working with B.M.D. in 2001. Over the course of thirteen years, up and until the crash, he wrote her 160 initial prescriptions and over 250 refill prescriptions. Lerner diagnosed B.M.D. with Major Depressive Disorder, ADD and panic disorder but not bi-polar disorder, although he opined she exhibited bi-polar-like symptoms. During her testimony, B.M.D. exhibited limited knowledge about the purpose and effect of each drug she was prescribed and admitted she often altered dosages without consulting Lerner. She denied Lerner ever warned her against driving after ingesting her medication. However, Lerner testified he would have warned her, especially if she felt drowsy or light-headed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.M.D. sometimes missed her appointments with Lerner. Lerner explained this was problematic because he did not want to alter B.M.D.'s medication regimen and recognized the importance of meeting with her in person to determine how she was responding to the medication. Lerner acknowledged he sometimes mailed prescriptions to B.M.D. without meeting with her in person and admitted to mailing her a prescription for Concerta on June 8, 2014. Prior to the crash, B.M.D.'s last meeting with Lerner was April 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Several years before the accident, B.M.D. told Lerner she had panic attacks that either occurred while she was driving or left her feeling like she could not drive. She reported experiencing one panic attack while driving so severe that she had to pull over. Lerner was aware B.M.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   experienced panic attacks while driving but was under the impression \"she has [not] had much trouble in that area\" because she continued to drive without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although plaintiff's complaint names B.M.D.'s pharmacist as \"John/Jane Doe Doctors/Pharmacists,\" the record lacks any mention of who filled B.M.D.'s prescriptions. Of particular significance is the absence of any record or testimony about whether B.M.D.'s pharmacist provided written or oral warnings of the potential side effects of the medications. No pharmacy records are included in the appellate record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lerner moved for summary judgment on March 27, 2018. Lerner argued he owed no duty of care to Schrope because she was not a readily identifiable victim. Lerner argued a therapist has no duty to warn unless he or she knows or should know their patient intends to harm a readily identifiable victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff opposed Lerner's motion and submitted the report of two experts. Robert J. Pandina, Ph.D., opined B.M.D.'s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired when she struck Schrope.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Pandina explained the purpose and possible side effects of each of the medications B.M.D. was prescribed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a. Duloxetine (Cymbalta ) is an anti-depression medication prescribed for major depression ; it has a half-life of [twelve] to [seventeen] hours, which is relatively long for such medications. To be effective the medication should be taken daily and requires a buildup period for efficacy. Given the long half-life the potential exists for a buildup of the drug that increases the risk of side effects hence careful monitoring of the medication is advisable as is close observation of the patient response to the medication. Side effects include: fatigue; drowsiness and sedation; double vision; crossed eyes; blurred vision; dizziness and lack of coordination; [i]nsomnia; impulsivity; anxiety; vivid dreams or nightmares; dry mouth, mouth ulcers ; memory problems; mood changes; itchiness; runny nose; cough ; and nausea. Use may also trigger panic attacks. Some patients have reported experiencing a loss of concentration, even with very small doses. Women are more likely than men to have side-effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b. Lamotrigine (Lamictal ) is prescribed for seizure disorders. On-set of effect ranges from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. It has a half-life of [twenty-nine] hours, which is relatively long for such medications. As is the case with [duloxetine (Cymbalta ) ] [due to] the long half-life the potential exists for a buildup of the drug that increases the risk of side effects hence careful monitoring of the medication is advisable as is close observation of the patient response to the medication. Lamotrigine is also an indicated medication option for the treatment of bipolar disorders. However, many clinicians also use it in patients with a (unipolar) depressive disorder who have not responded adequately to conventional antidepressants. Such usage would be considered \"off label.\" Side effects are similar to those of [d]uloxetine (Cymbalta ) and include: tremors, dizziness; tired feeling; blurred vision, double vision; loss of coordination; sleep problems. Given the risk of side effects patients should be carefully monitored\n   specifically when the medication is given along with other anti-depressants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   c. Lithium carbonate (Lithobid ) is prescribed principally for bi-polar depression. It may be used in cases where other forms of medications are not effective. In some case[s] of apparent major depression with fewer manic than depressive symptoms the drug may be used as an adjunctive therapy. Side effects include loss of balance or coordination, drowsiness or muscle weakness; hand tremors; confusion; memory problems; lack of awareness; blurred vision. Prescription of this medication requires frequent monitoring of blood to assure levels are within frequent therapeutic limits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   d. Trazadone is a medication used in the treatment of major depression. It may also be prescribed as a sleep aid. The medication has a bi-phasic half-life. The first phase ranges between [three] to [six] hours; subsequent phase range[s] between [five] and [nine] hours. Initial effectiveness occurs approximately one hour post ingestion. Side effects include: drowsiness and sedation; dizziness or loss of\n   balance; confusion; blurred vision; impairment of vigilance. Alcohol use will increase risk of sedation and other side effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   e. [Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride (Focalin ) ] is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant employed in treatment of ADD and [ADHD]. Side effects include: blurred vision; dizziness; drowsiness; agitation; heart palpitations. Special care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADD and ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder. The concern stems from the potential for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Before initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Prescription of these medications is contra-indicated for such individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   f. [Methylphenidate (Concerta )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] is a [CNS] stimulant employed in treatment of ADD and [ADHD]. Side effects include: blurred vision; dizziness; drowsiness; agitation; heart palpitations. Special care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADD and ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder. The concern stems from the potential for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Before initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Prescription of these medications is contra-indicated for such individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's second expert, Alberto M. Goldwaser, M.D., opined Lerner's treatment of B.M.D. \"fell outside the acceptable professional standards of care as they apply to the practice of neuropsychiatry/psychiatry, and such deviation was a significant contributing factor in causing the motor vehicle collision ... [that] resulted in the death of Ms. Judith Schrope.\" Goldwaser criticized Lerner for prescribing medication without an accompanying diagnosis and then prescribing additional medication to counteract negative side effects. Instead, Goldwaser opined Lerner should have treated B.M.D.'s underlying mental health issues rather than only treat her symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 11, 2018, after oral argument, the trial judge agreed with Lerner that because there was no connection between Lerner and Schrope, Lerner did not owe her a duty of care. The trial judge noted that many substances could render a driver sleepy and \"all of them are clearly marked with those kinds of warning[s].\" The judge also stated the record did not establish \"that [ ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [B.M.D.] was drunk or intoxicated.\" Thus, the trial judge granted Lerner's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff moved for leave to appeal, which we denied. The Supreme Court granted plaintiff's motion for leave to appeal and summarily remanded the case to us to review the May 11, 2018 order on the merits. On January 16, 2019, the American Medical Association and the Medical Society of New Jersey moved for leave to appear as amici curiae. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:13-9(a), we granted amici leave to file a brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff argues New Jersey law is ripe for an extension of a prescribing practitioner's duty of care and urges us to adopt the reasoning from other jurisdictions that a prescribing practitioner owes a duty to warn their patient of adverse side effects of medications for the benefit of third parties. For the reasons that follow, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[W]e review the trial court's grant of summary judgment de novo under the same standard as the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Templo Fuente De Vida Corp. v.

Based on our review of the record, we agree with the trial court's finding that B.M.D. was not impaired or intoxicated at the time of the crash. Plaintiff's expert reports to the contrary are based on conclusory\n   statements untethered to the observations of the police officers who interviewed B.M.D. at the scene. In our view, plaintiff's proofs of proximate cause amount to \"pure speculation or conjecture\" and would force the jury to hypothesize on whether B.M.D. was impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Goldwaser and Pandina opined that the medication B.M.D. took on the day of the crash compromised her ability to drive. Both experts based their opinion on: court records, B.M.D.'s and Lerner's deposition testimony, Lerner's treatment records,\n   pharmacy and laboratory records, a police report, B.M.D.'s statement to police and a crash reconstruction report. Pandina concluded B.M.D. ingested \"four (and possibly five) medications on the date of the collision including: [d]uloxetine (Cymbalta ), [lamotrigine ] (Lamictal ), [l]ithium carbonate (Lithobid ) and [dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride (Focalin ) ].\" Each of these medications carry side effects that, if experienced, may impair a person's ability to drive, including dizziness, sleepiness, blurred vision and loss of coordination. However, the record lacks any evidence B.M.D. was experiencing one or several of these side effects before, during or after the fatal crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B.M.D. provided a statement to police and acknowledged she took some, but not all, of her medications. In her deposition testimony, she admitted to ingesting Focalin on the morning of the crash and that it had, in the past, made her feel \"speedy.\" Yet, police at the scene declined to question her further on whether she was impaired by her medications. The police report does not describe her as exhibiting behaviors that might be consistent with the side effects of her medication, such as slurred words, squinting, lack of coordination or other observable symptoms. Moreover, B.M.D. was only charged with careless driving, not driving while intoxicated. Neither expert applied their expertise in neuropsychology, psychiatry or clinical psychopharmacology to prove how they knew B.M.D. was impaired even though no officer at the scene observed she was exhibiting symptoms consistent with the side effects of the medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pandina opined his conclusion was supported by the crash reconstruction. Prior to the crash, visibility was clear, no cars were approaching from the other direction and B.M.D. had room to safely pass Schrope. However, Pandina does not explain how B.M.D.'s actions were caused by the side effects of her medication. In part, Pandina based his conclusion on an assertion that B.M.D.'s description of the crash given at the scene was inconsistent with the reconstruction report. Yet, Pandina failed to offer any explanation as to why he believed B.M.D.'s inconsistent recollection was indicative of her impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Instead, both expert reports conclude that if B.M.D. ingested all the medication she was prescribed on the date of the crash, she could have experienced all of the debilitating side effects. However, this conclusion was not based on B.M.D.'s observable behavior at the time of the crash. As a result, the expert reports offer little more than conclusory assertions. Considering the record's lack of direct or circumstantial evidence indicating B.M.D. was impaired, the expert reports alone are insufficient to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of B.M.D.'s impaired driving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205938\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/36/#p60\">\n    221 N.J. at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205938\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/36/#p60\">\n    110 A.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A party's burden of proof on an element of a claim may not be satisfied by an expert opinion that is unsupported by the factual record or by an expert's speculation that contradicts that record.\");\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"755640\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/289/309/#p322\">\n    289 N.J.
