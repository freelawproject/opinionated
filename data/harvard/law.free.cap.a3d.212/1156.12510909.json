Wise raises two issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the trial court erred by holding that the real estate exception to what is commonly referred to as the Sovereign Immunity Act (Act)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not apply to Wise's claim that HACH was negligent by failing to provide adequate outdoor lighting; and (2) whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the outdoor lighting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 9, 2015, Wise filed the Complaint in the trial court, alleging that she fell at approximately 12:10 a.m. on May 9, 2013, while walking on a sidewalk in the Chestnut Terrace public housing complex (Chestnut Terrace) HACH owned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wise, a Chestnut Terrace resident, was returning home with her sister after visiting another resident when she fell. Although Wise alleges in her Complaint that \"insufficient lighting and demarcation of the ... sidewalk, and/or along with a defect within the sidewalk itself caused her to trip and fall, resulting in serious injuries[,]\" Wise admitted in a deposition that she did not see any defect of the sidewalk where she fell. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 10a. In a letter to HACH's counsel, Wise's attorney described the incident as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   [T]his accident took place near midnight, and the outside lighting at the housing development was poor, if not non-existent. While my client attempted to stay on the sidewalk that night to get to her car[,] she simply could not see to delineate the sidewalk from the ground, hit the edge of the sidewalk with her foot and rolled her ankle causing the fracture. Hence, the 'defect' so to speak with [sic] not with the sidewalk itself, but the inadequate outdoor lighting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   R.R. at 89a. Similarly, in her brief to this Court, Wise acknowledges that \"[she] testified that the area was dark, and her inability to see where she was going caused her to fall.\" Wise Br. at 5. According to Wise, light from an outdoor pole light located a \"significant distance\" from where she fell was the only light source, and the light was obstructed by a large tree. Wise Br. at 5. As a result, Wise contends she could not see the edge of the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 17, 2016, HACH filed the Motion, wherein it asserted that Wise's action was barred by the Act and governmental immunity. On February 10, 2017, the trial court granted the Motion, dismissed the action and entered judgment in HACH's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wise appealed from the trial court's dismissal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which transferred the action to this Court. The trial court filed its memorandum opinion pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a) (1925(a) Opinion) on April 21, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Wise argues that the trial court erred when it granted the Motion and concluded that the Act shields HACH from liability for Wise's negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Initially,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [s]ummary judgment will be entered only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and it is clear that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Summary judgment is proper in cases in which 'an adverse party who will bear the burden of proof at trial has failed to produce evidence of facts essential to a cause of action or defense in which a jury trial would require the issues be submitted to a jury.' [Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No.] 1035.2(2). We view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

In\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , a driver stopped along the berm of a road. The driver and passengers were unaware that a strip mine was located directly adjacent to the berm. Several passengers left the vehicle, climbed an embankment located outside the right-of-way and fell into the strip mine. One passenger died, and three others were severely injured. Three of the passengers sued the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (DER) (now the Department of Environmental Protection), alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that DOT and DER had failed to warn the public of the strip mine either by lighting the area, or by erecting a barrier along the right-of-way. The common pleas court granted summary judgment because sovereign immunity barred the action. This Court reversed on appeal, concluding that the plaintiffs had pled facts sufficient to establish a dangerous condition. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the term \"\n   <strong>\n    dangerous condition of Commonwealth agency real estate\n   </strong>\n   ,\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4), and reasoned: \"These key words indicate that a dangerous condition\n   <strong>\n    must derive, originate from or have as its source the Commonwealth realty\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818972\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/424/\">\n    562 A.2d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Regarding the first factor, the Court explained that \"[t]he term 'dangerous condition' is unambiguous and plainly encompasses any condition that presents a danger.

Moreover, the defective guardrail is not the kind of obvious condition a possessor of land should expect an invitee to discover independently.

The trial court denied the summary judgment motion, but permitted SEPTA to file an interlocutory appeal to this Court. On review, this Court first concluded that Donnelly could not establish a common law cause of action against SEPTA. Further, this Court concluded that the Act's real estate exception did not apply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Liability under the real estate exception depends, first, on the legal determination that an injury was caused by a condition\n   <em>\n    of government realty itself\n   </em>\n   , deriving, originating from, or having the realty as its source, and, only then, the factual determination that the condition was dangerous.

Because the highwall was some distance from the edge of the Commonwealth right-of-way, the Supreme Court held that the absence of lighting on the Commonwealth property was neither an artificial condition of nor defect in the land itself. However, in the present case, the absence of lighting in the fire stairwell\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   clearly on the [PHA's] property, and the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   is not applicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   , 623 A.2d at 903 (citation omitted).

She further argues that\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   support her assertion that whether inadequate lighting constitutes a dangerous condition of Commonwealth property is a question for the fact finder, and, accordingly, the trial court erred when it dismissed her Complaint. In addition, Wise asserts that because both the obscured light and the sidewalk from which she fell were Commonwealth property, her situation is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Initially, this Court emphasizes\n   <strong>\n    the distinction between the duty of care a Commonwealth agency owes to those using its property, and the sovereign immunity defense.\n   </strong>\n   Sovereign immunity bars an action against the Commonwealth\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     even where the Commonwealth has breached its duty\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to those using its property, so long as an exception to sovereign immunity does not apply. Thus, Wise may credibly argue that the Commonwealth breached its duty because the \"condition of the property [was not] safe for the activities for which it [was] regularly used, intended to be used or reasonably foreseen to be used[,]\" since it was foreseeable that the property would be used at night.\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818972\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/424/\">\n    562 A.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that such is true,\n   <strong>\n    the Commonwealth's breach of its duty does not remove the sovereign immunity bar precluding Wise's action against the Commonwealth, unless she establishes that her claim comes within one of the exceptions\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See Manning.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   , factual questions existed regarding whether the missing bannister and defective lights were fixtures, and if so, were a dangerous condition of Commonwealth realty. Here, Wise does not claim that the pole light was inoperable or that it did not light the area directly adjacent to and below it - only that the pole light was a significant distance away from where she fell, the light therefrom was obscured by a tree, and there was insufficient lighting in the area where she fell. Wise does not contend that during daylight hours the Commonwealth realty is in any manner defective. In addition, Wise does not assert that the tree directly injured her. Nor does she aver that she fell into the tree or that the tree fell on her. In fact, Wise does not allege that the tree was defective in any way; only that its location obstructed the light coming from the pole light. Rather,\n   <strong>\n    Wise claims that the darkness caused her fall\n   </strong>\n   . She argues that the defect of the Commonwealth's property was that there was darkness at the location where she fell, notwithstanding that darkness is a natural exterior condition at midnight (the time of her fall).\n   <strong>\n    Wise's characterization of the defect as insufficient lighting due to a tree on the property obstructing the pole light's illumination, ignores that, but for the natural nighttime darkness, there is no alleged defect\n   </strong>\n   , i.e., the property only becomes allegedly defective when there is insufficient natural light. In other\n   words,\n   <strong>\n    Wise's complaint is that the Commonwealth failed to alter the natural state of nighttime darkness\n   </strong>\n   which, thereby, caused her fall. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   are also distinguishable in that, here, Wise asserts that either a defect existed\n   <strong>\n    because\n   </strong>\n   an allegedly necessary fixture - additional lighting -\n   <strong>\n    should have been installed\n   </strong>\n   , or a tree (that was not itself defective)\n   <strong>\n    should have been removed\n   </strong>\n   since, according to Wise,\n   <strong>\n    it obstructed artificial light from illuminating a naturally dark exterior area at midnight\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This Court contrasts Wise's allegations with the situations in\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   wherein the enclosed building stairwell blocked natural light causing the artificial condition of darkness, and plaintiffs alleged that the housing authority failed to ensure that the lights which were installed to cure the artificially dark area were operative. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   , where\n   <strong>\n    the lack of natural light was caused by the enclosed stairwell structures\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   here, the lack of\n   <em>\n    exterior\n   </em>\n   light naturally occurs at night. Wise cannot contend that the nighttime darkness was caused by the Commonwealth realty. Rather, she asserts that the Commonwealth should have taken steps to ameliorate the darkness on its property at midnight. In\n   <em>\n    Page v.

Thus, Wise contends that\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    is directly applicable to the instant matter and binding precedent. There is nothing in\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    describing the stairwell as being on the outside of the building. Wise simply presumes such on the basis that, according to Wise, a\n    <strong>\n     fire\n    </strong>\n    stairwell is \"designed to provide safe egress during a building fire.\" A review of\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    reveals that there is no description, representation or any other indication that the stairs were outside. The\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    Court described the fall location as an \"unlit fire\n    <strong>\n     stairwell\n    </strong>\n    [\n    <strong>\n     ,\n    </strong>\n    ]\"\n    <strong>\n     not\n    </strong>\n    a fire escape.\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    , 623 A.2d at 902 (emphasis added). Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2004) (Merriam-Webster's) defines \"stairwell\" as a \"vertical shaft in which stairs are located.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1214. Further, Merriam-Webster's defines \"shaft,\" in relevant part, as \"a vertical opening or passage\n    <strong>\n     through\n    </strong>\n    the floors of a building.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1142 (emphasis added). Thus, based on the\n    <em>\n     Floyd\n    </em>\n    Court's description, the stairwell was in the interior of the building.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
