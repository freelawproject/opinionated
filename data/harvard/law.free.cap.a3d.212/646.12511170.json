(Yellow Cab), and Vito Bochicchio, Jr., the sole shareholder of Yellow Cab, seeking damages for serious injuries she sustained when she was struck by a taxicab that had been stolen from Sainval by two teenagers after Sainval left the vehicle unattended with the key in the ignition in a Norwalk neighborhood known to have a higher than average crime rate. A jury trial ensued at which the defendants claimed, inter alia, that the conduct of the two thieves was a superseding cause that relieved Sainval of any liability to the plaintiff for his alleged negligence. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury, in response to interrogatories submitted to it by the trial court, found that Sainval was negligent in leaving the taxicab unattended with the key in the ignition; that, in light of the surrounding neighborhood, it was reasonably foreseeable that the vehicle would be stolen and operated in an unsafe manner; and that Sainval's negligence was a proximate cause of some or all of the plaintiff's injuries. The jury also found, nevertheless, that the defendants were not liable for the plaintiff's injuries because the accident that occurred was not within the scope of the risk created by Sainval's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial claiming, inter alia, that the jury's finding that Sainval's negligence constituted a proximate cause of the accident was legally inconsistent with its finding that the accident was outside the scope of the risk created by Sainval's negligence. The court denied the motion and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that (1) it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury on the doctrine of superseding cause, (2) even if the\n   doctrine were properly submitted to the jury, the court's instructions and interrogatories misled the jury, and (3) the trial court improperly denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial on the ground that the jury's verdict was irreconcilable with its responses\n   to the interrogatories.\n   <em>\n    Snell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk Yellow Cab, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489529\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/787/#p41\">\n    172 Conn.

Although we answer the first question in the affirmative, we answer the second in the negative and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history. \"On December 3, 2009, Sainval, who was employed by Yellow Cab as a taxicab driver, was operating a taxicab owned by Yellow Cab in Norwalk. In the early evening, he drove the taxicab to Monterey Village, a housing complex located in an area of the city with significant criminal activity. Sainval parked the taxicab and went inside one of the apartments, leaving the taxicab unlocked and unattended with the keys in the ignition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Two teenagers, Shaquille Johnson and Deondre Bowden, who that afternoon had been consuming alcohol and smoking marijuana, noticed the parked taxicab. Although they initially intended to steal anything of\n   value that they could find inside the unlocked taxicab, once they observed the keys in the ignition, the two teens decided to steal the taxicab and to go on a 'joy-ride.' They drove the taxicab from Norwalk to Stamford, making one brief stop in between, with each of the teens taking a turn driving the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"When they reached Stamford, they [encountered] traffic. At that time, Bowden was driving the taxicab. He 'kind of nodded off' and rear-ended the vehicle in front of him. Bowden, who was both 'tipsy' and 'high,' then attempted to flee the scene. In order to maneuver the taxicab around the vehicle he had struck, Bowden drove the taxicab up over the curb of the road and onto the adjoining sidewalk. In doing so, Bowden first hit a fire hydrant before striking the plaintiff with the taxicab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The plaintiff sustained severe physical injuries, particularly to her midsection, requiring millions of dollars in medical expenditures as of the time of trial, with additional treatments and surgeries expected. After hitting the plaintiff, Bowden never attempted to stop the vehicle; he and Johnson exited the stolen taxicab while it was still moving and fled the scene on foot, returning home by train. The police later identified the teens as the individuals involved in the hit and run of the plaintiff and arrested them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The plaintiff initially commenced this action solely against Sainval and Yellow Cab.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Johnson and Bowden\n   were not\n   named by the plaintiff as defendants in the civil action. Although the defendants filed an apportionment complaint against the two teens, the court later granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the apportionment complaint, agreeing with the plaintiff that apportionment was unavailable in the present case because the misconduct of the teenagers was not pleaded as mere negligence but as reckless or intentional conduct. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) ('there shall be no apportionment of liability or damages between parties liable for negligence and parties liable on any basis other than negligence including, but not limited to, intentional, wanton or reckless misconduct');\n   <em>\n    Allard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Liberty Oil Equipment Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545367\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/787/#p801\">\n    253 Conn. 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20237\">\n    756 A.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (recognizing that \u00a7 52-575h [o] was enacted to expressly overrule in part\n   <em>\n    Bhinder\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sun Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"245260\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/246/223/#p234\">\n    246 Conn. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%20202\">\n    717 A.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1998], in which [this court] had recognized [common-law] extension of statutory apportionment liability for parties whose conduct was reckless, wilful and wanton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The operative second amended complaint contains two counts relevant to the issues on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count one sounds in negligence against Sainval. According to the plaintiff, Sainval acted negligently by leaving his taxicab in an unguarded public parking lot in a high crime area with the keys in the ignition, which created the reasonably foreseeable risk that the taxicab would be stolen and that a thief would drive the taxicab in an\n   unsafe manner and cause injury to a person or to property. Count two alleges that Yellow Cab was vicariously liable for Sainval's negligence on a theory of respondeat superior. Prior to trial, Yellow Cab conceded that it would be liable to the same extent that Sainval was found liable on count one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"In their amended answer, the defendants, by way of a special defense, raised the doctrine of superseding cause. The defendants pleaded that, '[i]f the plaintiff sustained the injuries and losses as alleged in her complaint, said injuries and losses were the result of the intentional, criminal, reckless and/or negligent conduct of a third party, which intervened to break the chain of causation between [Sainval's] alleged negligence and/or carelessness and the plaintiff's alleged injuries and losses.' \" (Footnotes altered; footnote in original, footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Snell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk Yellow Cab, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489529\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/787/#p41\">\n    172 Conn.

The court suggested that the exception was not at issue in the present case because, under the plaintiff's theory of liability, the intervening theft of the car was entirely foreseeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The defendants, however, argued that the court was focusing on the wrong criminal act. They indicated that it was not necessarily the theft of the taxicab in this case that warranted an instruction on superseding cause but the unforeseeability of the thieves' subsequent criminal\n   conduct, namely, intentionally driving the taxicab up onto a sidewalk to evade responsibility for a rear-end collision and the ensuing criminal assault on the plaintiff. Furthermore, the defendants noted that part of the court's rationale in\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   for abandoning the doctrine of superseding cause in cases alleging that an intervening negligent act or acts contributed to a plaintiff's injuries was that apportionment of liability between tortfeasors was permitted, which would prevent a less culpable defendant from inequitably shouldering full responsibility for injuries that resulted from multiple negligent acts. The defendants contended that, unlike\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   , this case involved intervening actions of other tortfeasors that were not merely negligent but reckless and criminal. In such a case, the defendants argued, apportionment of liability is unavailable by statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ) ; and, thus, the primary policy rationale underlying the abolishment of the doctrine of superseding cause was absent. The court indicated that it would review the case law and give the issue further consideration in light of these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[Subsequently], the court provided counsel with the latest draft of its jury instructions and also with copies of draft interrogatories that the court intended to submit to the jury. The court indicated that the current version of the instructions included a new paragraph that the court had decided to add after further consideration of the case law concerning superseding cause and its discussions with the parties. That paragraph instructed the jury to consider whether the theft of the taxicab and the resulting accident involved intentional acts that were outside the scope of the risk created by Sainval's conduct, and that if the jury found this to be so, then the defendants should not be found responsible for the plaintiff's injuries because the conduct of the two teens would have been the proximate cause of those injuries, thus relieving the defendants of any liability. The court\n   also drafted a new, related interrogatory that asked the jury to state whether the 'accident' that occurred was outside the scope of the risk created by Sainval's act of leaving the keys in the ignition of the taxicab. The court directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants if the answer to that inquiry was yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Following the close of evidence later that day, the court held a charging conference. At the charging conference, the plaintiff stated that it believed the additional paragraph added by the court to its latest draft instructions was unnecessary and confusing and that, in defining and explaining the concept of proximate cause, the court adequately had covered both foreseeability and whether Sainval's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff also stated that she did not think there was any evidence from which the jury could construe that the teens had intentionally sought to harm her. The court suggested that the additional instruction was necessary to comport with case law, referring in particular to\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Metro-North Commuter Railroad Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146117\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/150/\">\n    292 Conn. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=971%20A.2d%20676\">\n    971 A.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). It indicated its belief that foreseeability for purposes of determining negligence and scope of the risk for purposes of applying superseding cause, although closely related, were slightly different concepts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court agreed that there was nothing in\n   the record to support a finding that the assault on the plaintiff was intentional but noted that the two teens had also engaged in other criminal conduct, including intentionally stealing the taxicab and intentionally fleeing the scene to evade responsibility after striking the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The defendants noted that, although the court's proposed jury instruction made reference to a special defense, it never identified that defense; in fact, the term 'superseding cause' was never used by the court. The defendants argued that they intended to reference that term in ... closing arguments and that they were entitled to a separate charge addressing their superseding cause defense. The defendants also took the position that, unlike in criminal law, tort law made no meaningful distinction between reckless and intentional conduct, and, thus, they asserted that it was inconsequential whether the criminal assault on the plaintiff was the result of intentional or reckless conduct for purposes of applying the doctrine of superseding cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"On December 11, 2014, prior to closing arguments, the plaintiff requested that the court change the order of the proposed interrogatories. The interrogatory that the court had added regarding scope of the risk, which the court indicated related to the special defense of superseding cause, was, at the time, interrogatory number four. Interrogatory number five at that time asked whether the plaintiff had proven that some or all of her injuries were proximately caused by Sainval. The plaintiff argued that because proximate cause was an element of her prima facie case, it made more sense for the jury to answer that interrogatory and fully establish a prima facie case before turning to any consideration\n   of a special defense. According to the plaintiff, this would also negate the need for a retrial in the event there was a defendants' verdict on the special defense that was overturned later on appeal; all that would be required would be a hearing in damages. The defendants did not agree that a switch was necessary. The court nevertheless indicated that it would most likely make the switch and later incorporated the change in the interrogatories it submitted to the jury. The court also indicated that it had made some additional changes based [on] the positions of the parties at the charging conference, including referring to the doctrine of superseding cause by name.\n   \"After the parties concluded their closing arguments, the court read its instructions to the jury. The relevant portions of the court's instructions for purposes of the present appeal are those addressing proximate causation, which provided in relevant part as follows: 'Once you've gotten past factual causation, you need to address proximate cause. Proximate cause means that there must be a sufficient causal connection between the act or omission alleged, and any injury or damage sustained by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \" 'An act or omission is a proximate cause if it was a substantial factor in bringing about or actually causing the injury. That is, if the injury or damage was a direct result, or a reasonable and probable consequence of the defendant's act or omission, it was proximately caused by such an act or omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \" 'In other words, if an act had such an effect in producing the injury that reasonable persons would regard it as being a cause of the injury, then the act or omission is a proximate cause. In order to recover damages for any injury, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that such injury would not have occurred without the negligence of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \" 'If you find that the plaintiff complains about an injury which would have occurred even in the absence of the defendant's conduct, or is not causally connected to this accident, you must find that the defendant did not proximately cause that injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \" 'Under the definitions I have given you, negligent conduct can be a proximate cause of an injury, if it is not the only cause, or even the most significant cause of the injury, provided it contributes materially to the production of the injury, and thus is a substantial factor in bringing it about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \" 'Therefore, when a defendant's negligence combines together with one or more other causes to produce an injury, such negligence is a proximate cause of the injury if its contribution to the production of the injury, in comparison to all other causes, is material or substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \" 'When, however, some other causal causes contributes so powerfully to the production of an injury, as to make the defendant's negligent contribution to the injury merely trivial or inconsequential, the defendant's negligence must be rejected as a proximate cause of the injury, for it has not been a substantial factor in bringing the injury about.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \" 'Or to put it another way, if you find that the injury would have been sustained, whether or not the defendant had been negligent, his negligence would not have been a proximate cause of the accident.

The plaintiff argues that, under this state's well established precedent-precedent on which the trial court's jury instructions were predicated-if Sainval's negligence proximately caused some or all of the plaintiff's injuries, then the accident was, by definition, within the scope of the risk created by his negligence.

Specifically, the plaintiff argues that, \"under \u00a7 442 B, in order for another force to relieve the defendant of liability, that force must be both (1) intentionally caused by a third person and (2) not within the scope of the risk.\" To be sure, this court has applied \u00a7 442 B in cases in which a defendant has claimed that his\n   or her negligence was superseded by the intentionally harmful acts of a third party.

As we explained, however, the terminology employed by the Restatement (Second) and by this court in explaining the doctrine are materially different. In particular, under the Restatement (Second), negligent conduct that is\n   <em>\n    found to be a proximate cause of the injuries sustained\n   </em>\n   may nevertheless be rendered so relatively inconsequential in light of a later superseding cause that that superseding cause is deemed to relieve the original tortfeasor of liability. Under our precedent, by contrast, a finding that conduct constitutes a superseding cause renders\n   the original negligence so insignificant in relation to that superseding cause that the original negligence cannot be deemed to be a proximate cause of the injuries. Thus, our precedent simply does not contemplate a situation in which the original negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in producing the injuries if there is a finding of a superseding\n   cause. Indeed, we consistently have described a superseding cause as an intervening force that \"\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    an act of negligence of the defendant from being a substantial factor in producing a plaintiff's injury\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653094\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/312/#p335\">\n    262 Conn. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20A.2d%201003\">\n    813 A.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Virelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Benhattie, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1581778\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/146/203/#p209\">\n    146 Conn. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20A.2d%20760\">\n    148 A.2d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959) (\"the determination whether negligence of [a third party] was such a superseding cause\n   <em>\n    as to prevent the antecedent negligence of the defendant from being a substantial factor in producing the plaintiff's injuries\n   </em>\n   was essential to a finding [of superseding cause]\" [emphasis added] );\n   <em>\n    Colligan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1609309\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/129/26/#p30\">\n    129 Conn. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20A.2d%20231\">\n    26 A.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942) (same).

Under our law, the intervention of such a superseding cause prevents the defendant from being held liable for the plaintiff's injury on the theory that, due to such superseding cause, the defendant did not legally cause the injury even though (his/her) negligence was a substantial factor in bringing the injury about.

Because such intentionally harmful (conduct/force of nature/criminal event), if unforeseeable by the defendant, would constitute a superseding cause of the plaintiff's alleged injury if it occurred as claimed by the defendant and if it proximately caused the plaintiff's injury, the plaintiff must disprove at least one essential element of that claim by a fair preponderance of the evidence in order to prove that the defendant legally caused that injury. The plaintiff can meet this burden by proving either 1) that the conduct claimed to constitute a superseding cause did not occur as claimed by the defendant, either because it did not occur at all or because it was not engaged in with the intent to cause harm; or 2) that such conduct was foreseeable by the defendant, in that the injury in question was within the scope of the risk created by the defendant's conduct; or 3) that such conduct was not a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's alleged injury. These, of course, are questions of fact for you to determine based on the evidence. Keep in mind, however, that the defendant does not have any burden to prove the existence of a superseding cause.

As we explain more fully in part II of this opinion, under our case law, a finding that conduct constitutes a superseding cause renders the original negligence so insignificant in relation to that superseding cause that the original negligence cannot be deemed to be a proximate cause of the injuries and, therefore, cannot be deemed to be a substantial factor in producing the injuries.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    We note that the plaintiff urges us to adopt \u00a7 34 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts, published in 2010, which she asserts \"merges the viable concepts related to superseding cause (foreseeability and proximate cause) officially into a [single] proximate cause (or scope of liability) analysis without the confusion and prejudice related to use of the superseding cause doctrine.\" Section 34 of the Restatement (Third) provides: \"When a force of nature or an independent act is also a factual cause of harm, an actor's liability is limited to those harms that result from the risks that made the actor's conduct tortious.\" 1 Restatement (Third), Torts, Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a7 34, p. 569 (2010). Because the plaintiff did not raise this claim in either the trial court or the Appellate Court, it is not properly before us. Even if it were, however, as the Appellate Court noted, our recent case law \"reflects a jurisprudential move toward embracing\" the more modern approach to superseding cause prescribed in \u00a7 34 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts.\n    <em>\n     Snell\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Norwalk Yellow Cab, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489529\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/787/#p41\">\n     172 Conn.

I write separately for two reasons. First, and most significantly, I am troubled by the unnecessary and unfortunate prolixity of our superseding cause doctrine, or what remains of it. I understand that the majority is unable completely to escape the gravitational pull of existing doctrine, because the court's ability to chart a new course, even with respect to the common law, is constrained by the arguments raised by the parties, who themselves are constrained by the perceived limitations imposed by our own precedent. In my view, the majority opinion nonetheless makes progress, incomplete but not insignificant, toward a more sensible and simplified doctrine. This concurring opinion primarily is intended to highlight the particular aspects of the majority opinion that I believe can be built on in future cases so that the job of doctrinal reconstruction\n   might be completed. The second reason I write is to note my disagreement with two minor points contained in the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The confusion generated by the superseding cause doctrine is easier to identify than to resolve. Causation, while a simple everyday word, is by no means a simple concept, in law or elsewhere, and its application to various questions of legal liability and damages has vexed our profession for at least the past one hundred years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That vexation is reflected in an unruly doctrine\n   marked by a proliferation of varying, partly overlapping, and partly incommensurable verbal formulations, none of which quite satisfies the powerful desire to capture the elusive concept in words.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The doctrine of superseding cause is marked by this confusion, and the tradition of stacking one unsatisfactory formulation on top of another has resulted in a jury instruction that requires an advanced degree in logic and linguistics to understand. A jury is subjected to wave after wave of abstractions like foreseeability, scope of the risk, proximate cause, substantial, material, trivial, relatively insignificant, and inconsequential causes, concurrent causes, overpowering events, and so forth, connected by unhelpful transitional phrases such as \"[i]n other words,\" \"[t]hat is,\" and \"[t]o put it another way.\" It does no one any good to perpetuate a doctrine of this character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The majority has done admirable work clarifying doctrinal connections, resolving doctrinal tensions, sorting through conflicting authorities, and bringing the light of common sense to its subject matter. Yet even after that work has been accomplished, the reader would be forgiven if he or she feels unprepared to submit a model jury instruction to replace Connecticut Civil Jury Instruction 3.1-5. If the doctrine remains challenging for lawyers and judges, moreover, one can only imagine what a lay jury will make of it. Perhaps the guidance\n   provided by the majority opinion will help produce more reliable trial outcomes in the future than the verdict in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As I have indicated,\n   I believe that the majority has laid the groundwork to assist in the reconstruction of a simplified and more coherent doctrine. I wish to identify three principles in particular that may be especially useful in that endeavor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, the majority has clarified that the fundamental principle animating the doctrine of superseding cause is that a negligent actor will not be relieved of liability by the intervention of another force-in most cases, the reckless or intentional misconduct of a third party-if the type of harm sustained by the plaintiff is within the scope of the risk that made the actor's conduct negligent. This basic insight, in my opinion, best identifies the critical operative principle underlying the doctrine of superseding cause in terms that can be understood and applied without inordinate difficulty. As the majority notes, the Restatement (Third) of Torts evidently has reached this conclusion in its treatment of superseding cause by abandoning the traditional doctrine in favor of an analysis fundamentally based on a scope of the risk analysis. See footnote 12 of the majority opinion; see also 1 Restatement (Third), Torts, Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a7 34, p. 569 (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   My preliminary view, as yet untested in the adjudicatory setting in Connecticut to the best of my knowledge, is that the reformulated approach to causation set forth in the Restatement (Third) may hold promise. Time will tell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, just as under ordinary negligence rules, the defendant is liable for harm as long as his or her negligence was a substantial factor in producing it, even if the defendant did not foresee, nor reasonably could have foreseen, the extent of the harm or the particular manner in which it occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for example, the fact that the harm is brought about by the criminal or reckless act of a third party will not cut off the negligent party's liability if harm of the same general nature is within the scope of the risk that made the party's act or omission negligent. See footnotes 17 and 18 and accompanying text of the majority opinion; see also footnote 3 of this concurring opinion; 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 442 B, p. 469 (1965). This principle serves as a complement to the one discussed in the preceding paragraph because its application also hinges on the scope of the risk. The principle is important in the present context because intervening intentional or reckless conduct not infrequently results in harm that may be unusual in\n   degree or manner of infliction but nevertheless is within the scope of the risk that made the actor negligent. See 2 Restatement (Second), supra,\n   \u00a7\u00a7 448 and 449, pp. 480-484; see also 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 34, comment (d), p. 572.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Third, the possibility remains that the explicit equivalency the majority emphasizes between the doctrines of superseding cause and sole proximate cause may contain the seed for future development of a simplified doctrine. The majority makes a persuasive case that this court's repeated references to superseding cause as equivalent to sole proximate cause is not the result of loose language but actually means what it says: if a third party's conduct amounts to a superseding cause of a plaintiff's harm, then it is the sole proximate cause of that harm, and the negligent defendant is not a proximate cause at all. The question therefore arises why the superseding cause doctrine is needed at all, that is, why not simply ask the jury in such a case whether the intervening force was the sole proximate cause of the harm? It seems to me that this is a question worth asking, although I have no view about how it should be answered because it was neither raised nor briefed by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   My disagreement with the majority involves two minor aspects of its opinion. First, I see no reason to engage in the analysis appearing in footnote 10 of the majority opinion, which contains an extensive, and I\n   believe unnecessary, discussion regarding\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soneco/Northeastern, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733335\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/20/#p37\">\n    287 Conn. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%20839\">\n    946 A.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   involved the unusual situation in which there were two potentially negligent actors responsible for the plaintiff's injuries, but one of them, the plaintiff's employer, could not be brought into the case for apportionment purposes because it enjoyed immunity from liability under the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%20839\">\n    946 A.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a). This court held that the defendant, although precluded from seeking apportionment against the nonparty employer, was entitled to point to the employer as the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm;\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soneco/Northeastern, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 37-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%20839\">\n    946 A.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   but was not entitled to invoke the doctrine of superseding cause to accomplish the same purpose under this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Quality Steel Products, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"655920\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/263/424/\">\n    263 Conn. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=820%20A.2d%20258\">\n    820 A.2d 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soneco/Northeastern, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 41-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20A.2d%20839\">\n    946 A.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority criticizes this aspect of\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   on the ground that its holding (1) relies on a misreading of\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   , (2) conflicts with this court's subsequent holding in\n   <em>\n    Sapko\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20360\">\n    305 Conn. 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20A.3d%20827\">\n    44 A.3d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), which held that the doctrine of superseding cause was applicable to a claim brought under the Workers' Compensation Act, and (3) creates a doctrinal \"distinction without a difference\" because the permitted defense of sole proximate cause and the precluded defense of superseding cause essentially\n   mean the same thing. See footnote 10 of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   My concern here is not with the substance of the majority's criticism of the\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   analysis as it relates to\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   and the doctrines of sole proximate cause and superseding cause; it seems clear to me that\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   misreads\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   . My point, rather, is that the current status of\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   is not before us, and the context of that case is sufficiently unusual that I do not believe that we should suggest any corrections to its holding until we are presented with a live controversy raising the particular issues and considerations implicated by that unusual setting. Perhaps, as the majority appears to suggest,\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   went off course by holding that the defendant was not entitled to raise a defense on the basis of superseding cause. But there are other possibilities as well, and I believe that we should not indicate a view on the subject in the present case because the scenario in\n   <em>\n    Archambault\n   </em>\n   is different and may be sui generis; see footnote 6 of this concurring opinion; and because the proper treatment of that scenario has not been briefed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, although I agree with the majority's conclusion that the existing model civil jury instruction on superseding cause; see Connecticut Civil Jury Instructions 3.1-5, available at http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/Civil/Civil.pdf (last visited August 5, 2019); provides an erroneous statement of the law and, therefore, does not assist the plaintiff's argument, I wish to add my gloss to ensure that the majority's message is not misunderstood as a wholesale disavowal of the model instructions. Although the model civil jury instructions are \"not intended to be authoritative\";\n   <em>\n    Snell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Norwalk Yellow Cab, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489529\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/787/#p41\">\n    172 Conn. App. 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489529\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/158/787/#p41\">\n    158 A.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ; in the sense that they come with no guarantee of infallibility, we also must acknowledge and embrace the fundamental fact that, as a matter of routine practice\n   around the state, the model instructions are heavily relied on by trial lawyers and judges in most cases, certainly those garden variety cases being tried every day in virtually every courthouse hosting civil jury trials. In my view, the reminder of fallibility served today should not be understood to convey the view that the model instructions generally are unreliable, or that we lack confidence in them, or that the instructions should not continue to be relied on by trial lawyers and judges as containing an accurate statement of the law. The instructions are promulgated by a distinguished panel of committee members who have undertaken the Sisyphean task of synthesizing and articulating the law governing a broad variety of civil cases in a form readily understandable to a lay jury. They provide commendable guidance. But precisely because the task is so difficult-the law is not always certain, nor is it static, nor is it always produced or pronounced in \"one size fits all\" formulations-it\n   is fair to suggest that trial lawyers are well advised to \"trust but verify\" these model instructions to ensure that they are correct, current, and properly crafted to fit the particular case at hand. This case presents one of those highly unusual situations in which one of our model civil jury instructions contains an error and, thus, illustrates why eternal vigilance is the watchword of our sometimes unforgiving profession. Fortunately, the inaccuracy was of no practical consequence here, because the parties did not rely on Connecticut Civil Jury Instruction 3.1-5 governing superseding cause at trial, and the trial court did not issue the inaccurate instruction. Going forward, the bench and bar are on notice of the inaccuracy contained in the existing version of Connecticut Civil Jury Instruction 3.1-5, and, undoubtedly, the Civil Jury Instruction Committee will rectify the inaccuracy by promulgating a new and improved version in due course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    See W.

On the other hand, the potentially at-fault nonparty in\n    <em>\n     Archambault\n    </em>\n    is not subject to apportionment as a \"settled or released [person]\" pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-572h (f) (4) and (n).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
