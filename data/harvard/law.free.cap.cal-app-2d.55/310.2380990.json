The complaint alleged that plaintiffs were the owners of said property, that defendants claimed ownership thereof but did not own the same or have any interest therein. The answer alleged that defendants were owners of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The facts were either admitted or established by uncontradicted evidence. Leonard W. Corbett died on May 24, 1940, leaving an estate of the value of approximately $200,000. The plaintiffs are daughter and son of a brother of Ida Hardison Corbett, the deceased wife of Leonard W. Corbett. The defendants are the executors of the will of Leonard W. Corbett. .</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">By the decree of distribution in the estate of Ida Hardison Corbett, deceased, the plaintiffs were awarded interests of five-eighths and three-eighths, respectively, in 877 shares of Union Oil Company stock, subject to a life estate in Leonard W. Corbett. That life estate had been terminated and the ownership of said 877 shares is not involved herein, but this reference to those shares is made in order that there may be a proper understanding of statements concerning them which appear in certain letters hereinafter mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">On August 25, 1938, Leonard W. Corbett signed his name in the presence of a witness on the back of each of the thirteen certificates (representing in the aggregate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>1168 shares of stock) at the place provided in the printed blank form on the back thereof for assignment and transfer of the shares of stock. On each of said certificates, in said printed blank form on the back thereof, at the place designated for the name of the assignee, the names of the plaintiffs appeared in typewriting. On each of said certificates the following appeared: \u201cFor Value received, I hereby sell, assign and transfer unto Aura D. and Harvey C. Hardison ................................................ Shares of the Capital Stock represented by the within Certificate, and do hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint ................................................ Attorney to transfer the said stock on the books of the within named Company with full power of substitution in the premises. Dated, Aug 25th 1938. Leonard. W. Corbett In Presence of Fred Brown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">After endorsing said certificates in such manner, Leonard W. Corbett put them in an envelope and wrote on the envelope in his handwriting \u201cAura D. and Harvey C. Hardison,\u201d and placed such envelope in his safe deposit box in a bank, where it with the enclosed certificates was found after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Leonard W. Corbett was known to the plaintiffs as \u201cUncle Len.\u201d He wrote six letters in his handwriting to plaintiffs which, in the parts essential to the question involved herein, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">(1) . \u201cMay llth/38 My dear Aura\u2014After getting entirely out of debt last fall\u2014and I am sure happy to say so; I began picking up Union Oil shares, when I though_ the price was O K for you and Harvey after I go-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">\u201cI also looked into the matter of how to go about it, without paying big Lawyers fees, so I came to the conclusion that an endorsement of the back of the certificate was the best and leaving it in the Box in the Bank- Today the number of shares is 1500-The last I bought amounted to nearly $13,000. ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-16\">\u201cThis was all done without consulting any one, and if it does not meet with your approval\u2014ju.st let me know.

Uncle Len\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">Mr. Corbett made a will on April 2, 1936, (about two years prior to writing the letters above mentioned concerning the Union Oil stock) in which he devised certain real property to respondents. The stock involved here, was acquired after the will was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\">All of the dividends paid on the stock from the time of purchase to the time of the death of Mr. Corbett were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ceived by him and credited to him in his books of account. At the time of his death the certificates of stock were in Mr. Corbett\u2019s safe deposit box in the Bank of America at Ventura. A key to the box was in a safe at the home of Mr. Corbett and another key to the box was in his pocketbook, at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The above letters, the special endorsements of the certificates assigning them to plaintiffs, and the conduct of Mr. Corbett show clearly that it was his intention that the plaintiffs have the stock. Appellants concede that such was Mr. Corbett\u2019s intention. They assert, however, that more than an intention was required; that there must have been such positive intention and statement as to effect a present transfer of title; that Mr. Corbett did not constitute himself trustee for plaintiffs; that the transaction was an imperfect gift, and equity will not give effect to an imperfect gift by enforcing it as a trust, since to do so would be to give effect to an intention not contemplated by the maker of the alleged gift; and that the language of the letters did not constitute a present declaration of trust, but shows a contrary purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In support of the assertion that Mr. Corbett did not consider that he had placed the certificates out of or beyond his power to retain them for himself, appellants rely on language in the letters as follows: that he bought the stock \u201cfor you and Harvey after I go\u201d; that he bought the stock at 18 and the price increased to 21% \u201cand while I could sell and make quite a nice profit I did not buy it for that purpose\u201d; and \u201cYou may have to pay a state inheritance on it unless the present law is changed. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The statement that he bought the stock for plaintiffs \u201cafter I go\u201d is consistent with an intention to retain a life estate in the stock and receive the dividends therefrom. The words that he \u201ccould sell and make quite a nice profit,\u201d standing alone, do indicate that he considered that it was within his power to sell the stock. When those words are considered, however, with the remainder of that sentence, \u201cI did not buy it for that purpose,\u201d and when considered with the two sentences next following, \u201cI bought it for dividends while I am living and then it goes 50-50 to Aura and Harvey. Is that plain enough?,\u201d the whole context is consistent with an intention to retain only a life estate, and is apt language to emphasize an intention not to sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>stock but to hold it for plaintiffs. The statement relative to inheritance tax is consistent also with an intention to retain only a life estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Contrary to the assertion of appellants, and as a part of the evidence that Mr. Corbett did consider that he had transferred all of the title to the certificates, except a life estate, it is to be noted also that in one of the letters (Oct. 1st) he listed all of the stock and, immediately following the figures designating the total number of shares, he wrote in his handwriting, \u201cI hold a life Int only,\u201d and underscored some of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Further, and as a part of the evidence that Mr. Corbett did consider that he had placed the certificates beyond his power to retain them for himself, it is to be noted that in one of the letters (May 11, to Harvey), after stating the amount he had paid for the stock then on hand, he wrote in his handwriting, \u201cThese certificates I bought recently will be Endorsed to you &amp; Aura &amp; will be in my Deposit Box in the Bank of <em>America\u2014No </em>one can use it but you folks,\u201d and he underscored the word \u201cNo.\u201d In one of the letters (Oct. 1st) he stated, \u201cthen the next question arose was, how to fix it to make sure you would get it with as little expense as possible, so after taking it up with the Union Secy and others, I came to the conclusion that the simple &amp; safe way was to Endorse it over to Aura D. &amp; Harvey C. Hardison, then the sure way was to have a witness.\u201d He did endorse the certificates specifically naming plaintiffs as assignees and did cause his said endorsements to be witnessed by a person who signed his name on the back of the certificates as such witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The situation here is not that which occurs frequently when property is left with a custodian upon oral directions to deliver the same at a certain time, or on some contingency, leaving uncertainty as to the intent and purpose of the donor. Mr. Corbett stated at length in his handwriting what his intention was, the estate he retained for himself, and the estate he created for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">A valid trust in personal property may be created even by parol; such trust may be created as to the trustor and beneficiary by any words or acts of the trustor indicating with reasonable certainty: (1) an intention on the part of the trustor to create a trust; and (2) the subject, purpose and beneficiary of the trust. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2221; <em>Noble </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Learned, </em>(1908) 153 Cal. 245, 250 [94 P. 1047].) It is not necessary that the terms \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ctrustee\u201d be used. <em>(Cahlan </em>v. <em>Bank of Lassen County, </em>(1909) 11 Cal. App. 533, 540 [105 P. 765].)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The case of <em>Cahlan </em>v. <em>Bank of Lassen County, supra, </em>is similar to the present case. Plaintiffs therein alleged ownership and possession of certificates representing hank stock; that the certificates were issued to one Scholl and assigned and delivered to plaintiffs; that Scholl died and the executors of his will claimed an interest in the shares of stock. The prayer of the complaint was that it he decreed that the executors had no interest in the stock. Judgment for plaintiffs was affirmed. Scholl had been for several years a partner of the father of the two plaintiffs. Scholl owned two certificates representing 20 shares of stock of the Bank of Lassen County. He left the certificates in a locked tin box which was in the bank vault. The certificates bore assignments in blank signed by Scholl which were witnessed by the cashier of the bank. The envelope, in which the certificates were enclosed, was endorsed in the handwriting of the bank cashier as follows: \u201cIn case 'of my death to go to Lena and Neva Cahlen.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 mother testified that Scholl told her he had given the girls each ten shares of stock and had put it in his box at the bank, and that he further said, \u201cAs long as I am kicking, I will hold this and receive the dividends.\u201d She testified further as to other parol statements made by Scholl concerning the stock. Scholl had stated to other persons that he had given the stock to plaintiffs. (After Scholl\u2019s death the executors delivered the certificates to plaintiffs, thinking it was their duty to do so.) The court said at page 538\u201c The evidence leaves no doubt of his intention to do this [referring to the giving of the stock to plaintiffs] and that he did everything to accomplish it except to deliver the certificates to the donees. And the' evidence was sufficient to warrant the inference . . . that he retained possession for the donees and for the purpose only of collecting the dividends while he lived\u2014in short, that he constituted himself their trustee for the purposes stated.\u201d The court said further at page 539: \u201cThe facts thus disclosed showed that Mr. Scholl held these certificates as trustee for plaintiffs. His only interest in the shares of stock was in the dividends paid during his lifetime.\u201d On page 540 it was stated' further: \u201cIt was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>petent for Scholl to become the trustee of the trust created by himself. . . . Any words which indicate with sufficient certainty an intention or purpose to create a trust will be effective in so doing, without the use of the words trust or trustee. . . . The circumstance that Mr. Scholl retained the power to receive the dividends on the stock did not affect the validity of the trust. ... It does not appear that Scholl indorsed the certificates \u2018to the plaintiffs,\u2019 using that language. The indorsement was in blank. But the evidence clearly showed that his intention was to indorse them to plaintiffs and his act had that effect. Nor did it appear that he ever said in words that \u2018he held the same in trust for them, \u2019 but his declarations and acts showed beyond doubt that he did in fact so hold them and so intended.\u201d On page 541 it was stated further: \u201cIt is true, as claimed by appellants, that an ineffectual attempt to make a gift does not create a trust, and equity will not perfect an imperfect gift by establishing a trust where none was contemplated <em>(Noble </em>v. <em>Learned, </em>153 Cal. 245 [94 P. 1047]); but here the evidence is in every way consistent with the view taken by the trial court that a trust was contemplated, and its findings must stand. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The evidence in the present case was stronger in support of the trust than the evidence was in the <em>Gahlan case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In the <em>Gahlan case </em>the statements relative to the trust were oral; the endorsements on the two certificates were in blank; the writing on the envelope containing the certificates was in the handwriting of the bank cashier; and the time for termination of the trust was \u201cupon my death,\u201d as written on the envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In the present case the statements relative to the trust were in six letters in the handwriting of Mr. Corbett; the endorsements on the thirteen certificates specifically stated the names of plaintiffs as the assignees; the writing on the envelope containing the certificates was in the handwriting of Mr. Corbett; and the time for the termination of the trust was \u201cafter I go,\u201d as written in some of his letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The case of <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>(1941) 48 Cal.App.2d 249 [119 P.2d 754], was an action to quiet title to an investment certificate which was issued in the names of \u201cGeorge Ward or Thomas B. Randall under a trust agreement.\u201d One provision in the agreement was, \u201cAnd on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>death [referring to Ward], all unpaid principal and interest shall vest in Thomas B. Randall.\u201d Randall had no knowledge of the transaction. Ward retained possession of the certificate and after his death the defendant executor had possession of it. The executor contended there was no valid trust. The court in affirming the judgment quieting title said, at page 254, \u201cIt is well to allude again to the question of vesting, in the light of Ward\u2019s declaration, that \u2018on his (Ward\u2019s) death all unpaid principal and interest shall vest in Thomas B. Randall. \u2019 It is not inconsistent with a present transfer of interest that the words \u2018shall vest\u2019 are used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>Savelli </em>v. Simon, (1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 365 [77 P.2d 486], it was said at page 368: \u201cIt is likewise settled that the intention of the alleged donor is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court from all of the evidence in the case . . . and that where different conclusions may be reasonably drawn from the evidence by different minds, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Asj1\">Appellants contend that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action to establish a trust. Their argument is that the complaint is in the customary quiet title form alleging ownership in plaintiffs; that there was nothing therein to indicate the theory upon which plaintiffs were proceeding; that the general rule is that an action to quiet title is inconsistent with the establishment of an equitable interest and that in seeking the latter relief the facts relied upon should have been pleaded. In support of such contention appellants rely principally upon the case of <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Tormey, </em>(1890) 84 Cal. 126 [24 P. 319], That was an action to quiet title to real property. The complaint was in the usual quiet title form. The judgment was for plaintiff. In reversing the judgment it was held that \u201cthe case proved and found is not the case made by the complaint,\u201d in that plaintiff was the owner of the equitable title and that defendant held the legal title in trust for plaintiff, and that the complaint should have been \u201camended at the trial so as to conform to the proofs and to correspond with the findings.\u201d Other cases cited by appellants in support of such contention were likewise to establish equitable interests or trusts in real property which then stood in the names of persons other than the plaintiffs, rather than to establish ownership in the plaintiffs. In the present case the complaint alleged ownership in the plaintiffs, and the findings and judgment were that the plaintiffs were owners of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>stock and that defendants had no interest therein. In order to establish ownership, however, evidence was produced concerning the life estate of Mr. Corbett in the stock and the termination thereof. It was not necessary to make allegations relative to the chain of title through which plaintiffs derived ownership. In <em>Cahlan </em>v. <em>Bank of Lassen County, supra, </em>at page 539, it was said: \u201cThe point seems to be that as the complaint alleges ownership and possession of the bank stock and does not allege the trust to establish which the evidence was admitted, it was not competent to prove ownership by this means. . . . The primary object of the action is to establish ownership of these certificates of stock. . . . Proof of ownership made necessary a disclosure of all the facts out of which was to appear the ultimate fact of ownership. ... In the case of <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Bank of Oakland, </em>122 Cal. 19, [54 P. 370], a case quite similar to this, the trusteeship in the bank was shown to establish ownership. The court said: \u2018The ownership of the plaintiff is all that is material to be alleged.\u2019....\u201d (See <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>(1941) 48 Cal.App.2d 249 [119 P.2d 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The evidence was sufficient to warrant the findings of the trial court that said certificates were endorsed and assigned by Leonard W. Corbett for transfer to plaintiffs with the intent and purpose of assigning and transferring to plaintiffs all of his interest and ownership in them, subject only to the right in himself to receive the dividends during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Sehauer, P. J., and Shinn, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 28,1942.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
