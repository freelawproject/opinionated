Code, \u00a7 17550 et seq.), which sought a determination that the State of California should reimburse the Agency for moneys transferred into its Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (the Housing Fund) pursuant to Health and Safety Code <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sections 33334.2 and 33334.3. Those sections require a 20 percent deposit of the particular form of financing received by the Agency, tax increment financing generated from its project areas, for purposes of improving the supply of affordable housing.  The Agency claimed that this tax increment financing should not be subject to state control of the allocations made to various funds and that such control constituted a state-mandated new program or higher level of service for which reimbursement or subvention was required under article XIII B of the California Constitution, section 6 (hereafter section 6; all further references to articles are to the California Constitution). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 16; \u00a7 33670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The Agency brought a petition for writ of administrative mandamus to challenge the decision of the Commission. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; Gov. Code, \u00a7 17559.) The superior court denied the petition, ruling that the source of funds used by the Agency for redevelopment, tax increment financing, was exempt pursuant to section 33678 from the scope of section 6, as not constituting \u201cproceeds of taxes\u201d which are governed by that section. The superior court did not rule upon the alternative grounds of decision stated by the Commission, i.e., the 20 percent set-aside requirement for low- and moderate-income housing did not impose a new program or higher level of service in an existing program within the meaning of section 6, and, further, there were no costs subject to reimbursement related to the Housing Fund because there was no net increase in the aggregate program responsibilities of the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The Agency appeals the judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate.

(Gov. Code, \u00a7 17500 et seq.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission hearing consisted of oral argument on the points and authorities presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Under Government Code section 17559, review by administrative mandamus is the exclusive method of challenging a Commission decision denying a subvention claim. \u201cThe determination whether the statutes here at issue established a mandate under section 6 is a question of law.

On appellate review, we apply these standards: \u201cGovernment Code section 17559 governs the proceeding below and requires that the trial court review the decision of the Commission under the substantial evidence standard.

[Citation.] \u2019 [Citation.] The next year, the voters added article XIII B to the Constitution, which \u2018imposefs] a complementary limit on the rate of growth in governmental spending.\u2019 [Citation.] These two constitutional articles \u2018work in tandem, together restricting California governments\u2019 power both to levy and to spend for public purposes.\u2019 [Citation.] Their goals are \u2018to protect residents from excessive taxation and government spending. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of San Diego </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 80-81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Section 6, part of article XIII B and the provision here at issue, requires that whenever the Legislature or any state agency mandates a \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d on any local government, \u201c \u2018the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for <em>the costs of such program </em>or increased level of service . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(County of San Diego </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 81, italics added.) Certain exceptions are then stated, none of which is relevant here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at page 81, the Supreme Court explained that section 6 represents a recognition that together articles XIII A and XIII B severely restrict the taxing and spending powers of local agencies. The purpose of the section is to preclude the state from shifting financial responsibility for governmental functions to local agencies, which are ill equipped to undertake increased financial responsibilities because they are subject to taxing and spending limitations under articles XIII A and XIII B. <em>(County of San Diego </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>at p. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">To evaluate the Agency\u2019s argument that the provisions of sections 33334.2 and 33334.3, requiring a deposit into the housing fund of 20 percent of the tax increment financing received by the Agency, impose this type of reimbursable governmental program or a higher level of service under an existing program, we first review the provisions establishing financing for redevelopment agencies. Such agencies have no independent powers of taxation <em>(Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>100, 106 [211 Cal.Rptr. 133, 695 P.2d 220]), but receive a portion of tax revenues collected by other local agencies from property within a redevelopment project area, which may result from the following scheme: \u201cRedevelopment agencies finance real property improvements in blighted areas. Pursuant to article XVI, section 16 of the Constitution, these agencies are authorized to use tax increment revenues for redevelopment projects. The constitutional mandate has been implemented through the Community Redevelopment Law (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33000 et seq.). [\u2018JD The Community Redevelopment Law authorizes several methods of financing; one is the issuance of tax allocation bonds. Tax increment revenue, the increase in annual property taxes attributable to redevelopment improvements, provides the security for tax allocation bonds. Tax increment revenues are computed as follows: The real property within a redevelopment project area is assessed in the year the redevelopment plan is adopted. Typically, after redevelopment, property values in the project area increase. The taxing agencies (e.g., city, county, school or special district) keep the tax revenues attributable to the original assessed value and pass the portion of the assessed property value which exceeds the original assessment on to the redevelopment agency. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33640, 33641, 33670, 33675). In short, tax increment financing permits a redevelopment agency to take advantage of increased property tax revenues in the project areas without an increase in the tax rate. This scheme for redevelopment financing has been a part of the California Constitution since 1952. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 16.)\u201d <em>{Brown </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1014, 1016-1017 [214 Cal.Rptr. 626].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pages 1016-1018, the court determined that by enacting section 33678, the Legislature interpreted article XIII B of the Constitution as not broad enough in reach to cover the raising or spending of tax increment revenues by redevelopment agencies. Specifically, the court decided the funds a redevelopment agency receives from tax increment financing do not constitute \u201cproceeds of taxes\u201d subject to article XIII B appropriations limits. <em>{Brown </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>at p. 1019).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This ruling was based on section 33678, providing in pertinent part: \u201cThis section implements and fulfills the intent... of Article XIII B and Section 16 of Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>XVI of the California Constitution. <em>The allocation and payment to an agency of the portion of taxes specified in subdivision (b) of Section 33670 for the purpose of paying principal of, or interest on </em>. . . <em>indebtedness incurred for redevelopment activity . </em>. . <em>shall not be deemed the receipt by an agency of proceeds of taxes levied by or on behalf of the agency within the meaning of or for the purposes of Article XIII B . </em>. . <em>nor shall such portion of taxes be deemed receipt of proceeds of taxes by, or an appropriation subject to limitation of, any other public body within the meaning or for purposes of Article XIII B </em>... or any statutory provision enacted in implementation of Article XIII B. <em>The allocation and. payment to an agency of this portion of taxes shall not be deemed the appropriation by a redevelopment agency of proceeds of taxes levied by or on behalf of a redevelopment agency within the meaning or for purposes of Article XIII B of the California </em>Constitution.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In <em>County of Placer </em>v. <em>Corin </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 443, 451 [170 Cal.Rptr. 232], the court defined \u201cproceeds of taxes\u201d in this way: \u201cUnder article XIII B, with the exception of state subventions, the items that make up the scope of \u2018 \u201cproceeds of taxes\" \u2019 concern charges levied to raise <em>general revenues </em>for the local entity. \u2018 \u201cProceeds of taxes,\u201d \u2019 in addition to \u2018all tax revenues\u2019 includes \u2018proceeds . . . from . . . regulatory licenses, user charges, and user fees <em>[only] to the extent that such proceeds exceed the costs reasonably borne by such entity in providing the regulation, product or service. </em>...\u2019(\u00a7 8, subd. (c).) (Italics added.) Such \u2018excess\u2019 regulatory or user fees are but <em>taxes </em>for the raising of general revenue for the entity. [Citations.] Moreover, to the extent that an assessment results in revenue above the cost of the improvement or is of general public benefit, it is no longer a special assessment but a tax. [Citation.] <em>We conclude \u2018proceeds of taxes\u2019 generally contemplates only those impositions which raise general tax revenues for the entity.\u201d </em>(Italics <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In light of these interrelated sections and concepts, our task is to determine whether the 20 percent Housing Fund set-aside requirement of a redevelopment agency\u2019s tax increment financing qualifies under section 6 as a \u201ccost\u201d of a program. As will be explained, we agree with the trial court that the resolution of this issue is sufficient to dispose of the entire matter, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>accordingly we need not discuss the alternate grounds of decision stated by the Commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\n<em>Housing Fund Allocations: Reimbursable Costs?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">1. <em>Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The Agency takes the position that the language of section 33678 is simply inapplicable to its claim for subvention of funds required to be deposited into the Housing Fund. It points out that section 6 expressly lists three exceptions to the requirement for subvention of funds to cover the costs of state-mandated programs: (a) Legislative mandates requested by the local agency affected; (b) legislation defining or changing a definition of a crime; or (c) pre-1975 legislative mandates or implementing regulations or orders. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>None of these exceptions refers to the source of the funding originally used by the agency to pay the costs incurred for which reimbursement is now being sought. Thus, the agency argues it is immaterial that under section 33678, <em>for purposes of appropriations limitations, </em>tax increment financing is not deemed to be the \u201cproceeds of taxes.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1017-1020.) The Agency would apply a \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule to section 6 (see, e.g., <em>Davis </em>v. <em>City </em>o/Berkeley (1990) 51 Cal.3d 227, 234 [272 Cal.Rptr. 139, 794 P.2d 897]) and conclude that the source of the funds used to pay the program costs up front, before any subvention, is not stated in the section and thus is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">As an illustration of its argument that the source of its funds is irrelevant under section 6, the Agency cites to Government Code section 17556. That section is a legislative interpretation of section 6, creating several classes of state-mandated programs for which no state reimbursement of local agencies for costs incurred is required. In <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 482, 487 [280 Cal.Rptr. 92, 808 P.2d 235], the Supreme Court upheld the facial constitutionality of Government Code section 17556, subdivision (d), which disallows state subvention of funds where the local government is authorized to collect service charges or fees in connection with a mandated program. The court explained that section 6 \u201cwas designed to protect the tax revenues of local governments from state mandates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>would require expenditure of such revenues.\u201d <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>at p. 487.) Based on the language and history of the measure, the court stated, \u201cArticle XIII B of the Constitution, however, was not intended to reach beyond taxation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court therefore concluded that in view of its textual and historical context, section 6 \u201crequires subvention only when the costs in question can be recovered <em>solely from tax </em>revenues.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.) Interpreting section 6, the court stated: \u201cConsidered within its context, the section effectively construes the term \u2018costs\u2019 in the constitutional provision as excluding expenses that are recoverable from sources other than taxes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>No subvention was required where the local authority could recover its expenses through fees or assessments, not taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">2. <em>Interpretation of Section 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Here, the Agency contends the authority of <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, 53 </em>Cal.3d 482, should be narrowly read to cover only self-financing programs, and the Supreme Court\u2019s broad statements defining \u201ccosts\u201d in this context read as mere dicta. It also continues to argue for a \u201cplain meaning\u201d reading of section 6, which it reiterates does not expressly discuss the source of funds used by an agency to pay the costs of a program before any reimbursement is sought. We disagree with both of these arguments. The correct approach is to read section 6 in light of its historical and textual context.  The rules of constitutional interpretation require a strict construction of section 6, because constitutional limitations and restrictions on legislative powers are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used. <em>{City of San Jose </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1816-1817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The goals of articles XIII A and XIII B are to protect California residents from excessive taxation and government spending. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 81.) A central purpose of section 6 is to prevent the state\u2019s transfer of the cost of government from itself to the local level. <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 68.)  The related goals of these enactments require us to read the term \u201ccosts\u201d in section 6 in light of the enactment as a whole. The \u201ccosts\u201d for which the Agency is seeking reimbursement are its deposits of tax increment financing proceeds into the Housing Fund. Those tax increment financing proceeds are normally received pursuant to the Community Redevelopment Law (\u00a7 33000 et seq.) when, after redevelopment, the taxing agencies collect and keep the tax revenues attributable to the original assessed value and pass on to the redevelopment agency the portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>assessed property value which exceeds the original assessment. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1016-1017.) Is this the type of expenditure of tax revenues of local governments, upon state mandates which require use of such revenues, against which section 6 was designed to protect? <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">3. <em>Relationship of Appropriations Limitations and Subvention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">We may find assistance in answering this question by looking to the type of appropriations limitations imposed by article XIII B. In <em>County of Placer </em>v. <em>Corin, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d at page 447, the court described the discipline imposed by article XIII B in this way: \u201c[A]rticle XIIIB does not limit the ability to expend government funds collected from all sources. Rather, the appropriations limit is based on \u2018appropriations subject to limitation,\u2019 which consists primarily of the authorization to expend during a fiscal year the \u2018proceeds of taxes.\u2019 (\u00a7 8, subd. (a).) As to local governments, limits are placed only on the authorization to expend the proceeds of taxes levied by that entity, in addition to proceeds of state subventions (\u00a7 8, subd. (c)); no limitation is placed on the expenditure of those revenues that do not constitute \u2018proceeds of taxes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Because of the nature of the financing they receive, tax increment financing, redevelopment agencies are not subject to this type of appropriations limitations or spending caps; they do not expend any \u201cproceeds of taxes.\u201d Nor do they raise, through tax increment financing, <em>\u201cgeneral revenues </em>for the local entity.\u201d <em>(County of Placer </em>v. <em>Corin, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d at p. 451, original italics.) The purpose for which state subvention of funds was created, to protect local agencies from having the state transfer its cost of government from itself to the local level, is therefore not brought into play when redevelopment agencies are required to allocate their tax increment financing in a particular manner, as in the operation of sections 33334.2 and 33334.3. (See <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 68.) The state is not transferring to the Agency the operation and administration of a program for which it was formerly legally and financially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>responsible. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 805, 817 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 304].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">For all these reasons, we conclude the same policies which support exempting tax increment revenues from article XIII B appropriations limits also support denying reimbursement under section 6 for this particular allocation of those revenues to the Housing Fund. Tax increment financing is not within the scope of article XIII B. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1016-1020.) Section 6 \u201crequires subvention only when the costs in question can be recovered <em>solely from tax </em>revenues.\u201d <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 487, original italics.) No state duty of subvention is triggered where the local agency is not required to expend its proceeds of taxes. Here, these costs of depositing tax increment revenues in the Housing Fund are attributable not directly to tax revenues, but to the benefit received by the Agency from the tax increment financing scheme, which is one step removed from other local agencies\u2019 collection of tax revenues. (\u00a7 33000 et seq.) Therefore, in light of the above authorities, this use of tax increment financing is not a reimbursable \u201ccost\u201d under section 6. We therefore need not interpret any remaining portions of section 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Work, Acting P.

Section 6 is not discussed; the court\u2019s analysis of other concepts found in article XIII B is nevertheless instructive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">The alternate grounds of the Commission\u2019s decision were that there were no costs subject to reimbursement related to the Housing Fund because there was no net increase in the aggregate program responsibilities of the Agency, and that the set-aside requirement did not constitute a mandated \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d under this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The term of art, \u201cappropriations subject to limitation,\u201d is defined in article XIIIB, section 8, as follows: [ID (b) \u201c \u2018Appropriations subject to limitation\u2019 of an entity of local government means any authorization to expend during a fiscal year <em>the proceeds of taxes levied by or for that entity </em>and the proceeds of state subventions to that entity (other than subventions made pursuant to Section 6) exclusive of refunds of taxes.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">We disagree with respondents that the legislative history of sections 33334.2 and 33334.3 is of assistance here, specifically, that section 23 of the bill creating these sections provided that no appropriations were made by the act, nor was any obligation for reimbursements of local agencies created for any costs incurred in carrying out the programs created by the act. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1337, \u00a7 23, pp. 6070-6071.) As stated in <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at pages 1817-1818, legislative findings regarding mandate are irrelevant to the issue to be decided by the Commission, whether a state mandate exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
