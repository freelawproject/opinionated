(Staff Builders) appeals an order of the superior court confirming an arbitration award. Because the trial court did not apply the correct standard in reviewing the arbitration award, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Staff Builders acquires, franchises, and manages home health care businesses. Glen Lindenstadt (Lindenstadt), who does business as The Lindenstadt Company (TLC), assisted Staff Builders in its acquisition efforts. From 1991 until 1995, TLC and Staff Builders entered into 25 to 30 written agreements referencing the possible acquisition of over 100 businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">By way of example, an agreement dated March 25, 1993, listed 11 potential acquisition candidates, including Homelife Nursing, Inc., and Kay-lee Home Care. The agreement acknowledged that TLC \u201chas brought th[ese] possible acquisition/franchise candidate(s) to [Staff Builders\u2019] attention.\u201d The agreement further provided that \u201c[i]f [Staff Builders] consummates an acquisition . . . with respect to the[se] company(ies) and/or business(es) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>. . . and first called to [Staff Builders\u2019] attention by TLC within 36 months from the date entered below, [Staff Builders] will pay TLC a Finder Fee [based on] the Present Value of the Gross Aggregate Consideration.\u201d Staff Builders also agreed to \u201clist TLC in all acquisition agreements and final closing documents as the Finder/Initiator . . . Finally, the parties agreed that any controversy relating to the agreement would be resolved through binding arbitration and that the prevailing party would be entitled to attorney fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In August 1995, TLC initiated arbitration proceedings against Staff Builders, seeking the payment of finder\u2019s fees in connection with Staff Builders\u2019 acquisition of four businesses: Homelife Nursing, Inc., Kaylee Home Care, Comprehensive Services, and Albert Gallatin Visiting Nurse Association, Inc. Staff Builders defended the claims on the ground that TLC had functioned as an unlicensed real estate broker and was therefore statutorily barred from seeking any compensation under certain sections of the Real Estate Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10000 et seq.). (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10130, 10131, 10136.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> TLC argued that it had served as a \u201cfinder,\u201d not a broker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lindenstadt admitted that he did not have a real estate broker\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In early 1996, the arbitrator conducted two days of hearings. On April 21, 1996, she issued an award, concluding that TLC was entitled to finder\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>on two of the transactions (Homelife Nursing, Inc., and Comprehensive Services) but not on the other two (Kaylee Home Care and Albert Gallatin Visiting Nurse Association, Inc.). The award required that Staff Builders pay TLC $125,000 in finder\u2019s fees, $20,519 in interest, and $6,200 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In her six-page award, the arbitrator described the evidence produced at the hearings and the basis for her decision. As to the transactions involving Kaylee Home Care and Albert Gallatin Visiting Nurse Association, Inc., the arbitrator found that Lindenstadt had acted as an unlicensed broker and that the Real Estate Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10000 et seq.) precluded TLC from receiving any payment for those deals. With respect to the transactions involving Comprehensive Services and Homelife Nursing, Inc., the arbitrator concluded that Lindenstadt had not acted as a broker and that TLC was entitled to finder\u2019s fees; as to these transactions, the award recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cLindenstadt testified that he obtained Comprehensive\u2019s financial reports to forward to Staff Builders and also \u2018facilitated meetings, kept discussions on track.\u2019 Lindenstadt\u2019s testimony as to his activities was vague and conclusory and the Arbitrator gave it little credence .... Staff Builders\u2019 [president] Steve Savitsky testified that Lindenstadt had no involvement in negotiating terms of the Comprehensive Services deal. The Arbitrator makes the factual finding that Mr. Lindenstadt\u2019s activities were as testified by Mr. Savitsky and thus included no prohibited \u2018broker\u2019 activities precluding enforcement of the contract. Therefore the fee agreement relating to Comprehensive Services is enforceable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201cMr. Lindenstadt testified that his initial contact with Homelife [Nursing, Inc.] was with a Mr. Gleason, from whom he got an expression of interest and a purchase price which he passed on to Staff Builders, along with information about the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201cMr. Lindenstadt testified that he spoke to Mr. Gleason at least 5-10 times over the course of 1993 to see how things were progressing and also discussed Homelife with Staff Builders several times asking whether they were pursuing the opportunity. . . . Mr. Lindenstadt testified that he did \u2018follow up\u2019 and had \u2018numerous conversations\u2019 (5-10) with Gleason re Homelife throughout 1993, but did not \u2018negotiate\u2019 for Staff Builders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201cMr. Gleason contradicted Mr. Lindenstadt, stating that he had never spoken to Lindenstadt and would recall 5-10 conversations if they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>occurred. Mr. Gleason also testified that such conversations could not have occurred as he would not discuss acquisition matters with anyone, had no authority to do so, and would forward such calls to Homelife CEO Ed Schrum. ['JO Ed Schrum testified that Gleason never reported any such conversations with Lindenstadt.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] [&lt;JQ Mr. Savitsky testified that to his knowledge, Lindenstadt had nothing to do with the Homelife transaction. [U John Northway testified that it was he who brought the Homelife transaction to fruition, not Lindenstadt. Mr. Savitsky agreed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">\u201cThe Arbitrator believed Mr. Gleason\u2019s and Schrum\u2019s testimony as to the nonexistence of these conversations as more credible than Mr. Lindenstadt\u2019s. Mr. Lindenstadt\u2019s lack of recall about the specifics of the conversations, combined with Mr. Gleason\u2019s and Schrum\u2019s compelling testimony that they did not occur, leads the Arbitrator to believe that the conversations indeed did not occur. Therefore there is no factual basis for finding that Mr. Lindenstadt engaged in prohibited brokering activities. The contract with respect to Homelife is enforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In May 1996, Lindenstadt filed a petition in the trial court to confirm the arbitration award. Staff Builders filed papers opposing the petition and submitted evidence in support of its contention that Lindenstadt had acted as an unlicensed broker. Staff Builders argued that the trial court was obligated to undertake a de novo review of the evidence to determine whether the arbitration award was based on illegal contracts or transactions\u2014those where Lindenstadt had acted as a broker. At oral argument, the trial court stated that it would not review the illegality issue de novo because the parties had already litigated that issue in the arbitration, and the arbitrator had decided it. By minute order dated June 21, 1996, the trial court granted the petition \u201cfor the reasons stated on the record as fully reflected in the notes of the official court reporter . . . .\u201d The court also awarded Lindenstadt attorney fees and costs incurred in seeking confirmation of the award. Staff Builders filed a timely appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Staff Builders contends that the trial court should have reviewed the evidence de novo to determine whether the arbitration award was based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>illegal agreements or transactions. We agree. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court so that it can evaluate the evidence under the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Staff Builders further argues that, because Lindenstadt acted as a broker on <em>some </em>of the transactions, the finder\u2019s exception to the licensing requirement cannot be applied to any of the other transactions. Under this view, the arbitration award would have to be vacated even if Lindenstadt acted as a finder on the two transactions for which the arbitrator awarded compensation. We reject this contention. On remand, the trial court should confirm the award if it determines that Lindenstadt acted as a finder on those transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review of the Arbitration Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\u201cIn general, \u2018. . . courts may not interfere with arbitration awards. Courts may not examine the merits of the controversy, the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award, or the reasoning supporting the decision. ... A court may not set aside an arbitration award even if the arbitrator made an error in law or fact. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Schlessinger </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1109 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">However, in <em>Loving &amp; Evans </em>v. <em>Blick </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 603 [204 P.2d 23] <em>(Loving &amp; Evans), </em>the Supreme Court recognized a narrow exception to the general rule. In that case, a dispute arose on a construction project between the property owner and the contractors over the amount due the contractors. Pursuant to a provision in the parties\u2019 contract, the matter was submitted to binding arbitration. The property owner argued that the contractors were not entitled to any recovery because they were not properly licensed. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7026, 7028, 7031.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The arbitrator implicitly rejected that argument and rendered an award in favor of the contractors. (33 Cal.2d at pp. 604-605.) The contractors then petitioned the superior court to confirm the award. The property owner opposed confirmation on the ground that the contractors had not been licensed, and the parties\u2019 contract was therefore illegal and unenforceable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 605-606.) The trial court rejected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>argument and confirmed the award. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the trial court should have independently determined whether the parties\u2019 contract was illegal. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 606-615.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">As the high court explained: \u201c[T]he rules which give finality to the arbitrator\u2019s determination of ordinary questions of fact or of law are inapplicable where the issue of illegality of the entire transaction is raised in a proceeding for the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award. When so raised, the issue is one for judicial determination upon the evidence presented to the trial court, and any preliminary determination of legality by the arbitrator, whether in the nature of a determination of a pure question of law or a mixed question of fact and law, should not be held to be binding upon the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\u201cThe foregoing conclusion is entirely in harmony with the provision of section 1288 of the Code of Civil Procedure [now section 1286.2], which recites the grounds upon which the trial court \u2018must make an order vacating the award.\u2019 Section (d) thereof specifies that the award must be vacated \u2018where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, . . . .\u2019It seems clear that the power of the arbitrator to determine the rights of the parties is dependent upon the existence of a valid contract under which such rights might arise. ... In the absence of a valid contract no such rights can arise and no power can be conferred upon the arbitrator to determine such nonexistent rights. The question of the validity of the basic contract being essentially a judicial question, it remains such whether it is presented in a proceeding \u2018for an order directing . . . arbitration\u2019 under section 1282 of the Code of Civil Procedure [now section 1281.2] or in a proceeding \u2018for an order confirming\u2019 or \u2018vacating an award\u2019 under sections 1287 and 1288 of said code [now sections 1285, 1286, and 1286.2]. If it is presented in a proceeding under said section 1282 and it appears to the court from the uncontradicted evidence that the contract is illegal, the court should deny the petition \u2018for an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration.\u2019 If it is presented in a proceeding under said section 1287 or 1288 and similar uncontradicted evidence is offered, the court should deny confirmation and should vacate any award granting relief under the illegal contract upon the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in making such award.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\u201cSection 1281 of the Code of Civil Procedure, providing for submission to arbitration of \u2018any controversy . . . which arises out of a contract,\u2019 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>contemplate that the parties may provide for the arbitration of controversies arising out of contracts which are expressly declared by law to be illegal and against the public policy of the state. So it is generally held that \u2018a claim arising out of an illegal transaction is not a proper subject matter for submission to arbitration, and that an award springing out of an illegal contract, which no court can enforce, cannot stand on any higher ground than the contract itself.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201c. . . [W]hen a party seeks to use the processes of the courts to obtain confirmation of an arbitrator\u2019s award, and an issue is raised concerning the alleged illegality of the contract upon which the award is based, the trial court is the tribunal which must determine such issue of illegality upon the evidence presented to it. If this were not the rule, courts would be compelled to stultify themselves by lending their aid to the enforcement of contracts which have been declared by statute to be illegal and void. A party seeking confirmation cannot be permitted to rely upon the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion of legality for the reason that paramount considerations of public policy require that this vital issue be committed to the court\u2019s determination whenever judicial aid is sought.\u201d <em>(Loving &amp; Evans, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at pp. 609-614, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Similarly, in <em>All Points Traders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barrington Associates </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 723 [259 Cal.Rptr. 780], an investment banking firm (Barrington) agreed to assist a company (All Points) in finding an investor to purchase its stock. After the sale of All Points\u2019 stock, Barrington initiated binding arbitration pursuant to the parties\u2019 written agreement, seeking payment of a commission. All Points argued in the arbitration that, because Barrington did not possess a real estate broker\u2019s license, it was not entitled to any compensation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 727.) The arbitrator found in favor of Barrington and awarded it a commission. The superior court confirmed the award. The Court of Appeal reversed, concluding that Barrington needed a real estate broker\u2019s license to assist All Points in the sale of its stock. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 728-735.) Absent the license, the parties\u2019 agreement was illegal under the Real Estate Law, and the arbitration award could not be based on such an agreement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 735-738.) As the Court of Appeal stated: \u201cInherent in the arbitration award granting Barrington a commission for its involvement in the sale of All Points is the finding that the underlying contract was legal and enforceable. However, the issue of illegality is one for judicial determination upon the evidence presented to the trial court, and the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>finding, whether in the nature of a determination of a pure question of law or a mixed question of fact and law, is not binding on the trial court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 737, citing <em>Loving &amp; Evans, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at p. 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">More recently, in <em>Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th 1, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principles established in <em>Loving &amp; Evans </em>and approved the decision in <em>All Points Traders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barrington Associates, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 723. <em>(Moncharsh, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 31-32.) As the <em>Moncharsh </em>court pointed out, \u201cBoth <em>Loving &amp; Evans . . . </em>and <em>All Points Traders . . . </em>permitted judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s ruling where a party claimed the entire contract or transaction was illegal.\u201d (3 Cal.4th at p. 32.) The high court further stated: \u201cAlthough we recognized the general rule [in <em>Loving &amp; Evans] </em>that the merits of a dispute before an arbitrator are not subject to judicial review, \u2018the rules which give finality to the arbitrator\u2019s determination of ordinary questions of fact or of law are inapplicable where the issue of illegality of the entire transaction is raised in a proceeding for the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award.\u2019 \u201d (3 Cal.4th at p. 31, italics omitted; accord, Knight et al\u201e Cal. Practice Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5:465 to 5:471, pp. 5-129 to 5-130.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Here, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, it did not matter that Staff Builders had submitted the illegality issue to the arbitrator or that the arbitrator had decided that issue. \u201c[T]he trial court is the tribunal which must determine such issue of illegality upon the evidence presented to it\u201d <em>(Loving &amp; Evans, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at p. 614), and \u201c. . . any preliminary determination of legality by the arbitrator . . . [is] not . . . binding upon the trial court\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 609). In seeking to confirm the arbitration award, Lindenstadt \u201ccannot be permitted to rely upon the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion of legality\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 614) since \u201c. . . it would violate public policy to allow a party to do through arbitration what it cannot do through litigation\u201d <em>(Ericksen, Arbuthnot, McCarthy, Kearney &amp; Walsh, Inc. </em>v. <em>100 Oak Street </em>(1983) 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Cal.3d 312, 316, fn. 2 [197 Cal.Rptr. 581, 673 P.2d 251]). As in <em>All Points Traders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barrington Associates, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 723, the trial court must determine whether the Real Estate Law precludes confirmation of the award. If Lindenstadt acted as an unlicensed real estate broker on a transaction, the arbitrator exceeded her powers (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1286.2, subd. (d)) to the extent she awarded compensation for that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We therefore remand the case so that the trial court can independently decide whether Lindenstadt\u2019s claims were based on illegal contracts or transactions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">B. <em>The Finder\u2019s Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Staff Builders argues before this court, as it did before the arbitrator and the trial court, that the finder\u2019s exception should not be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis but, instead, should be available only if Lindenstadt acted as a finder on all transactions. We reject this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The Supreme Court has explained the rationale for the finder\u2019s exception as follows: \u201cOne who merely introduces two parties to a real estate transaction, whether or not he solicits those persons, does not need to be as knowledgeable about real estate transactions as a licensed broker, unless, of course, he participates in the negotiations. The finder of loans is an individual who is familiar with finance and who knows who is available to lend money under what terms and at what time. Unless he enters into the negotiation of the transaction or other activities beyond introduction, he need not be well versed in real estate law or in real estate economics and appraising.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">\u201cIt is true that the finder\u2019s exception presents a seeming anomaly in our law. In general, an unlicensed individual may recover an agreed compensation where he merely finds a buyer, seller, lender, or borrower, but if in addition to finding such person he goes further and helps to conclude the transaction by taking part in negotiating the details of the transaction, compromising or composing differences between the parties, by way of example, he may not recover the agreed compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">\u201cNevertheless, when viewed in the light of the competing public policies the finder\u2019s exception is not anomalous. Fundamental to our law is the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>principle that persons should perform their contracts, and when they breach their agreements, action should ordinarily lie to enforce contractual duties. On the other hand, the promotion of competency and integrity in those called upon by the public to perform complex duties involving trust is a salutary purpose, and the policy underlying the licensing statutes must be given full effect. <em>Neither considerations of competency nor of trust are of importance where the undertaking is merely to seek out, locate, find and introduce a buyer, seller, borrower, or lender to his counterpart or where negotiations and completion of the transaction are left completely to the principals. By enforcing the promise to pay a finder\u2019s fee we give effect to the policy of enforcement of contracts in cases where the policy underlying the licensing statute does not directly apply.\u201d (Tyrone </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 1, 11-12 [106 Cal.Rptr. 761, 507 P.2d 65], italics added; see also <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Department of Real Estate </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 286, 295 [142 Cal.Rptr. 789] [finder\u2019s exception applies \u201cwhere one simply acts as an intermediary or middleman in finding and introducing two parties to a real estate transaction\u201d]; <em>Zappas </em>v. <em>King Williams Press, Inc. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 768, 775 [89 Cal.Rptr. 307] [court should view alleged finder\u2019s activities in realistic manner to determine the number of transactions in which he may have improperly functioned as a broker].)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The record in this case indicates that Lindenstadt was involved in locating several acquisition candidates for Staff Builders over the years. He may have acted as an unlicensed broker on <em>some </em>of those transactions. However, the purpose of the broker\u2019s licensing statute\u2014the promotion of competency and trust\u2014is not served by denying Lindenstadt a finder\u2019s fee on transactions where he merely introduced the principals (Staff Builders and the acquired entity) to one another, and Staff Builders thereafter negotiated the acquisition. The goal of the licensing law is adequately served by denying Lindenstadt any compensation on those transactions where he crossed the line from finder to broker. Moreover, by applying the finder\u2019s exception in this way, Staff Builders will justifiably be required to perform its contractual obligation\u2014to pay a finder\u2019s fee\u2014on transactions where Lindenstadt actually functioned as a finder. Thus, on remand, the trial court should apply the finder\u2019s exception on a transaction-by-transaction basis in determining whether to confirm the arbitration award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The order is reversed. On remand, the trial court shall conduct a de novo review of the evidence to determine whether plaintiff violated the Real Estate Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10000 et seq.) and shall apply the finder\u2019s exception to that law on a transaction-by-transaction basis in ruling on the petition to confirm the arbitration award.

Thus the dispute relates only to the conversations Lindenstadt purports to have had with Mr. Gleason.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">At the time of the arbitration in <em>Loving &amp; Evans, </em>Business and Professions Code section 7031 provided: \u201cNo person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or maintain any <em>action in any court of this State </em>for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract for which a license is required by this chapter without alleging and proving that he was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of such act or contract.\u201d (Stats. 1939, ch. 37, \u00a7 1, p. 384, italics added.) The phrase \u201caction in any court of this State\u201d includes a proceeding in superior court to confirm an arbitration award. <em>(Loving &amp; Evans, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at pp. 611-613; <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Nat. C. Goldstone Agency </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 628, 632-633 [204 P.2d 37].) A similar prohibition is contained in the Real Estate Law. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 10136.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Lindenstadt does not contend that Staff Builders should have sought a judicial determination of the illegality issue before the arbitration commenced or that Staff Builders failed to properly object to the arbitration. (Cf. <em>Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 29-31 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899] [discussing waiver of illegality claim]; <em>Bayscene Resident Negotiators </em>v. <em>Bayscene Mobilehome Park </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 119, 129 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 626] [same]; <em>South Bay Radiology Medical Associates </em>v. <em>Asher </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1074, 1079-1081 [269 Cal.Rptr. 15] [same]; Knight et al., Cal.

Consequently, we do not address that subject. <em>(See MST Farms </em>v. <em>C. G. 1464 </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 304, 306 [251 Cal.Rptr. 72].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Our discussion has been limited to the standard of review that governs a <em>trial court\u2019s </em>review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision where one of the parties claims that the entire contract or transaction underlying the award is illegal. On appeal from an order confirming an arbitration award, we review the trial court\u2019s order (not the arbitration award) under a de novo standard. (See <em>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. </em>v. <em>Intel Corp. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 362, 376, fn. 9 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 581, 885 P.2d 994]; <em>Stirlen </em>v. <em>Supercuts, Inc. </em>(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1527 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 138]; <em>Brookwood </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1667, 1670 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 515]; see also <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1383, 1394-1395 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 446] [discussing application of de novo standard to findings based on witness credibility].) To the extent that the trial court\u2019s ruling rests upon a determination of disputed factual issues, we apply the substantial evidence test to those issues. <em>(Cochran </em>v. <em>Rubens </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 481, 484-486 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 672]; <em>Engineers &amp; Architects Assn. </em>v. <em>Community Development Dept. </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 644, 653 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 800].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b739-11\">In determining the illegality question, the trial court should consider all of the admissible evidence submitted to it regardless of whether that evidence was before the arbitrator. (See <em>Loving &amp; Evans, supra, </em>33 Cal.2d at pp. 605, 614-615.) Of course, the trial court should also consider the arbitration award itself, including the testimony and other evidence described therein. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Because we are reversing the trial court\u2019s order and remanding the case for further proceedings, we do not decide whether either party is entitled to attorney fees on appeal. The resolution of that issue must necessarily await the outcome of the proceedings on remand since, at this point, there is no \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the case. At an appropriate time after remand, the trial court should determine if either party is entitled to fees for this appeal and, if so, the amount of the award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
