Shell contends the court erred by allowing the jury to determine Shell was liable for negligence even though the PB pipes in 14 homes did not leak or otherwise fail. Shell further contends the court erred by ruling that economic loss alone can support a tort cause of action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Western was found strictly liable to the 34 homeowners, but it appeals only the postjudgment order awarding homeowners their costs as prevailing parties under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 1032. Western contends it was the section 1032 prevailing party because the homeowners ultimately recovered no net monetary award after settlement amounts with other defendants were credited against the jury\u2019s damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">We reverse the 14 judgments against Shell from which Shell appeals and affirm the order awarding the 34 homeowners their section 1032 costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>against Western. Western has not appealed the judgments against it in favor of the 34 homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Shell manufactured a PB resin used by Western and other companies to make PB pipes for plumbing systems. In the early 1980\u2019s, PB pipes were installed as part of the plumbing systems of 34 new homes owned by the 34 homeowners who filed this action. Some of the 34 homes experienced leaks in their plumbing systems, and the 34 homeowners filed this action against Shell, Western and others involved in the design, manufacture, distribution and installation of the plumbing systems and their components.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In an \u201comnibus\u201d order apparently applying to multiple lawsuits involving PB plumbing systems, the court overruled a demurrer seeking dismissal of claims made by those homeowners who did not allege their plumbing systems had leaked or experienced other failures. Before trial, the court also denied Shell\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion for a finding that the owners of homes without leaks cannot state causes of action for either strict liability or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The parties stipulated that 14 of the 34 homeowners had suffered no leaks in the plumbing systems of their homes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court denied Shell\u2019s motion for a directed verdict against those 14 homeowners. The jury\u2019s special verdicts found Shell liable to all 34 homeowners for negligence and Western liable to all 34 homeowners on a strict liability theory for design or manufacturing defects. The jury found Shell \u201cliable for negligence as to those plaintiffs who have not had a leak in their plastic plumbing system.\u201d The jury made special findings of the damages suffered by each of the 34 homeowners and then found that 80 percent of those damages were attributable to Shell and 20 percent were attributable to Western. The jury effectively found that the aggregate amount of damages suffered by all 34 homeowners was $222,282. However, after making offsets for the homeowners\u2019 prior settlements with other defendants, the court entered separate judgments for each of the 34 homeowners against Shell and Western in the amount of $0.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>The Owners of Homes Without Leaks Have Suffered No Damage Giving Rise to a Cognizable Action for Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Shell contends that the 14 owners of homes without leaks in their plumbing systems cannot state a cause of action for negligence because they have suffered no damage, and that the court erred by allowing the jury to decide Shell\u2019s liability for negligence as to those homeowners. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Although Shell and the 14 homeowners agree that these homes suffered no plumbing system leaks, the homeowners assert that their \u201cdamage\u201d consists of the degradation and \u201cmicro-cracking\u201d of their PB plumbing systems. They further assert they proved at trial that their plumbing systems were reasonably certain of failing in the future. Shell argues that these factors do not present any cognizable damage which would support a negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\"><em>Khan </em>v. <em>Shiley Inc. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 848 [266 Cal.Rptr. 106] is apposite to this case. <em>Khan </em>involved a patient who had an artificial valve implanted in her heart. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 850.) The patient was later informed that the implanted valve was one of a group of valves being recalled because of a propensity to fracture. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 851.) The patient suffered emotional and physical problems caused by anxiety and the concern that her heart valve might malfunction in the future and cause her almost certain death. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The patient filed an action against the valve manufacturer alleging negligence, strict liability, fraud and other causes of action. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 851-852.) The complaint acknowledged that the heart valve \u201c \u2018ha[d] not yet malfunctioned,\u2019 \u201d but alleged the valve was \u201c \u2018defective and likely to malfunction at any moment because of the conduct of the defendants] as alleged herein, thereby exposing [plaintiff] to the constant threat of imminent death or other serious physical injury and the anxiety, fear and emotional distress that results therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 852.) The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion because the patient\u2019s heart valve had not yet failed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The Court of Appeal rejected the patient\u2019s argument that a malfunction of an inherently defective product is not required to establish a product liability claim. <em>(Khan </em>v. <em>Shiley Inc., supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at p. 854.) The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>stated: \u201cNo matter which theory is utilized, however, where a plaintiff alleges a product is defective, proof that the product has malfunctioned is essential to establish liability for an injury <em>caused by the </em>defect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 855, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The court found this element of causation to be missing. It reasoned: \u201c[The patient\u2019s] alleged injury was not caused by any defect in the valve. Rather, it was caused, if at all, by the knowledge the valve may, at some future time, fracture.\u201d (217 Cal.App.3d at p. 855.) Despite the patient\u2019s emotional and physical symptoms, the court noted she had not yet been \u201cvictimized\u201d and stated: \u201cIn the absence of product malfunction, [the patient] cannot establish defendants breached any duty owed to her.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 856. ) The court further stated: \u201cSo long as the valve continues to function, no cause of action exists under any products liability theory.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 857.) The court also confirmed that no cause of action for negligence existed \u201cpremised on the <em>risk </em>the valve <em>may </em>malfunction in the future.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1318 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 305] applied the principle set forth in <em>Khan </em>in a different context. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion on the ground that the statute of limitations had run on strict liability, negligence and other causes of action because the school district had discovered the <em>presence </em>of asbestos in its buildings more than three years before it filed suit. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1322-1324.) The Court of Appeal reversed the summary judgment because the mere <em>presence </em>of asbestos was insufficient to begin the running of the statute of limitations; rather, actual asbestos <em>contamination </em>was required. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1322, 1341-1342.) The court noted: \u201cThe statute of limitations does not begin to run and no cause of action accrues in a tort action until damage has occurred. [Citation.] If the last element of the cause of action to occur is damage, the statute of limitations begins to run on the occurrence of \u2018appreciable and actual harm, however uncertain in amount,\u2019 that consists of more than nominal damages. [Citations.] . . . Cases contrast actual and appreciable harm with nominal damages, speculative harm or the threat of future harm. <em>The mere breach of duty\u2014causing only </em>nominal damages, <em>speculative harm or the threat of future harm hot yet realized\u2014normally does not suffice to create a cause of action. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1326, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Citing the seminal case of <em>Seely </em>v. <em>White Motor Co. </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 9, 18-19 [45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d 145], the court in <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>further noted the distinction between physical injury to person or property and merely economic loss: \u201cUntil physical injury occurs\u2014until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>damage rises above the level of mere economic loss\u2014a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action for strict liability or negligence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1327.) The court stated: \u201cOther jurisdictions that adopt <em>Seely's </em>physical injury/ economic loss distinction routinely find that asbestos contamination constitutes the physical injury element of strict liability or negligence causes of action in an asbestos-in-building case. The dangerousness that creates a risk of harm alone has been held to be insufficient to support an award of damages\u2014there must be physical harm caused by that product. [Citation.] At the release of asbestos fibers into the environment, the cause of action has been held to accrue and the statute of limitations to begin to run. [Citation.] The injury for which asbestos plaintiffs are being recompensed has been found to be the contamination of their buildings, not the mere presence of asbestos. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1328-1329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The court concluded: \u201cAs no cause of action could be stated <em>for </em>strict liability or negligence in an asbestos-in-building case without physical injury to person or property, <em>Seely </em>compels the conclusion that a tort cause of action cannot accrue until physical injury occurs. Once physical injury to property occurs\u2014assuming that damage is the last element of the tort cause of action to occur\u2014the cause of action accrues and the limitations period commences.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201c. . . In order to be consistent with the principles of <em>Seely, </em>it appears that until contamination occurs, the only damages that arise are economic losses that do not constitute physical injury to property recoverable in strict liability or negligence. Physical injury resulting from asbestos contamination, not the mere presence of asbestos, must have occurred before a cause of action for strict liability or negligence can accrue in an asbestos-in-building case and the limitations period commence.\" (37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1329-1330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The court summarized its analysis: \u201cIn California, no cause of action accrues\u2014i.e., the statute of limitations does not commence\u2014until all elements of the cause of action, including that of damage or injury, have occurred. There must be appreciable harm before the damage element of a cause of action accrues, triggering the commencement of the limitations period. In a strict liability or negligence case, the compensable injury must be physical harm to persons or property, not mere economic loss. Accordingly, we hold that in an asbestos-in-building case, the mere presence of asbestos constitutes only a threat of future harm. Contamination by friable asbestos is the physical injury and the actual, appreciable harm that must exist before a property owner\u2019s strict liability or tort cause of action against an asbestos manufacturer accrues and the limitations period commences.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>(37 Cal.App.4th at p.1335.) Accordingly, the court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for determination of whether there had been actual asbestos contamination more than three years before the school district filed suit. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1341-1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In <em>Seely </em>v. <em>White Motor Co., supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at page 18, the California Supreme Court stated: \u201c[I]n actions for negligence, a manufacturer\u2019s liability is limited to damages for physical injuries and there is no recovery for economic loss alone. [Citations.]\u201d Although <em>Seely </em>involved a breach of warranty claim making the court\u2019s statement on negligence technically dictum, courts generally have adopted and applied this statement of law to negligence actions. (See <em>Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumman Flxible </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 289, 293-294, 298 [204 Cal.Rptr. 736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we note that no element of \u201cdamage\u201d exists for a negligence cause of action by the owners of homes without leaks in their plumbing systems. Although the 14 homeowners assert that their PB pipes are inherently defective and have suffered degradation and \u201cmicro-cracking,\u201d these factors, if true, do not show that there has been the requisite \u201cdamage\u201d for a negligence cause bf action. Both <em>Khan </em>and <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>hold that appreciable present harm, not merely the threat of future harm, is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">To the extent the homeowners contend they have suffered damage to the PB pipes by degradation and \u201cmicro-cracking\u201d of the PB pipes, <em>Seely </em>and its progeny preclude a negligence cause of action based on damage solely to the defective product. <em>(Seely </em>v. <em>White Motor Co., supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 18-19; <em>Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumman Flxible, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at pp. 298-300.) The homeowners cite <em>J\u2019Aire Corp. </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 799 [157 Cal.Rptr. 407, 598 P.2d 60] to support their assertion that damage to the product or other economic loss alone is sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence. Although <em>J\u2019Aire </em>sets forth a limited exception to the general rule that economic loss alone is insufficient to state a negligence cause of action, the 14 homeowners do not meet the requirements for that exception. <em>J\u2019Aire </em>involved a tort claim by a tenant for its lost profits against a contractor who failed timely to complete construction of tenant improvements pursuant to the landlord\u2019s construction contract with the contractor. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 802-803.)  The California Supreme Court adopted a six-part test for determining when a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>exists between parties which would permit recovery in a negligence action for economic losses alone. \u201cThose criteria are (1) the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff, (2) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, (3) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, (4) the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, (5) the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct and (6) the policy of preventing future harm. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 804.) The court concluded all six criteria were met and the tenant could state a cause of action for negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 808.) The court found that the first factor was met because the construction contract was specifically for the renovation of tenant\u2019s premises and the contractor knew that its performance would directly affect the tenant and its business. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 804.) The third factor was met because the tenant was clearly harmed when it was unable to operate its business for one month and suffered further losses when it had to operate its business without heat and air-conditioning. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The record here does not support application of the <em>J\u2019Aire </em>exception. The first and third <em>J\u2019Aire </em>factors were not met: (1) Shell\u2019s manufacture of PB resin did not involve a transaction specifically intended to affect the particular needs of any of the 14 homeowners; and (2) there was insufficient certainty that the 14 homeowners suffered an injury and, in fact, the record shows the homeowners have yet to suffer <em>any </em>injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Ott </em>v. <em>Alfa-Laval Agri, Inc. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1439 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 790] similarly concludes the <em>J\u2019Aire </em>\u201cspecial relationship\u201d did not exist under the facts in <em>Ott. </em>The <em>Ott </em>court reasoned that the milking system the plaintiffs purchased was not shown to be \u201c \u2018intended to affect\u2019 the plaintiffs in any way particular to the plaintiffs, as opposed to all potential purchasers of the equipment.\u201d <em>(Ott, supra, </em>at p. 1455.) The failure to meet the first condition of the special relationship test precluded application of the <em>J\u2019Aire </em>exception for tort recovery of only economic losses; \u201cthe milking system was intended to affect the plaintiffs in the same way as all retail buyers,\u201d thereby making economic damages alone unavailable in a negligence action. <em>(Ott, supra, </em>at p. 1456.) The court further noted: \u201c[O]ne cannot infer that defendants took action intended to affect plaintiffs, nor that defendants reasonably could foresee any economic injury from malfunctioning equipment above that which <em>any </em>dairy would suffer if its milking system were substandard.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1457, fn. 10, original italics.) As in <em>Ott, </em>the record here does not support a finding that Shell\u2019s actions were intended to affect the 14 homeowners in any manner different from the intended effect on all homeowners with PB pipes. Accordingly, the <em>J\u2019Aire </em>exception does not apply here and the 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>homeowners cannot recover for the economic losses of replacement or repair costs for the PB pipe or for the decreased market value or marketability of homes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The court erred by denying Shell\u2019s motions for summary judgment and directed verdict and by allowing the jury to decide the negligence cause of action against Shell as to the 14 homeowners with home plumbing systems that had not leaked or otherwise failed. We reverse these 14 judgments against Shell, remand and direct the trial court to enter judgments in favor of Shell against those 14 homeowners. The judgments against Western are not reversed because Western has not filed an appeal from the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\n<em>The Court Did Not Err by Finding the Homeowners Are Entitled to Their Section 1032 Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">In its appeal Western contends the trial court erred by finding that the 34 homeowners were prevailing parties entitled to their costs under section 1032. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Section 1032, subdivision (b) states: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) states: \u201c \u2018Prevailing party\u2019 includes the party with a net monetary recovery, ... a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. When any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The jury found Western strictly liable and awarded the 34 homeowners an aggregate amount of $222,282 in damages. However, after crediting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>aggregate amount of settlements with other defendants, the court entered judgments against Western for $0. Both parties filed memoranda of costs and motions to tax the other party\u2019s costs. The trial court granted the homeowners\u2019 motion, denied Western\u2019s motion and, citing <em>Syverson </em>v. <em>Heitmann </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 106 [214 Cal.Rptr. 581], awarded the homeowners all of their section 1032 costs as the prevailing parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Western contends the court erred by finding that the homeowners, rather than Western, prevailed at trial. It asserts that the homeowners failed to obtain the \u201cprimary relief sought\u201d and thus should be denied their costs. Western further asserts that the homeowners ultimately recovered no damages against it and that Western should be deemed the section 1032 \u201cprevailing party\u201d even though the jury found it strictly liable and awarded an aggregate amount of $222,282 in damages against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">As Western notes, the court in <em>Pirkig </em>v. <em>Dennis </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1560 [264 Cal.Rptr. 494] stated at page 1566: \u201cA plaintiff will be considered a prevailing party when the lawsuit yields the <em>primary relief sought </em>in the case. [Citations.]\u201d (Italics added.) However, the <em>Pirkig </em>court also stated: \u201cPrevailing on the issue of liability may be deemed sufficient in itself to determine a prevailing party under the broad definition of section 1032.\u201d <em>(Ibid.:, </em>but see <em>Childers </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1550, fn. 3 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 328].) Further, the factual background of <em>Pirkig </em>is similar to the instant matter. In <em>Pirkig </em>the plaintiffs prevailed on the issues of liability and damages at both the first and second trials. <em>(Pirkig, supra, </em>at p. 1566.) However, the judgment did not award the plaintiffs any net monetary recovery because of credits for the amount of prior settlements with other defendants. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1563, 1566.) The <em>Pirkig </em>court held that the failure to obtain a net monetary recovery did not prevent the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of section 1032 costs, stating: \u201cThat such a coincidence does not affect the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover costs and attorney fees under section 1032 is well established by the governing case law . . . [citations].\u201d <em>(Pirkig, supra, </em>at p. 1566.) The court further stated: \u201cThe only reason [the plaintiffs] failed to obtain a net monetary recovery at the second trial was because [the plaintiffs] settled before trial with the sellers for a greater amount than awarded by the second court [at the second trial].\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s award of section 1032 costs to the plaintiffs as the prevailing parties. <em>(Pirkig, supra, </em>at pp. 1565, 1568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Contrary to Western\u2019s assertion, the cases of <em>Syverson </em>v. <em>Heitmann, supra, 171 </em>Cal.App.3d 106, and <em>Ferraro </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Gas Co. </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 33 [162 Cal.Rptr. 238] are not, because of the 1986 amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to section 1032, inapplicable. We agree with the statement in <em>Pirkig </em>that \u201cthe 1986 amendment to section 1032 did not bring forth a substantial change in the definition of \u2018prevailing party,\u2019 \u201d and those cases continue to have precedential effect. <em>(Pirkig </em>v. <em>Dennis, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1567-1568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The 34 homeowners prevailed on the issues of liability and damages, receiving an aggregate jury award of $222,282. Had some of Western\u2019s codefendants not settled with the homeowners prior to or during trial, judgments would have been entered against Western in the aggregate amount of 20 percent of $222,282. Under these circumstances, Western cannot proclaim itself to be the section 1032 prevailing party. The court correctly found that the 34 homeowners were section 1032 prevailing parties entitled to their costs against Western.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The judgments are affirmed, except we reverse the 14 judgments against Shell as to those homeowner respondents named in footnote 3, <em>ante, </em>and we remand with directions that the court enter judgments in favor of Shell as to them. We affirm the order awarding the homeowner respondents their section 1032 costs against Western. The parties shall bear their own costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Huffman, Acting P. J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 27, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\"> We have accepted and considered an amicus curiae brief filed by the Association for California Tort Reform in support of Shell\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-13\"> All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\"> Those 14 homeowners are: (1) Ernie Antinori, (2) Manuel and Nedra Bringas, (3) Bill and Linda Burton, (4) Ernesto and Myma Fune, (5) Richard and Tammi Lampke, (6) Louis and Robretta Lester, (7) Samuel and Maria Lopez, (8) Marlena Murphy, (9) Perry and Deborah Partow, (10) Carolyn Rogness, (11) Jeffrey and Monica Strong, (12) Terrance Sussan and Susan Williams Sussan, (13) Arthur and Ottilie Williams and (14) Chester and Nancy Woods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-13\"> All of the cases homeowners cite as support for their judgments against Shell are inapposite. Most of them are distinguishable from <em>Seely </em>because they involved injuries to property other than the product itself. (See, e.g., <em>Raven\u2019s Cove Townhomes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Knuppe Development Co. </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 783, 788-789 [171 Cal.Rptr. 334]; <em>Del Mar Beach Club Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>Imperial Contracting Co. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 898, 905, 913 [176 Cal.Rptr. 886, 25 A.L.R.4th 336]; <em>Pisano </em>v. <em>American Leasing </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 194, 196-197 [194 Cal.Rptr. 77].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> We do not address the effect of Western\u2019s section 998 offer to the homeowners because Western does not raise this issue in its opening brief. Further, we do not address the trial court\u2019s award of costs to Shell because we dismissed as untimely the homeowners\u2019 appeal of that award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
