Code of Civil Procedure section 730 provides that the court shall fix attorney\u2019s fees in a foreclosure action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Here we hold that section 730 does not authorize the court to award attorney\u2019s fees, but only to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to an attorney\u2019s fees clause in a security instrument after judgment in a foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Christopher Lee Lessel and Ann Janine Lessel appeal an order denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to section 730. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">On March 20, 1986, Imperial Savings Association lent $450,000 to Christopher Lee and Ann Janine Lessel to pay off construction financing on their Westlake Village home. A deed of trust on 1486 Kingston Circle, Westlake Village, secured the obligation. Paragraph 19 of the deed of trust provided: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201c[In the event of default] Lender . . . may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. . . and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by applicable law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this paragraph 19, including . . . reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Thereafter, the property suffered soil movement and the home was damaged. In August 1988, the Lessels ceased making loan payments and defaulted under the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In July 1987, the Lessels brought an action against the developer of their home, the soils engineer who certified the soil compacting of the lot, and the Realtors representing the developer. (Lessel v. Prudential (Super. Ct. Ventura County, 1987, No. 97717).) In 1992, the Lessels recovered $462,500 in the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In Lessel v. Prudential, Imperial Savings Association sought an equitable lien on the $462,500. Eventually, the trial court dismissed Imperial Saving Association\u2019s action for failure to prosecute. In 1992, the Resolution Trust Corporation brought an action against the Lessels, also seeking some or all of the $462,500. Resolution Trust Corporation dismissed its lawsuit in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In the present action, Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation (CMM), successor in interest to Imperial Savings Association, seeks judicial foreclosure, a deficiency judgment, a receiver to rent out the property, and a constructive trust on the $462,500. By summary judgment, the trial court concluded that most of CMM\u2019s causes of action were precluded as a matter of law. On February 16, 1996, CMM voluntarily dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The Lessels sought $136,634.75 for attorney\u2019s fees from CMM pursuant to Civil Code section 1717 and section 730. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the Lessels were not prevailing parties under Civil Code section 1717, subdivision (b)(2), and that section 730 does not create a right to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The Lessels appeal and contend section 730 provides a statutory basis to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The Lessels argue that section 730 authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees independent of Civil Code section 1717. Section 730 provides: \u201cIn all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cases of foreclosure of mortgage the attorney\u2019s fee shall be fixed by the court in which the proceedings are had, any stipulation in the mortgage to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d The Lessels point out that section 1033.5, subdivision (a), permits as an allowable litigation cost under section 1032 (recovery of costs), \u201c(10) Attorney fees, when authorized by . [1 (B) Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The Lessels also assert that they need not be \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 1717 to recover fees under section 730. They rely on <em>Winick Corp. </em>v. <em>Safeco Insurance Co, </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1502, 1507-1508 [232 Cal.Rptr. 479], holding that a prevailing party in contractor bond actions (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3250) need not obtain a judgment on the merits to receive attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The Lessels are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Civil Code section 1717 or section 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Civil Code section 1717, subdivision (a), permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the party prevailing \u201con the contract\u201d where the contract provides for attorney\u2019s fees incurred to enforce it. Civil Code section 1717, subdivision (b)(2), however, precludes attorney\u2019s fees \u201c[w]here an action has been voluntarily dismissed.\u201d Under that circumstance, there is no prevailing party. <em>(D &amp; J, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ferro Corp. </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1191, 1194 [222 Cal.Rptr. 656].) Thus, the Lessels are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under paragraph 19 of the deed of trust because CMM voluntarily dismissed the action. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717, subd. (b)(2); <em>D &amp; J, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ferro Corp., supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d 1191, 1194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Section 730 does not authorize the trial court to award attorney\u2019s fees in foreclosure actions unless the security instrument provides for attorney\u2019s fees. Our Supreme Court, in <em>Hotaling </em>v. <em>Montieth </em>(1900) 128 Cal. 556, 557-558 [61 P. 95], interpreted an earlier version of section 730 as \u201creferring only to \u2018the attorney\u2019s fee provided for in the mortgage,\u2019 and as having \u2018no application where none is so provided.\u2019 \u201d The court held: \u201cThe act merely gives the court power to fix the fee at any sum not exceeding the amount stipulated by the mortgagor; it cannot allow a fee greater than that amount.\u201d (128 Cal. at p. 558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The plain meaning of section 730 authorizes the trial court to settle or determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees in foreclosure actions. It does not state that the trial court shall award attorney\u2019s fees or that a party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. In statutes authorizing an award of attorney\u2019s fees, the Legislature has used the words \u201caward\u201d or \u201centitled.\u201d (\u00a7 405.38\u2014expunge-ment of lis pendens [\u201cThe court shall direct that the party prevailing on any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u201d]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1717\u2014contract provision for attorney\u2019s fees [\u201cthe party prevailing on the contract . . . shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 3250\u2014action on payment bond [\u201cIn any action, the court shall award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, to be taxed as costs.\u201d].) Therefore, section 730 is somewhat like a person\u2019s appendix; it is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><em>Winick Corp. </em>v. <em>Safeco Insurance Co., supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d 1502, is distinguishable. <em>Winick </em>concerned Civil Code section 3250, which requires an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the party prevailing in an action on a contractor\u2019s bond. Civil Code section 3250 expressly authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees: \u201cIn any action, the court shall award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, to be taxed as costs.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3250.) In contrast, section 730 does not expressly authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Accordingly, the order is affirmed. The Lessels shall bear costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Stone (S. J.), P. J., and Yegan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-14\">All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless stated otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
