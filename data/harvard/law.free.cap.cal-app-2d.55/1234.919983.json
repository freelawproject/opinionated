(RBVA), and Lyman Clark et al. (the Clarks), Lorraine Weikel, individually and as executor for Maurice Weikel, deceased (hereafter, Weikel) subsequently refiled suit against all of the original defendants. Weikel now appeals following the sustaining of demurrers by respondents TCW, RBVA and the Clarks to the latest action. Weikel argues that her complaint was not barred. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">\u201cA. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">\u201cThe dispute revolves around a small wedge of land (hereafter \u2018the wedge\u2019) which formed part of the boundary between two adjacent shopping centers in Rancho Bernardo. Dr. Maurice Weikel (now deceased) and his wife Lorraine owned the shopping center (the Weikel Center) on the northern side of the wedge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">\u201cThe shopping center on the southern side of the wedge is known as \u2018The Plaza.\u2019 The Plaza was developed by defendant/respondent Rancho Bernardo Village Associates (RBVA). Defendants/respondents Jay Kuhne and Ralph Braden were the general partners of RBVA. In 1984 defendant/respondent/ cross-appellant TCW Realty Fund II Holding Company (TCW) purchased The Plaza from RBVA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">\u201cAt the northern end of The Plaza, adjacent to the wedge, is a retail shop occupied by defendant/respondent Lyman Clark. This lawsuit resulted from the conflict between Weikel\u2019s desire to build on the wedge and TCW\u2019s desire to preserve the integrity and beauty of Clark\u2019s shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>\u201cB. <em>Phase I: The Initial Dispute and the \u2018RBVA Agreement\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">\u201cIn 1980 RBVA began developing The Plaza immediately south of the Weikel Center. The permit to build The Plaza contained the condition that there be direct access across the common boundary between The Plaza and the Weikel Center.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">\u201cIn late 1981 RBVA, without Weikel\u2019s approval, unilaterally installed various forms of access across the common boundary. It removed curbs, landscaping and sprinkler systems to open a vehicle passage in front of Clark\u2019s shop; it opened a curb to provide access behind Clark\u2019s shop; and at the other end of the common boundary it installed a sidewalk leading from a bank and office building to Weikel\u2019s parking lot. After Weikel protested, RBVA barricaded vehicle access, removed the sidewalk, and agreed to restore Weikel\u2019s improvements if an agreement on access were not reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">\u201cExtensive negotiations resulted in the so-called \u2018RBVA agreement.\u2019 Weikel agreed to cooperate on an access agreement if RBVA would commit to a number of endeavors, one being to convey to Weikel title to The Plaza\u2019s portion of the wedge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">\u201cWeikel wanted to build on the wedge, and to that end requested that RBVA convey a fee interest. However, RBVA\u2019s lender would not agree to release any land from its security. To avoid that problem, Weikel\u2019s attorney suggested Weikel accept an alternative solution: RBVA would grant Weikel an encroachment or building easement over The Plaza\u2019s side of the wedge to allow Weikel to build on the wedge. RBVA\u2019s lender agreed to subordinate to this easement. The RBVA agreement, by which the parties granted each other \u2018access easements\u2019 and RBVA granted Weikel his \u2018building easement,\u2019 was finalized and documented by March 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">\u201cMeanwhile, RBVA was negotiating to sell the property to TCW. TCW conditioned its purchase on resolution of the dispute between RBVA and Weikel and the removal of the parking lot barriers. The RBVA agreement accomplished that goal. The 1984 access easements specifically provided mutual ingress and egress so that traffic could move freely between the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>centers. The building easement and access easements were recorded in April 1984, and TCW\u2019s acquisition of The Plaza closed in June 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">\u201cC. <em>Phase II: The \u2018Lot Split Agreement\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">\u201cWeikel soon learned the building easement would not work. The City would not approve construction which straddled a lot boundary. Weikel approached TCW in May 1985 to determine if TCW would agree to a lot line adjustment enabling him to build on the wedge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">\u201cFrom the earliest meetings TCW expressed concerns over the impact a lot line adjustment might have on Clark\u2019s shop. At the initial May 1985 meeting, concerns about cutting off Clark\u2019s windows were raised, with TCW indicating it was willing to cooperate but was concerned about an agreement which might engender a lawsuit should the lot line adjustment restrict Clark\u2019s sight or cut into his roof canopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">\u201cPreserving Clark\u2019s roof line, sight lines and windows was a continuing concern expressed by TCW on numerous occasions. Typical of TCW\u2019s statements was the following taken from a November 1985 letter in which TCW\u2019s agent responded to Weikel\u2019s proposal to build up to and tie into Clark\u2019s building: \u2018 \u201cAs I have indicated to you, we have some real concerns as to how these additional stores will affect our property, especially since they deal with the tearing down and altering of our roof line .... Our concern also relates to how the structure you plan to construct will affect [Clark\u2019s store] and the exposure that it now enjoys. I do believe that this particular tenant would feel strongly about losing any part of the store front or exposure to any of his windows on the side or to the front of his store.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">\u201cSimilar concerns over the impact Weikel\u2019s buildings might have on Clark\u2019s sight lines and \u2018canopy\u2019 were expressed in meetings and correspondence in the succeeding years. Weikel\u2019s representative, Mr. Cooper, met with Clark directly to discuss Clark\u2019s concerns. Clark indicated he would fight any impingement of his sight lines or canopy, and Cooper assured him there would be no loss of windows or sight lines, and no loss of, or building under, the canopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">\u201cDuring the lengthy negotiations, TCW asked to see specific plans to determine how Weikel\u2019s building might affect Clark, but Weikel understandably was reluctant to invest in detailed plans until it appeared the deal might materialize. However, Cooper continually reassured TCW that the worst possible impact on Clark would be the addition of sprinklers to the roof canopy or conversion of part of the canopy to an open trellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>\u201cBy the fall of 1987 relations between Weikel and TCW had become rancorous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, TCW continued to negotiate, and also continued its efforts to obtain Weikel\u2019s plans to determine any impact it might have on Clark. One of the plat maps Weikel\u2019s agent provided to Ms. Mathews (TCW\u2019s representative) clearly showed the proposed new boundary line going <em>around </em>Clark\u2019s canopy, with the architect\u2019s notation to keep any new building 10 feet from the canopy face.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">\u201cTCW and Weikel eventually reached an agreement (the Tot split agreement\u2019) in which TCW would convey certain land to Weikel, and the parties would substitute new access easements for the 1984 access easements, which contained the erroneous property description. The key provisions of the agreement related to Clark\u2019s shop. TCW\u2019s obligations under the agreement were subject to the condition that Weikel would use best efforts in his construction to preserve the canopies, but that if local regulations required the canopies be modified, Weikel would submit plans for such modification to TCW for its approval. Also, paragraph 2.c. of the contract provided: \u2018 \u201cThe occurrence of the lot split shall not cause the Original TCW Land to be in violation of any San Diego municipal law, regulation or ordinance (including, but not limited to, minimum setback requirements) ....\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">\u201cAlthough TCW\u2019s counsel prepared the text of the agreement, Weikel\u2019s agent was responsible for supplying the other exhibits, including the plat map and the property descriptions attached to the deeds. The agreement was signed by the principals without these key exhibits attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">\u201cThe plat map supplied by Cooper and actually attached to the agreement and conveyance documents had the new boundary line running alongside Clark\u2019s building and under the canopy, rather than with a 10-foot setback skirting the canopy. This new lot line had the effect of immediately placing Clark\u2019s building in violation of several requirements: the canopy now violated the setback requirements of zoning regulations; and the proximity of the wall to the new property line mandated that existing display windows be replaced with fire-rated windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>\u201cD. <em>The Dispute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">\u201cWeikel proceeded with his plans to develop the property. He submitted plans to TCW which effectively eliminated any sight lines to the northern side of Clark\u2019s shop, the proposed plans enveloping the entire wedge, abutting and burying the northern face of Clark\u2019s shop and jutting out to obscure Clark\u2019s sight lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">\u201cHowever, the building department would not approve Weikel\u2019s plans because the lot line relocation caused Clark\u2019s shop to be in violation of both the building code (fire-rated windows or openings were within five feet of a property line, and fire-rated walls were within twenty feet of the property line), and the zoning code (specifically, the provision prohibiting any structure, such as the canopy, from overhanging a property line). Weikel proposed three alternatives to solve the concerns of the building department, none of which was acceptable or accorded with the intent to preserve the beauty and visibility of Clark\u2019s shop.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">\u201cTCW consulted with its property managers and Clark concerning the various proposals. The property managers indicated all three proposals would have a negative impact on both Clark and the future leasability of Clark\u2019s space. Clark advised TCW none of the proposals was acceptable and would have such a negative impact on his business that he would file a lawsuit if any of those proposals was implemented. TCW also consulted with the architect who originally designed The Plaza. The architect, after consulting with the building department, advised that these options also required construction of a parapet above Clark\u2019s shop. The architect opined that all of the available options would negatively affect Clark\u2019s retailing operation by reducing sight lines and the architectural integrity and appeal of the building, and would be costly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">\u201cTCW advised Weikel that none of the proposed plans was feasible and offered to meet with him to discuss alternatives. This [initial] lawsuit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>\u201cE. <em>The </em>[First] <em>Lawsuit and Trial Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cWeikel sued on various theories. The first count alleged breach of the RBVA agreement, claiming the refusal to modify Clark\u2019s shop to accommodate Weikel\u2019s building plans breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The second count claimed the lot split agreement was similarly breached. The third count alleged fraud, claiming TCW never intended to meet its promise to approve development by Weikel. Count four sought a declaration that Weikel had the right to rescind the 1988 access easements. Count six alleged Weikel had a right to an injunction against unreasonable surface water discharges onto Weikel\u2019s property. Count seven sought an injunction requiring TCW and Clark to modify the shop because of building code violations. Finally, Weikel\u2019s common count sought restitution of the value RBVA and TCW had received from the access easement Weikel had granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cTCW cross-complained and alleged Weikel made false representations that he would preserve Clark\u2019s building and that the lot split did not violate any laws, giving rise to claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. TCW also alleged the lot split, by causing Clark\u2019s shop to violate code requirements, was the failure of a condition to the deed and entitled TCW to rescind. TCW also sought declaratory relief validating the 1988 access easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">\u201cThe court entered judgment in favor of TCW and against Weikel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The essential basis for the judgment was the determination that the lot split was rescindable because it placed Clark\u2019s shop in violation of code requirements, contrary to the parties\u2019 intent. The rescission rendered moot Weikel\u2019s claims insofar as they were premised on the lot split agreement. The court also concluded TCW was entitled to a declaration that the original easements be reinstated without granting any right to Weikel to block access or rescind them. Weikel appeals all of these rulings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">In our opinion on the appeal, we affirmed the great bulk of the trial court\u2019s rulings, deleting only that language purporting to preclude Weikel from unilaterally rescinding the reinstated easements. <em>(Weikel </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>No. D015050.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Our opinion in the prior case (hereinafter <em>Weikel I) </em>was filed on September 8, 1993. Slightly over one month later, when that opinion became final as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>this court, Weikel filed another lawsuit against TCW, RBVA and the Clarks, which will hereinafter be referred to as <em>Weikel II.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">In <em>Weikel II, </em>Weikel sought to (1) quiet title to interests conveyed by the 1984 \u201cbuilding easement\u201d; (2) recover damages from TCW and the Clarks for a trespass \u201c[c]ommencing June 19, 1984, and continuing to this day\u201d; (3) abate a nuisance (the Clarks\u2019 building) which \u201c[c]ommenc[ed] May 29, 1985\u201d; (4) recover damages from RBVA for an alleged breach of warranty \u201c[cjommencing April 18, 1984\u201d; (5) recover damages from RBVA for breach of an implied covenant \u201c[c]ommencing April 18, 1984\u201d; (6) obtain from the court various declarations of right against TCW, RBVA and the Clarks; (7) obtain restitution from RBVA and TCW for use of the easement; and (8) obtain another quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">TCW thereafter demurred on the grounds (1) all of Weikel\u2019s claims were barred by res judicata, (2) all of Weikel\u2019s claims were barred by statutes of limitations, and (3) in any event, Weikel\u2019s claims failed to state a cause of action. The Clarks moved for judgment on the pleadings on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">On February 4, 1994, the court sustained TCW\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and granted the Clarks\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding \u201c[t]he action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>Issues regarding the validity and scope of the 1984 easement should have been raised in the prior action. The two sets of easements were \u2018component parts of an overall agreement\u2019 which should have been, and to the extent necessary were adjudicated in the same action.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Judgment of dismissal was later entered as to TCW and the Clarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">On April 22,1994, RBVA\u2019s default was set aside and the RBVA demurrer to the complaint was sustained without leave to amend, and judgment of dismissal in favor of RBVA was thereafter entered on June 20, 1994. Weikel appealed from the rulings in favor of TCW, the Clarks and RBVA. Consistent with his previous practice, Weikel\u2019s counsel filed a separate notice of appeal from the orders made concerning attorney <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">\u201cOn appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]; <em>Buckaloo </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 815, 828 [122 Cal.Rptr. 745, 537 P.2d 865].) The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125 [271 Cal.Rptr. 146, 793 P.2d 479, 16 A.L.R.5th 903].) The judgment must be affirmed \u2018if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Longshore </em>v. <em>County of Ventura </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 14, 21 [157 Cal.Rptr. 706, 598 P.2d 866].) However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. <em>(Barquis </em>v. <em>Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 103 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817].) And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan, supra, </em>39 Cal,3d at p. 318.)\u201d <em>(Aubrey </em>v. <em>Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">In this case, as noted earlier, the trial court sustained the demurrer of TCW<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on the grounds res judicata applied to the claims sought to be presented in <em>Weikel II, </em>and thus did not rule on whether the other grounds supporting the demurrer (statutes of limitations and failure to state a cause of action) were \u201cwell taken.\u201d We proceed to a discussion of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">In 1984 counsel for Weikel made a decision: to devise a complex agreement for a purpose (construction on Weikel\u2019s part of the wedge of a building across lot lines) which could not (as it turns out) be accomplished. In the many years since, counsel for Weikel has litigated the consequences of his decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All things, however, must end, and that principle applies here with particular force. While Weikel now mounts an extended discourse against the rulings below, the assertions are without merit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>A. <em>Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">The general principles here applicable are clear: \u201cRes judicata operates as a bar to maintaining a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them on the same cause of action. <em>(Branson </em>v. <em>Sun-Diamond Growers </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 327, 340 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 314]; <em>Gamble </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 893, 898 [280 Cal.Rptr. 457].) However, where a judgment is not rendered on the merits, it does not operate as a bar. <em>(Koch </em>v. <em>Rodlin Enterprises </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1591,1596 [273 Cal.Rptr. 438].) Res judicata precludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of action or relitigation of the same cause of action on a different legal theory or for different relief. <em>(Boccardo </em>v. <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1043 [184 Cal.Rptr. 903].)\u201d <em>(Lucas </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 277, 285 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 655].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Here the central question is whether <em>Weikel II </em>was, or was not, an attempt at \u201crelitigation of the same cause of action on a different legal theory.\u201d For purposes of this analysis, it is of no moment whether the identical causes of action were <em>in fact </em>litigated in <em>Weikel I; </em>all that is required is that Weikel have had the <em>opportunity </em>to litigate them in <em>Weikel I. </em>\u2019\u2019The doctrine of res judicata gives conclusive effect to a final judgment rendered upon the merits by a court having jurisdiction of the cause. <em>(Goddard </em>v. <em>Security Title Ins. &amp; Guar. </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 47, 51 [92 P.2d 804].) \u2018The rule is based upon the sound public policy of limiting litigation by preventing a party who has had one fair trial on an issue from again drawing it into controversy.\u2019 <em>(Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 811 [122 P.2d 892].) \u2018Restatement Second of Judgments views the doctrine as a bar or merger applicable to subsequent litigation between the same parties concerning the same controversy with very few exceptions. The Restatement\u2019s approach is based on the assumption that <em>there has been an opportunity in the first litigation for a fair and full hearing of the claim asserted. </em>Once that opportunity has been afforded, the Restatement Second asserts, fairness dictates that the controversy in question be put to rest.\u2019 (Italics added.) <em>(Nakash </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 59, 68 [241 Cal.Rptr. 578].)\u201d <em>(Schultz </em>v. <em>Harney </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1619-1620 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 276].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The relevant question reduces to a determination whether the causes of action <em>resolved </em>in <em>Weikel I, </em>and those matters as to which Weikel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>then had an <em>opportunity </em>to litigate, embrace the claims sought to be asserted in <em>Weikel II. </em>This in turn requires a determination as to the \u201cprimary rights\u201d sought to be asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">\u201cFor purposes of identifying a cause of action under the doctrine of res judicata, \u2018California has consistently applied the \u201cprimary rights\u201d theory, under which the invasion of one primary right gives rise to a single cause of action.\u2019 <em>{Slater </em>v. <em>Blackwood </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 791, 795 [126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 543 P.2d 593].) But \u2018. . . the \u201ccause of action\u201d is based upon the harm suffered, as opposed to the particular theory asserted by the litigant. [Citation.] Even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated, one injury gives rise to only one claim for relief.\u2019 <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">\u201cUnder the primary rights theory advanced by Pomeroy, \u2018. . . a cause of action consists of 1) a primary right possessed by the plaintiff, 2) a corresponding primary duty devolving upon the defendant, and 3) a delict or wrong done by the defendant which consists in a breach of such primary right and duty. [Citation.] Thus, two actions constitute a single cause of action if they both affect the same primary right.\u2019 <em>(Gamble </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 893, 898 [280 Cal.Rptr. 457].)\u201d <em>(Branson </em>v. <em>Sun-Diamond Growers, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 340-341, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">In <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins.

The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">\u201cBay Cities had a single injury and thus a single cause of action against its attorney. \u2018California has consistently applied the \u201cprimary rights\u201d theory, under which the invasion of one primary right gives rise to a single cause of action.\u2019 <em>(Slater </em>v. <em>Blackwood[ </em>(1975)] 15 Cal.3d 791, 795 [126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 543 P.2d 593]; <em>Big Boy Drilling Corp. </em>v. <em>Rankin </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 646, 649 [3 P.2d 13]; 4 Witkin, Cal.

Bay Cities had one primary right\u2014the right to be free of negligence by its attorney in connection with the particular debt collection for which he was retained.

Even where there are multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be predicated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number><em>one injury </em>gives rise to only one claim for relief.\u2019 <em>(Slater </em>v. <em>Blackwood, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 791, 795, italics added.)

The second count claimed the lot split agreement was similarly breached. The third count alleged fraud, claiming TCW never intended to meet its promise to approve development by Weikel. Count four sought a declaration that Weikel had the right to rescind the 1988 access easements. Count six alleged Weikel had a right to an injunction against unreasonable surface water discharges onto Weikel\u2019s property. Count seven sought an injunction requiring TCW and Clark to modify the shop because of building code violations. Finally, Weikel\u2019s common count sought restitution of the value RBVA and TCW had received from the access easement Weikel had granted.\u201d <em>(Weikel I, supra, </em>No. D015050.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Earlier, we described the <em>Weikel II </em>pleadings: In <em>Weikel II, </em>Weikel sought to (1) quiet title to interests conveyed by the 1984 \u201cbuilding easement\u201d; (2) recover damages from TCW and the Clarks for a trespass \u201c[c]ommencing June 19, 1984, and continuing to this day\u201d; (3) abate a nuisance (the Clarks\u2019 building) which \u201c[c]ommenc[ed] May 29, 1985\u201d; (4) recover damages from RBVA for an alleged breach of warranty \u201c[c]ommencing April 18, 1984\u201d; (5) recover damages from RBVA for breach of an implied covenant \u201c[c]ommencing April 18, 1984\u201d; (6) obtain from the court various declarations of right against TCW, RBVA and the Clarks; (7) obtain restitution from RBVA and TCW for use of the easement; and (8) obtain another quiet title. <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 1243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>The substantial identity of these complaints is clear. The <em>Weikel I </em>\u201cbreach of covenant\u201d and \u201cfraud\u201d counts are essentially repeated in <em>Weikel II </em>as \u201cbreach of warranty\u201d and another \u201cbreach of covenant.\u201d The injunctive relief sought in <em>Weikel I </em>as to the structure in which the Clarks\u2019 store is located is identical to the claim asserted in <em>Weikel II </em>to \u201cabate a nuisance,\u201d and in both pleadings \u201crestitution\u201d for use of the easement is sought.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The single point thus remaining for decision is whether any other matter set out in <em>Weikel II </em>involves both (a) a different \u201cprimary right\u201d than set out in <em>Weikel I </em>and also (b) one which could not have been litigated therein. It appears not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Viewed under any light, the \u201cprimary right\u201d herein must be seen as Weikel\u2019s interest in constructing a building on a portion of the \u201cwedge.\u201d The \u201ccorresponding primary duty\u201d owed Weikel by TCW is no more than the duty not to unreasonably interfere with Weikel\u2019s rights, but that \u201cduty\u201d cannot be transmuted into an obligation to tear down the structure of an existing tenant of TCW, the Clarks, for the sole benefit of Weikel. Essentially, the refusal of TCW to damage its own tenant, the Clarks, for the benefit of Weikel, is the \u201cbreach of . . . primary right\u201d which is now in <em>Weikel II, </em>just as it was earlier in <em>Weikel I, </em>asserted by Weikel as a basis for judicial action. This does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Weikel\u2019s central theory is that when <em>Weikel I </em>was filed in 1989, the 1984 access easements were nullities, and thus no cause of action with respect to those instruments had \u201caccrued.\u201d We do not agree with this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">In the opposition counsel filed below to TCW\u2019s demurrer, it was admitted that while <em>Weikel I </em>\u201cfocused on the rights arising from the lot split agreement and the deed delivered pursuant to it,\u201d the case \u201calso involved implied rights arising from the 1984 contract [while] any rights arising from the 1984 deeds were excluded.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">This does not suffice to save the present allegations from an assertion.of the bar of res judicata. While counsel may have had a variety of reasons for having <em>chosen </em>to limit the scope of <em>Weikel I, </em>it is clear that the \u201crights arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>from\u201d all of the 1984 instruments <em>could have been </em>litigated therein. No more than this, as we have noted above, is required to bring into effect the bar of res judicata asserted below.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">As we observed in the last appeal, \u201c[tjhis lawsuit resulted from the conflict between Weikel\u2019s desire to build on the wedge and TCW\u2019s desire to preserve the integrity and beauty of Clark\u2019s shop.\u201d <em>(Weikel I, supra, </em>No. D015050.) Nothing whatsoever in the pleadings in <em>Weikel II, </em>or in any of the arguments advanced either below or in this court by counsel for Weikel, dispels the entailed conclusion that the \u201cconflict\u201d has not, since the time of the last appeal, become anything substantially different from what it once was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">All that has happened is that the focus of the pleadings in <em>Weikel II </em>has been changed from the (now-rescinded) \u201clot line adjustment\u201d which was at issue in <em>Weikel I </em>to the underlying earlier \u201caccess easements,\u201d also at issue in the earlier action. The true interest of Weikel, the ability to construct a building on a portion of the \u201cwedge,\u201d remains unchanged, as does the existence of the impediment to Weikel\u2019s desires, the unaltered structure housing the retail store operated by the Clarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Clearly, this claim must fail. Whatever the hypothetical merits of some theory considered in the abstract,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as applied to the particular matter before us, nothing whatsoever asserted as a basis for recovery in <em>Weikel II </em>involves matters which were not, or could not have been, litigated in <em>Weikel I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">As our Supreme Court has observed, \u201cThe primary right theory has a fairly narrow field of application. It is invoked most often when a plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce it in two suits. The theory prevents this result by either of two means: (1) if the first suit is still pending when the second is filed, the defendant in the second suit may plead that fact in abatement (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (c); <em>Wulfjen </em>v. <em>Dolton </em>[(1944)] 24 Cal.2d 891, 894-895 [151 P.2d 846]); or (2) if the first suit has terminated in a judgment on the merits adverse to the plaintiff, the defendant in the second suit may set up that judgment as a bar under the principles of res judicata <em>(Panos </em>v. <em>Great Western Packing Co. </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 636, 638-640 [134 P.2d 242]). The latter application of the primary right theory appears to be most common: numerous cases hold that <em>when there is only one </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number><em>primary right an adverse judgment in the first suit is a bar even though the second suit is based on a dijferent theory </em>(e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 427, 432 [203 Cal.Rptr. 638]) <em>or seeks a dijferent remedy </em>(e.g., <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Yerge </em>(1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 165, 171 [276 P.2d 649]).\u201d <em>(Crowley </em>v. <em>Katleman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 682 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 881 P.2d 1083], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">This case is a clear instance of a single \u201cprimary right\u201d which is sought to be asserted, after an adverse judgment in a first lawsuit, in a second proceeding, albeit somewhat \u201cbased on a different theory ... or seeking] a different remedy . . . .\u201d Under the cases set out above,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> an attempted reassertion of the same \u201cprimary right\u201d is properly subject to the bar of res judicata, as the trial court held herein. For these reasons, we must affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">Finally, we must observe that apart from the lack of merit in Weikel\u2019s suit, from every viewpoint, public policy demands the termination of this litigation. RBVA, for example, has not held any interest in the property since 1984. Surely it may be entitled to have this matter resolved in this century, just as the Clarks (essentially innocent bystanders in this collision of interests between property owners) are entitled to operate their business without either the threats of demolition or the need for more lawyers hanging over their heads, as has been true for over a decade now.  \u201cThe rule against splitting a cause of action is based upon two reasons: (1) That the defendant should be protected against vexatious litigation; and (2) that <em>it is against </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number><em>public policy to permit litigants to consume the time of the courts by relitigating matters already judicially determined, or by asserting claims which properly should have been settled in some prior action.'\u2019'\u2019 (Wulfjen </em>v. <em>Dolton </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 891, 894-895 [151 P.2d 846], italics added.) That holding applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">When all of this is considered in connection with the fact that the \u201cwedge\u201d <em>at its widest part </em>is only 11 yards wide, it is not reasonable to believe that the additional revenues (over and above those from the existing structure) from any structure Weikel might have erected thereon could have equalled the great amounts which have thus far been expended by Weikel in the course of litigation. (See, e.g., fn. 11, <em>ante.) </em>Our judicial system is intended for the resolution of disputes, rather than their perpetuation through the ages. In the circumstances before us, it would be against public policy to permit this litigation to continue, and we will not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondents TCW, RBVA and the Clarks to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Kremer, P.

(consolidated with <em>Weikel </em>v. <em>Rancho Bernardo Village Associates, </em>D015051, and <em>Weikel </em>v. <em>TCW Realty Fund II Holding Co., </em>D015055). Footnotes 2 through 7 from that opinion are included herein as originally numbered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">Easy access between the two centers would make them more desirable, because there would effectively be two anchor tenants (a Vons supermarket at the northern end, and a Savon Drugstore at the most southern end), creating customer traffic within the \u2018integrated\u2019 centers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A3A\">RBVA also agreed to replace certain landscaping and sprinklers its crews had destroyed; to remove a sidewalk on the western perimeter; to build a sidewalk to join the buildings on the eastern perimeter; to redesign parking and traffic flow in Weikel\u2019s parking lot; to construct certain improvements to control surface water drainage; and to drop plans for a kiosk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Weikel apparently discovered an error in the 1984 access easements and threatened to re-barricade the opening between the parking lots. One of the legal descriptions attached to the access easements contained the error: Instead of describing the parking area, it apparently described the area covered by the building easement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">We digress momentarily to note that there was some evidence from which a trier of fact could have concluded TCW was in fact aware that this earlier plat (showing the boundary line <em>skirting </em>the canopy) was later supplanted by the plat showing the new boundary line running <em>under </em>the canopy. Weikel\u2019s appellate briefs recite this evidence at length to support his claim TCW in fact knew where the new line would be located. Weikel\u2019s brief, however, ignores a most fundamental principle of appellate review: We view the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">One option left the property line in place while completely eliminating the northerly display windows and canopy as well as part of the westerly canopy. A second option moved the property line five feet back, but still required replacing the existing display windows with fire-rated windows (such as windows with chicken mesh) and removing a large part of the canopy. The third option\u2014the only one to preserve Clark\u2019s canopy and display windows\u2014 was deemed not viable by Weikel because it required installation of an unsightly fire wall which would block sight lines and customer traffic flow to all adjoining shops.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">The court also entered judgment in favor of the Clarks pursuant to the Clarks\u2019 motion for nonsuit brought at the close of Weikel\u2019s opening statement on the ground that Weikel had no private right to enjoin the alleged building code violations. The court also granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of RBVA, reasoning that the lot split agreement was a novation of the RBVA agreement and thus released RBVA from further liability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">The 12-page complaint in <em>Weikel II </em>is attached hereto as Appendix A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">In <em>Weikel </em>/, counsel for Weikel filed three separate appeals from the judgment, and also separate appeals from orders made as to attorney fees on the appeal.

The holding, however, was that \u201c[i]n the first action the harm alleged was breach of contractual obligations. In the present case the harm suffered by appellant is respondents\u2019 alleged tortious conduct which has prevented satisfaction of the judgment it won in the first action. Although appellant pleads various theories of recovery, they all address the same legal wrong\u2014respondents\u2019 tortious conduct preventing appellant from collecting on its judgment. Some of these theories happen to bear the same name as theories pleaded in the first case. But the primary right they embody is different and thus res judicata does not apply.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1837-1838, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"AOv\">The factual distinctions between <em>Brenelli </em>and the present matter make it inapplicable herein. This observation also applies to our decision in <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>First City Financial Corp. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 390, 402 [177 Cal.Rptr. 398], also relied upon by Weikel, as that case involved both a breach of contract and a subsequent, separate tort, which we held to be severable causes of action. Neither <em>Brenelli </em>nor <em>Sawyer </em>controls the resolution of the issues herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">This holding makes it unnecessary to discuss the alternative grounds raised by TCW of the statutes of limitation and of the failure to state a cause of action. A cursory inspection of the face of the complaint in <em>Weikel II, </em>however, demonstrates that under any view the entirety of the complaint is time-barred, and despite extensive discussion of various theories under which some causes are asserted to have been \u201ctolled,\u201d nothing in Weikel\u2019s arguments or authorities cited therein supports a contrary view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
