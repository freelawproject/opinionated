When the policy was issued, Wayne F. Bell, the company\u2019s manager, provided Empire with a copy of the Sonoma County ordinance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">During the policy period, Wayne F. Bell lost his driver\u2019s license, and in December 1992 he signed a \u201cDriver Exclusion\u201d endorsement excluding from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>coverage any accidents involving Wayne F. Bell as driver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 8, 1993, Natasha Downing was injured in an accident caused by Wayne F. Bell while he was operating an ambulance owned by Bell\u2019s Ambulance Service. (After the accident, Wayne F. Bell obtained a driver\u2019s license, and on March 30, 1993, he was reinstated as a driver under the policy.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">The insurer, Empire, filed the present declaratory relief action and then moved for summary judgment, asserting that pursuant to the driver exclusion Empire had no duty to defend or indemnify Bell\u2019s Ambulance Service (Bell).</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">Both Bell and cross-defendant Downing opposed the motion, raising various points of contention. Downing\u2019s principal argument rested upon the provision of the Sonoma County ordinance requiring ambulance services to maintain insurance coverage. Downing conceded that there were no disputed issues of fact but argued that the driver exclusion was ineffective as a matter of law in that it nullified the compulsory insurance provision of the Sonoma County ordinance. In response, Empire asserted that the Sonoma County ordinance is preempted by Insurance Code section 11580.1, which expressly allows a driver exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">The trial court granted Empire\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that there were no disputed issues of fact and as a matter of law Empire had no duty to defend or indemnify. The trial court reasoned that the driver exclusion is authorized by Insurance Code section 11580.1 and the Sonoma County ordinance could not require more of an insurer than is required by the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Downing appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment entered in favor of Empire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">Empire\u2019s position in this dispute is not well delineated. As we understand the argument, Empire contends that insurance companies are governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>exclusively by state law, viz., the Insurance Code; insurance companies cannot be subject to local regulations; the Insurance Code allows a driver exclusion such as the one agreed to here; therefore, the driver exclusion cannot be rendered ineffective by the Sonoma County ordinance. We reject Empire\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\">First, as we discuss in part A below, we reject Empire\u2019s assertion that the driver exclusion here is expressly permitted by the Insurance Code. Hence, we need not examine Empire\u2019s contention that the Insurance Code takes precedence over the Sonoma County ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">Furthermore, we reject Empire\u2019s argument that the Sonoma County ordinance is an ineffective regulation of insurance companies. The ordinance requires all ambulance services to obtain a permit from the county, and among the prerequisites for a permit is proof of liability insurance. As we will explain in part B, the Sonoma County ordinance is a valid and enforceable regulation of ambulance services,  Moreover, as we will explain in part C, when, as here, insurance coverage is required by law as a condition to doing business, the provisions of the compulsory insurance law are incorporated into the insurance contract so that an insurer providing a certificate of insurance as proof that the regulated business entity has insurance remains liable on its policy until the requisite notice has been given to the regulatory agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">A. <em>Insurance Code</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">In support of its contention that the driver exclusion endorsement is expressly authorized by the Insurance Code, Empire relies upon subdivision (d)(1) of section 11580.1, which allows an exclusion for a named driver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Downing persuasively argues, however, that Insurance Code section 11580.1 applies only to an \u201cautomobile liability policy,\u201d not to a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d for commercial passenger vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">The Legislature has distinguished in the Insurance Code and the Vehicle Code between an automobile liability policy and a motor vehicle liability policy. <em>{State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1455 [264 Cal.Rptr. 512].) An automobile liability insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>policy is essentially defined by Insurance Code section 11580.1, which lists various provisions that must be contained within an automobile liability policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 1465.) Expressly excepted from compliance with section 11580.1 of the Insurance Code are those policies to which Vehicle Code section 16450 et seq. applies. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.05.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Vehicle Code section 16450, in turn, defines a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">The distinction coincides with the different financial responsibility requirements imposed upon commercial and noncommercial vehicles.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Owners of <em>commercial </em>passenger vehicles (unless they are self-insured or post a bond or cash deposit) must maintain a <em>motor vehicle </em>liability insurance policy. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16500.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, owners of noncommercial vehicles may satisfy the financial responsibility requirements with <em>either </em>an automobile liability policy or a motor vehicle liability policy. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16054.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>In <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 1455, the court explained two key differences between the two types of policies. The first difference pertains to the process of proving financial responsibility. Owners of commercial passenger vehicles must maintain proof of financial responsibility at all times while conducting business. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16500, 16502.) Thus, a motor vehicle liability policy, which is required for commercial passenger vehicles, must be certified. That is, a certificate of insurance must be issued to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) as proof of financial responsibility as an incident to issuance of the policy. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16450.) In contrast, owners or drivers of noncommercial vehicles need only prove financial responsibility to the satisfaction of the DMV after a driver has been in an accident. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16050-16057.) An automobile liability policy need not be certified at the outset. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16054, subd. (b); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1466-1469.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\">The second key difference between the two types of policies pertains to the extent of coverage. A motor vehicle liability policy, which is required for commercial passenger vehicles, must cover all vehicles registered to or operated by the named insured. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16450-16452; <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1466-1469.) Coverage for an automobile liability policy, on the other hand, need not be as extensive. Pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.1, coverage for an automobile liability insurance policy may be excluded for particular vehicles. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, subd. (c)(8); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1466-1467.) And coverage may be excluded for particular operators. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, subd. (d)(1); <em>Associated Indem. Corp. </em>v. <em>King </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 470 [109 Cal.Rptr. 190].) We perceive that this difference, too, is based upon a legislative intent to provide more stringent financial responsibility requirements upon owners of commercial vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">From our reading of the whole of this statutory scheme, we conclude that Insurance Code section 11580.1 defines the contents of an automobile liability policy but not a motor vehicle liability policy. Under the financial responsibility laws, Bell\u2019s Ambulance Service was obligated to maintain a motor vehicle liability policy for its commercial passenger vehicles. (Veh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>Code, \u00a7 16500.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Hence, it is immaterial to the dispute here that a driver exclusion is authorized by Insurance Code section 11580.1 for automobile liability policies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">B. <em>Local Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Ambulance services are regulated and licensed by the California Highway Patrol (CHP). (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2500 et seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \u00a7 1100 et seq.) Vehicle Code section 2512 explicitly authorizes local authorities to adopt more restrictive regulations of ambulance services.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Sievert </em>v. <em>City of National City </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 234 [131 Cal.Rptr. 358], the court held that in light of that statutory authorization for local regulations, the city\u2019s ordinance requiring a permit to operate within the city was not preempted by state law. (See also <em>Bell </em>v. <em>City of Mountain View </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 332, 338-339 [136 Cal.Rptr. 8] [city ordinance requiring ambulance license not preempted]; but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 221 [40 Cal.Rptr. 121] [state laws governing licensing of drivers completely occupy the field and render local legislation invalid].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">With respect to financial responsibility obligations in particular, again the state statutory scheme leaves room for supplemental local legislation. The statewide regulations issued by the CHP commissioner require ambulance services to meet the financial responsibility requirements imposed upon commercial passenger vehicles pursuant to Vehicle Code section 16500. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \u00a7 1106.2.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Vehicle Code section 16500, in turn, provides that owners of commercial passenger vehicles not regulated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>Public Utilities Commission (PUC) are required either to maintain motor vehicle liability insurance, to provide a bond or cash deposit, or to qualify as a self-insurer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Vehicle Code section 16501 expressly allows local regulation of commercial passenger vehicles as well.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Holloway </em>(1920) 45 Cal.App. 634 [188 P. 577] [city ordinance required copy of insurance policy to be filed with city as condition for obtaining permit].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">Explicitly, then, the state statutes have left room for local regulation. Vehicle Code section 2512 permits local regulation of ambulance services, and Vehicle Code section 16501 allows local authorities to impose financial responsibility requirements upon commercial passenger vehicles. In light of this statutory authorization given to local authorities, the Sonoma County ordinance unquestionably has full legal force and effect.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">C. <em>Compulsory Insurance Coverage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">As we have already observed, owners of ambulance services must comply with the financial responsibility requirements imposed upon owners of commercial passenger vehicles. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \u00a7 1106.2.) That is, (unless they are self-insured or post a bond or cash deposit) they must provide proof to the DMV of motor vehicle liability insurance with coverage of at least $15,000 for each person injured or killed. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16450, 16500.) And the insurer providing the certificate of insurance must give notice to the DMV within 10 days after the insurance is canceled. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16433.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">The relevant provisions of the Sonoma County ordinance supplement the state financial responsibility laws by requiring ambulance services to maintain liability insurance coverage of at least $1 million; to name the county as an additional insured under the policy; to file a certificate of insurance with the county prior to issuance of a permit; and to include within the policy a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>provision requiring 15 days\u2019 notice to the county prior to cancellation or modification of the policy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (See fn. 1, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">In this appeal, Downing makes an argument somewhat different from her argument below. In the proceedings below, Downing argued that the driver exclusion endorsement was invalid as it conflicted with the provision of the ordinance requiring Bell to maintain liability insurance coverage,  On appeal, Downing emphasizes the advance notice requirement contained within the Sonoma County ordinance (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>and she persuasively argues that the consequence of that advance notice requirement is that coverage remains in effect until notice has been given to the county and the 15-day waiting period has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The Supreme Court has recognized that when, as here, insurance coverage is required by law as a condition to doing business, the statutory provisions creating that requirement are incorporated into the insurance contract. \u201cThe obligations of such a policy are measured and defined by the pertinent statute, and the two together form the insurance contract. . . . [T]he insurance carrier is done no injustice when its rights are determined thereunder. [&lt;]Q Any provisions of such a policy which are in conflict with the pertinent statutes are nullified and superseded to that extent, particularly where the policy itself, expressly so provides.\u201d (6c Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (Buckley ed. 1979) \u00a7 4463, pp. 615-617, fns. omitted; quoted in <em>Samson </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 220, 231 [178 Cal.Rptr. 343, 636 P.2d 32]; accord, <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tab Transportation, Inc. </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 389, 398-399 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 159, 906 P.2d 1341]; see also <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Employees\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 31, 37-40 [307 P.2d 359].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">That principle was applied in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1154 [286 Cal.Rptr. 146], where the insured, a highway transporter, was required by state law (Pub. Util. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 3631, 3634) to maintain insurance coverage and to give 30 days\u2019 notice of cancellation to the PUC. The insured substituted insurance carriers, changing from Fireman\u2019s Fund to Allstate, but failed to notify the PUC of the change. In a dispute between the two insurance carriers, the court held that the effect of noncompliance with the statutory advance notice requirement is continued coverage; hence, Fireman\u2019s Fund, the original insurer, remained liable despite the cancellation of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>The court reasoned that the financial responsibility law is intended to protect the public from inadequately insured transporters, and this statutory purpose is advanced by enforcing continuous coverage. Moreover, the court observed that providing continuous coverage until the PUC receives notice may deter lax practices by insurers. And finally, the court noted that the initial burden on Fireman\u2019s Fund was minimal; Fireman\u2019s Fund could easily have eliminated its exposure simply by giving the required notice. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1161-1166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-4\">More recently, the Supreme Court followed the <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>case and held that where there had been no compliance with the notice requirement, coverage on a liability policy obtained by a highway transporter continued in effect even though the one-year policy had expired by its terms. (Transamer<em>ica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tab Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 389.) The court affirmed the principle that the regulatory scheme requiring highway transporters to maintain liability insurance and to give notice of cancellation to the PUC is incorporated into the insurance policy. The court then went on to hold that a PUC regulation declaring that the insurance policy remains in force until canceled served to amend the original provisions of the insurance policy so that the policy could not lapse by reason of the expiration of the policy term; rather, coverage continued in accordance with the regulatory scheme until the policy was canceled and the PUC was notified of the cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">In the present case, the parties have not cited the <em>Transamerica </em>case in their briefs. Empire seeks to distinguish the <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>case on two grounds. First, Empire emphasizes that the financial responsibility law (Pub. Util. Code, former \u00a7 3634) applicable in the <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>case provided for immediate suspension of the transporter\u2019s permit in the event the transporter failed to maintain adequate liability protection. Empire argues that in the present case, in contrast, there is no certainty that Bell\u2019s permit to operate the ambulance service would have been suspended even if the county had been notified of the driver exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">We reject the argument. The fact that a transporter would be <em>immediately </em>suspended was not determinative of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund. </em>Rather, the court reasoned that the statutory scheme as a whole was intended to enforce continuous coverage during the life of the transporter\u2019s permit. Here, too, the financial responsibility laws reflect an intent to compel continuous coverage. The Sonoma County ordinance requires an ambulance service to obtain a permit from the county before operating; and the permit-tee must maintain insurance coverage. The ordinance further provides that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>permit may be suspended or revoked if the ambulance service is operated in violation of any applicable law or regulation pertaining to ambulance operations. (Sonoma County Code, \u00a7 28-5(j)(10).) As already noted, the CHP regulation requires an ambulance service to comply with the financial responsibility requirements of the Vehicle Code. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \u00a7 1106.2.) Within this context, we infer that the purpose of the 15-day notice to the county is to enable the county to suspend or revoke the permit of the ambulance service when adequate insurance coverage is not maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">Empire finds a second distinction between the present case and the <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>case in that the insured in that case was regulated by the PUC while Bell here was not. In our view, however, that distinction is inconsequential. The financial responsibility requirements imposed upon highway transporters by the Public Utilities Code are analogous to those imposed upon ambulance services. Ambulance services, like highway transporters, are required to obtain liability insurance and to submit proof to the regulatory agency.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The regulatory schemes for both ambulance services and highway transporters require advance notice of cancellation to the regulatory agency. Both regulatory schemes are designed to protect the public from financially irresponsible owners of vehicles.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">The fact that ambulance services are governed both by state law and by local ordinance does not denigrate the legal force of the Sonoma County ordinance. The Sonoma County ordinance is, as we have explained above, no less binding than a state law. Accordingly, the provisions of the ordinance, requiring Bell to maintain insurance coverage and requiring advance notice to the county of any modification or termination of coverage, are incorporated into the insurance policy <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>Empire additionally argues that under the terms of the ordinance the insurer itself has no duty to notify the county of any change in liability coverage; hence, Empire should not be penalized for the absence of notice. This argument, however, finds no support in the case law. In both <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund </em>and <em>Transamerica, </em>the courts placed the burden on the insurer, even though the statute itself did not specify who must undertake to give notice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Supreme Court explained as follows: \u201cAn insurer that files with the PUC a \u2018certificate of insurance\u2019 as proof that a highway carrier has insurance, as was done here, remains liable on its policy until that policy is canceled by giving the requisite 30 days\u2019 written notice to the PUC. . . . [&lt;fl] In addition to providing an efficient means for the PUC to administer the Act\u2019s financial responsibility requirements imposed on highway carriers, the certificate of insurance on file with the PUC serves as assurance that the public is protected in the event of an accident involving a particular highway carrier. These important considerations far outweigh the slight burden imposed by statute on an insurer of providing the PUC with 30 days\u2019 written notice of cancellation of a liability policy issued to a highway carrier.\u201d <em>(Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tab Transportation, Inc., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at pp. 402-403; see also <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1165-1166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">So, too, in the present case, the certificate of insurance provided to the county by Empire as proof of Bell\u2019s compliance with the financial responsibility requirements served as assurance that Bell\u2019s insurance coverage remained in full force and effect.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>\n                   Until the county was notified otherwise, Empire remained liable on its policy.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that Empire has no duty to defend or indemnify. The effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>the Sonoma County ordinance is to provide for continuous insurance coverage until the county is notified and the 15-day waiting period has expired. In the absence of notice to the county of the driver exclusion endorsement, coverage under the Empire policy continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\"> The record in this case, however, does not reflect whether notice of the driver exclusion was given to the county.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the proceedings below, the parties did not address the notice requirement. Downing argued in opposition to Empire\u2019s summary judgment motion that the driver exclusion was ineffective as it violated the provision of the ordinance requiring Bell to maintain liability insurance coverage. Empire responded with the legal argument that the Sonoma County ordinance was preempted by the Insurance Code. Because the trial court had no occasion to examine whether a factual dispute exists on whether the county was notified of the driver exclusion endorsement, we remand the matter for further proceedings on the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">The judgment is reversed. Costs are awarded to appellant Downing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">Strankman, P.

As we will explain in part C, <em>post, </em>the requirements of the financial responsibility laws are implicitly made a part of the insurance policy. Hence, we do not examine whether the Empire policy, as written, complied with the statutory requirements of a motor vehicle policy.

(c).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">Empire seeks to avoid liability under the policy based upon a disclaimer contained in the certificate of insurance: \u201cShould any of the above described policies be canceled before the expiration date thereof, the issuing company will endeavor to mail 10 days written notice to the certificate holder named to the left [Sonoma County Emergency Services Agency], but failure to mail such notice shall impose no obligation or liability of any kind upon the company, its agents or representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AT8\">We summarily reject the argument. A certificate of insurance is merely evidence that a policy has been issued. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 384.) It is not a contract between the insurer and the certificate holder. (13A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7530 (1996-1997 pocket supp.) p. 20; <em>United States P. &amp; Fdry. Co. </em>v. <em>United States F. &amp; G. Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1974) 505 F.2d 88, 89.) Obviously Empire could not, simply by inserting a provision in the certificate of insurance, eliminate its obligation under state law to give notice of insurance cancellation to the DMV. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 16433.) Nor can Empire eliminate its obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>pursuant to the Sonoma County ordinance to give advance notice of insurance cancellation or modification to the county.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">Downing has asked this court to take judicial notice of a declaration of a county official attesting that no notice was received.
