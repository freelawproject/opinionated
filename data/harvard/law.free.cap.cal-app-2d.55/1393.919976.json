Andrade stipulated to a judgment that he was the father of Candace Jade Booth. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>submitted an income and expense declaration stating that his average gross monthly income for the past 12 months had been $1,700. At the support hearing, Andrade indicated that he had just received a raise, and that his gross monthly income was $1,837.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">Placer County argued that in 1994 and 1995, Andrade\u2019s gross monthly income, including overtime and bonuses, had been $2,287 and $2,318, respectively, and that in the first six months of 1996, his average gross income was $2,617 per month. Andrade\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cthe overtime is speculative and, in fact, he\u2019s been cut back almost to nothing due to a merger which his employer\u2019s currently going through, the overtime shouldn\u2019t be calculated into his earnings for the purposes of this support order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">The court determined that Andrade\u2019s gross annual income was $1,924 per month, stating, \u201cI\u2019m not going to force overtime. . . . [Bjased on the case of <em>Simpson,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I do not include overtime. And especially in the situation where it varies from month to month.\u201d When pressed by Placer County, the court responded, \u201c[Bjased on a full time, with regular work regimen, I don\u2019t think under <em>Simpson </em>we\u2019re allowed to force a person to work overtime unless they are in a job situation where they are the manager of a restaurant and their regular work schedule is 55 hours a week. That, pursuant to this pay stub, is not Mr. Andrade\u2019s regular work schedule. He works a regular\u2014full-time work period. Occasionally he has overtime. He has occasionally, double time. He occasionally gets bonuses. So, it just varies from paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m not going to force him to work overtime. It\u2019s like we don\u2019t force people to work second jobs.\u201d Based on a gross monthly income of $1,924, the court ordered Andrade to pay ongoing child support in the amount of $254.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">Placer County claims the court erred in excluding Andrade\u2019s bonus and overtime earnings from his income for the purpose of determining his child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">Family Code section <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides a formula for determining the amount of child support based on the net disposable incomes of the parents. The court must calculate the \u201cannual gross income\u201d of the parent, defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>section 4058<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as \u201cincome from whatever source derived,\u201d except as specified, including \u201cbut not limited to\u201d wages and bonuses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From this is derived the parent\u2019s monthly net disposable income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Overtime is not excluded from the definition of \u201cannual gross income\u201d and the definition is broad enough to include overtime either under the term \u201cwages\u201d or within the inclusive \u201cincome from whatever source . . . .\u201d Bonuses are specifically included in the definition of \u201cannual gross income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">The assumption underlying these calculations is that past income is a good measure of the future income from which the parent must pay support. However, the law recognizes that is not always the case. Thus, the court is given discretion to adjust the \u201cthe monthly net disposable income figure [if it] does not accurately reflect the . . . <em>prospective </em>earnings of the parties at the time the determination of support is made ....\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 4060, italics added.) The \u201ccourt may [also], in its discretion, consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent\u2019s income, consistent with the best interests of the children.\u201d (\u00a7 4058, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">At issue is whether Andrade\u2019s past earnings accurately reflect his prospective earnings. Andrade had earned bonus and overtime pay for the two and one-half year period preceding the support hearing. The trial court was unwilling to include this in calculating Andrade\u2019s income because the amount varied from month to month, and because it refused to \u201cforce\u201d Andrade to work overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">The court cannot deduct predictable overtime and bonuses in determining Andrade\u2019s prospective earnings merely because they occur sporadically. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>mechanism for calculating Andrade\u2019s net disposable income is a monthly average. (\u00a7 4060.) The question is whether the bonuses and overtime are likely to reoccur. Absent a determination that \u201cthe monthly net disposable income figure does not accurately reflect [Andrade\u2019s] . . . prospective earnings,\u201d it was error for the court to exclude overtime and bonuses in its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">The court can disregard past bonus and overtime payments from the calculation only if it determines that Andrade is unlikely to receive them in the future. That might occur because of changed employment conditions, as suggested by Andrade\u2019s counsel. However, such a change should be shown by admissible evidence. A showing that a parent is unlikely to receive overtime might also be based upon evidence that the parent is no longer willing to accept voluntary overtime. The record indicates Andrade has been voluntarily working overtime for the previous two and one half years. If he continues to do so there is no ground to exclude the overtime payments. If he voluntarily ceases to work overtime the trial court may then decide \u201cin its discretion, [whether to] consider [Andrade\u2019s overtime] earning capacity\u201d (\u00a7 4058, subd. (b)) pursuant to the criteria set forth in <em>In re Marriage of Simpson, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">On the record before us there is no substantial evidence of either basis to disregard Andrade\u2019s past bonus and pay overtime in calculating his support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for a determination whether Andrade\u2019s past monthly net disposable income, including his overtime and bonus income, accurately reflects his prospective earnings. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Puglia, P.
