She sued HBS, Luis E. Lomeli, William Depew, Elmo Saunders, and Misae Saunders for breach of employment contract and related claims. HBS cross-complained against Williams and California State Integrators, Inc. (CSI), a company in which Williams served as an officer, director, and majority shareholder, for breach of fiduciary duty and related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Misae Saunders appeals from the judgment enforcing settlement of the employment dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Citing <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 896 P.2d 171], she argues judgment should be reversed because she was not present at the settlement negotiations, did not personally sign the terms of settlement on November 17, 1995, and did not authorize anyone to act on her behalf. Misae Saunders also asserts the November 17, 1995, writing did not represent the final agreement between the parties because it contemplated execution of another document. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The parties agreed to mediate their dispute on November 17, 1995, and selected Lloyd Phillips, Jr., a retired superior court judge, as mediator. All parties to the lawsuit attended the mediation except Misae Saunders, who was out of the country. Each party was represented by counsel, including Melinda Guzman Moore for Williams in her capacity as cross-defendant and Randolph Cooke for the individual defendants, including Elmo and Misae Saunders.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">The parties settled the case and Moore made handwritten notes of the settlement terms, including the agreement to provide \u201cFull and Final Mutual Releases signed by parties of all claims directly and indirectly related.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The handwritten document was signed by those present, including Cooke and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>Elmo Saunders. There is conflicting evidence whether anyone was authorized to act on Misae Saunders\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">On November 21, 1995, Moore drafted and circulated for signature a \u201cMutual Full and Final Release of All Claims.\u201d The document provided for release of all claims, known and unknown, and included an express waiver of Civil Code section <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is conflicting evidence whether the parties agreed to waive that statute during the November 17, 1995, mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Williams fulfilled her settlement obligations by signing the release on November 29, 1995, and dismissing her complaint with prejudice. Williams also returned the HBS stock to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">HBS dismissed its cross-complaint with prejudice, but HBS and the individual defendants refused to sign the formal release prepared by Moore. Meanwhile, HBS president Lomeli informed shareholders at the February 8, 1996, shareholders\u2019 meeting that the corporation had performed its side of the settlement agreement and the case with Williams was over. At the same meeting, HBS assigned all its \u201cknown and unknown\u201d rights, except for specified accounts receivable, to Misae Saunders \u201cfor her personal usage.\u201d Shareholders then dissolved the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Neither HBS nor the individual defendants had signed the formal release when Williams successfully moved for entry of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 in May 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court did not specifically address the legal effect of Misae Saunders\u2019s failure to personally sign the handwritten settlement agreement, although Elmo Saunders, Depew, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>and Lomeli raised the issue in response to Williams\u2019s motion. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 578, was decided almost a year before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Elmo Saunders filed a notice of appeal on behalf of Misae Saunders and signed it as \u201cElmo Saunders, Counsel for Defendant and Appellant.\u201d He filed an amended notice of appeal the same day, signing it as \u201cCounsel in Pro Per for Defendant.\u201d This court denied Williams\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under California Rules of Court, rule 1(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">The trial court\u2019s factual findings on a motion to enforce settlement pursuant to section 664.6 are subject to limited appellate review and will not be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Kohn </em>v. <em>Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 780].) Where, as here, the central issue on appeal involves the construction and application of a statute, the court conducts an independent review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Burckhard </em>v. <em>Del Monte Corp. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1912, 1916 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">\n<em>Authority to Settle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Misae Saunders argues the judgment should be reversed because she did not participate in mediation or personally sign the November 17, 1995, handwritten settlement agreement. We agree she is not bound by the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">In <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 578, the parties\u2019 attorneys negotiated settlement of an action to collect attorney fees; the litigants were not involved in the settlement discussions. When one litigant refused to sign the formal settlement agreement presented by his attorney, the other moved for judgment under section 664.6. (10 Cal.4th at pp. 580-581.) The trial court denied the motion, following a line of cases which held the signature of the attorney alone was insufficient to create a binding settlement agreement for purposes of section 664.6. (10 Cal.4th at p. 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">The Court of Appeal denied a petition for writ of mandate, and the Supreme Court issued an alternative writ to resolve the conflict among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>Courts of Appeal. <em>(Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 581.) It held the term \u201cparties\u201d in section 664.6 means the litigants themselves, and does not include their attorneys of record. (10 Cal.4th at p. 586, see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1700 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 740] [this court applied the same definition to oral agreements to settle where the litigant never personally informed the court he approved the agreement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">In <em>Levy, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged the term \u201cparty,\u201d as used in a number of procedural statutes, is commonly understood to mean the actual litigant as well as the litigant\u2019s attorney of record. (10 Cal.4th at p. 583.) It noted the term \u201cis also susceptible of a narrower meaning, namely the specific person or entity by or against whom legal proceedings are brought.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The court turned to the intent of the Legislature in drafting section 664.6 to determine which definition of \u201cparties\u201d should prevail. (10 Cal.4th at pp. 582-583.) The high court concluded the latter definition applies when the \u201cthe subject of the statute may affect the substantial rights of the litigants themselves, . . .\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 583.) It reasoned that \u201c[bjecause the settlement of a lawsuit is a decision to end the litigation, it obviously implicates a substantial right of the litigants themselves.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Here, unlike <em>Levy </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>the court found that Misae Saunders authorized her husband, in addition to her attorney, to act on her behalf. Although <em>Levy </em>does not address the question whether the signature of a spouse and codefendant is sufficient to demonstrate assent to settlement terms for purposes of section 664.6, the court\u2019s assessment of the intent of the legislation supports the conclusion it is not. The Supreme Court stated <em>the Legislature \u201ccreated a summary, expedited procedure to enforce settlement agreements when certain requirements that decrease the likelihood of misunderstandings are met. </em>Thus the statute requires the \u2018parties\u2019 to stipulate in writing or orally before the court that they have settled the case. The litigants\u2019 direct participation tends to ensure that the settlement is the result of their mature reflection and deliberate assent. This protects the parties against hasty and improvident settlement agreements by impressing upon them the seriousness and finality of the decision to settle, and minimizes the possibility of conflicting interpretations of the settlement. [Citations.] It also protects parties from impairment of their substantial rights without their knowledge and consent.\u201d <em>{Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 585, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Because Misae Saunders did not participate in mediation nor sign the November 17, 1995, settlement agreement, we conclude the court erred in enforcing the settlement against her. We express no opinion whether Williams can litigate her agency theories in a different motion or separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>proceeding. (See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 584-585, 586, fn. 5; and <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Kenneally </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 523, 530 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 671].) Given our resolution of this issue, we need not address the other claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The judgment is reversed as to Misae Saunders. Defendant Saunders shall recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Puglia, P. J., and Morrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 17, 1997, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 3, 1997.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The language of Mrs. Saunders\u2019s brief suggests she appeals on behalf of herself and HBS, the corporation. She complains Lomeli was not authorized by the HBS board of directors to bind the corporation to the November 17,1995, settlement agreement. However, HBS did not file a notice of appeal, and its claims of error are not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The other settlement terms included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">a.
