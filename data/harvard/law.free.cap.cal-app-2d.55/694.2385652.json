The notice of appeal in the present case from the aforementioned order was filed August 3, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">This is the sole question necessary for us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">Was <em>appellant\u2019s notice of appeal filed within the time prescribed by section 939 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to wit, within sixty days from the entry of the order in the trial court terminating the proceedings for the preparation of the transcript to be used on appeal?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">This question must be answered in the affirmative and is governed by the following principles of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">(1) The time for filing a notice of appeal runs from the actual entry of the order from which an appeal is taken in the <em>regular minutes </em>of the court and not from the entry in the \u201crough minutes\u201d of the clerk. <em>(Berman </em>v. <em>Blankenship Motors, </em>140 Cal.App. 134, 135 [34 P.2d 1035]; see, also, 2 Cal.Jur. (1921) 396, \u00a7 166.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">(2) The time within which an action provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, in which event it is also excluded. (\u00a7 12, Code Civ. Proc.; <em>Adolph Ramish, Inc., </em>v. <em>Behr, </em>40 Cal.App.2d 54, 55 [104 P.2d 410].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">(3) Where the last day of the period within which an appeal from an order is permitted is Sunday, a non-judicial day, an appeal filed on the following day, Monday, is in time. <em>(Estate of Rose, </em>63 Cal. 346, 347; <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Sweitzer, </em>34 Cal.App.2d 441 [93 P.2d 831].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">Applying the foregoing rules to the facts of the instant case, appellant pursuant to the provisions of section 939 of the Code of Civil Procedure had sixty days from the entry of the order in the trial court within which to appeal from the same. The sixty-day period commenced to run on June 3, the date the order was entered in the regular minutes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the court.  The sixtieth day thus fell on August <em>2, </em>1942, which was Sunday, and, therefore, under the second rule above stated should be excluded in computing the time within which appellant was permitted to appeal, and the notice of appeal, having been filed on the following day, Monday, August 3, 1942, was filed within time.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">For the foregoing reasons the motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Moore, P. J., and Wood (W. J.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
