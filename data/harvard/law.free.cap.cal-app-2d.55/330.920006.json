We issued an order to show cause and a temporary stay order on February 6, 1997.

Real parties are employees and relatives of employees of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads.

Its provisions were not, therefore, so pervasive as to preempt the entire field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">\u201cThe Act was amended in 1988 to include \u2018any person,\u2019 but [petitioner\u2019s] predecessor went out of business in 1956, excluding it from the provisions of the 1988 amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s] motion as to this issue is therefore denied.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Petitioner contends the superior court erred in finding that Congress did not intend to preempt the field of locomotive parts and equipment regulation. Petitioner does not contest the lower court\u2019s findings on the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We begin with a discussion of preemption and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">1. <em>Preemption principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The doctrine of federal preemption is derived from the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI) and is designed to prevent the states from impinging on federal law and policy. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 516 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407].) Preemption can occur in three instances: (1) where Congress expressly specifies that its enactment preempts state law (express preemption); (2) where there is a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive that there is a reasonable inference that Congress intended to dominate the field and state laws on the same subject are precluded (field preemption); and (3) where federal law actually conflicts with state law and it is impossible for a private party to comply with both requirements (conflict preemption). <em>(English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 72, 78-79 [110 S.Ct. 2270, 2274-2275, 110 L.Ed.2d 65].) \u201cPreemption fundamentally is a question of congressional intent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 78-79 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2275].) All preemption cases begin with the presumption that federal statutes do not supersede the historic police powers of the state unless Congress manifests a clear intent to do so. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 516 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2617]; <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>Hyundai Motor Co. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1672,1678 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 595], citing <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S._[116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700].) It is the burden of the party claiming preemption to prove Congress\u2019s intent. <em>(De Canas </em>v. <em>Bica </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 351, 357 [96 S.Ct. 933, 937, 47 L.Ed.2d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>2. <em>The BIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The BIA was enacted in 1911, as an amendment to the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 et seq.). <em>(Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 163, 189 [69 S.Ct. 1018, 1034, 93 L.Ed. 1282, 11 A.L.R.2d 252].) In its original codification, the BIA provided, inter alia: (1) that it applied to any common carrier or carriers (defined as a railroad), their officers, agents, and employees, engaged in the transportation of passengers or property by railroad; (2) that it was unlawful for any common carrier to use any locomotive engine propelled by steam unless its boiler and appurtenances were in proper condition and safe to operate, and that all boilers shall be inspected from time to time and be able to withstand such test or tests as prescribed in the rules and regulations therein; (3) that a chief inspector and two assistant inspectors shall be appointed to ascertain that common carriers observe the requirements of the act; (4) there would be fifty inspectors assigned to the different states, each having certain job qualifications; (5) that each common carrier was required to file its rules and instructions for inspection with the chief inspector; (6) that each inspector had certain specified duties; (7) that the chief inspector must report to the Interstate Commerce Commission on an annual basis; and (8) that a statement of all accidents must be filed with the chief inspector. (Pub.L. No. 383 (1911) \u00a7\u00a7 1-8, 36 Stat. 913-916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In addition, it contained a provision \u201cThat any common carrier violating this Act or any rule or regulation made under its provisions or any lawful order of any inspector shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars for each and every such violation, to be recovered in a suit or suits to be brought by the United States attorney. . . .\u201d (Pub.L. No. 383 (1911) \u00a79, 36 Stat. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In 1915 and 1924, the BIA was amended to include the entire locomotive and all its parts. The statute was also amended several times between 1940 and 1980 in portions not pertinent to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In 1988 and 1992, however, the civil penalty provision of the BIA was amended to read as follows: \u201cAny person (including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or other employee or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any independent contractor providing goods or services to a railroad; and any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor) violating sections 22 to 29 and 31 to 34 of this title, or any rule or regulation made under its provisions or any lawful order of any inspector, shall be liable to a penalty. . . .\u201d (Former 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 34, Pub.L. No. 100-342 (1988) \u00a7 14(7), 102 Stat. 633; Pub.L. No. 102-365 (1992) \u00a7 9(a)(8), 106 Stat. 978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The purpose in enacting the BIA was to protect train service employees and the traveling public from defective locomotive boilers and equipment. <em>(Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>337 U.S. at pp. 190-191 [69 S.Ct. at pp. 1034-1035].) \u201c[I]t has been held consistently that the [BIA] supplements the [FELA] by imposing on interstate railroads \u2018an absolute and continuing duty\u2019 to provide safe equipment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 188 [69 S.Ct. at p. 1034].) In addition to the civil penalty, a person harmed by violation of the BIA is given recourse to sue under FELA, which applies only to railroad employees injured while engaged in interstate commerce. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 189 [69 S.Ct. at p. 1034]; see <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Cedar Rapids &amp; I.C.R. Co. </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 164, 166 [89 S.Ct. 1706, 1708, 23 L.Ed.2d 176].) FELA provides the exclusive remedy for recovery of damages against a railroad by its employees. (L<em>illy </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk R. Co. </em>(1943) 317 U.S. 481, 485 [63 S.Ct. 347, 350-351, 87 L.Ed. 411].) FELA liability is expressly limited to common carriers. (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Summary of Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">1. <em>Petitioner\u2019s argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is based principally on the 1926 case, <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line </em>(1926) 272 U.S. 605 [47 S.Ct. 207, 71 L.Ed. 432], which specifically addressed the scope and effect of the BIA. <em>Napier </em>involved challenges to two state statutes which prescribed specifications for devices to be installed on locomotives. The United States Supreme Court held that states were precluded from imposing additional requirements for locomotive equipment based on the federal preemption by the BIA. The court noted that the BIA gives the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to regulate the design, construction and material of every part of the locomotive, and thus, the states may not impinge upon that authority. It determined that the BIA is intended to occupy \u201cthe field of regulating locomotive equipment used on a highway of interstate commerce,\u201d even with respect to locomotives that are operated wholly within one state and those not engaged in hauling interstate freight or passengers. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 607, 613 [47 S.Ct. at pp. 207-208, 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">2. <em>Real parties\u2019 argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Real parties rely primarily on the reasoning employed by two recent Supreme Court decisions filed more than fifty years after the <em>Napier </em>case, <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, supra, </em>518 U.S._[116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700], and <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp. </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 238 [104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443]. They urge that those cases, rather than <em>Napier, </em>should control.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Next, they argue that the BIA is expressly limited to regulating operating locomotives, in use, while on the line of a railroad, and does not apply to the work performed by real parties because it was performed in railroad terminals and repair shops, and that during the relevant time period, BIA did not regulate petitioner\u2019s predecessor because it stopped building locomotives in 1956, before the statute was amended to include manufacturers. Finally, they contend that case law cited by petitioner applies only to cases where the alleged injury resulted from the failure to add on or install extra devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">3. <em>Petitioner\u2019s reply</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Petitioner, in its reply brief, argues that <em>Napier, </em>which directly addresses the issue, is still good law, and has been followed by other lower federal courts. It asserts that <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood, </em>on the other hand, involve different statutes and are simply not applicable because an entirely different preemption analysis was employed by these cases. Finally, it asserts that the \u201con line\u201d requirement is not meant to preclude the regulatory effect of the BIA, and furthermore, that there has been no factual showing that the injuries were sustained only from work performed on locomotives that were off line.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Read in a vacuum, the <em>Napier </em>case appears to directly address and resolve the issue of whether real parties\u2019 action is preempted by the BIA. However, we must look to a number of other factors, and, in so doing, we conclude that the action is not preempted. A more correct statement of the problem before us is: may state tort liability be imposed on a manufacturer of locomotive parts? Crucial to a discussion of this case is a thorough review of the two recent Supreme Court cases relied upon by real parties, <em>Silkwood </em>and <em>Medtronic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">In <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, supra, </em>518 U.S. _ [116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700], a woman injured when her pacemaker failed sued the manufacturer of the pacemaker. The federal district court in Florida dismissed the entire complaint on the grounds that the federal statute known as the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c et seq.) expressly preempted state law on the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use. The United States Supreme Court, noting the presumption against preemption, examined the purpose of the legislation, the structure and purpose of the entire statute. The court first considered the presumption against preemption and then ascertained congressional purpose, not only from the preemption clause, but from the statutory framework of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>MDA as a whole. It considered how Congress intended the MDA to affect business, consumers, and the law, and concluded that Congress did not intend to bar consumers from any relief from injuries from medical devices. It observed that the MDA did not contain any provision regarding a right of action against manufacturers. The court found nothing in the legislative history which indicated that Congress meant to preclude product liability suits, which were prevalent at the time of enactment. It reviewed the express preemption clause in the MDA, which prohibited establishment of any state <em>requirement </em>different from that contained in the MDA and determined that the express preemption of requirements imposed by the states did not necessarily preclude all common law tort actions. (518 U.S. at pp._-_ [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2251-2253, 135 L.Ed.2d at pp. 716-719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In the well-known case of <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., supra, </em>464 U.S. 238, a nuclear laboratory worker\u2019s father sued under common law tort principles under Oklahoma law for injuries his deceased daughter had suffered from plutonium contamination. The jury\u2019s multimillion dollar punitive damages verdict was reversed by the federal circuit court of appeals on the grounds that it was preempted by the federal Atomic Energy Act. The Supreme Court employed both a field preemption and a conflict preemption analysis, in contrast to an earlier decision, <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. </em>v. <em>Energy Resources Comm\u2019n </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 190 [103 S.Ct. 1713, 75 L.Ed.2d 752] in which it had held that the same statute was intended to occupy the \u201centire field of nuclear safety concerns.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 212 [103 S.Ct. at p. 1726].) It looked at the legislative history which revealed a congressional awareness of tort remedies in a related piece of legislation and found no evidence that Congress intended to preclude state law remedies. In addition, it found that the Atomic Energy Act\u2019s scheme for the assessment of civil penalties did not conflict with an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Applying the more recently articulated tests of <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood, </em>we conclude that, notwithstanding <em>Napier, </em>the tort damages sought by real parties against petitioner are not preempted by the BIA. First we reexamine the policies behind the enactment of the BIA and FELA. The primary aim behind both was safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u201c[W]hen Congress enacted FELA in 1908, its \u2018attention was focused primarily upon injuries and death resulting from accidents on interstate railroads.\u2019 <em>Urie </em>[v. Thompson], <em>supra, </em>[337 U.S.] at 181 [69 S.Ct. at 1030]. Cognizant of the physical dangers of railroading that resulted in the death or maiming of thousands of workers every year, Congress crafted a federal remedy that shifted part of the \u2018 \u201chuman overhead\u201d \u2019 of doing business from employees to their employers. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Consolidated Rail Corporation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>v. <em>Gottshall </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 532, 542 [114 S.Ct. 2396, 2403-2404, 129 L.Ed.2d 427].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">FELA has since been construed liberally to further Congress\u2019s remedial and humanitarian goal. <em>(Consolidated Rail Corporation </em>v. <em>Gottshall, supra, </em>512 U.S. at p. 543 [114 S.Ct. at p. 2404]; <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>337 U.S. at p. 189 [69 S.Ct. at p. 1034].) One of the primary purposes of FELA was to eliminate defenses to tort liability and to facilitate recovery. <em>(Atchison T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Buell </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 557, 561 [107 S.Ct. 1410, 1413, 94 L.Ed.2d 563].)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Bearing this liberal construction in mind, along with the presumption against preemption, we next consider whether Congress intended that railroad employees could recover tort damages from the manufacturer of a defective locomotive part, absent any federal regulation regarding its safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In <em>Silkwood </em>and <em>Medtronic, </em>the court was able to discern a congressional assumption that tort remedies would be available, based upon the present-day state of tort liability. In contrast, when the BIA was enacted, no private right of action against a manufacturer existed. As Witkin recounts, the strict \u201cprivity doctrine\u201d in existence in 1911 required that in order to recover for injuries sustained from defective goods, only the immediate buyer could recover. Therefore, in our case, when the BIA was enacted, a railroad employee would have had no right of action against the manufacturer. In <em>MacPherson </em>v. <em>Buick Motor Co. </em>(1916) 217 N.Y. 382 [111 N.E. 1050], decided after the enactment of the BIA but 10 years before <em>Napier </em>was decided, this privity doctrine was repudiated and the duty of a manufacturer to exercise due care was extended to those persons to whom a risk of harm could be foreseen. (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 948, p. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The doctrine of strict liability of a manufacturer was not established until much later in <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897], and in <em>Vandermark </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 256 [37 Cal.Rptr. 896, 391 P.2d 168]. (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 1271 at pp. 716-717.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">In determining congressional intent in enacting of the BIA and during the relevant pre-1956 time period, we find nothing which persuades us that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Congress meant to preclude state tort law damages against a manufacturer. Petitioner did not meet its burden in this regard. <em>(Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee, supra, </em>464 U.S. at p. 258 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 626-627].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Both <em>Silkwood </em>and <em>Medtronic </em>involve a precise identification of what field is preempted by the federal legislation at issue. Because we find no intent to expressly preclude tort remedies against a manufacturer, we cannot say the field, which <em>Napier </em>found to be completely occupied, includes tort liabilities not contemplated at the time <em>Napier </em>was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The later enactments to the BIA which added the liability of a manufacturer such as petitioner for a civil penalty are not conclusive of a determination of preemption of tort liability, as demonstrated by <em>Silkwood. </em>\u201cPaying both federal fines and state-imposed punitive damages for the same incident would not appear to be physically impossible. Nor does exposure to punitive damages frustrate any purpose of the federal remedial scheme.\u201d (464 U.S. at p. 257 [104 S.Ct. at p. 626].) For this reason, we need not further discuss real parties\u2019 argument that petitioner was not regulated at the time the installation of the asbestos-containing insulation allegedly occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Petitioner contends that because <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood </em>involve different statutes which contain express preemption language, they employ an entirely different analysis and we should follow the <em>Napier </em>case. However, the pronouncement by <em>Napier </em>that Congress has occupied the entire \u201cfield\u201d does not result in a completely different analysis. Whether the preemption is classified as express, field, or conflict does not change the ultimate determination of congressional intent,  Indeed, as the California Supreme Court recently noted: \u201cThe \u2018three categories\u2019 of preemption . . . should not be taken to be \u2018rigidly distinct. Indeed field pre-emption may be understood as a species of conflict pre-emption: A state law that falls within a preempted field conflicts with Congress\u2019 intent (either express or plainly implied) to exclude state regulation.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 138, 148, fn. 3 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 900 P.2d 690], citing <em>English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 79-80, fn. 5 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2275].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Further, the fact that different subject matter is addressed by the statutes in <em>Silkwood </em>and <em>Medtronic </em>is immaterial; both speak to the availability of tort damages where there is specific federal regulation of the instrumentality that causes the injury. In fact, <em>Medtronic </em>specifically involves the manufacturer of a defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Petitioner refers us to the recent cases of <em>Springston </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>(N.D. Ohio 1994) 863 F.Supp. 535; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 720 F. 2d 1149; and <em>In re Train Collision at Gary, Indiana </em>(Ind.Ct.App. 1996) 670 N.E.2d 902, all of which specifically address the BIA and preemption of tort damages, relying primarily on <em>Napier. </em>We do not find these lower cases controlling in light of the recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court in <em>Medtronic </em>or <em>Silkwood. (Nissan Motor Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 980, 982 [261 Cal.Rptr. 80] [state appellate courts not bound by the interpretation of law by federal courts lower than the United States Supreme Court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Petitioner stresses the need for national uniformity in regulations, given the interstate nature of railroads. It contends that allowing state law tort claims would subject railroads to conflicting requirements throughout the states. In its argument before the superior court, petitioner argued that certain equipment might be required in some states and not in others, forcing the locomotive operator to stop at every state line and adjust its equipment. At oral argument before us, petitioner argued that there would be conflicting requirements even within a state where juries reached different verdicts regarding a railroad\u2019s negligence. Neither of petitioner\u2019s hypotheticals compels us to reach a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">First, we note that neither of the hypotheticals is apposite to this case. There was no actual conflict between the federal regulations in effect at the time the injuries occurred and state law negligence principles. Second, while the possibility certainly exists that different juries will find varying degrees of negligence by a particular party and award different types and amounts of damages, no two individual fact patterns are identical. The hypotheticals posed by petitioner are simply too speculative a basis on which to rest a finding of preemption. (See <em>English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 90 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2281].) In addition, the \u201ctension between the conclusion that safety regulation is the exclusive concern of the federal law and the conclusion that a State may nevertheless award damages based on its own law of liability\u201d was addressed in <em>Silkwood. </em>(464 U.S. at p. 256 [104 S.Ct. at p. 625].) Similarly, we find no irreconcilable conflict between the availability of state law tort damages and the federal locomotive regulatory scheme. <em>(Elsworth </em>v. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 540, 550 [208 Cal.Rptr. 874, 691 P.2d 630].)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In sum, we find that although <em>Napier </em>expressly involves the BIA and contains language that could be construed to support petitioner\u2019s position, we must nevertheless be guided by the analysis employed more recently in <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood. </em>Although those cases involve different statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>they are more directly applicable because they involve state law tort damages. The language in <em>Napier </em>that Congress intended to occupy \u201cthe field of regulating locomotive equipment\u201d must be read narrowly in light of the circumstances in existence at the time of its writing and in light of the statutory framework as a whole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Using the reasoning employed in <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood, </em>we are compelled to find that summary judgment was properly denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The petition is denied and the stay order is vacated. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Vogel (C. S.), P. J., and Epstein, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 16, 1997. and petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 3, 1997. Baxter, J., did not participate therein. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The summary judgment motion also contended that certain of the claims were barred by the statute of limitations, and that some of the plaintiffs were barred from bringing the claims because of their dismissal of prior asbestos claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Real parties are part of a larger pool of more than 4,500 claimants nationwide who seek recovery from petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-13\">The motion was also denied as to the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">As to a wrongful death cause of action, the right was established by Lord Campbell\u2019s Act in 1846, and all states now provide a statutory cause of action. (6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 1196, p. 632.) In California, former Code of Civil Procedure section 377 was enacted in 1872.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We do not discuss real parties\u2019 contention that the BIA only regulates locomotives that are on line. Their opposition to the summary judgment did not address this issue or contain facts which would support the allegation that all work of real parties was performed off line.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
