Under the Mobilehome Residency Law, Civil Code section 798 et seq., a park owner may terminate a mobilehome park tenancy when there is a \u201cchange of use of the park or any portion thereof.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.56, subd. (g).) The park owner claimed that the vacancy of the one space resulting from the eviction of these tenants constituted a change of use of a portion of the park, within the meaning of section 798.56, subdivision (g). The municipal court granted judgment for the park owner. The Appellate Department of the Santa Cruz Superior Court affirmed and certified the matter to this court as a case of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">We find that the eviction was unlawful under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g), and further that the park owner failed to comply with the provisions of Government Code section 65863.7, which requires the filing and review of a tenant impact report before any change of use of a mobile-home park can occur. We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">Governing Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">The Mobilehome Residency Law, enacted in 1978,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a comprehensive statutory scheme which defines the rights and obligations of mobilehome park landlords and the tenants renting spaces in the park. Article 6 of the law is entitled \u201cTermination of Tenancy\u201d and contains the following statement of purpose: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that, because of the high cost of moving mobilehomes, the potential for damage resulting therefrom, the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes, and the costs of landscaping or lot preparation, it is necessary that the owners of mobile-homes occupied within mobilehome parks be provided with the unique protection from actual or constructive eviction afforded by the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.55, subd. (a).) Consistent with this purpose, the law provides that the management of a park \u201cshall not terminate or refuse to renew a tenancy, except for a reason specified in this article . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.55, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The exclusive list of authorized reasons for termination is set forth in Civil Code section 798.56, subdivisions (a) through (g). Under subdivision (g), which concerns us here, a tenancy may be terminated if there is a \u201cChange of use of the park or any portion thereof, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-9\">\u201c(1) The management gives the homeowners at least 15 days\u2019 written notice that the management will be appearing before a local governmental board, commission, or body to request permits for a change of use of the mobilehome park.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>\u201c(2) After all required permits requesting a change of use have been approved by the local governmental board, commission, or body, the management shall give the homeowners six months\u2019 or more written notice of termination of tenancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-4\">\u201cIf the change of use requires no local governmental permits, then notice shall be given 12 months or more prior to the management\u2019s determination that a change of use will occur. The management in the notice shall disclose and describe in detail the nature of the change of use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-5\">\u201c(3) The management gives each proposed homeowner written notice thereof prior to the inception of his or her tenancy that the management is requesting a change of use before local governmental bodies or that a change of use request has been granted. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Subdivision (h) of Civil Code section 798.56, which was added to the statute in 1988,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> further provides that \u201c[t]he report required pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (i) of [s]ection 65863.7 of the Government Code shall be given to the homeowners or residents at the same time that notice is required pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Government Code section 65863.7 provides that certain procedures must be followed when a park owner closes the park or converts to another use, thereby displacing the residents. The report referred to in subdivision (h) of Civil Code section 798.56, is known as a relocation impact report, or a tenant impact report, and is described more fully in subdivision (a) of section 65863.7: \u201cPrior to the conversion of a mobilehome park to another use . . . or prior to closure of a mobilehome park or cessation of use of the land as a mobilehome park, the person or entity proposing the change in use shall file a report on the impact of the conversion, closure, or cessation of use upon the displaced residents of the mobilehome park to be converted or closed. In determining the impact of the conversion, closure or cessation of use on displaced mobilehome park residents, the report shall address the availability of adequate replacement housing in mobilehome parks and relocation costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Government Code section 65863.7 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-9\">\u201c(b) The person proposing the change in use shall provide a copy of the report to a resident of each mobilehome in the mobilehome park at least 15 days prior to the hearing, if any, on the impact report by the advisory agency, or if there is no advisory agency, by the legislative body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-10\">\u201c(c) When the impact report is filed prior to the closure or cessation of use, the person or entity proposing the change shall provide a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1527\">*1527</page-number>report to a resident of each mobilehome in the mobilehome park at the same time as the notice of the change is provided to the residents pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) [now (g)] of [s]ection 798.56 of the Civil Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-5\">\u201c(d) When the impact report is filed prior to the closure or cessation of use, the person or entity filing the report or park resident may request, and shall have a right to, a hearing before the legislative body on the sufficiency of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-6\">\u201c(e) The legislative body, or its delegated advisory agency, shall review the report, prior to any change of use, and may require, as a condition of the change, the person or entity to take steps to mitigate any adverse impact of the conversion, closure, or cessation of use on the ability of displaced mobilehome park residents to find adequate housing in a mobilehome park. The steps required to be taken to mitigate shall not exceed the reasonable costs of relocation. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">Government Code section 65863.8 further ensures that the residents of the mobilehome park have been properly notified before any hearing on a change of use of the park takes place. It provides that \u201c[a] local agency to which application has been made for the conversion of a mobilehome park to another use shall, at least 30 days prior to a hearing or any other action on the application, inform the applicant in writing of the provisions of [s]ection 798.56 of the Civil Code and all applicable local requirements which impose upon the applicant a duty to notify residents and mobilehome owners of the mobilehome park of the proposed change in use, and shall specify therein the manner in which the applicant shall verify that residents and mobilehome owners of the mobilehome park have been notified of the proposed change in use. Neither a hearing on the application, nor any other action thereon, shall be taken by the local agency before the applicant has satisfactorily verified that the residents and mobilehome owners have been so notified, in the manner prescribed by law or local regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">Local regulations in this case are found in chapter 17.90 of the Capitola Municipal Code, which pertains to \u201cChanges of Use of Mobilehome Parks.\u201d Chapter 17.90 was adopted May 1, 1985, and was subsequently amended into its present form, Ordinance No. 759, adopted October 28, 1993. The local code was enacted in order to carry out state laws and effectuate the purposes behind those laws. It provides a procedure for reviewing applications for a change of use or closure of a mobilehome park, and for determining reasonable mitigation measures. (See generally, Capitola Mun. Code, \u00a7 17.90.010.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1528\">*1528</page-number>Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Castle Estates Mobilehome Park is a 108-space mobilehome park located in the City of Capitola, The park contains a mix of single and double-wide mobilehomes of varying ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">In July of 1992, the Walters family negotiated the purchase of a double-wide mobilehome situated at space No. 97 at Castle Estates and applied to the park owner to rent space No. 97. The Walters were provided, and acknowledged receipt of, a form letter from the management of the park, entitled \u201cLetter to Prospective Homeowner.\u201d This letter informed them that the owner of the park was dissatisfied with the Capitola Mobilehome Park Rent Control Ordinance and felt he could not operate the park profitably. He was therefore considering closing spaces in the park whenever a coach was transferred to a new tenant. \u201cBy closing spaces after sale,\u201d the letter explained, \u201cthe park owner will, over time, regain the property for other forms of development.\u201d The letter further stated that the park owner would simply refuse to rent to new tenants were it not for the constraints of the Mobile-home Residency Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter concluded: \u201cTherefore, by this letter, we are informing you that upon transfer of this coach, Castle Mobilehome Estates may take action to close space No. 97, as a mobilehome space and terminate its use as a mobilehome space for rent. Under the provisions of Civil Code [s]ection 798.56, this change of use of the space to discontinue it as a mobilehome park space requires a twelve-month notice to terminate your tenancy provided no local government permits are required.\u201d The Walters proceeded with the purchase of the mobilehome and on August 5, 1992, they signed a rental agreement to rent space No. 97 at the park on a month to month tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">On June 14, 1993, the Walters were served with a document entitled \u201cNotice of Termination (Change in Use).\u201d This notified them that pursuant to Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g), their tenancy of space No. 97 would be terminated one year after the service of the notice. The reason relied on for the termination was that the park owner intended to change the use of the park. The notice referred to the reasons stated in the previous letter, a copy of which was attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">Along with the one-year notice of termination, the Walters were served with a \u201cRelocation Impact Report.\u201d This report reiterated the owner\u2019s plan to close spaces in the park, as coaches were transferred to new tenants, in order to regain the property over time for other forms of development. The report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1529\">*1529</page-number>stated that vacant spaces in mobilehome parks which would accommodate used mobilehomes are extremely scarce in California. In fact the report concluded, based on a survey of mobilehome parks in the area, that \u201cno empty space was found in 52 parks within 25 miles to relocate a double wide mobilehome\u201d such as the Walters\u2019. The report further stated that there were some spaces available in central California; however, it found only one park with a space possibly becoming available which would take an older mobilehome with a family. This park was in Marysville. The cost of transporting the Walters\u2019 mobilehome to Marysville was estimated at $6,700, with other incidental costs of over $2,000. The report suggested various mitigation measures: the Walters could sell their coach and buy a newer one already installed in a space in some other park. They could move to the more outlying areas of California, where there are typically more vacant spaces in mobilehome parks. They could explore housing alternatives such as condominiums, apartments and single-family homes. Or a \u201cRelocation Assistance Director\u201d could be appointed to assess the Walters\u2019 situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Copies of the one-year \u201cNotice of Termination\u201d and the \u201cRelocation Impact Report\u201d were sent to the other residents in Castle Estates and to the Capitola City Attorney, Richard Manning. A cover letter to Manning, dated June 11, 1993, informed him that the documents were being served on the Walters and that copies were enclosed \u201c[f]or your information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Manning immediately wrote to counsel for the park owner, explaining his view that Government Code section 65863.7 required the impact report to be \u201cfiled\u201d with the city before it was sent to the residents pursuant to Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (h). Manning also stated his opinion that vacating a single space in a park, while the remaining spaces continued to be rented, did not constitute a \u201cchange of use\u201d under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">On August 19, 1993, the city attorney sent another letter to counsel for the park owner, reiterating his opinion regarding the legalities of the purported eviction of the Walters and requesting a response. Counsel responded by letter dated August 25, 1993. He stated that the owner of Castle Estates \u201cintends to continue his practice of closing one space at a time as this is the only way he can recover possession of his property and use thereof due to the restrictions imposed by state law and local ordinances.\u201d Counsel expressed the view that \u201cstate law permits a mobilehome park [owner] to terminate tenancy by giving a 12-month notice that the use of a part of the park, i.e., that homeowner\u2019s space, is being changed.\u201d Counsel further asserted that the copy of the \u201cNotice of Termination\u201d and \u201cRelocation Impact Report\u201d previously sent to the city attorney on June 11, 1993, constituted a sufficient filing under the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1530\">*1530</page-number>Over the next few months, the Capitola Conversion Ordinance was amended and the amended Ordinance No. 759 was adopted October 28, 1993. The amended ordinance specifically provides that the \u201cRelocation Impact Report\u201d must be filed with the planning director prior to any change of use of a mobilehome park. (Capitola Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17.090.025, 17.090.040.) The required contents of the report are set forth in section 17.090.030. Section 17.90.070 details the procedure for review of the application for change of use and the relocation impact report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">On January 27, 1994, the city attorney wrote again to counsel for the park owner, referring to state law and enclosing a copy of Ordinance No. 759. The letter restated the city\u2019s position that the eviction of a tenant occupying a single space in a mobilehome park does not constitute a \u201cchange of use\u201d of the park, and further that there had been no formal filing of a relocation impact report with the city, which was necessary to initiate the review process mandated by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Over a year went by. On April 21, 1995, the park owner served on the Walters a \u201cSixty (60) Day Notice Terminating Tenancy.\u201d The notice informed them that their tenancy of space No. 97 at Castle Estates was terminated and that they must deliver possession of the premises on or before June 30, 1995. The notice stated that the termination was for the reason that \u201cthere will be a change of use of the Park or any portion thereof,\u201d pursuant to Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">The Walters continued to occupy space No. 97 and on July 11, 1995, the owner filed an unlawful detainer action against them. Trial of the unlawful detainer action was held in municipal court August 30, 1995, and the court rendered judgment in favor of the park owner. The Walters\u2019 motion for a new trial was denied and they appealed the matter to the Appellate Department of the Santa Cruz Superior Court. The appellate department affirmed the judgment after a hearing on March 14, 1996. The appellate department then certified the case for transfer to this court, on grounds that there is a lack of appellate authority on the issues and because it was anticipated that the subject conduct would continue. We accepted transfer August 30, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">Appellants argue first that the termination of their tenancy was unlawful because a forced vacancy of a single space in a mobilehome park does not constitute a \u201cchange of use of the park or any portion thereof,\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g). They argue further that if, as the park owner has maintained, the termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>their tenancy is but the first step in a plan to close the entire park for eventual use for other purposes, the owner must comply with the requirements of Government Code section 65863.7, and has not done so here. We agree with appellants on both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">\u201cIt is elementary that the construction of a statute and the question of whether it is applicable present solely questions of law.\u201d <em>(Dean W. Knight &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Transportation </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 300, 305 [202 Cal.Rptr. 44].) We therefore conduct an independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">A mobilehome park is defined in the Mobilehome Park Residency Law as \u201can area of land where two or more mobilehome sites are rented, or held out for rent, to accommodate mobilehomes used for human habitation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.4.) Under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g), a park owner may terminate a tenancy only if there is a \u201cchange of use of the park or any portion thereof . ...\u201d A \u201cchange of use\u201d is more particularly described in section 798.10 as follows: \u201c \u2018Change of use\u2019 means a use of the park for a purpose other than the rental, or the holding out for rent, of two or more mobilehome sites to accommodate mobilehomes used for human habitation, and does not mean the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a park rule or regulation. A change of use may affect an entire park or any portion thereof. \u2018Change of use\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, a change of the park or any portion thereof to a condominium, stock cooperative, planned unit development, or any form of ownership wherein spaces within the park are to be sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">Respondent\u2019s position appears to be that the projected vacancy of space No. 97 after the Walters are evicted is the required \u201cchange of use\u201d of a portion of the park, sufficient to justify termination of the tenancy under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g). In other words the vacancy resulting from the eviction itself provides the reason for the eviction. Such an interpretation of the statute is not only illogical, but it is also completely at odds with the stated purpose of this article of the Mobilehome Residency Law, which is to provide the homeowner with \u201cunique protection from actual or constructive eviction.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.55, subd. (a).) If a park owner were able to force tenants out one by one by simply asserting that each eviction constituted a change in the use of that space, the owner would be allowed to accomplish the precise result the law was enacted to prevent. Section 798.56 was clearly intended to limit the grounds upon which a tenancy could be terminated and it must be interpreted in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>Respondent contends that one space in a mobilehome park qualifies as \u201cany portion\u201d of the park, within the meaning of Civil Code sections 798.10 and 798.56, subdivision (g). We disagree. The change of use provisions of the Mobilehome Park Residency Law contemplate a circumstance where the park owner converts land used for mobilehome park purposes, i.e., two or more rentable sites for mobilehomes, to some other use. Although a change of use can apply to the entire park or only a portion thereof, it cannot apply to one space, because one space, under the definition contained in section 798.4, does not qualify as a mobilehome park use. Thus, there can technically be no \u201cchange of use\u201d of one space from mobilehome park use to some other use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">In a larger sense we do not believe the Legislature could have intended the change of use statute to apply to the situation here, where one tenant is evicted while the remaining 107 spaces continue to be rented out. Rather the plain meaning of the statute is that a change of use occurs if the mobilehome park, or a functional part of it, is no longer used as a mobilehome park.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The legislative history of Civil Code section 798.10 fully supports this interpretation and illuminates the intent behind the \u201cchange of use\u201d provision in section 798.56, subdivision (g). The year after the Mobilehome Park Residency Law was passed, bills were introduced in both the Assembly and the Senate to add section 798.10 to the code in order to clarify and define the term \u201cchange of use\u201d in section 798.56, subdivision (g). (See Stats. 1979, ch. 945, \u00a7 1, p. 3266.) The report prepared by the Assembly Committee on Judiciary explained that the objective of the bill was \u201cto prevent mobilehome park management from improperly evicting tenants by alleging that it intends to change the use of a park.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Bill Dig., Hearing date July 18, 1979.) It was reported that park owners were using the \u201cchange of use\u201d notice to harass tenants or to justify tenant terminations. In one case the park owner purported to change all of the leases parkwide from 12-month leases to 40-year leases, denoting this a \u201cchange of use\u201d sufficient to evict any tenant who refused to sign the new lease. The legislation was intended to counteract this and other abuses and to provide additional safeguards to ensure \u201cthat a change of use was not being fabricated as a pretense for terminating park tenancies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The analysis of Senate Bill No. 1170 by the Department of Housing and Community Development contains a similar statement of legislative purpose: \u201cThis bill would make clear that the term \u2018change of use\u2019 (which is presently undefined), means that there will be a change from the rental of mobilehome sites to a use other than rental of mobilehome sites. This term is being abused in many parts of the state, as construed to imply a \u2018change\u2019 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1533\">*1533</page-number>an all-adult park, or that portions of the park will be set aside for particular uses. These abuses run counter to the initial intent for enactment\u2014that because large mobilehomes are so expensive and difficult to move, the grounds for eviction should be limited to those which are <em>critical, </em>such as nonpayment of rent, detrimental conduct by the tenant, etc.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">We conclude that the park owner\u2019s practice here of evicting tenants on the basis that the resulting vacancy of each space constitutes a change of use of a portion of the park violates both the letter and the spirit of the change of use statute. The eviction is therefore unauthorized under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">Respondent argues that as a property owner he has a \u201cfundamental vested right\u201d to go out of business and leave his rental property vacant. <em>(301 Ocean Avenue Corp. </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1548, 1557-1558 [279 Cal.Rptr. 636]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060, subd. (a).) As is reflected in respondent\u2019s letter to prospective tenants, his plan was to eventually convert the park to some other more profitable development use by evicting tenants one by one under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g) and holding the spaces unoccupied until the entire park was vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">As respondent points out, Government Code section 7060.7, known as the Ellis Act, expressly permits a landlord to go out of business. However, respondent did not raise or argue the Ellis Act at the trial of this matter. Moreover, as respondent concedes, the Ellis Act provides that it is not intended to alter the rights and obligations set forth in Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g) and Government Code section 65863.7. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7060.7, subd. (5).) Thus, the Ellis Act is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">We agree with respondent that a park owner is entitled to convert property used as a mobilehome park to another use, or even to hold it as vacant land. And we are not unsympathetic to the plight of the mobilehome park owner, whose property rights are impacted by the various laws and regulations affecting mobilehome parks. Regardless of our views, however, our task as an intermediate court of appeal is limited to interpreting and applying existing law. For instance, Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g)(2), provides that an owner relying on such a change of use to evict his tenants must \u201cdisclose and describe in detail the nature of the change of use\u201d at the time of the 12-month notice. Similarly, section 798.57 requires management to be factually specific in describing the reasons for terminating a tenancy. Here, the park owner\u2019s stated reason for terminating the Walters\u2019 tenancy was that \u201c[b]y closing spaces after sale, the park owner will, over time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>regain the property for other forms of development.\u201d A statement that the use of the property will be changed to accommodate some other form of development to be determined at a future date does not comply with the statutory requirements for a specific plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Moreover, any such conversion or closure plan also requires compliance with Government Code sections 65863.7 and 65863.8 and with local ordinance. Here again, as we explain below, the Legislature has acted to protect mobilehome dwellers, not only from arbitrary and capricious conversions but also from the harsh effects of displacement resulting from legitimate conversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">When a park owner plans to convert or close a mobilehome park, he or she must comply with certain specific notice and reporting requirements. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.56, subd. (h); Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65863.7 and 65863.8.) Among other things the park owner must file an impact report with the local legislative body, describing the impact of the conversion or closure on the displaced residents and addressing the availability of adequate replacement housing and relocation costs. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7.) The owner must also provide copies of the report to each mobilehome resident in the park at the same time as the notice of change of use is provided to the residents under Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (g)(2). (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (c).) The local legislative body must review the report prior to the change of use and may require the park owner to take steps to mitigate any adverse impacts of the conversion on the displaced residents. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (e).) A public hearing must be held if requested by either the park owner or a park resident. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (d).) And under section 65863.8 of the Government Code, the local legislative body must notify a park owner applying for a change of use as to the notice requirements of Civil Code section 798.56 and must verify that all residents have been properly notified prior to a hearing or any other action regarding the change of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">Appellants claim respondent did not comply with the Government Code section 65863.7 requirements. Respondent contends first that section 65863.7 does not apply in this case because he was changing the use of only one space rather than converting the entire mobilehome park. Next he argues that even if section 65863.7 does apply, he fully complied with the notice and filing requirements of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">The basis for respondent\u2019s first claim is that Government Code section 65863.7 refers only to \u201ca mobilehome park\u201d whereas Civil Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number>798.56, subdivision (g) refers to a change of use of \u201cthe park or any portion thereof.\u201d Therefore, he argues, the requirements of section 65863.7 apply only if the entire park is converted. Where the change of use affects something less than the entire park, compliance is excused. In essence respondent\u2019s contention would mean that a park owner could change the use of a portion of the park, sufficient to justify terminating tenancies under section 798.56, subdivision (g), but would not need to comply with the notice and reporting requirements under sections 65863.7 and 65863.8, so long as some portion of the park continued to be used as a mobilehome park.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Such an interpretation is untenable. The two statutes were clearly intended to function together as an integrated scheme, as is evidenced by the cross-references contained in Civil Code section 798.56, subdivision (h), and Government Code sections 65863.7, subdivision (c) and 65863.8. There is no rational explanation why the Legislature would use the phrase \u201cchange of use\u201d in the Mobilehome Residency Law and not intend the same meaning in the Government Code section referred to therein. Obviously, a tenant who is displaced by a partial closure of a park is as much in need of the protections provided by the Government Code as a tenant in a park which is closed entirely. We therefore conclude that the notice and reporting requirements set forth in Government Code sections 65863.7 and 65863.8 apply whenever there is a change of use of the entire park or a functional portion thereof which results in the displacement of tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Perhaps anticipating such a conclusion, respondent contends he complied with all necessary requirements by serving the Walters with a one-year notice of change of use and a copy of a tenant impact report (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (c); Civ. Code, \u00a7 798.56, subds. (g)(2) &amp; (h)), by providing copies of the report and notice to all of the other residents of the park (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (c)), and by sending a copy of the report and notice to the Capitola city attorney, marked \u201cFor Your Information\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (a).). He contends the review required by section 65863.7, subdivision (e) and the hearing referred to in subdivisions (b) and (d) were not necessary here for various reasons: There was no local ordinance providing for a review procedure, no permits or zoning changes were sought, and no one requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">We disagree with respondent\u2019s reading of the statute. The purposes of Government Code section 65863.7 are to ensure that the local legislative body reviews the impact on the mobilehome park tenants of a change of use of the property, that mitigation measures are considered and that the tenants are involved in the process. Since these protections are dependent upon a meaningful review of the impact report, the language of the statute makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>this review mandatory: \u201cThe legislative body, or its delegated advisory agency, <em>shall review </em>the report, prior to any change of use, and may require, as a condition of the change, the person or entity to take steps to mitigate any adverse impact of the conversion, closure, or cessation of use on the ability of displaced mobilehome park residents to find adequate housing in a mobilehome park.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (e), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Review is initiated by the filing of the impact report with the local legislative body. Here there was no such filing. Respondent simply sent a copy of the report to the city attorney marked for informational purposes. Respondent reads the statute to provide that the report need only be filed \u201cupon the displaced residents\u201d of the park. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (a).) Read in context, however, the quoted language obviously refers to the impact of the conversion \u201cupon the displaced residents,\u201d not to a filing of the report \u201cupon the displaced residents.\u201d It is common sense that residents do not accept documents for \u201cfiling.\u201d Moreover, Government Code section 65863.7, subdivision (c) directs that when the report is \u201cfiled,\u201d the person requesting the change of use \u201cshall provide a copy of the report\u201d to each resident of the mobilehome. If the initial filing were to be upon the residents, this subdivision would be redundant. And finally, respondent\u2019s interpretation is totally inconsistent with the rest of the statute, which provides the various steps for review by the local legislative body.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">A formal filing of a statutory report does more than simply make its contents known to the local agency. It communicates that the submitting party intends to initiate and participate in the review process mandated by Government Code section 65863.7, that the document submitted is the one formally designated as the required report, and that the agency may begin the review and notification procedure set forth in the statute. A report which is simply sent to the residents with a copy mailed to the city attorney accomplishes none of these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\"><em>Schaefer Dixon Associates </em>v. <em>Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 524 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 698] illustrates this point in a somewhat different setting. In that case, a plaintiff failed to file a formal tort claim, although a series of letters essentially related all the necessary information. The court held that these informational letters did not meet the statutory requirement that a document be \u201cfiled,\u201d even though they contained a demand for damages. Rather than being \u201cpresented\u201d to the proper person representing the public entity, the letters were directed to the personal attention of the general manager of the public entity. A formal filing, the court observed, alerts the agency of the need to conduct an investigation, to notify the party if the claim is considered insufficient, and to correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>calendar necessary events such as statutes of limitations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 534-535.) We conclude that respondent\u2019s mailing of a copy of the impact report to the city attorney in this case did not constitute a filing within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">This conclusion disposes of respondent\u2019s claim that no hearing was required here because none was requested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that the statute appears to contemplate that if neither the park owner nor a park resident requests a public hearing, no hearing need be held. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subds. (b) &amp; (d).) However, the right to request a hearing on the sufficiency of the report is triggered by the filing of the report itself. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (d).) Here, as we have found, the tenant impact report prepared by the park owner was never filed with the city. Consequently, the review process was never initiated and the right to request a hearing did not arise. Furthermore, even if no hearing is requested, the local agency must nonetheless review the report \u201cprior to any change of use.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65863.7, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Respondent contends that at the time he served the one-year notice of termination and change of use on the Walters in June of 1993, Capitola had no ordinance providing a procedure for filing and reviewing an impact report concerning the closure of a mobilehome park. The present ordinance was adopted in October of 1993, several months later. Respondent claims this excused him from the duty to file an application and a tenant impact report for review by the City. We are not persuaded by this argument, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">The ordinance which was in place in June of 1993, Ordinance No. 576, provided that a \u201cconversion,\u201d which meant \u201cchanging the use of any property previously used as a mobilehome park to a use other than mobilehome park,\u201d required an application and an impact report. These were subject to review and approval by the decision making body of the City. (See former Capitola Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17.90.010, 17.90.040, 17.90.050.) Respondent argues that these sections did not apply to him because his change of use did not involve any permits or rezoning. However, the clear import of the ordinance was that any change which \u201ccould result in the loss of mobile-home park spaces\u201d was subject to review. (Capitola Mun. Code, \u00a7 17.90.010.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Furthermore, any ambiguity in the former ordinance regarding filing and review requirements was clarified in this case by the city attorney, who notified respondent repeatedly, following receipt of copies of the notice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>report served on the Walters, that the city did not consider this to be a sufficient filing, that the city wished to review the report and that the city viewed the termination of the Walters\u2019 tenancy as an unlawful eviction. Counsel for respondent was aware that an amendment to the existing ordinance was in process and he had apparently attended a session of the city council discussing the early versions of the amendment. Ordinance No. 759 was passed October 28, 1993 and counsel was sent a copy of the ordinance in January of 1994. Thus, respondent was well aware of local rules and nonetheless made no effort to comply. More than a year passed before the attempted eviction was resumed, by the service of the 60-day notice on the tenants in April of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Regardless of the status of the local ordinance, the filing and review of an impact report was at all times mandated by state law, pursuant to Government Code section 65863.7. The requirements of this section were not made dependent upon the enactment of a local ordinance and are not excused by the fact that the local ordinance did not describe a particular filing and review process at the time respondent first served notice on the Walters. In <em>Friends of Mammoth </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 247 [104 Cal.Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049] disapproved on other grounds in <em>Kowis </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250], the Supreme Court addressed a similar circumstance involving Public Resources Code section 21151. That statute set forth the requirement that an environmental impact report must be prepared \u201con any project they [local governmental agencies] intend to carry out which may have a significant effect on the environment. . . .\u201d (8 Cal.3d at pp. 274-275.) The court held that this statute applied to government approval of private development projects. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 259.) Although there was no local enabling legislation providing for a review of an impact report prior to approving a development project, the California Supreme Court ruled that the developer could not proceed with its underlying project until such time as the impact report was properly prepared and considered. The court recognized that projects could be delayed while the local agency developed procedures for reviewing the impact report, but found that such delays were \u201cimplicit\u201d in the Legislature\u2019s decision to require preparation of the report. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 273.) In other words, the absence of local rules governing review of the impact report did not excuse compliance with the state mandate. (See Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21169, limiting the retroactive effect of <em>Friends of Mammoth </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Finally, respondent argues that he complied with Government Code section 65863.7 to the fullest extent possible, because although his intent was to close the entire park space by space, he did not have any particular development plan in mind. Without any specific development plan, he argues, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>would have been premature to apply for the necessary use permits or zoning changes or approval of the conversion plan. Respondent thus suggests he should be allowed to evict tenants one by one, close the entire park and then apply to develop the property for some other use. This is precisely the situation that section 65863.7 was intended to prevent. Prior to 1985 that section required an impact report only when mobilehome parks were converted to another use. In 1985 section 65863.7 was amended to include the closure of a park or the cessation of use of the property as a park. (Stats. 1985, ch. 1260, \u00a7 1, pp. 4328-4329, Sen. Bill No. 316.) As explained by the author of the bill, \u201csome park owners have gotten around the law by simply closing the park, forcing long-term residents to move out, and letting the land sit idle until it can be developed into another commercial or lucrative venture. [Statement by Senator Bill Craven on the passage of Senate Bill No. 316, October 2,1985.]\u201d Senate Bill No. 316 was therefore intended \u201cto close a loophole in the law that would permit a mobilehome park to close, move out its tenants and later convert to another use without having to meet the requirements of law or local ordinance to assist their tenants [to] relocate. [Sen. Bill No. 316, Report of Senate Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Feb. 4, 1985.]\u201d Respondent\u2019s practice here is in direct conflict with the purpose and intent of Government Code section 65863.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">The judgment of the municipal court granting possession of the property to respondent is reversed and the court is directed to enter judgment in favor of appellants.
