He was found guilty on all three counts, judgment was pronounced against him on each, his motion for a new trial was denied and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Defendant was a duly licensed collection agent, doing business at Pasadena, in Los Angeles County, California, and all the charges here made against him grow out of his activities in that capacity. John F. Pryor, a lawyer practicing his profession at Hanford, California, had obtained two judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for Ms clients, one for William J. Hay against Roland S. Prank and W. A. Bliss, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cHay judgment\u201d and one in behalf of Mrs. Evelyn Bryon and her brother, Thomas Downing, against J. R. Robinson and Nellie Robinson, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cBryon judgment.\u201d Each of these judgments was obtained in the Superior Court of Kings County but all the judgment debtors resided in Los Angeles County. Mr. Pryor, having observed defendant in action and formed a favorable opinion of his ability as a collection agent, induced his clients above named to turn over to defendant for collection the judgments above described. The grand theft charges rest for support upon evidence showing, it is claimed, that species of grand theft from the plaintiffs above named which would formerly have been known as embezzlement of moneys collected by defendant for them, but which is now charged, under section 484 of the Penal Code, as theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The charge in count I relates to the Hay judgment. This was obtained in 1932 and its original amount was $1,012. In addition to this award to plaintiff it contained a provision \u201cthat defendants recover the washing machine and ironer mentioned and described in the testimony herein.\u201d On October 28, 1938, in Mr. Pryor\u2019s office at Hanford, an agreement was drawn up and signed by defendant, which was sent or taken to Hay and signed by him also. This agreement referred to the Hay judgment, provided that Hay would assign it to defendant \u201cfor collection . . . with the expressed understanding\u201d that Hay would \u201creceive fifty per cent (50%) of all the net proceeds of all collections in the above entitled case when and as collected\u201d and that defendant \u201cagrees to retain John P. Pryor as his attorney in the prosecution of this case.\u201d At about the same time Hay executed a written assignment of the judgment to defendant, at the end of which was defendant\u2019s signed \u201cconsent to have John P. Pryor remain as my attorney in the above entitled cause.\u201d On October 28, 1938, at Pryor\u2019s office, defendant signed a letter addressed to Pryor referring to the assignment of the Hay judgment, stating that \u201cyou [Pryor] are to be retained as attorney in the matter,\u201d and that in consideration of the facts that Pryor had obtained the judgment on a contingent basis and had received no fees therefor and that \u201cyou [Pryor] are now about to perform additional services,\u201d it was agreed that \u201cyou and I [Hall] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>are to divide equally the fifty per cent (50%) of the net proceeds if and when a collection is made on account of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">After these papers were signed an execution on the judgment was obtained under section 685, Code of Civil Procedure, and defendant made several calls on Prank, one of the judgment debtors, at Long Beach, and on December 2, 1938, entered into a written agreement with him regarding the judgment, by the terms of which defendant was to receive from Prank \u201c$400 cash this date,\u201d an assignment of a trust deed for $392, and an assignment of a contract with one Fernandez for sale of three lots with a balance due of \u201cabout\u201d $800, and Prank was to cooperate in the collection of \u201cthe balance of the judgment.\u201d At the time this agreement was signed Prank paid defendant the sum of $400 and assigned to Minnie M. Hall, defendant\u2019s mother, as security, the contract for sale to Fernandez of the three lots above mentioned, and the trust deed. On February 10, 1939, Prank paid defendant another $100 on the Hay judgment. On January 7, 1939, Prank assigned to defendant a contract with one Cotton for the sale of two other lots in the same tract with, and near, the three lots covered by the Fernandez contract. The latter transaction, as stated by Prank, was one by which defendant agreed to clear up the title to the two lots, defendant was to have a half interest in them for doing so and Prank was to have the other half, the deal being \u201cindependent of the judgment\u201d; but later Prank made an agreement with defendant by which defendant took Prank\u2019s interest in the two lots \u201cin on the judgment,\u201d and gave Prank credit for the balance due on the Hay judgment,1 \u2018 which was about $100. \u2019 \u2019 This was in February, 1939. Under date of February 17, 1939, Prank made an absolute deed of the lots covered by the Fernandez contract to defendant\u2019s mother, Minnie M. Hall. Under date of March 18,1939, defendant signed an agreement with Prank stating that defendant \u201cdoes hereby release\u201d to Prank all defendant\u2019s interest in the trust deed above mentioned, and that in consideration of \u201cthe release\u201d by Prank to defendant and his mother of all interest in the five lots above referred to and the cash already paid to defendant, defendant \u201cdoes hereby release and forever settle the obligation of the judgment. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>As above stated, in the course of collecting the Hay judgment the defendant obtained from Frank on December 2,1938, $400 and on February 10, 1939, $100. By the agreement he made with Hay he was required to remit to Hay half of the net proceeds \u201cwhen and as collected.\u201d Defendant testified that he had incurred an expense of $35 for making title search and $20 for other information. He did not report these expenses or claim them as deductions, but if they were' deductible items, there would be a balance of $445 as net proceeds. No other items of expense appear up to this time. On December 14, 1938, defendant sent Hay $50, in a letter which stated that \u201cFrom Frank I received $100,\u201d and also mentioned the assignment of the trust deed and a \u201clien on a house\u201d not definitely described, but apparently the above mentioned contract with Cotton, and then declared, \u201cThis is about all I can get Frank to agree to.\u201d At the same time defendant paid Pryor $25. On February 17, 1939, defendant sent Hay $14 and on January 29, 1939 he sent Pryor $7. No further sums were sent by him to either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Thus it appears that when defendant received $400 he accounted for only $100 of it, and that on collecting $100 more he accounted for only $28 of it. The excuses he gave at the trial for not making a complete accounting are that he had not made a complete settlement with Frank, and that in January, 1939, and thereafter, Frank was making claim for the washing machine and ironer which, by the terms of the Hay judgment, were to be returned to him, that defendant, as assignee of the judgment was liable to perform this part of the judgment, and that hence he was entitled to retain the balance of the sums collected as a protection against this liability. Neither of these excuses is good. By the agreement between defendant and Hay defendant was required to remit to Hay half of the net proceeds of all collections on the judgment \u201cwhen and as collected.\u201d The fact that the settlement with Frank was not complete would not afford any reason for not remitting to Hay his share of the proceeds of a partial settlement. Moreover, by the agreement of March 18, 1939, which was signed by Frank, as well as defendant, defendant purported to \u201cforever settle\u201d the judgment, so even on his theory on this point he should have remitted then.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In his own testimony defendant says that Frank was claiming $200 to $300 as damages if he did not receive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>washing machine and the ironer. It appears that later, after this prosecution of defendant was begun, Hay settled this matter with Frank for $25. Frank testified that defendant first called his attention to the fact that he was entitled to these articles, and he, Frank, did not make demand on defendant for them before the judgment was settled. Moreover, the agreement of March 18, 1939, \u201cforever\u201d settling the judgment, which Frank signed, would relieve defendant from any liability on this account from that date. Under these circumstances the jury might well conclude that this matter afforded no justification for not remitting the proceeds of the collections.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">No demand was made by Hay for his share of the amount collected by defendant until more than two years after the last of these collections; in fact Hay testified that he did not know of any collections other than those on which defendant reported to him until about the time of demand. Defendant contends that no sufficient demand was made even then. \u201cNo doubt embezzlement may be established, under certain circumstances, without proof of a demand, as where other evidence clearly shows an appropriation by an employee of his employer\u2019s funds, with intent to do so fraudulently and feloniously,\u201d said the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Royce, </em>(1895) 106 Cal. 173, 177, 178 [37 P. 630, 39 P. 524], and the court quoted this statement with approval in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>(1912) 163 Cal. 368, 373 [125 P. 907], adding to it this: \u201cIn some cases, in the absence of other sufficient proof, a demand may be necessary to fix the fact of the fraudulent appropriation ; but the real test always is, does the whole evidence establish the crime charged, that is, a fraudulent appropriation as charged in the indictment.\u201d To the same effect see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>(1934) 2 Cal.App.2d 141, 157 [37 P.2d 849]. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>(1894) 102 Cal. 552, 557 [36 P. 932], it is suggested that no demand would be necessary where, under the terms of a defendant\u2019s employment, the time for payment of money of his employer in his hands had arrrived and there was no satisfactory explanation of his default. This suggestion fits the present case. Not only did the defendant fail, without satisfactory explanation, to remit the full amount required when he collected $400 and then $100 for Hay, but he gave Hay misleading information, telling him that $100, instead of $400, had been received on the first collection, omitting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>mention the assignment of the Fernandez contract, which he had received and declaring that \u201cthis is about all I can get Frank to agree to.\u201d The defendant\u2019s explanation at the trial of what he later did with the money not accounted for shows that, nearly a year after receipt of the $400, he expended it for improvements and repairs on the two lots above mentioned which he obtained from Frank and in which he claimed a half interest as his own property. By so doing he converted at least half of the money so expended to his own use, if he had not previously done so, without regard to any question of his right to expend money collected for Hay in improving Hay\u2019s property without the latter\u2019s knowledge or consent. These and the other circumstances already set forth are sufficient to support the jury\u2019s implied finding that defendant fraudulently appropriated property of Hay which came into his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The further proceedings of the defendant in collecting the Hay judgment are so interwoven with those relating to the forgery charged in count II, that the facts regarding both must be included in one statement. As already stated, Frank made a deed dated February 17, 1939, of the three lots covered by the Fernandez contract. Frank testified that he signed this deed at or about its date, and that Minnie M. Hall was then named in it as grantee. Defendant testified that no grantee was named in the deed when Frank signed it and delivered it to him, that this occurred in December, 1938, that later in December, Frank orally consented to the insertion of the name of Minnie M. Hall as grantee and that her name was then put in. When this deed was introduced in evidence at the trial the grantee named in it was Trinidad Tebras. Frank testified that he did not authorize this change or discuss it with defendant and did not know of it until the investigation leading to this prosecution was begun. Defendant testified that he caused the erasure of the name, Minnie M. Hall, to be made on or about February 17, 1939, and, about a year later, himself inserted the name, Trinidad Tebras, as grantee, that this was done with Frank\u2019s oral consent and that Frank on being later told of it, said it was \u201call right.\u201d The evidence shows further that Fernandez made payments to defendant on his contract, the amount conceded by defendant being $131 and interest in unspecified amount, and the amount according to Fernandez\u2019 son being at least $15 per month for at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>least eighteen months, or $270. Trinidad Yebras was a friend of Fernandez and in November, 1940, bought from defendant the lots covered by the Fernandez contract, and paid him $598 therefor, not knowing at the time of any defect in the title, and thereupon he received from defendant the deed above mentioned with his name in it as grantee. He did this for the benefit of Fernandez. On July 30, 1941, thirty days after the information herein was filed, Yebras began an action to quiet title to the property against Frank and others and later a default judgment was given in his favor against Frank. On March 8, 1941, Pryor wrote and sent to defendant a letter demanding an accounting of his collections for Hay and the date of this letter is the date charged in the information as that of the theft from Hay. In answer to this defendant went to Pryor\u2019s office with a large and apparently unsorted mass of papers at which Pryor refused to look, but defendant did not pay over to Hay or Pryor any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The reasons now assigned by defendant for not paying over to Hay any of the money received from Fernandez and Yebras are first, the unsettled claim of Frank for the washing machine and ironer, already discussed and held insufficient, second, Yebras\u2019 action to quiet title, and third that defendant expended more than the sums so received on the real property obtained from Frank. Since Yebras\u2019 action to quiet title was not begun until after this prosecution was commenced, it affords no valid reason why defendant should not have accounted for the money received from Yebras at the time of its receipt. The money defendant claims to have spent was, according to his testimony, all spent on the two lots in which he claimed a half interest under his deal with Frank. The total amount so spent was only $361.40, of which, at most, he could claim against Hay only one-half. Such a claim could afford no good excuse for not paying to Hay his share of the considerable excess over that amount which defendant had collected from Fernandez and Yebras. As to these matters also we cannot say there is no support for the jury\u2019s finding of fraudulent misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Coming to the forgery charge, we think the evidence above recited is ample to support the jury\u2019s verdict. From it the jury could find that after Frank had signed the deed and delivered it to defendant the latter, without Frank\u2019s knowledge or consent, changed the name of the grantee and used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>deed so altered as a means of obtaining payment from Tebras for the property then appearing to be conveyed to him by it. A deed so altered is, of course, void and ineffective as a conveyance to the person whose name is so inserted as grantee. This is sufficient to satisfy the provision of section 470 of the Penal Code that \u201cEvery person who, with intent to defraud . . . falsely makes, alters, forges or counterfeits, any . . . deed ... is guilty of forgery.\u201d Defendant cites against this conclusion <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Locke-Paddon, </em>(1918) 37 Cal.App. 693, 695 [174 P. 674], and <em>Riverside P. C. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland C. Co., </em>(1920) 46 Cal.App. 87 [189 P. 808], but neither case is in. point here. In the Dutton case it was held that a change in the name of the grantee of a deed, made with the grantor\u2019s consent, after it had been signed but before it had been delivered as a deed, by one who was the real but not the record owner of the property conveyed, was \u201cnot the alteration of an instrument, since the instrument had not yet been created\u201d and for that reason did not make the deed void. Here, according to testimony which the jury believed, the deed had been delivered as an effective conveyance and the grantor was not consulted about the change. The other case cited by defendant did not involve an alteration but related to a bond delivered with unfilled blanks, the rule on which is different from that applicable to deeds in like condition stated in the cases hereinafter cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In connection with the forgery charge defendant complains of the following instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cNo 25. Under the law of this state a deed to real property must be made in writing, and, therefore, any authority given to an agent to change or alter such deed must also be in writing. If, however, an alteration is made by an agent having authority in writing from the grantor named in the deed to make such alteration the making thereof by the agent would not he a forgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u201cNo 26. Under the law of California a deed to real property must state the name of the grantor and the name of the grantee. A deed which does not show the name of the grantee (unless there is written permission given by the grantor for the name of the grantee to be subsequently inserted) is void and carries no title to the property described. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u201cNo 27. The law of this state is that the name of a grantor or grantee in a deed cannot be inserted by an agent for the grantor in the absence of the grantor, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the agent\u2019s authority be in writing. If the authority of the agent is not in writing, his insertion of the name of the grantor or grantee does not convey any title and the deed is therefore, absolutely void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">These instructions correctly stated the law, as far as they went. (See <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 652, 655, 656 [32 P.2d 968], and authorities there cited; also <em>Bryce </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 615 [55 P.2d 488], approving <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Taylor.) </em> But it is also the law, as declared in <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>that \u201cAn innocent purchaser taking a void instrument can, however, find protection in the doctrine of estoppel, where circumstances are presented which establish negligence or some other misconduct by the other party, which contributed to the loss.\u201d This rule should have been stated to the jury, with a fuller explanation of the doctrine of estoppel, as a qualification of, or in addition to, the instructions above quoted. The testimony of defendant states facts which would raise such an estoppel against Prank in Yebras\u2019 favor. It shows that Prank orally consented to the insertion of Yebras\u2019 name in the deed as grantee, with knowledge that defendant intended then to deliver the deed to Yebras for the purpose of effecting a conveyance of the property to him. While Yebras was not directly informed of this conduct of Frank, the delivery of the deed to him with his name appearing therein as grantee, such delivery being with Prank\u2019s consent, was an implied representation that Prank as grantor had executed such a deed, and entitled Yebras to rely, as against Prank, on the latter\u2019s conduct above described as creating an estoppel. In the cases of <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>and <em>Bryce </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra, </em>it was held that findings of no estoppel were supported by the evidence, but the facts were quite different from those to be considered here. In the Trout case the grantor, who was defrauded in other ways, merely failed to notice that the name of the grantee was not inserted in her deed. In the Bryce case, the grantor was induced to sign a deed without inserting the grantee\u2019s name in order to facilitate its exchange for certain bonds. In neither case was a deed altered by the insertion of a grantee\u2019s name with knowledge on the grantor\u2019s part that it would then be delivered to such grantee as a conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">An intent to defraud is essential to the crime of forgery, as the jury were properly instructed. If the jury had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>properly instructed on this rule of estoppel, they could, if they believed defendant\u2019s testimony above stated, have found that he had no intent to defraud Yebras, but believed that the deed would be an effective conveyance of the land to him. Without such an instruction on the law of estoppel, the other instructions quoted would prevent them from reaching such a conclusion even though they believed defendant\u2019s testimony on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Count III grows out of defendant\u2019s dealings with the Bryon judgment, which was dated April 29, 1935. This was an ordinary money judgment in the sum of $1,344. This judgment was assigned to defendant or or about February 8, 1939, and on February 9, 1939, an agreement regarding it was made between Mrs. Bryon, Downing and defendant. This agreement, after reciting the assignment., provided that defendant \u201cagrees to use his best endeavor to collect said judgment, which he is hereby authorized to do\u201d and that in consideration of his services \u201call moneys collected on said judgment after paying the cost and expense in the premises shall belong\u201d half to Downing and Mrs. Bryon and half to defendant and that \u201cimmediately upon making collection of such sum as he may be able to collect on said judgment\u201d defendant will \u201cafter deducting the necessary cost and expense in the premises, remit to the First Parties [Mrs. Bryon and Downing] one-half of such net proceeds.\u201d The agreement also authorized defendant \u201cto use his own judgment\u201d in compromising the debt, but not for less than $500. After signing these papers Downing left the handling of the matter to his sister, Mrs. Bryon. An execution was issued on this judgment, which defendant caused to be levied on real property at 3920 South Broadway, Los Angeles, hereinafter referred to as the \u201cBroadway property.\u201d Defendant bid this property in at the sale in the name of Mrs. Bryon on March 13, 1939, for $500. It was deeded to her by the sheriff August 13, 1940. After deducting expenses, $454.45 was credited on the judgment. On March 13, 1939, the defendant also had the execution levied on Title Guarantee <em>&amp; </em>Trust Co. and thereby impounded $1,218.37 which it had in its possession for payment to the judgment debtors. On April 2, 1940, the money so impounded was finally paid over to defendant. He also received as rent of the Broadway property, in 1939, $260, and in 1940, $360, making his total collections in money, $1,838.37. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>None of this was ever remitted or definitely accounted for to Downing or Mrs. Bryon or anyone for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">One of- the defenses now advanced to count III is that by an agreement defendant made with Mrs. Bryon after the Bryon judgment was turned over to him for collection he sold to her an interest in some real property referred to in the record as the \u201cKalmia Street property\u201d in exchange for the judgment, thereby becoming the absolute owner of the judgment, and therefore he was not required to turn over its proceeds to her. The difficulty with this argument is that, while defendant testified that such an agreement was orally made, Mrs. Bryon positively denied it, and the jury\u2019s obvious acceptance of her testimony is binding upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The only other excuse given here for defendant\u2019s prolonged failure to pay anything to Mrs. Bryon or her brother, out of the $1,800 and more that he received on account of the judgment is that he expended, for attorney\u2019s fees and court costs in collecting the judgment, more than he received. These expenditures were in part testified to by defendant, and as to some of them he was corroborated by attorneys who represented him in various suits. Some of these expenses related to the Kalmia Street property and we cannot credit them to defendant because of the jury\u2019s finding that Mrs. Bryon had no interest in that property. It appears without dispute that defendant brought many actions in the municipal and superior courts, in connection with his efforts to collect on the Bryon judgment. The nature and purpose of some of those actions appear rather indistinctly in the record; indeed, as to several of them, we cannot determine whether defendant had any good reason for bringing them or not. At least, he lost some of them. The jury may have been in the same situation as we are, and have concluded that defendant had no just reason for deducting from his collections the expenses of some of these actions. But the total of all the expenses which he claimed in all of these actions, including attorney fees not paid but incurred, in some of them, appears to be only $985.57. There may be some other unpaid attorney fees, but the record before us does not enable us to determine the amount thereof. The jury may have concluded that the expenses which defendant could claim in good faith were not sufficient to relieve him from the necessity of paying $200 or more to Mrs. Bryon. They may also have considered his good faith impugned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>what they deemed his false explanation of his reason for not doing so\u2014that is, his claim of a purchase of the judgment from her. We cannot say that such conclusions are without substantial evidentiary support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The same objection to the evidence regarding a demand is raised on this count as in case of count I. The same rule must be applied. The evidence is sufficient to show an embezzlement even though there had been no demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">At the trial John P. Pryor was called as a witness by the prosecution. Before his testimony had proceeded far, defendant objected \u201cto any testimony by this witness on the ground it is privileged and confidential between an attorney and a client,\" and it was stipulated that \u201cany questions asked of this witness may be considered objected to upon the ground it is a confidential communication between attorney and client and privileged.\" Defendant now argues that the court erred in overruling this objection. The argument is based on the above mentioned papers signed by defendant in connection with the Hay judgment, by which defendant appears to have retained Pryor as his attorney in the matter of collecting that judgment. Pryor denied that he had ever acted as attorney for defendant, but we need not determine whether this testimony overcomes the showing made by the papers referred to. No such arrangement was made regarding the Bryon judgment, and hence the objection could not be good as to matters relating only to it. The argument here seems to assume that every communication between attorney and client is privileged. This is not the law. To be privileged \u201cthe communication must be confidential, and so regarded, at least by the client, at the time. If it clearly appears that the same was not intended by the client to have been confidential, it is not privileged.\" <em>(Mission Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Chadwick P. Corp., </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 386, 390 [278 P. 855].) Communications made in the presence of a third party who is present as a witness .are not privileged. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>(1939) 31 Cal.App.2d 259, 265 [87 P.2d 908].) We find in Pryor\u2019s testimony nothing that can be regarded as privileged under these rules. Much of it related to the Bryon judgment and was not subject to the objection. He testified that he and defendant did <em>not </em>say various things to each other and that, he, Pryor, did not know of certain of defendant\u2019s acts. Obviously, these are not communications, at all, but the suggested communications are such that, if made, they would necessarily have been in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tended for Hay\u2019s information, and so not confidential under the rule above stated. The letter of Pryor demanding an accounting of defendant\u2019s collections for Hay and Bryon and a later letter repeating the demand and suggesting payment to them on account, purported to have been written by Pryor in behalf of Hay and Bryon, and could not be regarded as a confidential communication between him and defendant, even if he were attorney for defendant as well as Hay and Bryon. Pryor produced and identified a letter from defendant and Pryor\u2019s answer to it, but this letter from defendant was addressed to both Hay and Pryor. Pryor also testified to a conversation he had with defendant after the letter Pryor wrote to defendant demanding an accounting; but defendant brought a witness with him to this conversation. We find no error in the ruling complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The judgments and the order denying a new trial are affirmed as to counts I and III; they are reversed as to count II with directions for a new trial on count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Shinn, Acting P.
