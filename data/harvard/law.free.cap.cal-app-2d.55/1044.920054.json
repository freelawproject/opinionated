Subdivision (b) then provides: \u201c(b)(1) In addition to any other penalty or liability imposed by law, a person who is convicted of violating subdivision (a) shall pay a penalty equal to the amount of the actual cost of any gross evidence of removal of hazardous substances or hazardous waste that is incurred by an agency as a result of the illegal disposal. The court shall transmit all penalties collected pursuant to this subdivision to the county treasurer of the county in which the court is located for deposit in a special account in the county treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The question we address is whether the trial court correctly ordered the various defendants to pay <em>jointly and severally </em>the \u201cpenalty equal to the amount of the actual cost of any gross evidence of removal. . . .\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11374.5, subd. (b).) Because this question has never been answered in the context of this particular section, we rely upon the relevant legislative history to determine the purpose and intent of the cleanup penalty provision.  When called upon to interpret a statute, an appellate court begins with the fundamental canon of construction that the judiciary \u201c\u2018should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; <em>Cossack </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 732 [114 Cal.Rptr. 460, 523 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>260]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1259, 1266 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 209].)  And that history reveals the paramount purpose of section 11374.5, subdivision (b) is to ensure reimbursement of cleanup costs to an agency that has incurred those costs following a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11374.5, subdivision (a). (Sen. Rules Com., Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1175 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Rules Committee Report.) The legislators predicted that passage of this provision would facilitate the cleanup of contaminated areas by forcing those responsible to pay the cost of removing the damage. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, it was noted this method of financial reimbursement would make better use of prosecutorial resources and eliminate duplicative court proceedings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">All parties agree the court properly invoked Health and Safety Code section 11374.5, subdivision (b) in light of the facts of this case. Their disagreement stems from the manner in which a court should order cleanup costs paid. As we have noted, the court ordered joint and several liability against each appellant in the amount of $12,464.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Appellants contend the extent of their individual financial responsibility should vary according to their particular culpability, with the total of all orders against them not exceeding $12,464.82. They urge us to remand the matter in order for the trial court to apportion the amounts for which they are liable individually. We disagree. To impose such a requirement upon imposition of Health and Safety Code section 11374.5, subdivision (b) does not reflect the legislative purpose we have discussed. Carried to its logical conclusion, appellants\u2019 position endorses a result by which the agency would most likely receive only partial payment. The likelihood every defendant in a multiple-defendant case would contribute his or her allotted share in compliance with the court order is slim, indeed a cynic would say, none. Should any defendant not pay his or her portion, the agency would absorb the loss. We do not believe the Legislature contemplated such a result. Furthermore, appellants\u2019 interpretation would require supplemental litigation to determine each defendant\u2019s culpability, an expenditure of additional judicial and prosecutorial resources that contradicts the clear legislative intent. (Sen. Rules Com. Rep., <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">On the other hand, the People suggest the plain meaning of the statute requires each defendant to pay the entire amount of the cleanup cost, and urge the trial court be directed to order each appellant to pay the full amount, $12,464.82. While the argument has superficial appeal, it also fails to accomplish the legislative intent. Health and Safety Code section 11374.5, subdivision (b) has no punitive purpose that we can detect; rather, the desired result is simply to recover the costs of cleanup. It is a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>designed to facilitate reimbursement\u2014nothing more. Adopting the People\u2019s interpretation would create a potential windfall to the agency entitled to reimbursement. In this case, for example, the agency could recover as much as $87,253.74<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with no requirement that it return amounts in excess of cleanup costs. We do not agree the Legislature contemplated such a result. Indeed, the statute makes no mention of how, if at all, excess funds should be allocated by the county treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In our view, the imposition of joint and several liability, as the trial court did here, best carries out the section\u2019s legislative intent. By ordering each defendant jointly and severally liable for all cleanup costs, the trial court: (1) ensured, as best it could, full reimbursement to the agency; and (2) protected, as best it could, the defendants from paying amounts exceeding $12,464.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Accordingly, we hold the court correctly ordered joint and several liability upon each of the appellants convicted of violating subdivision (a) of Health and Safety Code section 11374.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">B. <em>Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">We now turn to the question of the joint and several order to pay restitution pursuant to Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f), which provides in part: \u201cIn every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims. . . .\u201d Unlike the preceding issue, our analysis of this section is facilitated by two cases which review a code section analogous to Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f). In those cases the courts relied upon certain safeguards in the statute, also present here, to conclude joint and several liability was appropriate. We shall reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Zito </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 736 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 491] <em>(Zito) </em>concerned a restitution order made pursuant to Government Code former section 13967.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Zito received a prison term, and the trial court ordered direct victim restitution against Zito and his codefendant in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>$300,000 jointly and severally. In affirming the order, the court noted joint and several liability (1) is not prohibited by Government Code former section 13967, (2) increases the likelihood the victim will be compensated, (3) is more likely to cause the criminal to understand his actions have harmed a real victim, and (4) does give the defendant some civil due process rights\u2014notice of the proposed order, right to a court hearing to contest liability and amount. Concerning the practical difficulties of administering a joint and several order, <em>Zito </em>observed the court can require notice to defendant of payments made by a codefendant, defendant has a right of contribution against a recalcitrant codefendant, and Government Code former section 13967, subdivision (c) lessens the chance of double recovery by a victim by crediting any payment in excess of the restitution amount against any other judgments resulting for the same loss. The court concluded the trial court properly ordered joint and several liability pursuant to Government Code former section 13967.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1096 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 35] <em>{Arnold) </em>likewise dealt with a joint and several restitution order pursuant to Government Code former section 13967, subdivision (c). Arnold was sentenced to <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Arnold </em>court agreed with <em>Zito </em>that the section provides sufficient civil due process protection by its notice and hearing procedures. \u201cWe additionally find that the Legislature has implicitly addressed any further concern that joint and several liability is more appropriately a civil law concept by simply providing that such an order does have a civil side to it.\u201d <em>{Arnold, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 1100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Thus, both <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Zito </em>hold a joint and several restitution order is proper under Government Code former section 13967.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Turning back to our case, defendants argue first that the statutory provisions of Government Code former section 13967, subdivision (c) are different from those of Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f). Unfortunately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>they do not explain how the provisions of the two sections are different. As we noted in footnote 6, <em>ante, </em>to us the sections appear similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f) provides in part: \u201cIn every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims. . . .\u201d Just as with Government Code former section 13967, Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f) \u201cdoes not expressly authorize joint and several liability restitution orders, neither does its provision prohibit such orders.\u201d <em>(Arnold, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 1099.) The restitution order is treated as a civil judgment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (h)), a defendant has the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(1)), and, just as the <em>Zito </em>court noted, a defendant has the right to have any amount in excess of the restitution amount credited to any other judgment arising from the same loss. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (j); <em>Zito, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">As we see it, Penal Code section 1202.4 and Government Code former section 13967 are sufficiently similar to dictate our adoption of the reasoning of <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Zito.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Next, defendants argue their case differs from <em>Arnold </em>because in that case Arnold and his codefendant were sentenced by different judges, whereas they were sentenced contemporaneously by the same judge. Suffice it to say, we find no authority, including <em>Arnold, </em>that gives any importance to whether codefendants are sentenced by the same judge at the same sentencing hearing. Such a distinction makes no sense and would lead to absurd results. We reject it out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Defendants further argue the trial court did not assess their individual culpability before imposing their joint and several liability. If it had, they contend, the amount each was assessed would vary according to his culpability. This contention was explicitly rejected in <em>Zito, </em>and we believe correctly so. \u201cAccording to Zito, his codefendant was more culpable. However, by pleading no contest to grand theft, Zito admits responsibility for the losses. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1016, subd. 3.) He is therefore \u2018culpable\u2019 and is responsible for the full amount of the victim\u2019s losses. Accordingly, his obligation to pay does not hinge upon the culpability of his codefendant.\u201d <em>{Zito, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 746.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Subsumed within this preceding argument is defendants\u2019 additional contention, as expressed by trial counsel at sentencing, that it is unfair that some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>defendants did not have standing to challenge service of a search warrant, yet are responsible for the entire amount of restitution. We fail to understand the connection between the two issues, and defendants cite no authority to enlighten us.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We hold the court correctly imposed restitution jointly and severally pursuant to Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Martin, Acting P.
