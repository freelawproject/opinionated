As pertinent, defendant was sentenced to a term of 25 years to life under the provisions of California\u2019s \u201cfirst strike\u201d sentencing law as set forth in Penal Code section 667.61.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude this sentence did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment, nor did the sentence violate defendant\u2019s right to the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Defendant was charged by an amended information with five felony counts arising from the same set of facts: first degree burglary with intent to commit rape (count 1; \u00a7\u00a7 459, 261, subd. (a)(2)); sexual battery (count 2; \u00a7 243.4, subd. (a)); and three counts of rape by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury (counts 3-5; \u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)). It was also alleged that defendant committed counts 3 through 5 while personally armed with a deadly weapon, a knife (\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (b)), and during the commission of a first degree burglary (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (c)(2), (d)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">After trial, a jury convicted defendant on all counts and found all the accompanying allegations true.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The trial court sentenced defendant to a total state prison term of thirty-seven years and eight months to life, computed as follows: twenty-five years to life on count 3 (\u00a7\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2), 459, 667.61), plus a two-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>enhancement on the personal arming allegation (\u00a7 12022.3, subd. (b)); six years on count 4, plus a two-year enhancement on the personal arming allegation, run consecutively to the term on count 3; and an unstayed term of two years on count 5, plus an eight-month enhancement on the personal arming allegation, run consecutively to the terms on counts 3 and 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred prejudicially by preventing him from eliciting a witness\u2019s opinion as to whether a person with a certain blood-alcohol percentage would be impaired. He further contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to call a certain witness and by failing to pursue an inconsistency between the victim\u2019s trial testimony and her pretrial story. He also raises numerous claims of sentencing error, some of which attack the constitutionality of section 667.61, the \u201cone strike\u201d provision mandating life sentences for certain forcible rapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The People not only disagree with all of defendant\u2019s claims of error but contend that defendant\u2019s sentence was too light because the trial court\u2019s imposition of a reduced enhancement of eight months on count 5, rather than a full-term two-year enhancement, was unauthorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Agreeing with the People, we shall modify the judgment to impose a two-year enhancement on count 5. In all other respects, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The essential facts were not disputed; indeed, they were confirmed by defendant in his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">On the morning of November 7, 1995,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the victim, Angelina S., discovered that she had left her keys in the locked bedroom of her duplex. Unable to open the door, she called a neighbor; the neighbor suggested asking the help of defendant, who lived across the street. Defendant succeeded in opening the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Before going to bed that night the victim locked the doors to her house, but not the bedroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">In the early morning hours of November 8, the victim was awakened by the cries of her seven-year-old daughter Paula, who was sleeping in the same bed. The victim saw a man standing at the foot of the bed. In her half-awake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>state she thought he was wearing a blue and white Power Ranger outfit; later she realized that he had on a mask.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She screamed, got out of bed, and tried to reach the bedroom door, with Paula behind her. Defendant pinned the victim facedown on the floor and lay on top of her. During the struggle she perceived that he was naked except for the \u201cmask.\u201d When she managed to remove the \u201cmask,\u201d she recognized defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">She asked him what he wanted, telling him she had no money or jewelry. She believed that he answered: \u201c[That\u2019s] not what I want.\u201d She asked him to let Paula leave the room; he agreed and told Paula to go to bed. In her native Tagalog, the victim then told Paula to call the authorities (avoiding the words \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201c911\u201d for fear of alarming defendant). Soon afterward Paula called 911 and told the victim in Tagalog from outside the bedroom that she had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The victim asked defendant why he was doing this and \u201c[didn\u2019t he] have a wife to do this with?\u201d He told her to shut up. When she screamed instead, he slapped her three or four times, telling her to \u201c[t]hink about [her] daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Defendant initially agreed not to insert his penis into the victim so that she would not become pregnant. As the struggle continued, however, he took off her sweatpants and underwear, touching her \u201cprivate part.\u201d He then put his hand under her shirt and touched her breast. Next, he tried to open her legs by force and penetrate her. He had a hard time because she continued to resist and try to move away. However, he succeeded in pushing his penis into her vagina three separate times, though he could not get it all the way in.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The victim heard her dog bark. Defendant asked her what the noise was; she said she did not know. He stood up, pulled her by the hair, and told her to go to the bedroom window. When he let go of her hair, she ran from the bedroom and out of the house, screaming. She saw the police outside. A sheriff\u2019s deputy stopped defendant as he tried to run out the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Investigating officers found a large kitchen knife belonging to the victim on the bedroom floor alongside her bed; she had not put it there. It had been in her kitchen when she went to sleep that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Deputy Osborne, one of the investigating officers, detected a mild odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath but observed no other signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">A detective conducted a videotaped interview of defendant (which was played for the jury) around 5:40 a.m. on November 8. Defendant confessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>his crimes but blamed them on his alcoholism and the alcohol he had drunk throughout the day. He admitted that he had penetrated the victim on three separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">A physical examination of the victim revealed two small tears at the bottom of her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Testifying on his own behalf, defendant stated that he is an alcoholic and that he assaulted the victim on account of his alcoholism. He drank six quarts of beer on November 7 and also smoked a marijuana joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">During the afternoon of November 7, despite having drunk three quarts of beer already, he was able to drive his daughter safely to a karate class. By 4 p.m. he was still feeling all right, able to think about his decisions and make plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Defendant and his wife quarreled at dinner. Afterward he went out. He could not remember what he was doing between 11:30 p.m. on the 7th and 2:30 a.m. on the 8th, but he remembered entering the victim\u2019s house through the window, going to her washer and grabbing a pair of her panties for a disguise, then going back to the kitchen and taking a knife, which he intended to use to scare her. He took off his clothes in her living room before going to the bedroom. He never actually made a decision to assault her, but he knew what he was doing and did exactly what he intended to do. The alcohol told him it was all right to do everything he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">After entering the victim\u2019s bedroom he put the knife down. At that point the victim woke up. He remembered all the details of the offenses clearly and described them essentially as the victim had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Counsel stipulated that a blood test administered to defendant at 10 a.m. on November 8 showed a blood-alcohol level of .07 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">I-II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">Defendant contends that as applied to the facts of this case section 667.61 constitutes cruel and/or unusual punishment under both the United States and the California Constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Section 667.61 provides as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201c(a) A person who is convicted of an offense specified in subdivision (c) under one or more of the circumstances specified in subdivision (d) . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life and shall not be eligible for release on parole for 25 years ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">\u201c(c) This section shall apply to any of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201c(1) A violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201c(d) The following circumstances shall apply to the offenses specified in subdivision (c):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201c(4) The defendant committed the present offense during the commission of a burglary, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 460,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] with intent to commit an offense specified in subdivision (c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Thus section 667.61 mandated a minimum sentence of 25 years to life in state prison for defendant because he committed the kind of rape specified in section 261, subdivision (a)(2), while engaged in the commission of a first degree burglary done with the intent to commit that kind of rape. (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (d)(4).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Before the trial court imposed sentence under section 667.61, it considered and denied a motion by defendant challenging the mandatory sentence as \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d under the federal Constitution (8th and 14th Amends.) and as \u201ccruel or unusual\u201d under the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 17). We shall conclude the court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>According to defendant, his sentence is cruel and unusual punishment under the federal Constitution and \u201ccruel or unusual\u201d punishment under the California Constitution because (1) at age 39 he had no prior felony convictions; (2) though armed with a knife, he left it on the floor throughout the incident; (3) he neither inflicted nor was charged with inflicting great bodily injury; (4) the present incident is \u201cappellant\u2019s only felony\u201d (original emphasis); (5) his punishment exceeds that which may be imposed on a first degree murderer or other unlawful killer; (6) his punishment also far exceeds that which may be imposed on a perpetrator of violent rape, rape in concert, or other sexual crimes if not subject to section 667.61; and (7) even if rape during the commission of a burglary is more heinous than rape alone, the disparity in sentencing is irrationally great. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">1. <em>The federal standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In asserting his federal claim, defendant relies on <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 277 [103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L. Ed.2d 637]. In Solem, the court found unconstitutional a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a seventh nonviolent felony. A bare majority of the court held \"... a court\u2019s proportionality analysis under the Eighth Amendment should be guided by objective criteria, including (i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 292 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3010-3011, 77 L.Ed.2d at p. 650].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Solem </em>is weakened by <em>Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 957 [111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836], in which a life sentence without possibility of parole for possessing 672 grams of cocaine was upheld. <em>Harmelin </em>produced five separate opinions. While seven justices supported a proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment, only four favored application of all three factors cited in <em>Solem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In <em>Harmelin, </em>Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, concluded <em>Solem </em>was wrongly decided and the Eighth Amendment contained no proportionality guarantee. <em>{Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 965 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2686, 115 L.Ed.2d at p. 846].) Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices O\u2019Connor and Souter, found the Eighth Amendment encompassed \u201ca narrow proportionality principle\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 997 [111 S.Ct. atp. 2702, 115 L.Ed.2d at p. 866]) and \u201cdoes not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to the crime.\u201d <em>{Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at p. 1001 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2705, 115 L.Ed.2d at p. 869] (opn. of Kennedy, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Consideration of the first factor identified in <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. 277 [103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637] was sufficient to uphold the constitutionality of the defendant\u2019s sentence; intra- and interjurisdictional analyses are appropriate only in rare cases. <em>(Harmelin </em>v. <em>Michigan, supra, </em>501 U.S. at pp. 1004-1005 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2706-2707, 115 L.Ed.2d at p. 871].) The defendant in <em>Harmelin </em>was lawfully sentenced to life without parole (LWOP) for possessing a large quantity of drugs. Defendant here, a forcible rapist, received a lesser sentence. Defendant\u2019s sentence is not \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to defendant\u2019s more serious crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Moreover, in <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. at page 296 [103 S.Ct. at pages 3012-3013, 77 L.Ed.2d at page 653], the court focused on the nonviolent nature of both the defendant\u2019s current offense of uttering a \u201c \u2018no account\u2019 \u201d check (\u201c \u2018one of the most passive felonies a person could commit\u2019 \u201d) and his prior offenses. The majority acknowledged a life sentence for other violent criminals would pass constitutional muster. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 299, fn. 26 [103 S.Ct. at p. 3014, 77 L.Ed.2d at p. 655].) Therefore, even under <em>Solem, </em>defendant\u2019s sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">2. <em>The California standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Under <em>In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921], a punishment may violate the California Constitution \u201cif, although not cruel or unusual in its method, it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424, fn. omitted.) To decide this question we must first examine \u201cthe nature of the offense and the offender, with particular regard to the degree of danger which both present to society\u201d; then we must compare the challenged penalty to \u201cpunishment prescribed in the same jurisdiction for other more serious offenses\u201d; finally, we must compare the challenged penalty to \u201cpunishment prescribed for the same offense in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 847].) In examining \u201cthe nature of the offense and the offender,\u201d we must consider not only the offense as defined by the Legislature but also \u201cthe facts of the crime in question\u201d (including its motive, its maimer of commission, the extent of the defendant\u2019s involvement, and the consequences of his acts); we must also consider the defendant\u2019s individual culpability in light of his age, prior criminality, personal characteristics, and state of mind. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 305, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 479 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Applying the first prong of the <em>Lynch-Dillon </em>test does not produce an outcome favorable to defendant. It is true, as the trial court found, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>defendant had an insignificant prior record consisting only of \u201cDUI\u201d offenses (driving under the influence), that he had led a productive life as a husband and father, and that his blood-alcohol level, though not a defense, had some tendency to mitigate the gravity of his conduct. But, as the trial court also found, defendant\u2019s crimes were extremely serious and dangerous to society in themselves. Furthermore, they were aggravated by numerous circumstances: the element of planning shown by his decision to invade a home which he had found out how to enter surreptitiously earlier that day, the callousness of choosing to prey on a sleeping victim with a small daughter whose presence he knew of, the deliberation revealed by his systematic preparations (obtaining a knife from one room and a disguise from another, carefully stripping and putting his clothes down where he could easily have retrieved them if surprised), the gratuitous violence he inflicted when angered, and his belief that everything he intended to do to the victim was \u201cokay.\u201d Moreover, it was only by chance that he did not inflict far more serious injury on the victim, either through the act of rape itself or through use of the knife with which he had equipped himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Defendant fares no better under the second prong of the <em>Lynch-Dillon </em>test. He argues that his penalty under section 667.61 is harsher than that imposed in California for any type of unlawful killing short of first degree murder or for any type of sexual offense (including a violation of section 261, subdivision (a)(2)) not committed in the course of a first degree burglary. However, this argument ignores the fact that defendant\u2019s acts involved both the commission of more than one kind of offense (rape and first degree burglary) and the commission of one offense for the purpose of committing another. The penalties for single offenses, such as those defendant cites, cannot properly be compared to those for multiple offenses\u2014especially where, as here, one offense was committed in order to commit another. Moreover, the gravity of the two crimes committed by defendant (burglary and rape) is greater than the sum of their parts: being raped in her own home is a woman\u2019s worst nightmare.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Furthermore, \u201c[bjecause it is the Legislature which determines the appropriate penalty for criminal offenses, defendant must overcome a \u2018considerable burden\u2019 in convincing us his sentence was disproportionate to his level of culpability.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weddle </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1196-1197 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].) The Legislature has chosen to make other offenses not involving homicide punishable by life imprisonment without possibility of parole: kidnapping for the purpose of ransom, extortion or robbery with bodily harm short of death (\u00a7 209, subd. (a)) and attempted train wrecking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>(\u00a7 218).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such sentences have been found not to constitute cruel or unusual punishment because the Legislature could reasonably decide that crimes which involve an inherent danger to the life of the victim are particularly heinous even if no death occurs. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 52, 64 [43 Cal.Rptr .2d 434] [aggravated kidnapping for ransom]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castillo </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 36, 66 [284 Cal.Rptr. 382] [same]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1207, 1237 [277 Cal.Rptr. 382] [same].) Both of the offenses that bring defendant within section 667.61 fit this description. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cburglary of a residence\u201d could properly be classified as a serious felony for enhancement purposes (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(18)) because of its dangerousness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 832 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736]. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 912, 920 [79 Cal.Rptr. 650] [first degree burglary dangerous enough to merit severe punishment without any aggravating factors].) The commission of rape by means of \u201cforce, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another\u201d (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)) self-evidently entails a threat to the life of the victim. A fortiori, if offenses such as aggravated kidnapping for ransom and attempted train wrecking, even absent death, may be punished by LWOP without offending California\u2019s bar against cruel or unusual punishment, it cannot offend that constitutional provision to punish the combination of offenses defendant committed by a life sentence with the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Defendant also has the burden of proving that \u201c. . . the punishment prescribed for his offense, as compared to that imposed for similar offenses in other jurisdictions, is unconstitutional under the third prong of [the <em>Lynch-Dillon </em>test].\u201d <em>(In re DeBeque </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 241, 255 [260 Cal.Rptr. 441].) He has made no showing on this point; thus he has failed to meet his burden. We note, however, that a federal court, applying the then-governing federal test for cruel and unusual punishment set out in <em>Solem </em>v. <em>Helm, supra, </em>463 U.S. at pp. 291-292 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 3010-3011, 77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 649-650] (which required the same sort of three-step evaluation as the <em>Lynch-Dillon </em>test), rejected an Eighth Amendment attack on Louisiana\u2019s mandatory sentence of LWOP for \u201caggravated rape\u201d because at least four other jurisdictions provided for life sentences for rape.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(5th Cir. 1989) 882 F.2d 160, 167.) In light of this fact, we see no possibility that a sentence of life with possibility of parole for rape in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>the course of a first degree burglary performed with the intent to commit that rape is disproportionately harsh compared to the punishment other jurisdictions might mete out for the same battery of offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">For all the above reasons, defendant\u2019s sentence is not cruel or unusual under the California standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Defendant also contends that section 667.61 as applied violates the principle of equal protection of the laws (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a)) because there is no justification for treating him far more harshly than a rapist who did not commit his crime in the course of a burglary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This contention fails because defendant has not shown that he was treated more harshly than other similarly situated persons. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 101, 103 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 781].) Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the offender to whom he compares himself has not been convicted of \u201cthe same crime\u201d as himself. Rape is one crime; rape in the commission of a first degree burglary is two.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendant seeks to evade this obvious fact by referring euphemistically to his first degree burglary as \u201c[the] conditions [under which] the crime [of rape] occurred.\u201d This rhetorical ploy cannot turn two crimes\u2014rape and first degree burglary\u2014into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Furthermore, as noted, first degree burglary is a serious and dangerous crime in itself, meriting severe punishment regardless of whether additional aggravating circumstances exist. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, 21A </em>Cal.App.2d at p. 920.) Defendant\u2019s bare assertion that there can be no justification for treating him more harshly than a \u201csimple\u201d rapist fails for this reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Each party contends that the trial court erred as to an enhancement. Defendant contends that the enhancements pursuant to section 12022.3, subdivision (b), on counts 4 and 5 must be stricken because section 1170.1, subdivision (a), does not include section 12022.3, subdivision (b), on its list of permissible enhancements on subordinate terms.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The People contend, on the contrary, that we must modify the eight-month enhancement on count 5 to a full-term two-year enhancement because the applicable statute does not authorize the trial court to reduce enhancements imposed thereunder. We disagree with defendant and agree with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">1. <em>Defendant\u2019s contention.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention fails because the general rule of section 1170.1, subdivision (a), on which he relies, is trumped by the more specific rule of section 1170.1, subdivision (i): \u201cFor any violation of paragraph (2) . . . of subdivision (a) of Section 261 . . .the number of enhancements which may be imposed shall not be limited, regardless of whether the enhancements are pursuant to this or some other section of law. <em>Each of the enhancements shall be a full and separately served enhancement </em>and shall not be merged with any term or with any other enhancement.\u201d (Italics added.) This provision was enacted to nullify, as to violations of section 261, subdivision (a)(2), the general limitation on enhancements stated in section 1170.1, subdivision (a). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tassell </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 77, 91 [201 Cal.Rptr. 567, 679 P.2d 1] [overruled on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 401 (27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757)].) Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, there is no \u201capparent conflict\u201d between subdivisions (a) and (i) of section 1170.1 which would justify invoking the \u201crule of lenity\u201d on his behalf so as to reduce the full-term enhancements which subdivision (i) was plainly intended to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">2. <em>The People\u2019s contention.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Pointing to the mandate of section 1170.1, subdivision (i), that full-term enhancements be imposed for all violations of section 261, subdivision (a)(2), the People argue that the trial court\u2019s reduction of the enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>on count 5 to one third the midterm was unauthorized.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore they ask us to modify the judgment to impose the full two-year enhancement on that count. We shall do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">If a trial court imposes a sentence unauthorized by law, a reviewing court may correct that sentence whenever the error is called to the court\u2019s attention. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Serrato </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 753, 763 [109 Cal.Rptr. 65, 512 P.2d 289].) Defendant in his reply brief makes no argument that the sentence imposed here was permissible in light of the clear mandate of section 1170.1, subdivision (i) (aside from his erroneous claim that section 1170.1, subdivision (a), rather than subdivision (i), controls). Instead he argues that the People have waived their claim of error, either because they failed to raise it below at the time of sentencing (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 353 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]) or because they have not raised it \u201cappropriately\u201d in this court by a People\u2019s appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 164, 167-168, fn. 1 [216 Cal.Rptr. 24].) Defendant\u2019s waiver arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">First, the waiver rule of <em>Scott </em>does not apply because the court in <em>Scott </em>expressly excluded unauthorized sentences from the scope of that rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 354.) Second, defendant\u2019s authority for the proposition that the People can raise unauthorized-sentence claims only on their own appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>James, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d 164) has not been followed on this point in any other published decision, and (as defendant candidly acknowledges) more recent authority has tacitly rejected its holding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 119, 126 [253 Cal.Rptr. 190]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Benton </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 92, 102 [161 Cal.Rptr. 12] [cited with approval in <em>Rowland].) </em>Furthermore, the holding of <em>James </em>illogically abridges the clear and simple rule of <em>Serrato: </em>If we may correct unauthorized sentences whenever they come to our attention, it must follow that any means by which the error is called to our attention are \u201cappropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore we conclude that <em>James </em>was wrongly decided on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Under our inherent authority to correct an unauthorized sentence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Serrato, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 763), we modify the judgment to change the enhancement on count 5 from eight months to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The sentence is modified to increase the enhancement on count 5 to two years. As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court shall prepare an amended abstract of judgment reflecting this modification and shall furnish a copy to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Sparks, Acting P.
