J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG6\">A jury convicted John Tauta Lepolo of second degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187), during which he used a rock (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)). He was sentenced to prison for 15 years to life, plus 1 year, and appeals, claiming the trial court erroneously excluded and admitted evidence, the jury was misinstructed, and the prosecutor committed misconduct. We reject his contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Late on the night of July 29, 1994, Lepolo and a relative by marriage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe pedestrian,\u201d were jaywalking across Chicago Avenue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Riverside, attempting to beat oncoming traffic, when the latter was struck by a Volkswagen bus being driven by the victim. After Lepolo checked on the pedestrian and discovered that he was unresponsive, Lepolo approached the bus, said he was going to kill the victim, pulled him out of the bus and began beating and kicking him, despite the victim\u2019s assertions that the collision had been an accident and he was sorry.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">A bouncer from a nearby nightclub and his friend approached and tried to calm Lepolo, then pushed him away from the victim, without success. Finally, the bouncer gave Lepolo a bear hug to prevent him from further beating the victim, but Lepolo put his hand inside his jacket simulating a firearm, told the men he had a gun and instructed them to \u201cback off\u2019 or he would shoot them. When they did, he ran off into a nearby field and disappeared. After the victim assured the men that he was all right, they went to assist the pedestrian. While they were distracted with him, Lepolo returned to the bus and began beating and kicking the victim again. When the men came towards the bus to assist the victim, Lepolo took off across the field. The men returned to the pedestrian\u2019s side and, this time, Lepolo returned to the bus carrying a 27-pound cement rock, which he proceeded to throw twice, while aiming, onto the victim\u2019s face and head, killing him. Lepolo was preparing to throw the rock onto the victim\u2019s face and head for a third time when the men set out towards him and he ran off for the last time. Lepolo later admitted to officers and at trial that he wanted to hurt the victim, although he denied wanting to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Lepolo made it to the home of relatives nearby, and although they checked on the welfare of the pedestrian, Lepolo did not nor did he even inquire of them as to the status of his in-law\u2019s condition. Lepolo went into hiding and stayed there, even after discovering that the victim had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Lepolo claimed that he was angry and in a rage at the time he killed the victim because he believed that the victim had killed the pedestrian and that the victim was drunk because Lepolo smelled alcohol on his breath and he appeared to be unsteady on his feet. Therefore, Lepolo argued to the jury, he was guilty only of heat of passion voluntary manslaughter. Lepolo also introduced evidence that he had consumed quite a bit of alcohol shortly before the incident, and an expert testified for the defense that this would impair Lepolo\u2019s thinking and judgment. On the basis of this evidence, Lepolo argued, alternatively, that he was guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Issues and Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Av_\">1. <em>Exclusion of Evidence</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">2. <em>Admission of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">a. <em>Impeachment Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Lepolo now contends that admission of this evidence requires that we reverse his conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">During cross-examination of Lepolo, the prosecutor asked him, \u201cDo you remember on . February 5th, [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] holding a 36-inch machete above your head and waving it towards an Orange Police Department officer who was in uniform and threatening him with it?\u201d Lepolo replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">On February 5, 1994, a police officer from the City of Orange was on patrol when he saw a number of men, who appeared to be drinking, in an alleyway. Lepolo, who was part of the group, ran into a nearby apartment. A few minutes later, Lepolo came up to a fence that separated him from that officer and two others. He yelled some things which the officer could not understand. Lepolo raised a 36-inch machete up over his head, pointed it at one of the other officers, who was in uniform, and said, \u201cI want that officer.\u201d The three officers drew their weapons, pointed them at Lepolo and demanded that he throw down the machete. Instead, Lepolo ran back into the apartment. After Lepolo was arrested for brandishing a weapon, he told the police who questioned him, \u201cThat officer pissed me off. I wanted to whack his head off.\u201d He said he grabbed the machete because he \u201cwas going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>whack [the officer\u2019s] head off.\u201d Lepolo added, \u201cMaybe next time I\u2019ll use a nine,\u201d which the interrogating officer took to mean a 9-millimeter handgun. When asked whether he still felt anger towards that police officer, Lepolo replied, \u201cI hope I see him again, just him and me, I don\u2019t care about his gun. I\u2019ll have a nine or just whack his head off. I\u2019ll get him.\u201d When the interrogating officer asked Lepolo why he was upset, Lepolo told him that the officer he wanted to harm had flipped him off. The officer tried to explain to Lepolo what had transpired between him and the threatened officer and Lepolo said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The trial court concluded that the above facts constituted the crime of brandishing a weapon, which, when combined with Lepolo\u2019s postarrest statements, constituted conduct indicating moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In contesting the admission of this evidence, Lepolo contends that the trial court should have been confined to the least adjudicated elements of the crime of brandishing a weapon, and, therefore, its reliance upon his statements was error. He is incorrect.  When the fact that a defendant has suffered a prior <em>conviction </em>is used to impeach, anything beyond the least adjudicated elements may not be examined because problems of proof (and the confusion resulting therefrom) and unfair surprise do not exist. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 296 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 316 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111].) They may well exist, however, when conduct which did not result in a conviction is used to impeach. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 296.) From a logical standpoint, it makes no sense to require the trial court to \u201cname that crime,\u201d to the exclusion of others, when presented with facts of past misconduct. This not only impinges on the prosecution\u2019s theoretical discretion to charge offenses, but it is meaningless, since there never will be a conviction for any particular offense arising from the conduct,  Therefore, there was no need in this case for the trial court to designate what occurred between Lepolo and the police officer as brandishing a weapon, to the exclusion of any other offense. Of course, it constituted a brandishing. It also constituted a terrorist threat, under Penal Code section 422,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a matter which neither side argued to the trial court, and, therefore, which it had no ability to consider. Whether the trial court admits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>evidence of past misconduct should be determined solely on the basis that that conduct evinces moral turpitude. The label is not important\u2014the conduct is.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 419 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 519], this court determined that a violation of Penal Code section 422 evinces moral turpitude. Moral turpitude has been variously described as follows: conduct indicating bad character, a readiness to do evil or moral depravity of any kind <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 314; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 991 [264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 782 P.2d 627]); acts \u201cattended by knowledge of [the] circumstances and a conscious decision to exploit them sufficient to signify a readiness to do evil . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1398, 1402 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 495]); \u201c \u2018an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man . . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mansfield </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 82, 87 [245 Cal.Rptr. 800]); or conduct involving violence, menace or threats <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1274 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 205]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cornelio </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1580 [255 Cal.Rptr. 775]).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Zataray </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 390 [219 Cal.Rptr. 33], the appellate court concluded that simple kidnapping was a crime involving moral turpitude. It held, \u201cThe gravamen of the offense is some sort of compulsion causing the victim to feel reasonable apprehension or fear. [Citation.] . . . [I]t. . . involves \u2018bad character\u2019 and \u2018readiness to do evil\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 399-400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Miles </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 474, 481-482 [218 Cal.Rptr. 378], the Court of Appeal held that arson, the \u201c \u2018willful. . . and malicious\u2019 \u201d burning of property \u201cnecessarily involve[d] an intent \u2018to do evil.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1488, 1493 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 716], a case cited by Lepolo, the appellate court concluded that vandalism involved moral turpitude. It noted that the crime required the defendant to act \u201c \u2018maliciously,\u2019 \u201d which \u201c \u2018import[s] a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act ....\u2019\u201d In addition, \u201c \u2018there must be a wanton and wilful (or \u201creckless\u201d) disregard of the plain dangers of harm, without justification, excuse or mitigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Finally, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dewey </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 216 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 537], fleeing or attempting to elude a pursuing officer by driving a vehicle in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>intent to evade, was held to involve moral turpitude. The Court of Appeal concluded, \u201c\u2018Wantonness\u2019 is defined as having \u2018consciousness of conduct, intent to do or omit the act ... , realization of the probable injury to another, and reckless disregard of the consequences.\u2019 [Citation.] In the context of reckless driving, the term \u2018willful\u2019 refers to the intentional disregard for safety. [Citation.] ... [^Q In holding that escape or attempted escape without force or violence . . . is a crime of moral turpitude, the court . . . [concluded that it] . . . involve[s] inherent dangers to personal safety . . . . It . . . creates an obvious potential for violence .... [T]he court reasoned that \u2018[a] defendant who was willing to expose himself and others to the potential for physical harm . . . may be equally [well] motivated and prepared to violate a testimonial oath in order to escape conviction.\u2019 [Citation.] <em>[% </em>Similarly, a defendant consciously places the safety of others in jeopardy when driving with the intent to evade a pursuing officer and with a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property while fleeing from a pursuing officer. [The offense] \u2018. . . carries with it as a likely consequence the possibility of . . . physical harm . . . <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 221-222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Lepolo does not here contest the existence of the facts, as stated on the record, which constitute the prior misconduct. The question is, do these facts evince moral turpitude? They do, under the tests stated above and the language employed in the cases cited above. Even if we were to view Lepolo\u2019s conduct narrowly, as constituting merely brandishing a weapon, Lepolo cites no authority holding that even the least adjudicated elements of brandishing do not involve moral turpitude. Therefore, we cannot agree with Lepolo that the trial court\u2019s conclusion in this regard was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Lepolo contends that even if his misconduct involved moral turpitude, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the brief reference to it. In this regard, Lepolo contends only that \u201cwav[ing] a machete in the air . . . has very little bearing on appellant\u2019s veracity .... [I]n light of the prejudicial nature of the conduct.... and the slight probative value of the evidence, the trial court should have exercised its discretion to exclude the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">However, Lepolo did not just wave a machete in the air. He threatened the officer, causing the latter, and two other officers, to draw their weapons and point them at him. He thus created an extremely dangerous situation in which either he, one of the officers, or, perhaps, even an innocent bystander could have been harmed. Afterwards, he clearly stated that it was his intent at the time he threatened the officer and displayed his machete to \u201cwhack [the officer\u2019s] head off.\u201d He thereafter insisted that he planned to harm the officer by using either a gun or a machete. These activities have more than \u201clittle\u201d bearing on Lepolo\u2019s veracity. The prejudicial impact of the misconduct was kept to a minimum by the manner in which it was introduced to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>jurors and by the instruction directing that they may consider such evidence only in assessing Lepolo\u2019s credibility, but that it did \u201cnot necessarily destroy or impair his believability.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Certainly, Lepolo\u2019s bare-bones assertions fall short of sustaining his heavy burden of showing that the trial court acted unreasonably in admitting the evidence, and this resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.

The instruction began, \u201cEvidence has been introduced for the purpose of showing that defendant . . . engaged in past criminal conduct amounting to a misdemeanor.\u201d Since no evidence other than this incident was ever introduced at trial concerning Lepolo's past conduct, it may be assumed that the jury knew the instruction referred to it. Additionally, the instruction goes on to provide, \u201cThe fact that [Lepolo] engaged in past criminal conduct amounting to a misdemeanor, if it is established, does not necessarily destroy or impair his believability. It is one of the circumstances that you may take into consideration in weighing . . . [Lepolo\u2019s] testimony. . . .\u201d The import of the instruction, taken as a whole, was that the operative words were not \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d but \u201cpast criminal conduct.\u201d Certainly, Lepolo cannot contend that the jury would not have understood that this related to the incident at issue. Finally, if Lepolo wished the instruction to be more explicit in this regard, he should have requested an appropriate modification.
