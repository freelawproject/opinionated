Herbert filed his response to the petition on November 25, 1985; he asked for dissolution of the marriage and for the resolution of property issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">On October 29, 1987, trial of the action commenced. The last of the written arguments of the parties was filed not later than January 5, 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was submitted for decision on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">On April 25, 1988, at 8:50 a.m., Herbert was found dead in his home. At 3 p.m. on the same day, the trial court entered a minute order dissolving the marriage and deciding the property issues. Notice of the ruling was given by the clerk of the court on April 26, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">On June 7, 1988, Herbert\u2019s former lawyer and Iva\u2019s attorney stipulated in writing that (1) the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue a decision or a judgment terminated upon the death of Herbert and (2) the trial court\u2019s minute order of April 25, 1988, was \u201cnull and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Appellant Dan Mallory is the executor named in Herbert\u2019s will. On July 7, 1994, appellant filed a motion to substitute himself into the dissolution action as the real party in interest, to set aside the stipulation, to confirm the findings and order of the trial court, and to enter a judgment nunc pro tunc as of a date prior to Herbert\u2019s death. Iva apparently opposed the motion, although her opposition papers are not a part of our record.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">After hearing and argument, the trial court entered a minute order on August 18, 1994, which (1) substituted appellant in place of Herbert in the action; (2) set aside the June 7, 1988, stipulation on the ground that Herbert\u2019s former attorney had no authority to execute it; (3) denied appellant\u2019s request for entry of judgment nunc pro tunc; and (4) directed that a judgment conforming to the trial court\u2019s April 25, 1988, minute order be entered as of August 18, 1994.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment was filed on August 18, 1994, and entered on September 7, 1994. It provided in part that the marriage of Herbert and Iva was dissolved as of August 18, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">On November 18, 1994, Iva moved for an order setting aside the trial court\u2019s August 18, 1994, order and the judgment entered on September 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>1994, on the ground the judgment was void. Appellant opposed the motion and noticed his own countermotion for an order reentering the judgment nunc pro tunc as of a date before Herbert\u2019s death. The two motions were argued and submitted on February 23, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">On March 3, 1995, the trial court filed a minute order which granted Iva\u2019s motion to set aside the September 7, 1994, judgment and denied appellant\u2019s motion to enter the judgment nunc pro tunc. This appeal is taken from the trial court\u2019s formal order, entered on October 25, 1995, incorporating the minute order rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">I. <em>Appealable </em>Order<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">II. <em>Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Appellant contends the trial court erred by granting Iva\u2019s motion to vacate the September 7,1994, judgment and denying his motion to enter that judgment nunc pro tunc as of a date prior to Herbert\u2019s <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant relies principally upon section 669 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 2346 of the Family Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Iva counters that the 1988 judgment was void, and thus properly vacated, because the trial court lost jurisdiction over the action at the moment Herbert died, several hours before the trial court entered its minute order decision. She cites the general rule that an action for marital dissolution abates at the death of a party <em>(In re Marriage of Williams </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 507, 510 [161 Cal.Rptr. 808]). She also relies on the notion, found in a number of Court of Appeal opinions decided during the past 30 or so years, that \u201c[u]pon the death of a party to a marriage dissolution or divorce proceeding, the court retains the power to enter judgment in conformity with matters <em>adjudicated </em>before the death[, but] it can make no further <em>adjudication </em>of issues.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 511, italics added.) As we read her argument, Iva assumes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>the word \u201cadjudicated\u201d in this statement means some on-the-record expression by the trial court of a decision to rule in a particular way in the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">B. <em>Entry of Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Section 669 reads in relevant part: \u201cIf a party dies after trial and submission of the case to a judge sitting without a jury for decision . . . and before judgment, the court may nevertheless render judgment thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Section 669 was enacted in 1872. Until 1965, it provided that if a party died \u201cafter a . . . decision\u201d but before judgment, the trial court could still render judgment. <em>(Kellogg </em>v. <em>Asbestos Corp. Ltd. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1404 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 256].) In 1965, the statute was amended to substantially its present form. (Stats. 1965, ch. 1636, \u00a7 1, p. 3730.) \u201cThe policy behind section 669 was that if the parties had done everything they could to put the case in a posture where it was ready for final rendition of judgment, a court delay should not be used to prejudice the parties.\u201d <em>(Kellogg </em>v. <em>Asbestos Corp. Ltd., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1404-1405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The language of the statute is unambiguous. The death of a party does not deprive the trial court of the power to enter a judgment so long as the case was submitted for decision before the party died. A case is \u201csubmitted\u201d on the date when \u201ceither of the following first occurs: (1) . . . the court orders the matter submitted; or (2) . . . the final paper is required to be filed or . . . argument is heard, whichever is later.\" (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 825(a); <em>Social Service Union </em>v. <em>County of Monterey </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 676, 680 [256 Cal.Rptr. 325].)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Section 669 applies to marital dissolution actions. The \u201crules of practice and procedure applicable to civil actions generally apply to, and constitute the rules of practice and procedure in,\u201d family law proceedings, \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that any other statute or rules adopted by the Judicial Council provide applicable rules.\" (Fam. Code, \u00a7 210.) We have not found any statute or rule which puts any part of a dissolution action, including the issue of the parties\u2019 marital status, beyond the reach of section 669.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>In re Marriage of Shayman </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 648, 651-652 [111 Cal.Rptr. 11], the court assumed section 669 applied to marital dissolution actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Furthermore, section 669 is not the superior court\u2019s only source of authority to enter judgment after the death of a party to a pending action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>Supreme Court held as early as 1895 that a trial court has the independent, inherent power to make findings and enter judgment when a party dies after submission of the case, and to do so nunc pro tunc as of a date before the death. In <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hale &amp; Norcross S. M. Co. </em>(1895) 108 Cal. 478 [41 P. 328], one of the defendants died after the evidentiary and argument phases had been completed, and after the trial court had announced its conclusions and directed the preparation of findings and a judgment, but before the trial court had settled and entered its findings. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s order that the findings and judgment adopted after the defendant\u2019s death be entered nunc pro tunc as of a date prior to the death. <em>(Id. </em>at p: 482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><em>Fox </em>was reaffirmed in <em>Norton </em>v. <em>City of Pomona </em>(1935) 5 Cal.2d 54, 57-58 [53 P.2d 952], a negligence case involving the collision of an automobile with a power pole. The action was tried by the court without a jury. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The plaintiff died after all the evidence and briefs had been submitted and the trial court had entered a minute order expressing its intention to enter judgment in favor of the defendant. Following the plaintiff\u2019s death, the trial court made formal findings of fact and conclusions of law and ordered them filed nunc pro tunc as of the date of the minute order. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57.) The Supreme Court, relying upon <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hale &amp; Norcross S. M. Co., supra, </em>108 Cal. 478, and <em>Leavitt v. Gibson </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 90 [43 P.2d 1091], approved the trial court\u2019s actions. (5 Cal.2d at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In both <em>Fox </em>and <em>Norton </em>the trial court had disclosed, before the party died, the identity of the litigant in whose favor the court intended to rule. Nevertheless, the announcement of a decision, even a tentative one, is not critical to the trial court\u2019s inherent power to render judgment notwithstanding the death of a party. In <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Gibson, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d 90, one of the authorities relied upon by the <em>Norton </em>court, a defendant died before the case was formally submitted. However, all the evidence had been heard and both sides had rested. The plaintiff\u2019s opening brief and the defendants\u2019 reply brief, but not the plaintiff\u2019s closing brief, had been filed and served. <em>(Leavitt, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d at p. 105.) The trial court nevertheless went ahead and made findings of fact and conclusions of law and ordered them to be filed nunc pro tunc as of the day after the close of the evidentiary phase of the trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The Supreme Court affirmed. It did not mention that section 669 then authorized entry of judgment only if the party died \u201cafter a . . . decision.\u201d Comparing the facts in <em>Fox </em>with the facts before it, the <em>Leavitt </em>court concluded: \u201c \u2018On the day of [the defendant\u2019s] death the court was in a position to have ordered the case submitted although it had not actually made such order. The bill of exceptions does not show that any stipulation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>order for extending time for such reply brief had been made. ... In view of the facts thus shown by the record we have reached the conclusion that there is no substantial difference between the situation presented by this case with respect to the question now under consideration and that presented in <em>[Fox </em>and <em>In re Estate of Pillsbury </em>(1917) 175 Cal. 454 (166 P. 11,3 A.L.R. 1396)] to which we have referred. The delay which had occurred (at the time of [the defendant\u2019s] death) may well have been caused by \u201cthe intricacy of the questions involved\u201d, as by any cause attributable to the laches of the parties. So, in relation to the right of the trial court to have its decision filed as of [the day after the evidence was presented], we think that such right should be upheld, and that \u201cthe principle upon which its action is to be sustained is that justice may be done between the parties\u201d.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leavitt </em>v. <em>Gibson, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d at p. 105; see also <em>Collison </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 490, 495 [11 Cal.Rptr. 555, 360 P.2d 51]; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Plant Insulation Co. </em>(1944) 23 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1417 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 751].)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">A recent reference to <em>Fox, Norton, </em>and section 669 appears in <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Asbestos Corp. Ltd., supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pages 1404-1405. The Court of Appeal in <em>Kellogg </em>held it was proper for the trial court to enter judgment in a negligence action even though the plaintiff died five days after the case had been submitted for decision but before the trial court had announced a tentative decision. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1401-1402, 1404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Subsequent Supreme Court opinions do not undercut <em>Fox, Norton </em>or <em>Leavitt, </em>or require us to impart a meaning to the current version of section 669 inconsistent with its literal language. The latest Supreme Court decision involving the death of party to a marital dissolution action is <em>In re Marriage of Hilke </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 215 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 371, 841 P.2d 891]. In <em>Hilke, </em>one of the spouses died after entry of a stipulated order bifurcating the proceeding, terminating the parties\u2019 marital status, and reserving jurisdiction over all other issues. Thereafter, the trial court, exercising its reserved jurisdiction, applied the presumption in former Civil Code section 4800.1 and found that certain real property held by the parties in joint tenancy was community property. The Court of Appeal reversed, \u201creasoning that the wife\u2019s death intervened before that statute could be applied, so that the husband\u2019s right of survivorship as a joint tenant prevailed.\u201d (4 Cal.4th at p. 218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal, and stated at one point in its opinion that \u201c[t]he death of one of the spouses abates a cause of action for dissolution, but does not deprive the court of its retained jurisdiction to determine collateral property rights if the court has previously rendered judgment dissolving the marriage.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Hilke, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>at p. 220.) The Supreme Court cited two cases for this proposition, <em>Mc-Clenny </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 140, 144 [41 Cal.Rptr. 460, 396 P.2d 916], and <em>Kinsler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 808 [175 Cal.Rptr. 564]. The Supreme Court also distinguished <em>Estate of Blair </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 161 [244 Cal.Rptr. 627], where the presumption of section 4800.1 was not applied, because in <em>Blair </em>\u201c. . . <em>the wife died before the entry of any judgment respecting the parties\u2019 marital status.\u201d (Hilke </em>at p. 221, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">We do not read <em>Hilke </em>as authority for the proposition that the death of a party to a marital dissolution action deprives the trial court of the power to enter judgment even though the issues, including marital status, were submitted before the party died. Neither section 669 nor the trial court\u2019s inherent power, as described in <em>Fox, Norton </em>and <em>Leavitt, </em>was in issue in <em>Hilke, </em>and none of the pertinent opinions referred to in <em>Hilke\u2014McClenny, Kinsler </em>and Blair\u2014support a withdrawal from <em>Fox, Norton </em>or <em>Leavitt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">In <em>McClenny </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at page 142, an interlocutory judgment granted the wife a divorce on the basis of extreme cruelty, entitling her to more than one-half the community property. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 143.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the wife died before the property was divided. The Supreme Court held that the wife\u2019s death did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to enforce the property rights \u201cadjudicated\u201d by the interlocutory decree. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 144-146.) In part, the Supreme Court said: \u201cIn the instant situation the death of one of the spouses occurred in the interval between the rendition of the interlocutory decree and the enforcement of the property rights adjudicated in that decree; the death intervened before the court had allocated the community property of the parties. [&lt;U Although the death of one of the spouses in such a case abates the divorce action, the abatement relates to the status of the parties and not to the property rights theretofore adjudicated. The death destroys the cause of action for the dissolution of the marriage; it does not liquidate the property rights which crystallized in the interlocutory decree.\u201d <em>(McClenny </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">This statement suggests that the death of a spouse subsequent to entry of a judgment covering both status and property rights operates to revoke that aspect of the judgment which ended the marital relationship.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We question the notion that the spouse\u2019s death canceled the prior status judgment as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>as the concept that one spouse\u2019s right to a greater share of the community property, which then depended upon a judgment severing the marital status on the grounds of extreme cruelty, survived the invalidation of the judgment severing the marital <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">However, whatever ambiguity may exist in <em>McClenny </em>was resolved by <em>Hilke. </em>As we noted, the <em>Hilke </em>court cited to <em>McClenny </em>as authority for the proposition that \u201c[t]he death of one of the spouses abates a cause of action for dissolution, but does not deprive the court of its retained jurisdiction to determine collateral property rights <em>if the court has previously rendered judgment dissolving the marriage.'\u201d (In re Marriage of Hilke, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 220, italics added.) We think the <em>Hilke </em>court\u2019s articulation of the principle for which <em>McClenny </em>was cited effectively retracts any implication in <em>McClenny </em>that a judgment dissolving the status of the parties\u2019 marriage is annulled by the later death of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The other two opinions mentioned in <em>Hilke </em>are also not determinative. In <em>Kinsler </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d 808, the decision cited with <em>McClenny, </em>the trial court entered interlocutory and final judgments of dissolution before the death of one of the parties; the interlocutory judgment had reserved jurisdiction over the property issues. The appellate court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to render a postdeath judgment on the reserved issues. In <em>Estate of Blair, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at page 166, the opinion the <em>Hilke </em>court distinguished, there is no indication that the parties to the related dissolution action had tried or submitted any issue to the trial court before the death of one of the spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Finally, there is an early case, <em>Kirschner </em>v. <em>Dietrich </em>(1895) 110 Cal. 502 [42 P. 1064], which likewise is not at odds with section 669 or <em>Fox, Norton </em>and <em>Leavitt. Kirschner </em>involved the death of a party to a marital dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>action after the court entered a judgment terminating the marital status but not reserving jurisdiction as to any other issue. The Supreme Court held that the representative of the deceased party could not intervene to raise matters concerning the disposition of the marital property. (110 Cal. at p. 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">In our case, the trial court withdrew its September 7, 1994, judgment because it concluded that Herbert\u2019s death abated the action and deprived the court of jurisdiction to enter judgment with respect to any of the issues submitted to it for decision on January 5, 1988. For all the reasons we have expressed, we find that the trial court was authorized to decide all these issues, including status, and to enter a conforming judgment notwithstanding Herbert\u2019s death on April 25, 1988. We will therefore vacate the trial court\u2019s order nullifying the 1994 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Our decision may appear to be inconsistent with those intermediate appellate cases, many cited by Iva, which say the trial court retains power to enter judgment in a dissolution proceeding only as to the issues \u201cadjudicated\u201d or \u201cdecided\u201d before the date of death of the deceased party. We will not spend time extensively examining each of these opinions. Even if they contradict the result we have arrived at, we would not be inclined to follow them because they contravene both the unambiguous language of the current version of section 669 and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Fox, Norton, </em>and <em>Leavitt. </em>In point of fact, however, none of the cases are contrary to either the statute or the opinions. (See <em>In re Marriage of Lisi </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1576 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 623] [trial court had jurisdiction to determine the amount of an attorney\u2019s fee award where the \u201corder determining the right to attorney fees was made prior to the death of [a party], but the court postponed the determination of the amount of reasonable fees to the date of trial\u201d]; <em>Estate of Blair, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d 161, 166 [no indication the parties in the dissolution action had tried or submitted any issues for decision before the death of the spouse]; <em>Kinsler </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d 808 [trial court had power to decide property issues after death of spouse where interlocutory and final judgments dissolving the status of the marriage and reserving jurisdiction as to property issues were entered before death]; <em>In re Marriage of Williams, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.3d 507 [no indication parties had tried or submitted any issue before one of them died; case involved motion by relative of deceased spouse to join in a dissolution action in order to contest the surviving spouse\u2019s motion for custody of the children of the marriage]; <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Melone </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 121, 124 [18 Cal.Rptr. 476] [trial court properly fixed attorney fees after the death of a party to a marital dissolution action because right to such fees had been adjudicated before death].)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Furthermore, we have not found any other appellate opinion which persuades us to adopt the position taken by Iva.

Law Revision Com. com., reprinted in 29C West\u2019s Ann. Fam. Code (1994 ed.) foil. \u00a7 2346, p. 666.) Former Civil Code section 4513 was enacted in 1969, and amended several times between 1969 and 1989. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, pp. 3326-3327; Stats. 1983, ch. 1159, \u00a74, pp. 4383-4384; Stats. 1985, ch. 96, \u00a71, pp. 231-232; Stats. 1985, ch. 106, \u00a7 10, pp. 257-258; Stats. 1989, ch. 1266, \u00a7 1, pp. 4994-4995.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It derived from former Civil Code section 131.5.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Historical Note, 12A West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil, former Civ. Code, \u00a74513.) The version of former Civil Code section 4513 in effect during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>1987 and 1988 was virtually identical to the current version of Family Code section 2346. (See Stats. 1985, ch. 96, \u00a7 1, pp. 231-232; Stats. 1985, ch. 106, \u00a7 10, pp. 257-258.) The only difference was that during 1987 and 1988 former Civil Code section 4513 did not include the first sentence of subdivision (d) of present Family Code section 2346; this sentence was added in 1989. (See Stats. 1989, ch. 1266, \u00a7 1, pp. 4994-4995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Contrary to the position taken by Iva, the trial court\u2019s power under Family Code section 2346 to enter a judgment dissolving the marriage nunc pro tunc is not limited to those instances where a second marriage has taken place after the date that the judgment could have been entered; the statute applies to every situation where injustice would result to a party whose rights are threatened by a delay that is not attributable to the fault of the party. <em>(Adoption of Graham </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 899, 904 [27 Cal.Rptr. 163, 377 P.2d 275] [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 133]; <em>Estate of Casimir </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 773, 780 [97 Cal.Rptr. 623] [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 4515]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 705, 709-710 [51 Cal.Rptr. 699] [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 133]; <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Hurst </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 859, 867-868 [39 Cal.Rptr. 162, 19 A.L.R.3d 635] [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 133].) Since the statute permits the trial court to act on its own motion, a motion for entry of a judgment nunc pro tunc may be made by a third party, including the representative of the estate of a deceased party. <em>(Hurst </em>v. <em>Hurst, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.2d at p. 867; <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Kern, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at pp. 328-329; see also <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Waller </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 456, 460 [83 Cal.Rptr. 533]; <em>Estate of Casimir, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d at p. 777.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The showing necessary to justify the exercise of the court\u2019s power to enter judgment nunc pro tunc is apparently not onerous. Most of the pertinent cases have arisen under the predecessors to Family Code section 2346, but we see no reason why the principles expressed in these opinions should not be applied equally to the exercise of the trial court\u2019s inherent power.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Where the delay is the result of some action or inaction on the part of the court itself, entry of a nunc pro tunc judgment in order to protect the interests of one or all parties is mandated: \u201c \u2018 \u201cA court will always exercise [its inherent] authority when it is apparent that the delay in rendering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>judgment, or a failure to enter it after its rendition, is the result of some act or delay of the court, and is not owing to any fault of the party making the application. One class of the cases in which this authority may be exercised, . . . comprises those \u2018actions in which no judgments have ever been rendered, but which are so far as the suitors can make them, in condition for the rendition of final judgments\u2019. [Citation.] \u2018The rule established by the general concurrence of the American and English courts is that, where the delay in rendering a judgment or a decree arises from the act of the court\u2014that is, where the delay has been caused either for its convenience, or by the multiplicity or press of business, through the intricacy of the questions involved, or of any other cause not attributable to the laches of the parties\u2014the judgment or the decree may be entered retrospectively as of a time when it should or might have been entered up. In such cases, . . . it is the duty of the court to see that the party shall not suffer by the delay.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Leavitt </em>v. <em>Gibson, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d at p. 103; see also <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hale &amp; Norcross S. M. Co., supra, </em>108 Cal. at pp. 482-483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">When the conduct of a party is in issue, cases have held that it is enough to demonstrate the party lacked heedfulness or was merely inattentive in failing to take action when action was required. <em>(Hurst </em>v. <em>Hurst, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.2d at p. 867 [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 133]; see also <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Berry </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 50, 59 [294 P.2d 757] [same].) \u201cLikewise, delay in the entry of the final judgment of divorce beyond the time when such judgment could have been obtained is a sufficient basis for finding inadvertence and negligence when the party entitled to such final judgment had no valid reason for such delay.\u201d <em>(Hurst </em>v. <em>Hurst, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.2d at p. 867; see also <em>In re Marriage of Tamraz </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1740, 1748 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 233] [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 4513]; <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Kern supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at pp. 334-335 [former Civ. Code, \u00a7 133].) On the other hand, it also has been said that a party\u2019s mere failure to act, standing alone, does not establish adequate grounds for entry of a nunc pro tunc judgment. (See <em>In re Marriage of Frapwell </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 479, 484-485 [125 Cal.Rptr. 878] [former Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1413 &amp; 1415; the declarations showed that an earlier application was not prevented by any neglect, ignorance or inadvertence, but because of a deliberate decision by the spouse\u2019s executor to await the progress of an appeal]; see also <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Berry, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at pp. 59-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The trial court in the instant case decided not to enter judgment nunc pro tunc because it concluded in part that a termination of the marriage made effective before Herbert\u2019s death would deprive Iva of \u201cvested rights.\u201d As the trial court put it, \u201c[Iva\u2019s] <em>property rights </em>as the widow of the deceased vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>after the point in time in which the nunc pro tunc judgment in this matter could be entered.\u201d The trial court relied upon <em>Adoption of Graham, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><em>Graham </em>involved a final judgment of divorce entered in October 1960 but made operative as of June 1952. The effective date of this judgment preceded the birthdates of two children fathered by the husband while he was living with a woman who was legally married to another person. The children had been placed with an adoption agency pursuant to a relinquishment filed with the State Department of Social Welfare and executed by the mother and the person to whom she was married at the time the children were bom. The husband claimed that because the nunc pro tunc judgment made him a single person before the birth of the children, he was their legitimate and, for other reasons, their adoptive father. Therefore his consent was required before the children could be placed for adoption. <em>(Adoption of Graham, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at pp. 901-903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The Supreme Court held the nunc pro tunc judgment did not invalidate the relinquishments executed by the mother and the person to whom she had been married because these individuals had \u201cvested rights\u201d in the relinquishments. <em>(Adoption of Graham, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 907.) The court relied upon a certain statutory provision which made an adoption relinquishment final and binding upon its filing with the State Department of Social Services and subject to later rescission only upon the mutual consent of the adoption agency and the persons who gave up the child. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 905.) The court concluded: \u201cThe legislative scheme for the placement of relinquished children contemplates that the statutory proceedings will progress unhampered by extrinsic matter and with assurance that proper proceedings may consummate a valid adoption ....[*][] The question before the court is fundamentally one of adoptive procedures, and the Legislature has provided extensive provisions therefor. Such provisions must be construed with the view of accomplishing their purpose. [Citation.] The purpose may best be accomplished, and the interest of the children best served, by giving continuing effect to those relinquishments which were valid when entered into and filed in the manner [specified by applicable law].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 906-907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\"><em>Graham </em>does not prohibit entry of a nunc pro tunc judgment in the case before us. The <em>Graham </em>court did not invalidate the backdated judgment as between the father of the children and his spouse. It simply held that the judgment did not operate to bind third parties whose rights were established under other applicable laws which, for policy reasons, were entitled to prevail over the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>Moreover, the Courts of Appeal have not applied <em>Graham </em>to situations where the alleged vested right claimed by the surviving spouse consisted of an inheritance. (See <em>Estate of Casimir, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 773, 781; <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Waller, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at p. 467; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>242 Cal.App.2d at pp. 709-710.) In <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Waller, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at pages 466-467, for example, the court found the entry of a nunc pro tunc final divorce judgment proper when one spouse, through inadvertence, mistake or excusable neglect, failed to have a judgment entered before his death. The effect of the antedated judgment was to divest the other spouse of her right to inherit from the decedent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 466.) Distinguishing <em>Graham, </em>the court said: \u201cA controlling element in the decision [in Graham] was the provision of Civil Code section 224m to the effect that the \u2018relinquishment authorized by this section ... is final and binding and may be rescinded only by the mutual consent of the adoption agency [which did not consent] and the parent or parents relinquishing the child.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 905.) [f] Unlike <em>Graham, </em>we are not dealing here with a right which the Legislature has declared may not be divested. [Citation.] We adhere, therefore, to the settled rule which authorized the court to enter the final decree herein antedating the death of defendant. (See, <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Kern, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at pp. 332-333; <em>Hamrick </em>v. <em>Hamrick </em>(1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 839 [260 P.2d 188]; <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Hull </em>[(1951)] 102 Cal.App.2d 382 [227 P.2d 546]; <em>Estate of Hughes </em>(1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 550 [182 P.2d 253].) In each of the last-cited cases, \u2018vested\u2019 rights of inheritance were necessarily or inferentially divested by the action of the court.\u201d <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Waller, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at p. 467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">It remains to be determined whether the trial court erred when it denied, by its formal written order of October 25, 1995, appellant\u2019s motion for nunc pro tunc treatment of the September 7, 1994, judgment. On the thin record made available to us it is impossible to assign to either Iva or Herbert any responsibility for any part of the delay between January 5, 1988, the day the case was submitted, and April 25, 1988, the day Herbert died. Herbert was in his mid-60\u2019s, and nothing before us suggests he was in poor health or had any life-threatening physical condition of which he or the trial court was aware. There was no dispute between the parties concerning the termination of their marriage; each in their respective pleadings requested a dissolution on the ground of \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d (former Civ. Code, \u00a7 4506, subd. (1), now Fam. Code, \u00a7 2310). Nevertheless, the property issues were vigorously contested. It seems likely the trial court was not able to render a decision before April 25, 1988, because the evidence introduced during the trial presented a number of complex and difficult factual issues arising from the parties\u2019 conflicting claims with respect to the various properties involved. (See <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Gibson, supra, </em>3 Cal.2d at p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">It is considerably less clear why appellant, as executor of Herbert\u2019s estate, waited for more than six years after Herbert died before moving to substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>into the dissolution action, to set aside the stipulation, and for nunc pro tunc entry of a judgment. (See <em>Kern </em>v. <em>Kern, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at p. 336 [an issue was whether failure to seek a final decree of divorce was due to mistake, negligence or inadvertence on the part of the conservator of the incapacitated wife].) Although the record discloses that Iva filed a contest of Herbert\u2019s will and Herbert\u2019s will was admitted to probate, we have no other information about the probate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">The more than six-year unexplained delay between Herbert\u2019s death and the filing of appellant\u2019s first motion for a backdated judgment might put us in a position to affirm the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s second motion for nunc pro tunc treatment of the 1994 judgment, on the ground appellant has not established an abuse of discretion by the trial court, but we decline to do so. At the time it ruled, the trial court was faced with the several cases which appear to say that in a marital dissolution action only \u201cadjudicated\u201d or \u201cdecided\u201d issues may properly be the subject of a judgment entered after the death of a party. In addition, the trial court apparently believed that <em>Graham </em>eliminated any discretion it otherwise might have had to enter a judgment nunc pro tunc as of a date before Herbert died. Under these circumstances, we will vacate the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion for nunc pro tunc treatment of the September 7, 1994, judgment and remand with directions that authorize appellant to pursue the motion if he wishes to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The trial court\u2019s order of October 25, 1995, setting aside the judgment entered on September 7, 1994, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The trial court\u2019s order of October 25, 1995, denying appellant\u2019s motion for entry of the September 7,1994, judgment nunc pro tunc as of a date prior to the death of Herbert Mallory, is vacated. The matter is remanded to the trial court. If appellant desires to renew his motion for nunc pro tunc treatment of the judgment, he shall serve and file a notice to that effect not later than 30 days after the remittitur is issued. The parties shall be permitted to timely bring before the trial court in a proper fashion all admissible evidence they may wish to present which bears upon the question whether the judgment should be entered nunc pro tunc as of a date prior to April 25, 1988.

For example, (1) it could not be set aside except by motion for new trial, appeal, a timely motion under section 473, or an independent action in equity; (2) it was appealable under the final judgment rule; and (3) it was res judicata between the parties as to the validity of the marriage after the time for motions in the trial court and appeal had passed. (11 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Husband and Wife, \u00a7 155, pp. 180-181.) For this reason, we have in our references to the cases which applied the former law treated interlocutory judgments as the equivalent of final judgments under current law. A case decided well after the 1965 amendment to section 669 viewed the statute as being applicable when a party died after submission of the case but before entry of the interlocutory judgment. <em>{In re Marriage of Shayman, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d at p. 652.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b958-15\">It appears that the time for an appeal of the interlocutory judgment entered in <em>McClenny </em>had expired before the wife died. <em>{McClenny </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 142; Historical Notes, 23 West\u2019s Ann.

(See Stats. 1969, ch. 1608, pp. 3326-3327.) The former addressed interlocutory judgments of divorce and the latter dealt with final judgments of divorce. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In 1983, when interlocutory judgments were eliminated, former Civil Code section 4513 was amended to conform the nunc pro tunc power to the new single judgment procedure (Stats. 1983, ch. 1159, \u00a7 4, pp. 4383-4384), and section 4515 was repealed (Stats. 1983, ch. 1159, \u00a7 6 p. 4385). Former Civil Code section 4515 was a substantial reenactment of former Civil Code section 133. (Historical Note, 12A West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1983 ed.) foil, former \u00a7 4515, pp. 337-338.) As originally enacted, former Civil Code section 133 read as follows: \u201c \u2018Whenever either of the parties in a divorce action is, under the law, entitled to a final judgment, but by mistake, negligence or inadvertence the same has not been signed, filed or entered, if no appeal has been taken for the interlocutory judgment or motion for a new trial made, the court, on the motion of either party thereto or upon its own motion, may cause a final judgment to be signed, dated, filed and entered therein granting the divorce as of the date when the same could have been given or made by the court if applied for. Upon the filing of such final judgment, the parties to such action shall be deemed to have been restored to the status of single persons as of the date affixed to such judgment, and any marriage of either of such parties subsequent to one year after the granting of the interlocutory judgment as shown by the minutes of the court, and after the final judgment could have been entered under the law if applied for, shall be valid for all purposes as of the date affixed to such final judgment upon the filing thereof.\u2019 \u201d (Historical Note, 12A West\u2019s Ann.
