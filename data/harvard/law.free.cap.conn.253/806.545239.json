J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKlD\">In the present cases, the plaintiff, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., appeals from the judgments of the trial court dismissing its summary process actions against the defendants, Wagar Ahmad, E.Z. Save, Inc., and Shop-Ways, Inc., after that court found that the plaintiff had failed to provide notice to the defendants as required by General Statutes \u00a7 42-133f (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Connecticut franchise act (general franchise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>act), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-133e through 42-133h, for termination of the leases between the parties. We conclude that such notice was not required because the parties\u2019 agreements do not create franchises within the meaning of the general franchise act.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to these appeals. On March 16,1993, the plaintiffs predecessor in interest, Getty Petroleum Coloration, and Ahmad entered into written agreements entitled Retail Gasoline Lease Agreement and Lessee Supply Contract (agreements) for a retail gasoline station located at 154 South Main Street in Torrington (Torring-ton station). The agreements were for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Ahmad subsequently assigned the agreements to E.Z. Save, Inc., and Shop-Ways, Inc., but he remained liable for payment and performance of all the terms and conditions of the agreements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The period of these agreements subsequently was extended to March 31, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">On July 3,1993, the plaintiff and Ahmad entered into a set of second written agreements that also were entitled Retail Gasoline Lease Agreement and Lessee Supply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Contract ( second agreements) for a retail gasoline station located at 44 South Street in Bristol (Bristol station). The second agreements concerning the Bristol station are identical in their substance to the agreements concerning the Torrington station.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The term of the second agreements also was for a period of three years. These second agreements subsequently were extended to July 31, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">On April 7,1998, the plaintiff informed the defendants that the agreements concerning the Torrington station were terminated effective May 10, 1998. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants had defaulted on the agreements by failing to maintain proper inventory records and to perform required gauge and water checks at the Torrington station\u2019s fuel tanks, and by consistently and repeatedly failing to deliver to the plaintiff in a timely manner the funds received for sales of the plaintiffs gasoline at that station. The defendants did not vacate the premises. The plaintiff then caused notices to quit to be served on the defendants and later filed a summary process complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">On May 19, 1998, the plaintiff informed Ahmad that the second agreements concerning the Bristol station were terminated effective May 29, 1998. The plaintiff claimed that Ahmad had refused to pump the plaintiffs gasoline at the Bristol station. Later, the plaintiff served a notice to quit on Ahmad and, still later, a summary process complaint seeking possession of the Bristol station.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">After conducting separate trials, the trial court dismissed both summary process complaints for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff had not provided the required notice to the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>under the general franchise act for termination of the leases between the parties, and that the failure to provide that notice was a jurisdictional defect. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reasoned that although the parties\u2019 arrangements did not qualify as franchises under the petroleum franchise act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-133j through 42-133n; the general franchise act was applicable. The trial court concluded that the parties had a franchise relationship under the general franchise act, and that the plaintiffs actions had to be dismissed because the general franchise act requires, inter alia, advance notice of at least sixty days before termination of a franchise. See footnote 1 of this opinion. The plaintiff appealed from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly applied the general franchise act to these actions, because only the petroleum franchise act may be applied to the distribution and sale of motor fuel. The plaintiff argues that, after finding that the parties\u2019 agreements did not create franchises under the petroleum franchise act because the plaintiff was not a franchisor under that act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court should not have proceeded to analyze the plaintiffs claims under the general franchise act. The plaintiff also claims that, even if we conclude that the general franchise act does apply, the trial court improperly determined that the agreements constituted franchises within the meaning of that act. We agree with the plaintiff that the parties\u2019 agreements do not create franchises within the meaning of the general franchise act and find this conclusion dispositive of the appeal. Accordingly, we reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>judgments of the trial court and remand the cases back to that court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The trial court\u2019s findings that the agreements established franchises subject to the provisions of the general franchise act are findings of fact, and we reverse such findings only when they are clearly erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Hartford Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Allen-Bradley </em>Co., 250 Conn. 334, 345, 736 A.2d 824 (1999). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is not supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d Id., 345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Section 42-133e (b) of the general franchise act defines franchise as \u201can oral or written agreement or arrangement in which (1) a franchisee is granted the right to engage in the business of offering, selling or distributing goods or services under a marketing plan or system prescribed in substantial part by a franchisor, provided nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create a franchisor-franchisee relationship between the grantor and grantee of a lease, license or concession to sell goods or services upon or appurtenant to the premises of the grantor, which premises are occupied by the grantor primarily for its own independent merchandising activities; and (2) the operation of the franchisee\u2019s business pursuant to such plan or system is substantially associated with the franchisor\u2019s trademark, service mark, trade name, logotype, advertising or other commercial symbol designating the franchisor or its affiliate, and includes any agreement between a manufacturer, refiner or producer and a distributor, wholesaler or jobber, between a manufacturer, refiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>or producer and a retailer, or between a distributor, wholesaler or jobber and a retailer . ...\u201d A franchisee under the act is defined as \u201ca person to whom a franchise is granted, including a distributor, wholesaler or jobber or retailer who is granted the authority under a franchise to use a trademark, tradename, service mark or other identifying symbol or name.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-133e (d). A franchisor is defined in the act as \u201ca person who grants a franchise to another person, including a manufacturer, refiner or producer or a distributor, wholesaler or jobber who grants to a distributor, wholesaler or jobber or retailer, as the case may be, the authority to use a trademark, tradename, service mark or other identifying symbol or name under a franchise . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-133e (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The trial court found that franchises existed between the parties that were subject to the general franchise act, which requires that a franchisee \u201cengage in the business of offering, selling or distributing goods or services under a marketing plan or system . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-133e (b). As evidence of a marketing plan, the trial court cited the fact that the plaintiff had a large amount of control over the defendants\u2019 sale of gasoline,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such as setting the price of the gasoline, requiring a minimum gallonage of gasoline to be sold each month, requiring approval for all signs and advertising, and requiring that the defendants operate the stations during certain hours and in accordance with the plaintiffs standards of quality, appearance, cleanliness and service. We do not review the trial court\u2019s finding that a marketing plan existed because we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants were engaged in the business of offering, selling or distributing gasoline under such a marketing plan. We conclude that such evidence was required for there to be franchises.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The definition of a franchise under the general franchise act expressly requires that the franchisee be \u201cgranted the right to engage in the business of offering, selling or distributing goods or services under a marketing plan or system . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-133e (b). The definition \u201crequires a two-step inquiry. First, the franchisee must have the right to offer, sell or distribute goods or services. Second, the franchisor must substantially prescribe a marketing plan for the offering, selling or distributing of goods or services.\u201d <em>Chem-Tek, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>816 F. Sup. 123, 127 (D. Conn. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to the determination of whether the agreements gave the defendants the right to engage in the business of offering or selling goods under a marketing plan or system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agreements provided that the plaintiff would deliver gasoline and other petroleum products to the defendants and would set the price for the sale of that gasoline at the gasoline stations leased to the defendants. The agreements further provided that the plaintiff retained ownership of the gasoline after delivery to the defendants \u201cuntil sold to [the plaintiffs] customers.\u201d The plaintiff also owned all of the income and accounts receivable arising out of the sale of the gasoline. The defendants are referred to in the agreements as \u201ccommission agents\u201d and were paid a commission of $.065 per gallon \u201cfor each gallon of \u2018Getty\u2019 gasoline sold through the [plaintiffs] marketing equipment . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>The defendants were required under the agreements promptly to deposit the proceeds from gasoline sales in the plaintiffs drop safes. The defendants also operated convenience stores at both locations leased from the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The operation of the stores was completely independent, however, from the defendants\u2019 relationship with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">No Connecticut appellate court has addressed the meaning of the terms \u201coffering\u201d or \u201cselling\u201d under the general franchise act. The United States District Court, however, has analyzed those terms in the context of a case with facts similar to those before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In <em>Automatic Comfort Corp. </em>v. <em>D &amp; R Service, Inc., </em>627 F. Sup. 783, 787 (D. Conn. 1986), the court thoroughly analyzed the concept of engaging in the business of offering or selling gasoline under the petroleum franchise act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and held that the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant in that case was not a franchise under that act. The court reasoned that \u201c[w]hile [the] defendant was clearly operating within a marketing plan dictated by [the] plaintiff . . . the parties\u2019 contract did not frame a relationship which Connecticut has defined as a franchise\u201d; (citation omitted) id., 786; because the defendant was not a franchisee, or, more specifically, a retailer that was \u201cengaged in the business of offering or selling gasoline.\u201d Id. The court stated that \u201c[t]he question [of whether one is engaged in the business of offering or selling gasoline] can best be analyzed by measuring how far [the] defendant is from the situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>of apure employee, who merely takes money and hands it over to his employer. To be a franchise, the franchisee must be engaged in the business of offering or selling gasoline. In actuality it is the plaintiff who is offering/ selling gasoline to the public. It owns the station. It buys the gasoline. It arranges for the acquisition of the gasoline and delivers it to the stations. It sets the prices. It is at risk for any loss of the gasoline at the station except by reason of fault on the part of defendant.\u201d Id. The court noted that \u201c[the] defendant was not at any substantial market risk, nor did it have any substantial indicia of entrepreneurial responsibility.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We agree with the reasoning of <em>Automatic Comfort Corp. </em>that it is the independent function of the parties in a marketing arrangement that controls whether the parties have created a franchise. In this case, the evidence was that the plaintiff owned the gasoline, delivered the gasoline to the stations and set the price of the gasoline. The agreements provided for the sale of the plaintiffs gasoline,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> through the plaintiffs equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ment to the plaintiffs customers. All cash receipts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>to be deposited in the plaintiffs drop safe by the defendants, who were \u201ctrustee [s] and custodian[s]\u201d of the plaintiffs funds. There was also evidence that all credit card payments were credited directly to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Although the agreements did provide that the defendants were responsible for additional rent if they did not sell a minimum gallonage,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendants did not bear the burden of marketplace risk that is indicative of an independent business operator. Notwithstanding the changing price of motor fuel, the defendants were to receive their commission in a fixed amount for overseeing the pumping of the gasoline and for collecting the sale price from the customers. The defendants\u2019 commission was to be remitted by the plaintiff upon the submission of a weekly invoice. The defendants\u2019 compensation was not affected by the rise and fall in the market price of motor fuel that is indicative of the risk that is assumed by an independent business operator. See <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co., </em>377 U.S. 13, 20, 84 S. Ct. 1051, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Because the plaintiff was selling its own gasoline, with the defendants acting as commission agents to facilitate the exchange, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the defendants had any entrepreneurial responsibility as to the sale of gasoline or the gasoline itself. While it may be that the defendants assumed entrepreneurial responsibility for the convenience stores that they operated at the premises, the only goods sold under the plaintiffs trademark were the plaintiffs gasoline, motor oil and other promotional items. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The defendants were functioning as service station managers responsible for seeing that the gasoline was sold and that payments were collected and forwarded to the plaintiff. Because the defendants did not own the gaso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>line or assume any substantial market risk in its sale, we conclude that they were not retailers in the business of selling gasoline as independent business operators. They were rather, as the court in <em>Automatic Comfort Corp. </em>v. <em>D &amp; R Service, Inc., </em>supra, 627 F. Sup. 786, stated, the \u201ctemporary custodian[s] of the gasoline, the caretalcer[s] of the property, the cashier[s], all as part of [the] plaintiffs business.\u201d Because the defendants were not engaged in the business of offering, selling or distributing the gasoline, they were not franchisees under the general franchise act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Our determination is consistent with the purpose of the general franchise act, which is to protect independent business persons who have assumed an entrepreneurial role and who face the risk of the market. \u201cWe believe our State must assume a minimum level of protection to the small business man from a corporation which suddenly and capriciously snatches away his livelihood,\u201d and to small business persons \u201cwho have literally sunk their life savings into their businesses and then have seen their investments and their labors go down the drain.\u201d 15 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1972 Sess., p. 2777, remarks of Representative Albert R. Webber. One of the principal remedial provisions of the general franchise act is the requirement that upon termination of the franchise, the franchisor must fairly and reasonably compensate the franchisee for inventory, supplies, equipment and furnishings purchased from the franchisor. General Statutes \u00a7 42-133\u00cd (c). This provision is further evidence of the legislative intent to protect business persons who, unlike the defendants, have been required to make substantial investment in components of an entrepreneurial business.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Finding that franchises existed in these cases would blur the distinction between the entrepreneur and one who acts as an agent for another in selling a product. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly accorded the defendants the protection afforded a franchisee under \u00a7 42-133L</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The judgments are reversed and the cases are remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-1331' (a) provides: \u201cNo franchisor shall, directly, or through any officer, agent or employee, terminate, cancel or fail to renew a franchise, except for good cause which shall include, but not be limited to the franchisee\u2019s refusal or failure to comply substantially with any material and reasonable obligation of the franchise agreement or for the reasons stated in subsection (e) of this section. The franchisor shall give the franchisee written notice of such termination, cancellation or intent not to renew, at least sixty days in advance to such termination, cancellation or failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>to renew with the cause stated thereon; provided, in the event the franchisor elects not to renew a franchise pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, the franchisor shall give the franchisee written notice of such intent not to renew at least six months prior to the expiration of the current franchise agreement. The provisions of this section shall not apply (1) where the alleged grounds are voluntary abandonment by the franchisee of the franchise relationship, in which event, such notice may be given thirty days in advance of such termination, cancellation or failure to renew, or (2) where the alleged grounds are the conviction of the franchisee in a court of competent jurisdiction of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of one year and directly related to the business conducted pursuant to the franchise, in which event, such notice may be given at any time following such conviction and shall be effective upon delivery and written receipt of such notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-9\"> When appropriate, Ahmad, E.Z.

The trial court found that the defendants purchased these items from the plaintiff and that the defendants set their retail price. Because \u201c \u2018price is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of a marketing plan\u2019 <em>Hartford Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Allen-Bradley Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 351; we agree with the trial court that the focus of whether there was a marketing plan was properly on the sale of gasoline, not these other items.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> Because the defendants dealt with the public at a retail level, they clearly were not distributing the gasoline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\"> A convenience store is defined as \u201ca retail store that carries a limited selection of basic items, as packaged foods and drugstore items, and is open long hours for the convenience of shoppers.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b832-8\"> At the time that <em>Automatic Comfort Corp. v.

Although this additional rent might represent some risk, it does not represent a substantial marketplace risk linked to the fluctuations in the price of gasoline in the market. It is, rather, a clause in the contract to ensure that the defendants devote their efforts to pump a minimum quantity of the plaintiff\u2019s gasoline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\"> Although the Lessee Supply Contracts attach the label \u201cfranchise\u201d to the arrangements between the plaintiff and Ahmad, the parties\u2019 characterizations, under the circumstances of this case, are not determinative of the issues before this court.
