We reject both of these claims and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In December, 1995, the defendant, who resided in an apartment located at 50 Button Street, New Haven, regularly purchased drugs from Ian Brown, a cocaine dealer known as \u201cRyder.\u201d The defendant generally contacted Ryder through Ryder\u2019s paging device when the defendant wished to purchase narcotics from him. Ryder usually delivered the drugs to a location across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the street from the defendant\u2019s apartment. Although the defendant sometimes picked up the drugs from Ryder, he frequently sent someone else to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On December 13, 1995, at approximately 6 p.m., Carlyle Herring, an acquaintance of the defendant, arrived at the defendant\u2019s apartment. Herring, who was then fifteen years old, had been to the defendant\u2019s apartment to use drugs on a few previous occasions. After engaging Herring in small talk, the defendant told him about a drug dealer named Ryder, whom Herring did not know. The defendant then suggested robbing Ryder of the drugs and cash that Ryder customarily carried. Specifically, the defendant proposed a plan whereby he would contact Ryder to set up a drug buy, and Herring, rather than the defendant, would meet with Ryder, ostensibly to pick up and pay for the drugs. Instead of purchasing the drugs from Ryder, however, Herring would rob Ryder of the drugs and any money that Ryder had in his possession. The defendant further explained that Ryder would be unable to identify Herring because Ryder and Herring did not know one another. After initially rejecting the defendant\u2019s suggestion, Herring agreed to the robbery plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The defendant then left the apartment and, upon returning, informed Herring that he had contacted Ryder, who had agreed to deliver the drugs to the usual location. The defendant gave Herring a .38 special revolver, and both Herring and the defendant walked across the street to await Ryder\u2019s arrival. Soon thereafter, the defendant saw Ryder\u2019s car approaching and pointed it out to Herring. As the car pulled up, the defendant hid so that Ryder could not see him.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Herring walked over to Ryder\u2019s car. Ryder was driving and Ira Lawrence, whom Herring also did not know, was sitting in the front passenger seat. Ryder asked Herring to identify himself. Herring stated that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201cCoco\u2019s\u201d little brother and that the defendant had sent him to pick up the \u201cstuff.\u201d Ryder, who knew Coco, identified himself to Herring, and Herring got into the back seat of Ryder\u2019s car. After driving around the block, Ryder pulled over and parked a short distance from the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The three men remained in the car, and Ryder handed Herring a plastic package containing one ounce of cocaine. When Herring did not immediately pay for the cocaine,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ryder told him to return the package and get out of the car. With the package in his possession, Herring exited the vehicle, removed the revolver from his coat pocket, put the revolver to Ryder\u2019s head and threatened to kill Ryder if he did not give Herring all of the money and drugs in his possession. Ryder complied, handing Herring two to three ounces of cocaine and several hundred dollars in cash. Herring then fired two shots, striking Ryder in the thigh and Lawrence in the chest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ryder drove to the hospital, where Lawrence died as a result of the gunshot wound to his chest. After the shooting, Herring gave the stolen drugs and money to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The defendant first claims that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The state contends that this claim is not reviewable because the defendant failed to seek such relief in the trial court. Alternatively, the state maintains that, even if the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>We first note that the defendant does not contend that the state\u2019s evidence, which consisted primarily of the accomplice testimony of Herring, was insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant, therefore, does not seek a judgment of acquittal. Rather, he asserts that the state\u2019s case, which was predicated on Herring\u2019s testimony, was so flimsy as to raise a substantial question regarding the reliability of the verdict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant claims that he should be granted a new trial because of the serious danger that he was wrongly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cThe trial court possesses inherent power to set aside a jury verdict which, in the court\u2019s opinion, is against the law or the evidence.\u201d <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>208 Conn. 21, 23-24, 543 A.2d 1331 (1988). That power, however, is subject to specific limitations. \u201cThe trial court should not set a verdict aside where there was some evidence upon which the jury could reasonably have based its verdict, but should not refuse to set it aside where the manifest injustice of the verdict is so plain and palpable as clearly to denote that some mistake was made by the jury in the application of legal principles, or as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>justify the suspicion that [the jurors] or some of them were influenced by prejudice, corruption or partiality. . . . Within these parameters, furthermore, the trial court may set a verdict aside even if the evidence was conflicting and there was direct evidence in favor of the party who prevailed with the jury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>221 Conn. 768, 774, 607 A.2d 418 (1992). The authority of the trial court to set aside a verdict that is against the weight of the evidence is grounded in the fact that \u201cthe action of a jury may be as unreasonable, and as suggestive of being produced by improper influences, in passing upon the credibility of witnesses and in the weighing of conflicting testimony, as in any other respect. It is one of the duties of a judge, in the due performance of his [or her] part injury trials, to see to it that such influences, apparently operating upon the jury, do not prevail, and manifest injustice thereby be done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 457, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980), quoting <em>Roma </em>v. <em>Thames River Specialties Co., </em>90 Conn. 18, 20, 96 A. 169 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">As we repeatedly have emphasized, the trial court is uniquely situated to entertain a motion to set aside a verdict as against the weight of the evidence because, unlike an appellate court, the \u201ctrial [court] has had the same opportunity as the jury to view the witnesses, to assess their credibility and to determine the weight that should be given to their evidence.\u201d <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 24-25; accord <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Fusaro, 225 </em>Conn. 420, 431, 623 A.2d 1014 (1993); see also <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 775. Indeed, we have observed that, \u201c[i]n passing upon a motion to set aside a verdict, the trial judge must do just what every juror ought to do in arriving at a verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>221 Conn. 264, 267, 604 A.2d 793 (1992); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 456. \u201c[T]he trial judge can gauge the tenor of the trial, as we, on the written record, cannot, and can detect those factors, if any, that could improperly have influenced the jury.\u201d <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>supra, 25; accord <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Fusaro, </em>supra, 431. Of necessity, therefore, an appellate court\u2019s inquiry must focus on whether the trial court abused its broad discretion in acting on a motion to set aside a verdict that allegedly is contrary to the weight of the evidence. See, e.g., <em>Wichers </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>252 Conn. 174, 189, 745 A.2d 789 (2000); <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>supra, 774-75; <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>supra, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It follows inexorably from the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim, namely, that the testimony of the state\u2019s key witness, Herring, was not believable, that the defendant\u2019s failure to raise such a claim in the trial court is fatal to his claim on appeal. On a cold record, we cannot meaningfully assess Herring\u2019s credibility to determine whether his testimony, which, if credited, concededly was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s convictions, nevertheless was so unworthy of belief as to warrant a conclusion that allowing the verdict to stand would constitute a manifest injustice. See <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 334, 732 A.2d 144 (1999) (\u201c[b]ecause we have nothing before us but a cold record, credibility determinations are not within our bailiwick\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 253-54, 726 A.2d 531, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 969, 120 S. Ct. 409, 145 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1999) (\u201cappellate review of a cold record is no substitute for the ability of the trial court to witness firsthand a [witness\u2019] responses and demeanor\u201d). Only the trial judge was in a position to evaluate Herring\u2019s testimony, along with the other relevant evidence, to make such a determination. We, therefore, decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The defendant also contends that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on reasonable doubt improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof in violation of his rights under the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the defendant raised no objection at trial to the court\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>concedes that his claim is impreserved. The defendant asserts, however, that he is entitled to a new trial because he has satisfied the requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), in which we held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. Although we agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for our review of his claim, he cannot prevail because he has failed to establish a constitutional violation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The defendant argues that four separate statements contained in the trial court\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process. Specifically, the defendant contends that the court improperly explained to the jury that reasonable doubt is: (1) \u201cnot a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture\u201d; (2) \u201careal doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence\u201d; and (3) \u201csuch a doubt, as in serious affairs that concern you, you would heed, that is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act in matters of importance.\u201d The defendant also challenges the language in the court\u2019s charge providing that, \u201c[i]f two conclusions can reasonably be drawn from the evidence, one of innocence and one of guilt, you must adopt the one of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970) .... The [reasonable doubt concept] provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014 that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. . . . [Id.], 363. At the same time, by impressing upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused, the [reasonable doubt] standard symbolizes the significance that our society attaches to the criminal sanction and thus to liberty itself. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, reh. denied, 444 U.S. 890, 100 S. Ct. 195, 62 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1979). [Consequently] [t]he defendants in a criminal case are entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge by the court that the guilt of the defendants must be proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 419-20, 464 A.2d 813 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In determining whether a trial court\u2019s charge satisfies constitutional requirements, however, \u201cindividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>237 Conn. 518, 536-37, 679 A.2d 902 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We previously have applied this standard of review in rejecting each of the claims advanced by the defendant, concluding that, in the context of the court\u2019s entire charge on reasonable doubt, the challenged language did not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof. Thus, we have approved a reasonable doubt instruction containing the statement that such a doubt is not \u201ca surmise, a guess or a conjecture\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 420, 518 A.2d 35 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170, 171 &amp; n.4, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980) (\u201cnot a surmise or a guess or a conjecture\u201d); and an instruction explaining that a reasonable doubt is not a \u201csurmise, or a guess, or a speculation . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 634, 543 A.2d 270 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Small, </em>242 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>93, 114-15 &amp; n.17, 700 A.2d 617 (1997) (rejecting constitutional challenge to charge containing explanation that reasonable doubt \u201cis more than a guess or a surmise\u201d). We also repeatedly have upheld the constitutionality of an instruction characterizing reasonable doubt as \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 504-505, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 816-20, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). Furthermore, both the United States Supreme Court; see <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 18, 21, 114 S. Ct. 1239, 127 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1994); and this court; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 688, 701 A.2d 1 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 147-50, 554 A.2d 713 (1989); have reached the same conclusion with respect to an explanation that reasonable doubt is a doubt that would cause a reasonably prudent person to \u201chesitate\u201d to act in matters of importance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>defendant has provided no persuasive reason why these challenged instructions, when viewed in the context of an otherwise accurate and thorough charge on reasonable doubt, diminish the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We also have rejected challenges to an instruction providing that, if two conclusions reasonably can be drawn from the evidence, one of guilt and one of innocence, the jury must adopt the conclusion of innocence. E. g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>219 Conn. 160, 166-67, 592 A.2d 382 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>217 Conn. 498, 503-504, 586 A.2d 610 (1991). We previously have approved this so-called \u201ctwo-inference\u201d instruction in light of the fact that it did not \u201cdiminish the state\u2019s burden where [t]he charge as a whole correctly instructed the jury as to the state\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 166, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>supra, 504. In upholding the use of the language, we recognized that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, at the time of our decision in <em>Dyson, </em>recently had prohibited the use of such an instruction because the \u201cinstruction by implication suggests that a preponderance of the evidence standard is relevant, when it is not. Moreover, the instruction does not go far enough. It instructs the jury on how to decide when the evidence of guilt or innocence is evenly balanced, but says nothing on how to decide when the inference of guilt is stronger than the inference of innocence but not strong enough to be beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>supra, 504, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Khan, </em>821 F.2d 90, 93 (2d Cir. 1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>231 Conn. 43, 49, 646 A.2d 835, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1038, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>115 S. Ct. 1404, 131 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1995) (recognizing possible danger of two-inference instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We see no reason to depart from our prior determination that the two-inference charge, when viewed in the context of an otherwise proper instruction on reasonable doubt, does not impermissibly dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof. Consequently, the defendant cannot prevail on his final claim of constitutional impropriety. Nevertheless, we now are persuaded, for the reasons articulated by the Second Circuit, that \u201cstanding alone, such language may mislead a jury into thinking that the [state\u2019s] burden is somehow less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Attanasio, </em>870 F.2d 809, 818 (2d Cir. 1989); accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Khan, </em>supra, 821 F.2d 93. We, therefore, invoke our supervisory authority over the administration of justice<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that, in the future,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> our trial courts refrain from using the \u201ctwo-inference\u201d language so as to avoid any suchpos-sible misunderstanding.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in relevant part: \u201cFelony murder.

The defendant claims that the state\u2019s case against him rested entirely on Herring\u2019s uncorroborated and self-serving testimony; the state maintains that Herring\u2019s testimony was supported by significant circumstantial indicia of reliability. Our review of the record indicates that, although Herring\u2019s testimony provided the sole <em>direct </em>evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, Herring\u2019s version of the events was buttressed by other evidence regarding the manner in which the robbery was conceived and carried out. We do not address this issue further, however, in light of our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s claim for a new trial, raised for the first time on appeal, is not reviewable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Article first, \u00a7 9, of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201cNo person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\"> The trial court charged the jury on reasonable doubt as follows: \u201cIn this case, as in all criminal prosecutions, the defendant is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This presumption of innocence was with this defendant when he was first presented for trial in this case. It continues with him throughout this trial unless and until such time as all the evidence produced here in the orderly conduct of the case, considered in the light of these instructions of law, and deliberated upon by you in the jury room, satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">\u201cThe burden to prove the defendant guilty of the crimes with which he is charged is upon the state. The defendant does not have to prove his innocence. This means that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element necessary to constitute the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">\u201cWhether the burden of proof resting upon the state is sustained depends not on the number of witnesses nor on the quantity of the testimony but on the nature and quality of the testimony. Please bear in mind that one witness\u2019 testimony is sufficient to convict if it establishes all of the evidence of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\u201cThe meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable. It is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture. Nor is it a doubt suggested by the ingenuity of a juror not warranted by the evidence. It is such a doubt, as in serious affairs that concern you, you would heed, that is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act in matters of importance. It is not hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy for the accused or any other person who might be affected by your decision. It is, in other words, a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>It is a doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after a fair comparison and careful examination of the entire evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all doubt. The law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before it returns a verdict of guilty. The law requires that, after hearing all the evidence, if there is something in the evidence or lack of evidence that leaves in the minds of the jurors, as reasonable men and women, a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt and acquitted. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except guilt and is inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. If two conclusions can reasonably be drawn from the evidence, one of innocence and one of guilt, you must adopt the one of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We also note that, in its jury instructions on the elements of the crimes charged, the trial court repeatedly emphasized that the state bore the burden at all times to establish each of the elements of those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> The defendant contends that the state constitution \u201crequire [s] a more stringent view of instructions intended to explain the concept of \u2018proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 than the more forgiving federal jurisprudence . . . .\u201d We need not resolve this claim, however, because, even if it is assumed, arguendo, that the state constitution \u201crequirejs] a more stringent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>view\u201d of a trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt than the federal constitution, the defendant cannot prevail under that more stringent standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> We note, however, that the \u201chesitate to act\u201d instruction has been criticized as unhelpful \u201cbecause the analogy it uses seems misplaced. In the decisions people make in the most important of their own affairs, resolution of conflicts about past events does not usually play a major role. Indeed, decisions we make in the most important affairs of our lives \u2014 choosing a spouse, a job, a place to live, and the like \u2014 generally involve a very heavy element of uncertainty and risk-taking. They are wholly unlike the decisions jurors ought to make in criminal cases.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 24 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part;), quoting Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions (1987) pp. 28-29, commentary on Instruction No. 21. Moreover, Judge Jon O. Newman, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, has stated: \u201cAlthough, as a district judge, I dutifully repeated [the \u2018hesitate to act\u2019 language] to juries in scores of criminal trials, I was always bemused by its ambiguity. If the jurors encounter a doubt that would cause them to \u2018hesitate to act in a matter of importance,\u2019 what are they to do then?
