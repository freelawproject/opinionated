On appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) rejected his affirmative defense of insanity<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) concluded that Public Acts 1995, No. 95-142, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 95-142), which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-29 (e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by changing the duration of the potential probationary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>term for certain convictions of, inter alia, first degree sexual assault,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not apply retroactively to the defendant\u2019s conviction for that offense. We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The evidence adduced at trial revealed the following undisputed facts. On Friday, April 29, 1994, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>dant, a 1993 graduate of the Hopkins School (Hopkins) in New Haven,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> conceived a plan to rape and murder twenty-seven of his former female classmates and, thereafter, to flee to Australia, where he intended to commit suicide.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One of these former classmates, hereinafter referred to as the victim, was a seventeen year old senior at Hopkins with whom the defendant was acquainted <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and who once had rejected the defendant\u2019s request for a date. The defendant decided that she would be his first victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On Saturday, April 30,1994, the defendant purchased a number of items that he intended to use to rape, torture and murder the victim, including a knife, a glue gun, duct tape, rope, and metal and bamboo skewers. On Monday, May 2, the defendant rented three films containing graphic violence to \u201cget [himself] in the mood\u201d to rape and kill the victim that day.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">At approximately 5 p.m. on May 2, the defendant drove to the vicinity of the victim\u2019s home and observed the residence from a distance. The defendant did not approach the home immediately because he believed that a car parked in the driveway belonged to the victim\u2019s brother and, in addition, because he was not certain that the victim was inside. At about 7:15 p.m., the defendant drove to a nearby pay telephone and called the victim to determine whether she was home. Upon learning that the victim was there,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the defendant drove back to the victim\u2019s home, walked up to the front door and rang the doorbell. The victim\u2019s father answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the door, and the defendant explained that his car had broken down and asked the victim\u2019s father if he could use a telephone to call for assistance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s father agreed and, when the defendant entered the house, she recognized him as a former classmate who had graduated from Hopkins the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The defendant then pretended to use the telephone to call for assistance. The victim\u2019s father offered the defendant some food and a drink, which the defendant accepted. The defendant and the victim then engaged in conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The defendant had been at the victim\u2019s home for approximately one-half hour when he suddenly pulled out a gun<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and placed it against the victim\u2019s head. The defendant ordered the victim to lie on the floor and, when the victim\u2019s father walked into the room, demanded that he do the same. Both the victim and her father complied with the defendant\u2019s command. As the defendant was removing some duct tape from a duffel bag<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that he had brought with him into the victim\u2019s home, the victim\u2019s father jumped up from the floor, wrested the gun from the defendant and subdued him. The victim\u2019s father then ordered the defendant to lie facedown on the floor and the defendant complied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The defendant remained in that position, motionless and silent, until the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">After the police had advised the defendant of his rights, he readily admitted that his purpose in going to the victim\u2019s home was to torture, rape and kill her. He further stated that he intended to kill the victim\u2019s father and her brother, who also were home at the time,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> because they would have been able to identify the defendant as the victim\u2019s assailant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendant also confessed that he had planned to rape and murder twenty-six other female students at Hopkins. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The defendant was charged with three counts of attempted murder for allegedly attempting to kill the victim, her father and her brother, two counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> for allegedly abducting the victim and her father and restraining them with the intent to sexually assault the victim, and one count of attempted sexual assault in the first degree for allegedly attempting to compel the victim to engage in sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>intercourse with him by the use or threat of use of force. The defendant, who elected to be tried by the court, raised the affirmative defense of insanity. At the conclusion of the trial, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s insanity defense and found him guilty of two counts of attempted murder and one count of attempted sexual assault in the first degree.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to a total effective term of imprisonment of forty years, suspended after twenty years, and five years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The defendant first contends that the evidence he adduced at trial established, as a matter of law, that, due to a mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13; footnote 6 of this opinion. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. At trial, the defendant did not deny committing the acts alleged by the state. He claimed, rather, that, as a result of his mental disease or defect, he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when he engaged in the proscribed conduct. In support of his affirmative defense, the defendant presented the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Madelene Baranoski, a clinical psychologist, and Paul Amble, a psychiatrist. The defendant also adduced evidence tending to establish that he had suffered from a progressively more serious mental illness that culminated in his unsuccessful effort to rape and kill the victim on May 2, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Baranoski conducted a psychological evaluation of the defendant that consisted of a number of psychological tests, a clinical interview and a review of the defendant\u2019s psychiatric history. On the basis of her inquiry into the defendant\u2019s mental condition on May 2, 1994, Baranoski opined that the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at that time. Baranoski also stated that the behavior of a person suffering from that mental illness \u201cwould be more likely to be impulsive when the disease is not under good control either by medication [or] close psychiatric observation.\u201d Bara-noski further opined that the defendant \u201cwas having difficulty with rational thought\u201d and had \u201can impairment of judgment and . . . difficulty controlling his behavior\u201d between April 30 and May 2,1994. According to Baranoski, the defendant also had frequent delusions that an external entity was controlling his mind, another common trait of individuals suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finally, Baranoski stated that the ability to plan and organize also was a recognized characteristic associated with paranoid schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Amble conducted a psychiatric examination of the defendant and, in addition, reviewed his mental health history and the results of the psychological tests that Baranoski had administered to the defendant. Amble concluded that the defendant suffered from a \u201cpsy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>chotic disorder not otherwise specified,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a mental illness that, according to Amble, is characterized by bizarre delusions, a separation from reality and a deterioration in functioning. Amble testified that, although he could not make a definitive diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia because, in his view, the defendant\u2019s disorder was continuing to evolve, his evaluation of the defendant did \u201cseem to strongly point towards . . . chronic paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d Amble also testified that the defendant suffered from sexual sadism and, further, that he did not believe that the defendant was malingering. Finally, Amble opined that from April 29 through May 2, 1994, the defendant lacked the ability to control his behavior and that the defendant believed that he was under the influence of an outside force.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The defendant also adduced evidence regarding his treatment and hospitalization for mental problems during the six month period prior to May 2, 1994. Specifically, the defendant, while attending Vassar College (Vassar) in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1993, after graduating from Hopkins, became obsessed with a young woman whom he had met at Vassar. The defendant, distraught because the woman refused his request for a date, decided to fly to Belgium to commit suicide.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendant thereafter aborted the suicide plan.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Several days later, however, the woman again rejected the defendant\u2019s overture, and the defendant devised a plan to rape and kill her. The plan failed, and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>was involuntarily committed to St. Francis Hospital (St. Francis) in Poughkeepsie on November 20, 1993.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The defendant was discharged from St. Francis on November 24, 1993,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and, on that very same day, was admitted to Silver Hill Hospital (Silver Hill) in New Canaan.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendant remained there as an inpatient until December 20, when he was discharged to outpatient care. He was readmitted to Silver Hill as an inpatient on December 29, however, because he could not control his suicidal ideation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The defendant was discharged from Silver Hill on January 24, 1994,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> but, because he still was unable to control his suicidal impulses, he was admitted to Four Winds Hospital (Four Winds) in Katonah, New York, on January 28, where he remained until his discharge on February 22. The defendant continued to receive treatment at Four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Winds on an outpatient basis until March ll,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> when he entered an outpatient program at Greenwich Hospital. The defendant remained a participant in that program until his arrest on May 2, 1994.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s insanity defense, the state relied primarily on its cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s two experts, and on the conduct and statements of the defendant before, during and after the events of May 2,1994. The state also relied on the notes and records of the various institutions at which the defendant had received treatment or counseling, and on the observations of several persons familiar with the defendant\u2019s activities and conduct immediately prior to May 2.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Finally, the state emphasized the uncontro-verted fact that many of the mental health professionals who had examined the defendant offered differing diagnoses of the defendant\u2019s psychiatric condition, including the defendant\u2019s own experts, Baranoski and Amble.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In particular, Baranoski acknowledged on cross-examination that she did not have enough information to render an opinion as to whether the defendant was unable to control his conduct at any time between April 29 and May 2, 1994. Baranoski also conceded that her diagnosis of the defendant differed from those of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>number of other mental health professionals, including Amble, and, further, that she disagreed with some of those diagnoses.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Finally, Baranoski noted that the defendant had told her that, upon executing his plan to kill twenty-seven people, he would become famous.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Amble stated on cross-examination that he had not previously testified concerning the sanity of a person accused of a crime. Amble further stated that he was not board certified in psychiatry, that, as of the time of trial, he had been engaged in the practice of forensic psychiatry only for about two years, and that he never had treated the defendant. Amble also conceded that he was the only mental health professional to have diagnosed the defendant as suffering from sexual sadism, and that the other examining psychiatrists and psychologists, including Baranoski, had offered diagnoses of the defendant that differed from his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In addition, Amble acknowledged that the defendant had felt the need to rent several violent films to \u201cget [himself] in the mood\u201d to rape and kill the victim. Amble also acknowledged that the defendant initially had not planned to kill the victim\u2019s father and brother, but later decided to do so, not out of any compulsion to harm them, but because they would have been able to identify him as the victim\u2019s assailant. Amble further acknowledged that the defendant originally had planned to kill only himself, but, thereafter, decided that, if he was going to commit suicide, he would fulfill some of his violent sexual fantasies before doing so. Moreover, because the defendant had demonstrated a measure of self-control in executing his criminal plan, Amble could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>not say that the defendant would have been compelled to proceed in accordance with his plan if, for example, there had been a law enforcement officer at the victim\u2019s home when the defendant arrived there on the evening of May 2,1994. Amble also conceded that the defendant knew that what he was doing was wrong, and that he was not suffering from any hallucinations, or otherwise out of touch with reality, during the several days leading up to and including May 2. Finally, during closing arguments, the prosecutor noted that Amble agreed that a mental disease or illness can result in a lowering of a person\u2019s inhibitions without causing that person to lose control over his or her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The state also relied on other evidence to support its contention that the defendant was able to control his conduct within the requirements of the law. For example, during several interviews with the police immediately after his arrest, the defendant answered all questions calmly and responsively. In one of these interviews, the defendant, when asked why he had attempted to rape and murder the victim, explained that he \u201cha[d] the will to do it\u201d and, further, that he \u201cha[s] a criminal mind.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Subsequent to his arrest, the defendant also told the police that he had rented the three videotapes on May 2 to \u201cexpose [himself] to violence\u201d for the purpose of \u201cget[ting] [himself] in the mood\u201d to assault and kill the victim. The defendant further explained that, in light of his previous struggles with such thoughts, it was \u201ctime to cross the line.\u201d The defendant indicated that he had become impatient waiting to have his first sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>relationship with a woman, and that he had \u201ctried to cross the line twice and . . . failed,\u201d referring to the incidents involving the victim and the young woman at Vassar.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Finally, the state maintained that Amble\u2019s opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s inability to control himself lacked support in the evidence. In particular, the state noted that the defendant had exhibited self-control by waiting from Friday until Monday to execute his plan to rape and kill the victim and also noted that the defendant, again, demonstrated self-restraint on Monday by postponing his entry into the victim\u2019s home for several hours. In addition, the records of the defendant\u2019s treatment at Greenwich Hospital during the period preceding the May 2 incident, and those of the Bridgeport correctional center for the period immediately thereafter, contain nothing to indicate that the defendant believed that he was being controlled by an outside force or forces.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Furthermore, the defendant, in responding to a psychological test administered to him while an inpatient at Four Winds in February, 1994, denied that he: was possessed by evil spirits; had very peculiar and strange experiences; has something wrong with his mind; often feels as if things are not real; has ever seen a vision; and wishes that he were not bothered by thoughts about sex. The state also introduced a letter that had been retrieved from the defendant\u2019s laptop computer; see footnote 18 of this opinion; in which the defendant, presumably writing to a friend sometime prior to his arrest, indicates that he is doing fine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>learning to cope with his problems.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The state, moreover, adduced evidence indicating that the defendant had been able to sleep and work normally,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and enjoy dinner with his friends, in the days immediately prior to May 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cIt is apparent, therefore, that the [court] reviewed conflicting evidence on the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental capacity at the time he [committed the proscribed acts]. The evaluation of such conflicting evidence on the issue of legal insanity is the province of the finder of fact. . . . [W]e have repeatedly stated that our review of the conclusions of the trier of fact . . . is limited. . . . This court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s [judgment] and will affirm the conclusion of the trier of fact if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . . The probative force of direct and circumstantial evidence is the same. . . . The credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony and to that of lay witnesses on the issue of sanity is determined by the trier of fact. \u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Medina, </em>228 Conn. 281, 309, 636 A.2d 351 (1994). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n its consideration of the testimony of an expert witness, the [trier of fact] might weigh, as it sees fit, the expert\u2019s expertise, his opportunity to obseive the defendant and to form an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>opinion, and his thoroughness. It might consider also the reasonableness of his judgments about the underlying facts and of the conclusions which he drew from them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 201, 672 A.2d 488 (1996); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>229 Conn. 328, 339, 641 A.2d 123 (1994). Moreover, \u201c[a]lthough expert witnesses testified on behalf of the defendant and the state called none, that alone is not a sufficient basis to disturb the verdict on appeal . . . for the [trier of fact] can disbelieve any or all of the evidence on insanity and can construe that evidence in a manner different from the parties\u2019 assertions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>supra, 309-10. It is the trier of fact\u2019s \u201cfunction to consider, sift and weigh all the evidence including a determination as to whether any opinions given concerning the defendant\u2019s sanity were undercut or attenuated under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>203 Conn. 212, 242, 523 A.2d 1306 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 490, 743 A.2d 1 (1999) (\u201cthe state can weaken the force of the defendant\u2019s presentation by cross-examination and by pointing to inconsistencies in the evidence\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In light of the totality of the evidence, the court reasonably could have rejected the opinion of Amble, the lone witness to testify that the defendant, due to his mental illness, was unable to control his conduct within the requirements of the law on May 2,1994. In addition, the court reasonably could have concluded that, even though the evidence indicated that the defendant was suffering from a mental illness,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> he nevertheless had the capacity to refrain from acting on his desire to commit rape and murder. In particular, that conclusion is supported by the fact that the defendant felt the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>to \u201cget [himself] in the mood\u201d in advance of attempting to commit those crimes by viewing videotapes depicting graphic violence. That conclusion is further supported by evidence indicating that the defendant decided to act out his sadistic sexual fantasies only after he had resolved to accomplish his primary objective, namely, to kill himself.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The defendant also asserts that the trial court, in rejecting his affirmative defense, placed undue emphasis on the fact that the defendant was able carefully to plan his attack on the victim over a period of several days.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In particular, the defendant contends that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ability to plan cannot be viewed as inconsistent with his claim that, due to the particular nature of his mental illness, he could not control his conduct within the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Of course, an accused who suffers from a mental disease or illness may be able to establish that he was unable to control his conduct according to law even though he had the capacity to plan that illegal conduct. Whether the capacity to plan a course of criminal conduct is probative of an accused\u2019s ability to control his behavior within legal requirements necessarily depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and ultimately is a determination for the trier of fact. Indeed, we previously have indicated that an accused\u2019s ability to formulate a plan to kill is relevant to a determination of whether the accused has the capability of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 382, 590 A.2d 408 (1991) (defendant \u201cwas in sufficient control of himself to form a plan to kill the victims in order to exact revenge and to make preparations to carry out that plan\u201d). We see no persuasive reason why the court was prohibited from drawing such an inference in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Moreover, although it is true that the trial court underscored the fact that the defendant had \u201ccarefully planned his course of conduct,\u201d the court did not indicate that it had relied exclusively on such evidence in rejecting the defendant\u2019s insanity defense. Thus, we are free to examine the entire record to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>a fact finder reasonably could have concluded that the defendant had failed to establish that he lacked substantial capacity to control his desire to commit rape and murder. As we previously have explained, the state mounted a vigorous challenge to the defendant\u2019s insanity defense, and adduced considerable evidence, both on cross-examination and in its rebuttal case, to undermine the defendant\u2019s claim. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that the evidence presented in support of his defense was so persuasive as to require a finding that it was more likely than not that he was unable to control his conduct within the requirements of the law. The defendant, therefore, cannot prevail on his claim that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly concluded that P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, which amended \u00a7 53-29 (e) to require the imposition of a probationary term of not less than ten years and not more than thirty-five years for certain serious sexual offenses, including first degree sexual assault under \u00a7 53a-70; see footnote 8 of this opinion; does not have retrospective applicability to the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted first degree sexual assault. Because we agree with the state that P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, does not have retroactive effect, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">A brief review of the pertinent statutory provisions is necessaiy to our resolution of this claim. Section 53a-29 (a) authorizes a trial court to impose a period of probation for certain felony offenses. Under subsection (d) of \u00a7 53a-29, a court may impose a probationary period not to exceed five years for the conviction of any felony, other than a class A felony or an offense enumerated in subsection (e) of \u00a7 53a-29, if the court determines that the criteria set forth in subsection (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>have been met. Prior to October 1, 1995, subsection (e) of \u00a7 53a-29 authorized a court to impose a term of probation of up to thirty-five years for a conviction of certain serious sex offenses, including a conviction under \u00a7 53a-70, if the person convicted: (1) previously had committed a violation of one of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 53a-29 (e); or (2) was, at the time of the offense, eighteen years of age or older and the victim was under the age of thirteen. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-29. Because the defendant was a first time offender and the victim was over the age of twelve, \u00a7 53a-29 (e) was not applicable to him as of the date of his offense. Consequently, the defendant faced a maximum period of probation of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In 1995, however, the legislature amended \u00a7 53a-29 (e) to require that the period of probation imposed for any of the offenses enumerated therein, including \u00a7 53a-70, shall be not less than ten years and not more than thirty-five years. The amendment also expanded the group of offenders eligible for the enhanced probationary period of subsection (e) by: (1) eliminating the requirement that the accused previously have been convicted of one of the crimes enumerated therein or be at least eighteen years old and the victim under thirteen years old at the time of the offense; and (2) adding the offense of risk of injury to a child by sexual contact; see General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (2); to the list of offenses enumerated in subsection (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Public Act 95-142, \u00a7 2, took effect on October 1,1995, approximately seventeen months after the defendant\u2019s attempted sexual assault on the victim, and approximately five months after the defendant\u2019s conviction for that offense. At the sentencing hearing, however, the defendant maintained that P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, had retrospective applicability to his conviction for attempted first degree sexual assault. The defendant claimed, therefore, that the court was not limited to sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the defendant to a maximum probationary term of five years, but, rather, was authorized to impose a term of probation of not less than ten years and not more than thirty-five years. The defendant further claimed that a long prison sentence was not necessary, and urged the court to impose a probationary term of at least ten years in lieu of a lengthy period of incarceration.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The state, which had sought a term of imprisonment of forty years, maintained that P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, was not retroactive and, therefore, that the defendant was eligible to receive a maximum period of probation of only five years. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s retroactivity claim and sentenced the defendant in accordance with the version of \u00a7 53a-29 existing prior to the 1995 amendment.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">On appeal, the defendant renews his contention that the trial court improperly failed to sentence him under the provisions of \u00a7 53a-29 (e) as amended by P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Whether P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, is retroactive presents a question of statutory construction. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . [BJecause the question presented by this appeal involves an issue of statutory construction, our review is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 596-97, 737 A.2d 916 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">There is nothing in the language or legislative history of P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, to suggest that the legislature intended for the amendment to be applied retroactively. We will not give retrospective effect to a criminal statute absent a clear legislative expression of such intent. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 625-26, 741 A.2d 902 (1999); <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 376, 678 A.2d 462 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 401, 636 A.2d 804 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Furthermore, under \u00a7 53a-29 (e), as amended by P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, a person convicted of first degree sexual assault is subject to a minimum probationary term of ten years and a maximum probationary term of thirty-five years. When the defendant engaged in the conduct that resulted in his conviction for attempted first degree sexual assault, he was subject to a maximum probationary period of only five years. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-29 (d) and (e). Thus, the retroactive application of P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, would expose the defendant and all others similarly situated to a substantially longer probationary period than they otherwise could have received for offenses subject to the pre-1995 amendment version of \u00a7 53a-29. It, therefore, is highly doubtful that the retrospective application of P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, would pass muster under the ex post facto clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>article one, \u00a7 10, of the United States constitution,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> which prohibits the retroactive application of a criminal statute that increases the punishment for a crime after its commission.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 249-50, 120 S. Ct. 1362, 146 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2000) (\u201c[o]ne function of the Ex Post Facto Clause is to bar enactments which, by retroactive operation, increase the punishment for a crime after its commission\u201d). \u201cIn choosing between two constructions of a statute, one valid and one constitutionally precarious, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 493, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 236, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S.

He made deliberate preparations to seek out [the victim] and other classmates by use of the Hopkins yearbook and handbook, whereby he obtained their addresses and used maps and atlases to determine their locations.

The trial court, however, was not persuaded that any such waiver would be binding on the defendant if it subsequently was determined that the court lacked the authority to impose a probationary term in excess of five years. The trial court also noted that the results of the defendant\u2019s psychiatric evaluation, which had been ordered by the court upon the defendant\u2019s postconviction motion for an examination under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-566, indicated that the defendant was not likely to benefit from treatment. Finally, the trial court stated that a short period of incarceration was unwarranted under the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b433-6\"> The constitution of the United States, article one, \u00a7 10, provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . pass any ... ex post facto Law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> The defendant contends that, because the trial court necessarily would have imposed a term of probation greater than five years under \u00a7 53a-29 (e), as amended by P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, the court might have imposed a shorter term of imprisonment than it did. The defendant asserts that, in such circumstances, P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, reasonably cannot be construed as authorizing an increased penalty for those offenses, including \u00a7 53a-70, that fall within the purview of subsection (e) of \u00a7 53a-29. We are not persuaded. First, the defendant\u2019s argument requires us to speculate as to what sentence the court might have imposed if the court could have imposed a period of probation in excess of five years. In fact, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant would have received a shorter prison term in such circumstances. More importantly, however, P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, contains no requirement that the enhanced probationary sentence authorized thereunder be imposed in lieu of, and not in addition to, any term of incarceration otherwise authorized for a conviction of one of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 53a-29 (e). In other words, under the amendatory language, the court could impose a significantly longer probationary term without any corresponding reduction in the length of any prison term that the court may impose. We, therefore, disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, need not be characterized as establishing a greater punishment than previously had been authorized for a violation of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 53a-29 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\"> The defendant contends that several cases from other jurisdictions support his claim that P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, should be applied retroactively. Those cases are inapposite, however, because, in each such case, the statutory amendment either reduced the potential term of imprisonment to which the defendant had been subject at the time of the offense; <em>In re Estrada, </em>63 Cal. 2d 740, 742, 408 P.2d 948, 48 Cal. Rptr. 172 (1965); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>279 Mont. 34, 39 \u2014 40, 926 P.2d 712 (1996); modified an element of the offense with which the defendant was charged such that the statute as amended eliminated the defendant\u2019s potential for conviction thereunder; <em>People </em>v. <em>Behlog, </em>74 N.Y.2d 237, 240-41, 543 N.E.2d 69, 544 N.Y.S.2d 804 (1989); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>24 Cal. App. 4th 1462, 1466, 29 Cal. Rptr. 2d 771 (1994) (amendment modiiying element of penalty enhancement provision); or expanded the number of alternatives to incarceration that could be employed in sentencing the defendant. <em>People </em>v. <em>Patino, </em>174 Misc. 2d 359, 363-65, 664 N.Y.S.2d 406 (1997). In contrast, P.A. 95-142, \u00a7 2, significantly enlarged the period of probation to which an eligible offender could be sentenced for a conviction of first degree sexual assault, thereby increasing the punishment for that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
