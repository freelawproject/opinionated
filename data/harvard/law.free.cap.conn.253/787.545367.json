The defendant, Liberty Oil Equipment Company, Inc. (Liberty Oil),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>trial court striking its apportionment complaint against the third party defendant, Boston Steel and Manufacturing Co. (Boston Steel). Liberty Oil claims that the trial court improperly struck its apportionment complaint because, although Boston Steel was alleged to be a product seller with respect to the particular item in question in the case, Liberty Oil confined its apportionment allegations against Boston Steel to claims of negligence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The plaintiff, Bruce Allard, brought the action underlying this case against Liberty Oil in negligence. Liberty Oil filed a substitute apportionment complaint against Boston Steel. The trial court granted Boston Steel\u2019s motion to strike the substitute apportionment complaint, and rendered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The procedural history is undisputed. In June, 1996, Allard brought the underlying action in this case. In his original complaint, Allard alleged that, on February 27, 1995, while employed by Viking Oil, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he brought his oil truck to Liberty Oil for servicing and, while in Liberty Oil\u2019s service area, he was descending certain steps of a ladder on his truck when he fell, landing on a wooden hand truck, causing him to suffer severe injuries. Allard alleged that Liberty Oil was negligent in failing to maintain its service area in a safe condition, in failing to prohibit customers from entering the service area, and in failing to take reasonable measures to prevent customers from entering the dangerous service area. Liberty Oil filed its first apportionment complaint against Boston Steel alleging that a portion of its liability to Allard, if any, should be apportioned to Boston Steel because the oil truck or a portion of the oil truck from which Allard allegedly had fallen was \u201cdesigned, installed, manufactured, distributed, or sold by\u201d Boston Steel, and was defective and unreasonably dangerous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The trial court, <em>Lavine, J., </em>granted Boston Steel\u2019s motion to strike this first apportionment complaint. Liberty Oil then filed a substitute apportionment complaint (apportionment complaint), which is the focus of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In the apportionment complaint, Liberty Oil alleged that the portion of the oil truck from which Allard allegedly had fallen, including the tank and ladder, was \u201cdesigned, manufactured, installed, distributed, or sold by\u201d Boston Steel. Liberty Oil also alleged that Allard had alleged that his injuries were the result of Liberty Oil\u2019s negligence, and that, if Allard had suffered any injuries, \u201cthen said injuries and damages were proximately caused by the negligence and carelessness of Boston Steel . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, Liberty Oil sought \u201can apportionment of liability against Boston Steel for the percentage of its liability causing the plaintiffs alleged injuries and damages.\u201d Boston Steel moved to strike the apportionment complaint on the ground that, despite the allegations of negligence, the apportionment complaint \u201calleges a products liability claim, not a negligence claim.\u201d The trial court, <em>Lavine, J., </em>granted the motion to strike. Subsequently, the trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>granted Liberty Oil\u2019s motion for judgment on the apportionment complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Liberty Oil claims that the trial court improperly struck its apportionment complaint. Liberty Oil\u2019s argument is simple and straightforward: it has been sued in negligence; General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h permits apportionment of negligence claims; its apportionment complaint seeks to apportion only its liability, if any, based on negligence; and, therefore, its apportionment complaint was proper. Despite this apparent simplicity and straightforwardness, however, we disagree. We conclude that the trial court properly struck the apportionment complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">It is undisputed that Liberty Oil filed its apportionment complaint pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provides in pertinent part: \u201cA defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>any civil action to which section 52-572h applies may serve a writ, summons and complaint upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable pursuant to said section for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages in which case the demand for relief shall seek an apportionment of liability. . . .\u201d Indeed, \u00a7 52-102b is \u201cthe exclusive means by which a defendant may add a person who is or may be liable pursuant to section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>52-572h for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages as a party to the action.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">It is also undisputed that, to the extent that Allard\u2019s complaint seeks damages from Liberty Oil based on negligence, that complaint is a \u201ccivil action to which section 52-572h applies\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (a); because of the provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (c): \u201cIn a negligence action to recover damages resulting from personal injuiy, wrongful death or damage to property occurring on or after October 1, 1987, if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the negligence of more than one party, each party against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for such party\u2019s proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneconomic damages . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (c), as amended by No. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (c), of the 1999 Public Acts (P.A. 99-69).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Put another way, a \u201ccivil action to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>section 52-572h applies,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-102b, means a civil action based on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>In addition, Boston Steel does not dispute that, if Liberty Oil\u2019s apportionment complaint were based on allegations of negligence by Boston Steel that did not in any way involve Boston Steel\u2019s conduct as a product seller, within the meaning of our statutes governing product liability; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-572m through 52-572q;* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the apportionment complaint would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>proper. That is because, in that instance, the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>of \u00a7 52-572h would plainly apply. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (b) and (c), as amended by P.A. 99-69, as set forth in footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The question raised by the present case, however, is whether \u00a7 52-572h, as amended by P.A. 99-69, permits an apportionment complaint that seeks to limit its allegations against a product seller, as defined by our product liability statutes, to allegations of negligence. We conclude that it does not, because of the provisions of our product liability statutes, as we have interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>them, and because of the specific provisions of \u00a7 52-572h, as contained in P.A. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">First, the allegations of the apportionment complaint are that Boston Steel \u201cdesigned, manufactured, installed, distributed, or sold\u201d the portion of the oil truck from which the plaintiff allegedly fell. These allegations are classic allegations of product liability. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (a) (\u201c \u2018[p]roduct seller\u2019 means any person or entity, including a manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor or retailer who is engaged in the business of selling such products whether the sale is for resale or for use or consumption\u201d); see footnote 8 of this opinion for the full text of \u00a7 52-572m. It cannot be disputed that Boston Steel is, under the allegations of the apportionment complaint, a \u201c \u2018product seller\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-572m. See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m (b) (\u201c \u2018[p]roduct liability claim\u2019 includes all claims or actions brought for personal injury, death or property damage caused by the manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, installation, testing, warnings, instructions, marketing, packaging or labeling of any product\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Second, under \u00a7 52-572m (b), a \u201c \u2018[pjroduct liability claim\u2019 includes all claims or actions brought for personal injury, death or property damage caused by the manufacture, construction, design, formula, preparation, assembly, installation, testing, warnings, instructions, marketing, packaging or labeling of any product. \u2018Product liability claim\u2019 shall include, but is not limited to, all actions based on the following theories: Strict liability in tort; negligence; breach of warranty, express or implied; breach of or failure to discharge a duty to warn or instruct, whether negligent or innocent; misrepresentation or nondisclosure, whether negligent or innocent . . . .\u201d Thus, despite the limitations by Liberty Oil of its allegations of misconduct to allegations of negligence, the allegations of the apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>complaint constitute a \u201c \u2018[p]roduct liability claim\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-572m (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Section 52-572n (a) provides: \u201cA product liability claim as provided in sections 52-240a, 52-240b, 52-572m to 52-572q, inclusive, and 52-577a may be asserted and shall be in lieu of all other claims against product sellers, including actions of negligence, strict liability and warranty, for harm caused by a product.\u201d See footnote 8 of this opinion for the full text of \u00a7 52-572n. It is now beyond dispute that this provision \u201cprovides the exclusive remedy for a claim falling within its scope, thereby denying a claimant the option of bringing common law causes of action for the same claim.\u201d <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 462, 463, 562 A.2d 517 (1989) (plaintiff cannot avoid product liability statute of limitations by pleading product liability claim in common-law terms); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 571-72, 512 A.2d 893 (1986) (common-law claim based on product liability barred by \u00a7 52-572n [a]); compare <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Haybuster Mfg., Inc., </em>226 Conn. 282, 298-99, 627 A.2d 1288 (1993) (loss of consortium claim not barred by Product Liability Act); <em>Paul </em>v. <em>McPhee Electrical Contractors, </em>46 Conn. App. 18, 21, 698 A.2d 354 (1997) (no apportionment claim permitted based on allegations of product liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Liberty Oil cannot, therefore, convert its apportionment claim against Boston Steel into something other than a product liability claim simply by alleging only negligent misconduct. Put another way, we fail to see why, if a claimant may <em>not </em>avoid the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 52-572n (a) by casting his pleading in common-law terms, a defendant seeking to bring in an apportionment defendant <em>should </em>be permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In addition, the provisions of \u00a7 52-572h, as amended by P.A. 99-69, lead us to the same conclusion. We first note that P.A. 99-69 governs this action. Section 2 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>P.A. 99-69 provides: \u201cThis act shall take effect from its passage and shall be applicable to any civil action pending or filed on or after August 11, 1998.\u201d The present case was pending on August 11, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Public Act 99-69 amended \u00a7 52-572h by adding subsection (o), which provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, there shall be no apportionment of liability or damages between parties liable for negligence and parties liable on any basis other than negligence including, but not limited to, intentional, wanton or reckless misconduct, strict liability or liability pursuant to any cause of action created by statute, except that liability may be apportioned among parties liable for negligence in any cause of action created by statute based on negligence including, but not limited to, an action for wrongful death pursuant to section 52-555 or an action for injuries caused by a motor vehicle owned by the state pursuant to section 52-556.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The general effect of P.A. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o), was to make clear that the apportionment principles of \u00a7 52-572h do not apply where the purported apportionment complaint rests \u201con any basis other than negligence,\u201d and that these other bases include, without limitation, \u201cintentional, wanton or reckless misconduct, strict liability or liability pursuant to any cause of action created by statute . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legislative history of P.A. 99-69 makes clear that its principal purpose was to overrule legislatively a portion of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>246 Conn. 223, 717 A.2d 202 (1998). See, e.g., 42 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1999 Sess., pp. 1797-98, remarks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of Senator Donald E. Williams, Jr.;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 42 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1999 Sess., p. 1916, remarks of Representative Michael P. Lawlor; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> id., pp. 1918-19;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see also generally Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1999 Sess., pp. 1271-74, 1310-29, 1340-46, 1355-58, 1362, 1365, 1418-20, 1426-31; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1999 Sess., pp. 1538-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In <em>Bhinder </em>v. <em>Sun Co., </em>supra, 246 Conn. 225, the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action against the defendant based on negligence. The defendant sought to apportion its liability to an apportionment defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>whose conduct was not negligent, but intentional, reckless, wilful and wanton. Id., 229. This court held that: (1) as a matter of statutory interpretation, \u201cthe plain language of \u00a7 52-572h provides that only negligent persons may be cited in by the defendant for apportionment of liability purposes\u201d; id., 230; and (2) nonetheless, \u201cas a matter of common law, we should extend the policy of apportionment to permit a defendant in a negligence action to cite in as an apportionment defendant a party whose conduct is alleged to be reckless, wilful, and wanton.\u201d Id., 234. <em>Bhinder </em>was decided on August 11, 1998. Id., 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The legislative response to <em>Bhinder </em>was prompt. In the next legislative session, the legislature amended \u00a7 52-572h through P.A. 99-69 by adding subsection (o), which was effective as to all actions pending on or filed after the date of the <em>Bhinder </em>decision. In doing so, it accomplished three purposes. First, the legislature reaffirmed that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, only negligent persons may be cited in as apportionment defendants pursuant to the statute. Thus, in this respect, P.A. 99-69 endorsed the corresponding statutory interpretation part of <em>Bhinder. </em>Second, the legislature made clear its intent that apportionment principles would not apply where the basis of liability of the purported apportionment defendant was based on conduct \u201cother than negligence,\u201d including but not limited to intentional, wanton or reckless misconduct, strict liability, and liability pursuant to any cause of action created by statute. Thus, in this respect, the legislature made clear its intent to overrule the common-law portion of <em>Bhinder. </em>It went beyond the facts <em>o\u00ed Bhinder, </em>however, which had been limited to allegations of common-law intentional, wanton and reckless misconduct. The legislature also included a specific bar to apportionment principles where the apportionment defendant\u2019s purported misconduct was based on strict liability or on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>a statutory cause of action. Third, the legislature made clear its intent that, despite the specific bar to apportionment regarding statutory actions, liability <em>may </em>be apportioned among parties liable for negligence in statutory actions based on <em>negligence, </em>such as 'wrongful death actions and actions for injuries caused by state-owned motor vehicles. Thus, the legislature in effect anticipated, and made clear its rejection of, a potential argument that statutory actions should not be considered to be actions \u201cbased on negligence,\u201d which is ordinarily understood to be a common-law, and not a statutory, concept, and also made clear that, where the statutory action in question is based on allegations of negligence, apportionment principles <em>would </em>apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">It is significant that actions based on \u201cstrict liability\u201d are among the types of actions that the legislature specifically noted as not affording apportionment. Product liability is simply a form of strict liability. See <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., </em>241 Conn. 199, 210-11, 694 A.2d 1319 (1997). In fact, General Statutes \u00a7 52-<em>5721, </em>which provides that \u201c[i]n causes of action based on strict tort liability,\u201d contributory and comparative negligence shall not be a bar to recovery, contemplates that strict liability and product liability are forms of the same tort. Section <em>52-5721 </em>further provides that \u201c[njoth-ing in this section shall be construed as barring the defense of misuse of the product or the defense of knowingly using the product in a defective condition in an action based on strict tort liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Thus, it would be inconsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 52-572h, as amended by P.A. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o), to permit a defendant sued in negligence to claim apportionment against a product seller whose alleged misconduct tracks that of product liability, solely because the party seeking apportionment chooses to limits its allegations to those sounding in negligence. Indeed, the specific bar to apportionment to a party based on strict liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>is most plausibly read as a legislative affirmation of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, referred to previously, in <em>Paul </em>v. <em>McPhee Electrical Contractors, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 21, that a product liability claim cannot be the basis of apportionment under \u00a7 52-572h. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 201, 506 A.2d 118 (1986) (legislature may be presumed to know state of law governing subject matter of legislation).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Liberty Oil argues that P.A. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o), supports its position because of its provision that apportionment is allowed between \u201cparties liable for negligence in any cause of action created by statute based on negligence . . . .\u201d Thus, Liberty Oil contends, \u201c[g]iven that the . . . apportionment claim alleges negligence in relation to a defective product, the apportionment complaint involves a statutory cause of action based upon negligence, and P.A. 99-69 does not prohibit but instead permits apportionment here.\u201d Implicit in this argument is the notion that a product liability claim is the kind of \u201ccause of action created by statute based on negligence\u201d that P.A. 99-69, \u00a7 1 (o), envisions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">First, that interpretation would conflict with the specific bar to apportionment for actions based on \u201cstrict liability,\u201d of which product liability, albeit now statutory, is simply a form. The specific reference barling apportionment involving actions based on strict liability trumps the more general notion implicit in Liberty Oil\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Second, the statutory actions based on negligence given as examples, namely, wrongful death and injuries caused by state-owned vehicles, are different in their nature from product liability claims. The theory behind the statutory limitation of apportionment claims to those involving negligence is that, in such a case, both the underlying claim of the plaintiff and the apportionment claim of the defendant are in relative pari materia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>in that they both involve negligent conduct. The statutory actions based on negligence given as examples are consistent with that theory because they rest on the same notions of fault embodied in nonstatutory negligence actions. Product liability claims, however, do not rest on notions of fault. They rest on more generalized notions of allocation of the plaintiffs loss to the product seller who puts a defective product into the stream of commerce, and therefore ordinarily is able to spread the loss by price adjustments. See <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>243 Conn. 168, 194, 700 A.2d 38 (1997). Thus, it would be inconsistent with the theory of the apportionment statute to read it as Liberty Oil proposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\"> The plaintiffs amended complaint contained a products liability count against another defendant, Baumert Sales Co., Inc., which is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-12\"> Liberty Oil appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\"> Viking Oil, Inc., as the plaintiffs employer, intervened as a plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\"> The specific acts of negligence on the part of Boston Steel alleged by Liberty Oil included: (1) failing to act reasonably; (2) negligently designing the tank and ladder; (3) negligently manufacturing the tank and ladder; (4) negligently installing the tank and ladder; (5) negligently failing to provide adequate warnings concerning the tank and ladder; and (6) failing to make reasonable use of its senses and faculties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> Meanwhile, Allard has filed an amended complaint reasserting his allegations of negligence against Liberty Oil, and adding a count of product liability against Liberty Oil.

Such notice shall also set forth the factual basis of the defendant\u2019s claim that the negligence of such person was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries or damages. No such notice shall be required if such person with whom the plaintiff settled or whom the plaintiff released was previously a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitation or repose, the plaintiff may, within sixty days of the return date of the apportionment complaint served pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, assert any claim against the apportionment defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\u201c(e) When a counterclaim is asserted against a plaintiff, he may cause a person not a party to the action to be brought in as an apportionment defendant under circumstances which under this section would entitle a defendant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">\u201c(f) This section shall be the exclusive means by which a defendant may add a person who is or may be liable pursuant to section 52-572h for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages as a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">\u201c(g) In no event shall any proportionate share of negligence determined pursuant to subsection <em>(f) </em>of section 52-572h attributable to an apportionment defendant against whom the plaintiff did not assert a claim be reallocated under subsection (g) of said section. Such proportionate share of negligence shall, however, be included in or added to the combined negligence of the person or persons against whom the plaintiff seeks recovery, including persons with whom the plaintiff settled or whom the plaintiff released under subsection (n) of section 52-572h, when comparing any negligence of the plaintiff to other parties and persons under subsection (b) of said section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\"> Public Act 99-69, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Apportionment of Liability between Negligent and Intentional Tortfeasors,\u201d provides: \u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\u201cSection 1.

The economic or noneconomic damages allowed shall be diminished in the proportion of the percentage of negligence attributable to the person recovering which percentage shall be determined pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">\u201c(c) In a negligence action to recover damages resulting from personal injury, wrongful death or damage to property occurring on or after October 1, 1987, if the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the negligence of more than one party, each party against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for [his] <em>such party\u2019s </em>proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneco-nomic damages except as provided in subsection (g) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">\u201c(d) The proportionate share of damages for which each party is liable is calculated by multiplying the recoverable economic damages and the recoverable noneconomic damages by a fraction in which the numerator is the party\u2019s percentage of negligence, which percentage shall be determined pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, and the denominator is the total of the percentages of negligence, which percentages shall be determined pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, to be attributable to all parties whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the injury, death or damage to property including settled or released persons under subsection (n) of this section.

(2) The court shall order that the portion of such uncollectible amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>which represents recoverable noneconomic damages be reallocated among the other defendants according to their percentages of negligence, provided that the court shall not reallocate to any such defendant an amount greater than that defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence multiplied by such uncollectible amount. (3) The court shall order that 1he portion of such uncollectible amount which represents recoverable economic damages be reallocated among the other defendants. The court shall reallocate to any such other defendant an amount equal to such uncollectible amount of recoverable economic damages multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is such defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence and the denominator is the total of the percentages of negligence of all defendants, excluding any defendant whose liability is being reallocated.

And let me emphasize Madam Speaker, there was a great deal of concern among the various parties and interests who are represented here at the legislature as to whether or not in some way this bill would do more than go back to the way the law was prior to last August\u2019s Supreme Court decision. It\u2019s, based on the testimony before our committee and the discussions that have happened prior [to] today, it\u2019s very clear that the only intent here is to put the law back where everyone understood it to be last year. That\u2019s the only purpose of this bill.\u201d 42 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 1918-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
