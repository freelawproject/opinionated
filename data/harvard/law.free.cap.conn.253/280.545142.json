We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 4 p.m. on February 14, 1996, Benjamin Sierra, Jr., was driving his parents\u2019 car on Fairfield Avenue in Bridgeport. While stopped at a red light at the intersection of Fairfield and Iranistan Avenues, Sierra spotted two young women, Tracey Gabree and Terri Horeglad, with whom he was acquainted, standing at a nearby pay telephone. Sierra waved to Gabree and Horeglad and they approached and entered Sierra\u2019s car. Horeglad sat in the front passenger seat and Gabree sat in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Gabree asked Sierra for a cigarette. Sierra then turned around and gave her a cigarette and a light. Sierra asked Gabree and Horeglad where they were going and one of them responded that they were homeless and just wanted to get warm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">When Sierra turned back toward the front of the car, he observed that his vehicle was blocked by a tan car that was facing the wrong direction on Fairfield Avenue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>At that moment, Gabree shouted: \u201cOh shit, Kareem!\u201d Gabree then fled from Sierra\u2019s car. A man, later identified by Sierra and Gabree as the defendant, emerged from the tan car and approached the passenger side of Sierra\u2019s car, where Horeglad remained seated. Sierra jumped out of his car and asked the defendant what was wrong. The defendant, who did not respond, pulled out what appeared to be a .32 or .38 caliber chrome plated revolver and fired four shots at Horeglad, each of which entered the right side of her body. Horeglad died as a result of the gunshot wounds. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The defendant first claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state improperly exercised its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s contentions, we first summarize the applicable law. \u201cIn <em>Batson </em>[v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986)] the United States Supreme Court recognized that a claim of purposeful racial discrimination on the part of the prosecution in selecting a jury raises constitutional questions of the utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The court concluded that [although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as long as that reason is related to his [or her] view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried . . . the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[237 Conn. 238, 243-44, 676 A.2d 384 (1996)]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">\u201cUnder Connecticut law, [o]nce a [party] asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the [opposing party] must advance a neu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>tral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] is then afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the [opposing party\u2019s] articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> . . . [T]he trial court then [has] the duty to determine if the [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] has established purposeful discrimination. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury selection process in his or her particular case was tainted by purposeful discrimination. . . .<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that [a party\u2019s removal] of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was . . . motivated [by race or gender]. These include, but are not limited to: (1) [t]he reasons given for the challenge were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>related to the trial of the case ... (2) the [party exercising the peremptoiy strike] failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race [or gender] were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors ... (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race [or gender] as the challenged juror were not struck ... (5) the [party exercising the peremptoiy strike] advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the [party exercising the peremptoiy strike] used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude members of one race [or gender], . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cIn assessing the reasons proffered in support of the use of a peremptory challenge . . . [a]n explanation . . . need not ... be pigeon-holed as wholly acceptable or wholly unacceptable . . . and even where the acceptability of a particular explanation is doubtful, the inquiry is not at an end. In deciding the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent, the judicial officer is entitled to assess each explanation in light of all the other evidence relevant to prosecutorial intent. The officer may think a dubious explanation undermines the bona fides of other explanations or may think that the sound explanations dispel the doubt raised by a questionable one. As with most inquiries into state of mind, the ultimate determination depends on an aggregate assessment of all the circumstances. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cFinally, the trial court\u2019s decision on the question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact that will necessarily turn on the court\u2019s evaluation of the demeanor and credibility of the attorney of the party exercising the peremptory challenge. . . . Accordingly, a trial court\u2019s determination that there has or has not been intentional discrimination is afforded great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>deference and will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 218-24, 726 A.2d 531 (1999); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 657-60, 735 A.2d 267 (1999). Guided by these principles, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The defendant contends that the trial court improperly denied his <em>Batson </em>challenge to the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to strike venireperson J.J., <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> an African-American female. The defendant argues that the state\u2019s challenge of J.J. was pretextual because the proffered explanation for striking her was not supported by her responses and, also, because the state later accepted a white venireperson, J.O., who, according to the defendant, gave answers comparable to those of J.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. During her voir dire examination, J.J. indicated to defense counsel that she might be uncomfortable serving on the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>assistant state\u2019s attorney (state\u2019s attorney), during his questioning of J.J., sought to clarify why J.J. had indicated some discomfort with serving as a juror in this case. J.J. responded that she was uncertain whether she \u201creally could be fair in [her] judgment.\u201d Upon further questioning, J.J. explained that making decisions affecting another person\u2019s life would be different from making decisions concerning her own.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> J.J. also agreed that she would not have a problem acquitting the defendant if the state did not prove its case. When the state\u2019s attorney asked J.J. if she would have any difficulty convicting the defendant if she found that the state had proved its case, she responded: \u201cI may have some hesitation. I mean, I can\u2019t say yes or no until I hear everything, all the evidence or whatever it is.\u201d When asked if her hesitation would affect her ability to be objective in a criminal case, she answered: \u201cI think there\u2019s always some hesitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">At the conclusion of J.J.\u2019s voir dire, the state\u2019s attorney moved to excuse her for cause, citing concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>about whether she could be objective.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court denied that motion. The state then sought to exercise a peremptory challenge against J.J. The defendant objected on the ground that the challenge was racially motivated. The state\u2019s attorney advanced the same explanation that he had made in support of his challenge for cause, adding that \u201cif a person comes in here and they express at the very minimum . . . hesitation in perhaps being able to find someone guilty, I would certainly be irresponsible if I did not excuse that person whether they were black, white or any other race.\u201d The trial court concluded that J.J.\u2019s responses regarding her potential difficulty in voting to convict constituted a valid, race neutral reason for the exercise of a peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, the court accepted the state\u2019s peremptory challenge and J.J. was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We agree with the state that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the reason proffered by the state\u2019s attorney for excluding J.J. was not pretextual. J.J.\u2019s responses provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s apprehension that J.J. might have difficulty voting to convict the defendant, even if the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. J.J. expressed hesi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>tancy as to whether she could find a person guilty of a serious crime, but expressed no such reluctance when asked about her willingness to find someone not guilty of such a crime. We previously have stated that a venire-person\u2019s \u201cindecisive or equivocal commitment to the prevailing standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt ... if adequately substantiated, satisfies <em>Batson </em>because a prosecutor has a legitimate interest in obtaining jurors who will faithfully adhere to the governing burden of proof.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 404-405, 538 A.2d 210 (1988). Because JJ.\u2019s responses suggested that she might have difficulty in objectively determining guilt, we agree with the state that the proffered explanation for her exclusion was supported by the record and, consequently, that the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In support of his claim of pretext, the defendant also contends that the state did not seek to strike J.O., a white female, even though, according to the defendant, J.O.\u2019s responses were similar to those of J.J. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 325, 630 A.2d 593 (1993) (pretext may be shown when \u201cpersons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race as the challenged juror were not struck\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The defendant raises this claim, however, for the first time on appeal. As we recently have stated in refusing to review such an unpreserved claim, \u201c[i]t would be both unfair and unreasonable to require the trial court to conduct a comparative evaluation of the backgrounds of venirepersons who have not been identified by the defendant in support of his <em>Batson </em>claim. Because a party is entitled to raise a <em>Batson </em>challenge at any time prior to the swearing in of the jury; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 250; there is no reason why the burden of identifying, with reasonable specificity, those venirepersons whose selection by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>opposing party tends to support the moving party\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim should be on the trial court, rather than on the party making the <em>Batson </em>claim. Moreover, because a claim of purposeful discrimination under <em>Batson </em>raises issues of fact to be decided by the trial court, the moving party\u2019s failure to inform the trial court of the full factual basis for the claim renders that claim unreviewable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 228 n.24. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s disparate treatment claim, raised for the first time on appeal, is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The defendant nevertheless claims that this case constitutes an exception to the general rule of unreviewability. In particular, the defendant contends that, in the exercise of our supervisory authority over the administration of justice,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we should require the trial court, on its own motion, to reexamine its rejection of any previous <em>Batson </em>challenge when the court thereafter finds that a prosecutor\u2019s explanation for seeking to strike a subsequent venireperson is pretextual. The defendant asserts that this proposed exception is applicable to this case because, the defendant alleges, the trial court, in rejecting the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge against a subsequent venireperson, M.B., an African-American female, found that the explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>that the state\u2019s attorney provided for challenging M.B. was a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Even if it is assumed, arguendo, that the trial court properly rejected the state\u2019s peremptory challenge against M.B. on the ground that the reasons given by the state\u2019s attorney for striking M.B. were inadequate, we nevertheless decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to exercise our supervisory power to require sua sponte reconsideration by the trial court of its earlier ruling rejecting the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>because the defendant, not the trial court, properly bears the burden of raising the issue of whether the court\u2019s subsequent finding of pretext calls into question the validity of the court\u2019s earlier ruling upholding the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge against aprevious venireperson. Of course, if warranted under the circumstances, the trial court may, sua sponte, reconsider its previous ruling rejecting the defendant\u2019s earlier <em>Batson </em>challenge. Moreover, the defendant is free to seek reconsideration of any such ruling at any time prior to the conclusion of jury selection. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 250. In light of the significant period of time that it often takes to select a jury and the large number of potential jurors frequently involved in that process, however, it would be unfair to <em>require </em>the court to undertake a sua sponte review of its prior <em>Batson </em>ruling or rulings solely because the court thereafter determines that, with respect to a subsequent venireperson, the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for exercising a peremptory challenge does not pass muster under <em>Batson. </em>We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s claim that we should invoke our supervisory authority in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court failed to make an adequate inquiry into allegations of juror bias in violation of his right to a fair trial guaranteed under the sixth and fourteenth amendments<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. Following the trial court\u2019s final instructions, the jury was excused for lunch prior to commencing its deliberations. After the lunch recess, the court indicated that it wished to place on the record a matter that it had discussed in chambers with defense counsel and the state\u2019s attorney. The court stated that, during the recess, an alternate juror, subsequently identified as the first alternate juror, J.D., had approached a deputy sheriff stationed at the metal detector outside the courthouse. According to the court, J.D. had indicated to the deputy sheriff that \u201ceither he . . . or other members of the jury have been intimidated about what he describes as friends of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The trial court indicated that it intended to question J.D. about the matter individually and on the record. The court asked defense counsel and the state\u2019s attorney if they had any objection to proceeding in that manner, or if they wished to suggest an alternative approach. Neither party objected to the procedure the court had suggested. The defendant, however, inquired whether it might be preferable first to interview the deputy sheriff who had reported J.D.\u2019s comment to the court. The trial court explained that it would not be productive to do so, stating that: \u201cI talked to the [deputy] sheriff and, to be honest, the information was . . . very sketchy .... I don\u2019t think he probed or asked [J.D.] any questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The court, in the presence of both defense counsel and the state\u2019s attorney, then proceeded to question J.D. about whether he had made a comment to the deputy sheriff regarding possible intimidation of the jury by the defendant\u2019s friends. J.D. responded that he had \u201casked the [deputy] sheriff what could be done in the event that \u2014 that I felt intimidated by the presence of \u2014 of maybe known associates of the defendant.\u201d The court asked what, if anything, had occurred to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>him to make this inquiry. J.D. responded that he had spoken to the deputy sheriff because of the \u201clooks and presence\u201d of suspected associates of the defendant, both inside the courtroom and on the steps outside the courthouse. The court then inquired of J.D. whether other jurors shared the same \u201cfeeling\u201d about these individuals. J.D. responded in the affirmative, adding that \u201cit\u2019s been noticed and mentioned\u201d by other jurors. When questioned by the court as to whether any such person had spoken to any of the jurors, J.D. responded: \u201cNo, nothing has been said to any jurors at all.\u201d At defense counsel\u2019s request, the court then asked J.D. what had caused him to believe that these individuals were friends or associates of the defendant. J.D. responded that, on two days during the coruse of the trial, he had observed two men seated in the second row of the courtroom, whom he assumed were friends of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Upon completing its questioning of J.D., the court indicated that it intended to question each juror, individually and outside the presence of the other jurors, about whether anything had occurred during the trial, either inside or outside the courtroom, that might affect any juror\u2019s impartiality. Neither party voiced any objection to this procedure, and the court thereupon questioned the jurors accordingly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Each juror responded to the court\u2019s inquiry in the negative. The trial court then asked whether either party had anything it wished to state for the record. Defense counsel stated that he believed that J.D.\u2019s concerns appeared to be unfounded. The trial court agreed, stating that any juror who felt that he or she could not be fair would have said so in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to the court\u2019s questioning. The court then asked the defendant if he had anything further to add, and defense counsel stated that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Thereafter, the court instructed the jury to commence its deliberations. After so instructing the jury, the trial court again afforded the defendant an opportunity to voice any concerns he might have had regarding the issue of possible juror bias. The defendant raised no objection to the procedure employed by the court or to the commencement of jury deliberations. The jury subsequently returned its verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">After the jury verdict, the defendant filed a motion seeking, inter alia, a new trial on the ground that the \u201climited colloquy undertaken by the [c]ourt was insufficient to discover what other [j]urors,\u201d in addition to J.D., might have felt intimidated by persons they believed were friends of the defendant. The defendant also claimed in his motion that the court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate to establish whether any of the jurors had discussed the matter, and how any juror other than alternate juror J.D. might have been led to suspect that the men identified by J.D. were friends of the defendant. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u201cJury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . [T]he right to a jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. . . .The modem jury is regarded as an institution in our justice system that determines the case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given [it] in the adversary arena after proper instmctions on the law by the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>248 Conn. 39, 46, 726 A.2d 513 (1999); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 330, 715 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>To ensure that the jury \u201cwill decide the case free from external influences that might interfere with the exercise of deliberate and unbiased judgment\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 47; a trial court is required to conduct a preliminary inquiry, on the record, whenever it is presented with information tending to indicate the possibility of juror misconduct or partiality.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 526, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995). We previously have \u201cinstructed that the trial court should consider the following factors in exercising its discretion as to the form and scope of a preliminary inquiry into allegations of jury misconduct: (1) the criminal defendant\u2019s substantial interest in his constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury; (2) the risk of deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial before an impartial jury, which will vary with the seriousness and the credibility of the allegations of jury misconduct; and (3) the state\u2019s interests of, inter alia, jury impartiality, protecting jurors\u2019 privacy and maintaining public confidence in the jury system.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201cAny assessment of the form and scope of the inquiry that a trial court must undertake when it is presented with allegations of jury [bias or] misconduct will necessarily be fact specific. No one factor is determinative as to the proper form and scope of a proceeding. It is the trial court that must, in the exercise of its discretion, weigh the relevant factors and determine the proper balance between them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 531-32. Consequently, the trial court has wide latitude in fashioning the proper response to allegations of juror bias. Id., 523-24; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>183, 227-28, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 326, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989). \u201cWe [therefore] have limited our role, on appeal, to a consideration of whether the trial court\u2019s review of alleged jury misconduct can fairly be characterized as an abuse of its discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 524. Although we recognize that trial \u201c [c] ourts face a delicate and complex task whenever they undertake to investigate reports of juror misconduct or bias\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>116 F.3d 606, 618 (2d Cir. 1997); we nevertheless \u201chave reserved the right to find an abuse of discretion in the highly unusual case in which such an abuse has occurred.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 524. Ultimately, however, \u201c[t]o succeed on a claim of [juror] bias the defendant must raise his contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>242 Conn. 125, 141, 698 A.2d 823 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The defendant has failed to demonstrate that the hearing conducted by the trial court was inadequate to safeguard his right to a trial before an impartial jury. The court\u2019s questioning of alternate juror J.D. revealed that J.D.\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d about possible intimidation by two suspected friends of the defendant were not founded upon any articulable facts or circumstances. J.D. expressly acknowledged that neither he nor any other juror had communicated with any such person or persons. Indeed, the only reason offered by J.D. for suspecting that the two unidentified men were associated with the defendant is the fact that they had been seated in the second row of the courtroom on two of the days of trial. Moreover, each juror, upon individual questioning by the court outside the presence of the other jurors, stated that nothing had occurred during the trial to affect his or her impartiality or objectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The defendant\u2019s primary claim is that the trial court\u2019s inquiry of the individual jurors was so general that it was inadequate to determine whether the jurors were influenced in some way by the presence of the two suspected friends of the defendant. It is true that the trial court did not question the jurors about the specific information that J.D. reported to the court, but, rather, inquired generally as to whether anything had occurred during the trial that might have compromised the jurors\u2019 impartiality. In light of the vague and speculative nature of the information elicited from J.D., however, and in the absence of a response from any juror tending to suggest even the possibility of juror bias, the trial court was not required to conduct a more fact-specific inquiry. Indeed, such questioning might have raised concerns in the minds of jurors when none previously had existed. Finally, defense counsel\u2019s failure to seek any additional questioning or investigation by the court, despite repeated opportunities to do so, belies the defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal regarding the inadequacy of the court\u2019s action. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, we conclude that the hearing conducted by the trial court fully comported with the defendant\u2019s right to a trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to introduce into evidence a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent written statement for substantive purposes. The state contends that the statement was admissible under the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), which allows the \u201csubstantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>fies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree with the state that the trial court properly permitted the state to use the witness\u2019 statement under <em>Whelan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On direct examination by the state, Sierra testified about the shooting. He also stated that he had been interviewed by officers of the Bridgeport police department after the incident. Sierra recalled accompanying the police to the police garage and identifying the vehicle from which the person who had shot Horeglad emerged. Sierra further testified that the police had shown him a photographic array and asked him whether the photograph of the shooter appeared in the array. Sierra testified that he had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array and that he had circled that photograph on a photocopy of the array. Sierra also insisted, however, that he had told the police that he was not certain about the identification, and that all he could say was that the shooter looked similar to the person depicted in the photograph that he had selected. Sierra further indicated that he had told the police that he recognized the shooter because he previously had seen the shooter riding around in his car.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Sierra also testified that he had given the police a written, signed statement about the shooting the day after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Sierra then was asked whether the person he had selected from the photographic array was present in the courtroom and Sierra responded that he saw someone who looked similar to that person. When questioned as to whether the person who shot the victim was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the courtroom, however, Sierra replied \u201c[n]o.\u201d Sierra thereafter acknowledged that he had told members of the office of the state\u2019s attorney that he was afraid and did not want to testify in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The state\u2019s attorney then showed Sierra a document that Sierra identified as the written, signed statement that he had given to the police the day after the shooting. In Sierra\u2019s three page statement, he indicated that he was sure that the photograph that he had selected from an array of fifteen African-American males was the photograph of the person who had shot Horeglad. Sierra also stated that he had identified the car from which the shooter had emerged and, further, that he had \u201cseen that car before in the neighborhood with [the shooter] driving it.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The state sought to introduce the statement as substantive evidence under <em>Whelan </em>and the defendant objected. The trial court then excused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Outside the presence of the jury, Sierra again identified the document as the statement he had given to the police about the shooting.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Sierra testified that he had signed the statement because it contained \u201cthe questions [the officer] had asked me and I had answered</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">On cross-examination, however, Sierra gave other reasons for why he had signed the statement. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>cally, he indicated that he felt pressure to do so because the interviewing officer had led him to believe that they would not return his parents\u2019 car, which had been seized after the shooting, until he gave the statement. Sierra further testified that he had just glanced at the statement before signing it, and that certain things that he had told the officer were not contained therein. Sierra also claimed that he was under the influence of heroin and crack cocaine when he signed the statement. In addition, Sierra testified that the officer had offered to help him with a narcotics case that was pending against him when he made the statement, and that those charges later were nolled when he returned to court. Finally, Sierra stated that the police had repeatedly asked him to look at the photographic array, and that he eventually had selected the defendant\u2019s photograph \u201cto get them off [his] back.\u201d During the course of his cross-examination, however, Sierra also testified that he had signed the statement because it accurately reflected his answers, that he had read each and every question and answer contained in the statement and that he had signed the statement knowingly and voluntarily and with an understanding of the questions and answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Donald A. Jacques, a Bridgeport police detective, also testified outside the presence of the jury. Jacques stated that Sierra had spoken to the police on the day of the shooting and, after learning of further information that implicated the defendant, Jacques and Sergeant Paul Carlson went to Sierra\u2019s home the day after the shooting. At that time, Sierra was shown a photographic array and asked whether the shooter\u2019s photograph was contained therein. Sierra, who appeared hesitant and afraid, glanced quickly at the photographic array and asserted that he could not recognize anyone and that he did not want to be involved any further. After a brief discussion with the officers, however, Sierra agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>examine the photographs, and he identified the photograph of the defendant as that of the shooter. Sierra then accompanied the officers to the police station, where he again identified the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">While at the station, Sierra also answered Jacques\u2019 questions regarding the shooting. Thereafter, Sierra signed a written statement containing those questions and answers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> According to Jacques, \u201c[t]here was no pressure put on\u201d Sierra either to identify the defendant as the shooter or to give a statement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Specifically, Jacques testified that Sierra never was told that his parents\u2019 car would be released if he gave a statement; rather, Sierra was informed that the vehicle would be returned after it had been processed by the department\u2019s identification division. Jacques further testified that he was unaware that Sierra had pending narcotics charges. Finally, Jacques stated that Sierra \u201cappeared normal . . . [and] was coherent\u201d when he gave his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"AdP\">Following Jacques\u2019 testimony outside the jury\u2019s presence, the defendant argued that the state should be barred from using Sierra\u2019s statement. Specifically, the defendant maintained that the statement was unreliable because, according to Sierra, he had been pressured into giving it and was under the influence of narcotics when he did so. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, finding the \u201ccircumstances under which the statement was taken and the identification of the photographs to be reliable.\u201d The court also indicated that the credibility of Sierra\u2019s trial testimony and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>prior written statement ultimately was a determination to be made by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim by noting that, prior to 1986, we had adhered to the \u201ctraditional view that a prior inconsistent statement of a nonparty witness is inadmissible hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein and, therefore, is admissible only for impeachment purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>222 Conn. 117, 122-23, 609 A.2d 236 (1992). \u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>[supra, 200 Conn. 743, however] ... we carefully considered the rationale for the common law prohibition on the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements and the criticisms of that rule. We noted that [t]he logic of [the] orthodox rule is that the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is too unreliable to be admitted as substantive evidence because the declarant was not (1) under oath and subject to punishment for perjury, (2) in the presence of the trier of fact, or (3) subject to cross-examination. [Id.], 749. We acknowledged, however, the view of many scholars and commentators that the oath is not as strong a guaranty of trustworthiness as it once may have been, and that the requirements that the jury observe the declarant and that the defendant have the opportunity to cross-examine are met when the declarant takes the stand and is subject to cross-examination. . . . [Id.], 749-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201cFurther, we agreed with several commentators that when the declarant is available for cross-examination the jury has the opportunity to observe him as he repudiates or varies his former statement. The cross-examination to which a recanting witness will be subjected is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>likely to be meaningful because the witness will be forced either to explain the discrepancies between the earlier statements and his present testimony, or to deny that the earlier statement was made at all. If, from all that the jury sees of the witness, [it] conclude [s] that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, [it is] none the less deciding from what [it] see[s] and hear[s] of that person and in court. . . . The jury can, therefore, determine whether to believe the present testimony, the prior statement, or neither. . . . Id., 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cWe concluded that the prevailing reasons for refusing to allow any prior inconsistent statement to be used as substantive evidence are no longer valid; id., 752; and that an exception to the hearsay rule was appropriate where the statements are made under conditions deemed to render them equal in reliability and trustworthiness to those made under the sanction of an oath and the test of cross-examination. ... Id. In this regard, however, we declined to follow the modem view favoring substantive admissibility for all prior inconsistent statements where the [declarant] is in court and subject to cross-examination, concluding that certain additional criteria of admissibility were appropriate to ensure the reliability of such statements for substantive use. Id. Noting the many hazards associated with the reporting and use of prior oral statements; see id., 753-54; we adopted a rale allowing the substantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. Id., 753.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 601-603, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). In refusing to adopt a broader hearsay exception applicable to all prior inconsistent statements, we expressly noted that \u201c[t]he hazard of error is greatly lessened with respect to prior inconsistent written statements signed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>declarant\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753-54; and indicated that, in such circumstances, \u201cthe likelihood of fabrication is slight and the risk of coercion, influence or deception is greatly reduced.\u201d Id., 753. Thus, \u201c[w]hile we noted that the requirement that prior statements be written and signed is not an absolute guaranty of reliability, it does provide significant assurance of an accurate rendition of the statement and that the declarant realized it would be relied upon. Id., 754.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>221 Conn. 93, 100, 602 A.2d 581 (1992); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>241 Conn. 502, 508, 699 A.2d 872 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The defendant concedes that Sierra\u2019s statement satisfies the four <em>Whelan </em>requirements, namely, that: (1) the prior inconsistent statement was in writing; (2) Sierra signed the statement; (3) Sierra had personal knowledge of the facts contained in the statement; and (4) Sierra testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753. The defendant, however, claims that the trial court improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>erly concluded that Sierra\u2019s statement was sufficiently reliable to be used by the state as substantive evidence under <em>Whelan. </em>We disagree. Moreover, we believe that the defendant\u2019s argument reflects a fundamental mis-perception of the thrust of <em>Whelan </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In <em>Whelan, </em>we carved out a hearsay exception for a relatively narrow category of prior inconsistent statements. As discussed previously, we carefully limited the exception to those prior statements that carry such substantial indicia of reliability as to warrant their substantive admissibility. As with any statement that is admitted into evidence under a hearsay exception, a statement that satisfies the <em>Whelan </em>criteria may or may not be true <em>in fact. </em>But, as with any other statement that qualifies under a hearsay exception, it nevertheless is admissible to establish the truth of the matter asserted because it falls within a class of hearsay evidence that has been deemed sufficiently trustworthy to merit such treatment. Thus, as with all other admissible nonhearsay evidence, we allow the fact finder to determine whether the hearsay statement is credible upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances. Consequently, once the proponent of a prior inconsistent statement has established that the statement satisfies the requirements of <em>Whelan, </em>that statement, like statements satisfying the requirements of other hearsay exceptions, is presumptively admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Of course, a prior inconsistent statement that fulfills the <em>Whelan </em>requirements may have been made under circumstances so unduly coercive or extreme as to grievously undermine the reliability generally inherent in such a statement, so as to render it, in effect, not that of the witness. In such circumstances, the trial court must act as a gatekeeper to ensure that the statement does not go to the jury for substantive purposes. We emphasize, however, that the linchpin of admissibility is reliability: the statement may be excluded as sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>stantive evidence only if the trial court is persuaded, in light of the circumstances under which the statement was made, that the statement is so untrustworthy that its admission into evidence would subvert the fairness of the fact-finding process.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the absence of such a showing by the party seeking to exclude a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>criteria,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the statement is admissible as substantive evidence;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> like all other evidence, its credibility is grist for the cross-examination mill. Thus, because the requirements that we established in <em>Whelan </em>provide a significant assurance of reliability,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it will be the highly unusual case in which a statement that meets the <em>Whelan </em>requirements nevertheless must be kept from the jury.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>This case clearly is not such a case. Sierra testified that he signed his statement to the police after reading it and finding it to be true. Jacques testified that there was no improper pressure placed on Sierra to make either the statement or the identification and, further, that Sierra was coherent and acted normally when the statement was made. Thus, the trial court properly concluded that Sierra\u2019s assertions that he was under the influence of narcotics and felt pressured by the police to make both the statement and the identification were \u201crelevant and proper matters for cross-examination . . . [that] go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 125. We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s <em>Whelan </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence in violation of his due process right to a fair trial. We disagree with both of these contentions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The defendant first asserts that the trial court, in its preliminary instructions to the venirepanel from which the jury in this case ultimately was selected, improperly explained the concept of reasonable doubt. Specifically, the defendant challenges the statement of the court that a reasonable doubt is \u201ca doubt for which you can give or assign a reason. Something you can explain to somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We previously have concluded that an instruction describing reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which you can give or assign a reason\u201d \u2014 or an instruction that is substantially similar thereto \u2014 does not diminish the state\u2019s burden of proof when considered in the context of the charge as a whole.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 705, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 254 n.22, 645 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 353-54 &amp; n.8, 622 A.2d 1014 (1993). Although we have disapproved of language providing that reasonable doubt is a doubt that a juror can \u201cexplain\u201d; e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>220 Conn. 698, 719, 601 A.2d 993 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1224, 112 S.

Ed. 2d 909 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>218 Conn. 447, 457, 590 A.2d 106 (1991); we also have held that the use of such language does \u201cnot render an otherwise adequate instruction on reasonable doubt constitutionally defective.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>supra, 719. Because our review of the trial court\u2019s preliminary and final jury instructions on reasonable doubt reveals that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>instructions otherwise were accurate in all respects, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim of a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The defendant also challenges the following portion of the trial court\u2019s final instructions: \u201cIt is the sworn duty of the courts and the jurors to safeguard the rights of persons charged of a crime by respecting the presumption of innocence which the law gives every person so charged, <em>but the law is made to protect society and those whose guilt has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and not to protect those whose guilt has been so </em>established.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant contends that this instruction, which was contained in the court\u2019s thorough charge on reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence, impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 635 A.2d 762 (1993), we considered a claim that the following language, contained in the court\u2019s jury instructions on reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence, was improper: \u201cBut the law is made to protect society and innocent persons, and not to protect guilty ones.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 135. We rejected the defendant\u2019s claim, concluding that the challenged language was not likely to have been misleading in view of the context in which that particular language appeared in the court\u2019s charge.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> See id., 135-36 &amp; n.19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>We nevertheless indicated that \u201cbecause of the possibility that a juror might hear the language differently, and might be given to understand from it that only innocent persons should be acquitted, we suggest that either: (1) the challenged sentence be omitted;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> or (2) it be modified to provide as follows: <em>\u2018But the law is made to protect society and persons whose guilt has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt, and not to protect those whose guilt has been so established. </em>\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 136 n.19. This suggested alternative language is virtually identical to the language that the trial court used in this case.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We are satisfied that this language fully comports with the protections guaranteed by the standard of reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence, and the defendant makes no persuasive argument to the contrary.

See, <em>e.g., Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358-59, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991); <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 96-98. Pursuant to this court\u2019s supervisory authority over the administration of justice, we have eliminated the requirement, contained in the first step of this process, that the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory chaEenge estabEsh a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 646 <em>&amp; </em>n.4, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S.

The defendant raises no claim regarding the state\u2019s effort to strike M.B. apart, from the contention that the trial court\u2019s alleged finding of pretext in connection with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s explanation for challenging M.B. required the court, sua sponte, to reconsider its earlier rejection of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge against J.J.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> In fact, our review of the record indicates that the trial court\u2019s rejection of the state\u2019s peremptory challenge against M.B. was predicated upon an improper application of <em>Batson. </em>Specifically, the reasons advanced by the state's attorney for seeking to strike M.B. \u2014 primarily M.B.\u2019s educational background and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s difficulty in communicating with her\u2014 were race neutral. Moreover, the court expressly found that the state\u2019s attorney sincerely believed that those reasons provided a proper basis upon which to strike M.B. from the jury panel, and, furthermore, that the state\u2019s attorney was \u201centitled to believe\u201d the proffered reasons. Nevertheless, the trial court indicated that, in its view, the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney were not, in fact, supported by M.B.\u2019s responses. Consequently, the trial court reluctantly concluded that the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge against M.B. was impermissible. The trial court, therefore, employed a standard that was overly demanding of the state. The question for the trial court was whether the state\u2019s articulated reasons were preferir\u00eda/,, <em>not whether the trial court deemed the reasons to he adequately supported by the record.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Therefore, because the record clearly indicates that the trial court did not believe that the state\u2019s motive in seeking to exercise a peremptory challenge against M.B. was based on M.B.\u2019s race, it appears that the trial court improperly sustained the defendant\u2019s claim regarding that challenge. We need not base our determination of this issue on the court\u2019s erroneous application of <em>Batson, </em>however, because we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to the relief that he seeks, even if we assume, arguendo, that the state sought to exercise a peremptory challenge against M.B. in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Batson </em>and its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> The trial court informed the parties that it did not intend to question the jurors specifically about the subject matter of J.D.\u2019s report to the court.

If such a showing has been made \u2014 and we leave the methods and contours of such a showing to the discretion of the trial court \u2014 the court should then hold a hearing to determine the truth of those facts and whether they do, in fact, grievously undermine the reliability of the statement. The ultimate question for the trial court, therefore, is whether, notwithstanding the statement\u2019s satisfaction of the <em>Whelan </em>requirements, the circumstances under which the statement was made nonetheless render it so unreliable that a jury should not be permitted to consider it for substantive purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> Of course, a <em>Whelan </em>statement is subject to the rules governing all other evidence, and may be excluded if it is irrelevant, cumulative or the like.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> As we previously have noted, statements that comply with the <em>Whelan </em>criteria generally \u201cprovid[e] a reasonable assurance of reliability\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 153, 159, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993); and, therefore, \u201cshould be admitted <em>to advance the truth finding function of the jury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)

We agree with the state that it has a strong and legitimate interest in having the jury apprised that it is not free to reject the court\u2019s instructions and, furthermore, that the jury is equally obligated to acquit those whose guilt the state has not established beyond a reasonable doubt and to convict those whose guilt has been so proven. However, the decision whether to convey these principles by using the language that we approved in <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 136 n.19, as the trial judge did in this case, is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
