The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of guilty rendered by the trial court, which had denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and this court granted his petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the defendant knowingly had entered a guilty plea to murder where the trial court failed to inform him, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a (b) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>be statutorily ineligible for parole as a consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>pleading guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>249 Com. 922, 733 A.2d 234 (1999). The defendant claims that statutory ineligibility for parole is a direct consequence of a guilty plea, and, therefore, that the trial court was required to inform him of that fact during the plea canvass in order for his waiver of his constitutional rights, which is implicit in a guilty plea, to be knowing and voluntary. The state argues that statutory ineligibility for parole is a consequence collateral to a guilty plea, and, therefore, that the trial court had no such duty. We agree with the state and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The facts and procedural history of this case as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court are as follows: \u201cOriginally, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and to two additional charges involving his possession and use of a firearm. After a jury had been selected, the trial began on September 4,1996. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the testimony of an eyewitness who identified the defendant as the person who had shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u201cOn the following day, the defendant agreed to plead guilty to the murder charge and the state agreed not to prosecute the other two charges. Before accepting the guilty plea, the trial court canvassed the defendant in accordance with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 through 713, now \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 through 39-21. The defendant\u2019s responses to the court\u2019s inquiries disclosed that he was thirty years of age and a high school graduate who had attended college for one year. He had discussed the murder charge and the evidence against him with his attorney and was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s services. He was not mder the influence of alcohol, drugs or any medication and he mderstood that murder was a class A felony that carried a maximum sentence of sixty years and a minimum sentence of twenty-five years with a maximum fine of $20,000. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing the canvass, the defendant said that he realized he was waiving various constitutional rights related to a criminal trial by pleading guilty, but, nevertheless, was pleading guilty voluntarily without any force or threats by other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201cThe court informed the defendant that, after discussing the case with the prosecutor and defense counsel, it was prepared to impose a sentence of thirty-three years for the crime that the defendant had committed. The court asked the defendant whether he wanted to plead guilty to murder when the sentence indicated was thirty-three years. The defendant answered yes. The court then proceeded to accept the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cOn December 3, 1996, before the sentencing proceeding, the defendant filed a written motion to withdraw his guilty plea, alleging that the plea was made unknowingly and involuntarily. Previously, in a brief letter received by the clerk\u2019s office on October 18,1996, the defendant had claimed that the trial court did not canvass him properly on an unspecified critical element of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u201cOn January 9,1997, there was an evidentiary hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. The only witness presented was the defendant, who testified that he did not understand the consequences of his plea when the trial court questioned him during the plea acceptance proceeding. He claimed that he was then under the impression that he would have to serve only eight to fifteen years of his thirty-three year sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also testified that his plea was not voluntary because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>his trial attorney had pressured him into pleading guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After Ustening to the arguments of the state\u2019s attorney and the defendant\u2019s new counsel, the court reviewed the transcript of the plea canvass and denied the motion to withdraw the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. The court then sentenced the defendant to thirty-three years imprisonment as agreed at the time that his guilty plea was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u201cOn appeal [to the Appellate Court and in the certified appeal to this court], the defendant claims that the trial court should have permitted him to withdraw his plea in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 721 (2)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because of his mistaken belief that the thirty-three year sentence would result in only eight to fifteen years of actual imprisonment. He maintains that the court should have informed him that he would not be eligible for parole because \u00a7 54-125a (b) (1) provides that persons convicted of murder as defined in \u00a7 53a-54a are ineligible for parole.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>53 Conn. App. 90, 91-94, 729 A.2d 232 (1999). The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court has no duty to advise a defendant of his statutory parole ineligibility during a plea canvass and, accordingly, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 97-98. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We first address the law governing guilty pleas. \u201cIt is axiomatic that unless a plea of guilty is made know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>ingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>[182 Conn. 353, 356, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 340, 387 A.2d 550 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>170 Conn. 469, 473, 365 A.2d 1100 (1976). A plea of guilty is, in effect, a conviction, the equivalent of a guilty verdict by a jury. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 345; <em>State </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>supra, 473. In choosing to plead guilty, the defendant is waiving several constitutional rights, including his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 466. These considerations demand the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and its consequences. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243-44. We therefore require the record affirmatively to disclose that the defendant\u2019s choice was made intelligently and voluntarily. [Id.], 242; <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>supra, 356; <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 373, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119-20, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201c[A] plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper as having no proper relationship to the prosecutor\u2019s business (e.g. bribes).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.

Those rules provide that the trial court must not accept a guilty plea without first addressing the defendant personally in open court and determining that the defendant fully understands the items enumerated in \u00a7 39-19, and that the plea is made voluntarily pursuant to \u00a7 39-20. \u201cThere is no requirement, however, that the defendant be advised of every possible consequence of such a plea.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 383, 521 A.2d 547 (1987). \u201cAlthough a defendant must be aware of the direct consequences of a plea, the scope of \u2018direct consequences\u2019 is very narrow. J. Bond, Plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Bargaining and the Guilty Plea (2d Ed.) \u00a7 3.38. In Connecticut, the direct consequences of a defendant\u2019s plea include only the mandatory minimum and maximum possible sentences; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (2) and (4)]; the maximum possible consecutive sentence; Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)]; the possibility of additional punishment imposed because of previous conviction(s); Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (4)]; and the fact that the particular offense does not permit a sentence to be suspended. Practice Book \u00a7 [39-19 (3)]; cf. J. Bond, supra [\u00a7 3.38], The failure to inform a defendant as to all possible indirect and collateral consequences does not render a plea unintelligent or involuntary in a constitutional sense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 383 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 [39-27] specifies circumstances under which a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea after it has been entered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2018[0]nce entered, a guilty plea cannot be withdrawn except by leave of the court, within its sound discretion, and a denial thereof is reversible only if it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 23, 355 A.2d 49 (1974). \u2018The burden is always on the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>dant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>169 Conn. 38, 46, 362 A.2d 499 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>210 Conn. 304, 308-309, 554 A.2d 1074 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The defendant, relying on <em>Cuthrell v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>475 F.2d 1364 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1005, 94 S. Ct. 362, 38 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1973), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit characterized direct consequences as having a \u201cdefinite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment\u201d; id., 1366; claims that statutory parole ineligibility is a direct consequence of a guilty plea, and that the trial court was therefore obligated to advise him at the plea canvass that he would be ineligible for parole. The defendant further argues that this court should apply a Cuthrell-type analysis instead of applying <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 369, in which this court determined that the only direct consequences of a guilty plea are those enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19. Id., 383 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In support of his argument, the defendant claims that Connecticut courts have applied a Cuthrell-type standard in a number of <em>post-Gilnite </em>cases. Specifically, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 160-61, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) (discussing whether removal of revocation of probation from defendant\u2019s criminal record is direct or collateral consequence for purposes of determining mootness of appeal); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>36 Conn. App. 695, 707, 652 A.2d 1050, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 912, 659 A.2d 183 (1995) (recognizing that \u201c \u2018[d]irect consequences have' definite, immediate and largely automatic effects\u2019 \u201d on range of punishment, and holding that sentence credits do not meet criteria); <em>Falby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>32 Conn. App. 438, 444-45, 629 A.2d 1154, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 927, 632 A.2d 703 (1993) (recognizing that \u201c[d]irect consequences have definite, immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and largely automatic effects\u201d on range of punishment, and holding that misinformation regarding form of parole hearing does not meet criteria); and <em>Sherbo </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>21 Conn. App. 172, 182 n.7, 572 A.2d 378, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 808, 809, 576 A.2d 539, 540 (1990) (applying <em>Cuthrell </em>test, and holding that procedure for commitment to Whiting Forensic Institute does not meet criteria). Those cases, however, do not support the defendant\u2019s argument that Connecticut courts have used a Cuthrell-type analysis to expand the universe of direct consequences of a guilty plea beyond those enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19. Although the cases discuss the distinction between direct and collateral consequences, rather than directly applying a strict <em>Gilnite </em>analysis, none of them holds that there are direct consequences to a guilty plea other than those enumerated in \u00a7 39-19. Indeed, in <em>Falby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 445, the Appellate Court, citing <em>Sherbo </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 181, recognized that \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 [39-19] <em>defines </em>the direct consequences\u201d for purposes of determining the validity of a guilty plea. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We conclude that <em>Gilnite </em>is not inconsistent with a Cuthrell-type analysis. Rather, <em>Gilnite </em>stands for the proposition that Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 defines the scope of the <em>Boykin </em>constitutional mandate that a defendant be advised of all direct consequences of his plea, while the <em>Cuthrell </em>standard simply enumerates several characteristics of those direct consequences. Thus, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, our case law clearly and consistently has limited the direct consequences of a guilty plea to those consequences enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The defendant argues, however, that, even if we have not held previously that there are direct consequences beyond those enumerated in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19, our case law implicitly requires statutory parole ineligibility to be treated as a direct consequence of a guilty plea. Specifically, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>176 Conn. 7, 404 A.2d 871 (1978) <em>(Collins </em>I), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 590 <em>(Collins II). </em>In <em>Collins I, </em>the defendant was not informed until his sentencing that the sentence for the offenses to which he pleaded guilty would ran consecutively to other sentences that he was serving. When the defendant learned that the sentences would be consecutive, he attempted to withdraw his plea. The trial court refused to allow the withdrawal. This court found that \u201cthe length of time a defendant may have to spend in prison is clearly crucial to a decision of whether or not to plead guilty.\u201d Id., 9-10. Because the defendant could not have known that the sentences were to run consecutively, we found that the plea had not been made intelligently. Therefore, we held that trial court\u2019s refusal to allow withdrawal of the plea was a denial of due process. Id., 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The defendant argues that, under <em>Collins I, </em>the trial court is required to inform the defendant of <em>any </em>consequences of a guilty plea that affect the time he will have to spend in prison. We disagree. We conclude, rather, that <em>Collins I </em>simply discusses the need for a plea to be knowing and voluntary, which is the rationale underlying the requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 (4) that the court ensure that the defendant understands \u201cthe maximum sentence possible from <em>consecutive senten</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>ces </em>and including, when applicable, the fact that a different or additional punishment may be authorized by reason of a previous conviction . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Therefore, <em>Collins I </em>does not stand for the proposition that the trial court must advise the defendant of any consequence to a plea that may increase the actual time he will spend in prison.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In <em>Collins II, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 590, the defendant claimed that his attorney incorrectly had informed him about the period of actual incarceration that would result from the maximum sentence imposed on him. Id., 598. This court held that the claim raised \u201clegitimate concerns that the defendant did not fully understand the consequences of his guilty pleas\u201d; id., 598-99; and we remanded the case for a factual hearing on the issue of whether the defendant would have entered the guilty pleas had he been accurately informed. Id., 599. We conclude that there is a material difference between a defendant\u2019s being misinformed, as was the case in <em>Collins II, </em>and his making unfounded assumptions, as the defendant did in this case. \u201cThe requirement that a plea be intelligently and voluntarily made does not impose upon the trial judge a duty to discover and dispel any unexpressed misapprehensions that may be harbored by a defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Egeler, </em>563 F.2d 796, 800 (6th Cir. 1977). Accordingly, we conclude that neither <em>Collins I </em>nor <em>Collins II </em>supports the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court has a duty to advise a defendant that his conviction will make him ineligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The defendant also argues that, in this case, the Appellate Court should not have relied on federal precedent holding that parole eligibility is not a direct consequence of a guilty plea. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 95, citing <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985) (recognizing that United States Supreme Court has never held that federal constitution requires state to furnish defendant with information about parole eligibility); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Posner, </em>865 F.2d 654, 660 (5th Cir. 1989) (trial court need not advise defendant that he was ineligible for parole); <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>616 F.2d 55, 61 (2d Cir. 1980) (federal constitution does not require state court to inform defendant of minimum portion of sentence he may be required to serve); <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Egeler, </em>supra, 563 F.2d 801 (federal constitution does not require state court to advise defendant that he will be ineligible for parole). The defendant argues that the rulings in <em>Armstrong </em>and <em>Posner </em>fail to recognize that statutory ineligibility for parole should not be treated the same way as parole eligibility for <em>Boykin </em>purposes, because the rationale for characterizing parole eligibility as a collateral consequence is that parole decisions are within the discretion of the parole board and are exceedingly complex. Therefore, it would be infeasible and undesirable for the trial court to attempt to advise a defendant of the rules governing parole decisions at a plea canvass. See Proposed Amendments to Criminal Rules, Advisory Committee Note, 52 F.R.D. 409, 422 (1971) (stating that \u201ccertain consequences of a plea of guilty, such as parole eligibility, may be so complicated that it is not feasible to expect a judge to clearly advise the defendant\u201d). Because statutory parole ineligibility is nondiscretionary and automatic, the defendant argues, that rationale is inapplicable in this case. The defendant further argues that the majority of federal circuit courts of appeal that have considered the issue have ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>statutory parole ineligibility is a direct consequence of a guilty plea, and he urges this court to follow those cases. See <em>Bye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 F.2d 177, 179 (2d Cir. 1970), and cases cited therein. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Bye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 435 F.2d 177, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that, under rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended effective July 1, 1966, the trial court must advise a defendant of his ineligibility for parole. The applicable version of rule 11 provided that the court shall not accept a guilty plea \u201c \u2018without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 179. Rule 11 was amended in 1975 to clarify \u201cthat a defendant need be informed of only two sentencing consequences: \u2018the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>supra, 616 F.2d 60. The advisory committee notes to the proposed amendment specifically provide that the amended rule would not require the trial court to inform the defendant of either his eligibility or his ineligibility for parole. Proposed Amendments to Criminal Rules, Advisory Committee Note, supra, 52 F.R.D. 421-22; see also 3 A.B.A., Standards for Criminal Justice (2d Ed. 1980) c. 14, standard 14-1.4 (a) (ii) n.14, p.14-24 (\u201c[presently, Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (c) does not require that prior to entry of a guilty plea the defendant be advised that the sentence may make the defendant ineligible for parole\u201d). Accordingly, the court in <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>supra, 61, held that, under the amended rule, the trial court was <em>not </em>required to advise the defendant of the minimum portion of the sentence that he actually would be required to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>We therefore agree with the Appellate Court that <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>supra, 616 F.2d 55, effectively overruled Bye; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 95 n.7; and conclude that the <em>Bye </em>line of cases relied on by the defendant was superseded by the 1975 amendment to rule 11. It is therefore clear that those cases were decided on the basis of the language of rule 11, not on the requirements of the constitution. See <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>supra, 60-61; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Egeler, </em>supra, 563 F.2d 800 (recognizing that rule 11 may require trial court to advise defendant of parole ineligibility, but noting that federal rule does not apply to states). Therefore, those cases are of limited persuasive value in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Moreover, a number of federal courts of appeal ruled that, even before the 1975 amendment, rule 11, and, by implication, the constitution, did not require the trial court to advise a defendant of parole ineligibility. See <em>Trujillo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 F.2d 266 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 899, 88 S. Ct. 224, 19 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1967); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1963). The reasoning of those courts was \u201cthat eligibility for parole is not a \u2018consequence\u2019 of a plea of guilty, but a matter of legislative grace. It is equally true that non-eligibility for parole is not a \u2018consequence\u2019 of a plea of guilty . . . rather, it is a consequence of the withholding of legislative grace.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 441; see also <em>Trujillo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 269. This conclusion is consistent with our conclusion that, under both a Cuthrell-type analysis and under <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 369, statutory parole ineligibility is not a direct consequence of a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that due process does not require a trial court to advise the defendant of his statutory parole ineligibility during a plea canvass. We recognize, as the defendant points out, that statutory parole ineligibility affects the amount of time that the defendant actually will spend in prison, and, unlike parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>eligibility, is neither complex nor dependent on the discretion of the parole board. It does not follow, however, that statutory parole ineligibility is covered by the <em>Boykin </em>constitutional mandate. \u201c[Nowhere] <em>in Boykin </em>does it appear that a precise knowledge of all of the penal ramifications [of a guilty plea] rises to the quality of a constitutional requirement.\u201d <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Egeler, </em>supra, 563 F.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The trial court advised the defendant at his plea canvass of the sentence that it intended to impose. The record does not indicate that either the trial court or the defendant\u2019s attorney suggested to the defendant that he would be eligible for parole. Rather, the defendant simply assumed that he would be eligible. The trial court has no constitutional obligation to discover and dispel such unfounded assumptions. See id., 800. Our cases have not identified any direct consequences of a guilty plea beyond those identified in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19. Furthermore, we are persuaded by the federal cases holding that statutory parole ineligibility is not a direct consequence of a guilty plea, but is, rather, \u201ca consequence of the withholding of legislative grace.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 324 F.2d 441; see also <em>Trujillo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 377 F.2d 269. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary and intelligent in a constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The defendant finally argues that, even if such advice is not constitutionally required, this court should invoke its supervisory authority to direct the trial courts to advise defendants of their statutory parole ineligibility. Because we are persuaded by the reasoning of the federal cases holding that trial courts need not advise defendants of their ineligibility for parole, we decline to engage in such an extraordinary exercise of our authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">We conclude that neither constitutional due process nor Connecticut\u2019s rules of criminal procedure requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>a trial court to advise a defendant of his statutory parole ineligibility at a plea canvass.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a provides: \u201c(a) A person convicted of one or more crimes who is incarcerated on or after October 1, 1990, who received a definite sentence or aggregate sentence of more than two years, and who has been confined under such sentence or sentences for not less than one-half of the aggregate sentence or one-half of the most recent sentence imposed by the court, whichever is greater, may be allowed to go at large on parole in the discretion of the panel of the Board of Parole for the institution in which the person is confined, if (1) it appears from all available information, including any reports from the Commissioner of Correction that the panel may require, that there is reasonable probability that such inmate will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and (2) such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>release is not incompatible with the welfare of society. At the discretion of the panel, and under the terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the panel including requiring the parolee to submit personal reports, the parolee shall be allowed to return to his home or to reside in a residential community center, or to go elsewhere. The parolee shall, while on parole, remain in the legal custody and control of the board until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.

(2) A person convicted of an offense, other than an offense specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection, where the underlying facts and circumstances of the offense involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person shall be ineligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section until such person has served not less than eighty-five per cent of the definite sentence imposed. (3) No person convicted of any other offense for which there is a mandatory minimum sentence which may not be suspended or reduced by the court shall be eligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section until such person has served such mandatory minimum sentence or fifty per cent of the definite sentence imposed, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u201c(c) The Board of Parole shall, not later than July 1,1996, adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to ensure that a person convicted of an offense described in subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section is not released on parole until such person has served eighty-five per cent of the definite sentence imposed by the court.
