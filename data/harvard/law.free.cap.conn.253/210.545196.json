The defendant, Victor Velasco, was charged with the crimes of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also was charged under \u00a7 53-2021c with committing robbery in the first degree with a firearm. Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty on the first two counts. The trial court rendered judgment and sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of sixty years on the felony murder conviction, execution suspended after fifty years, and a twenty year concurrent term of imprisonment on the conspiracy conviction. The trial court then determined, from the evidence presented at trial, that the defendant had used a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k. Accordingly, the trial court also imposed a five year sentence to run consecutively with the other sentences for the conviction under \u00a7 53-202k.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant raises several issues on appeal. First, the defendant claims that because \u00a7 53-202k extends the maximum punishment beyond that which might otherwise be imposed upon conviction of an underlying class A, B or C felony, due process requires that the dispositive question of whether he used a firearm in the proscribed manner must be submitted to a jury. He claims further that, irrespective of whether due process safeguards apply to sentence enhancement statutes, the legislature did not intend for the ultimate factual question under \u00a7 53-202k to be determined by the court. Second, the defendant claims that the trial judge\u2019s ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>tioning of several witnesses, including the defendant himself, deprived him of a fair trial as guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 19,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution. Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the reasonable doubt standard improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We conclude that neither the trial court\u2019s questioning of witnesses nor its instruction on reasonable doubt was improper. Because we agree with the defendant, however, that when an accused is convicted by a jury of an underlying felony, the question of whether the accused used a proscribed firearm in the commission of that felony must also be decided by the jury, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s five year consecutive sentence under \u00a7 53-202k must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 10:45 p.m. on December 19, 1996, the defendant and another individual entered Maria\u2019s Variety Store in Bridgeport. The two men robbed the store, and one of them shot and killed the owner, Fernando Reis. Several eyewitnesses identified the defendant as one of the assailants who had robbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the store. One witness, Kathryn Curwen, had been standing by the cash register talking with Reis when the defendant and another male, both dressed in black and wearing ski masks, entered the store. According to Curwen, one of the assailants wore a jacket with a black and gold emblem that read \u201cBillion Bay,\u201d the same type of jacket that police later seized from the defendant. Both men were armed, and the defendant waved Curwen back by brandishing a handgun. Curwen heard one of the two men demand money and then heard a gunshot, but she did not see who had fired the shot. Thereafter, the taller of the two assailants put a nine millimeter gun to Curwen\u2019s head when a second customer refused to comply with his demand to retreat to the back of the store. After the assailants fled, Cur-wen called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Officer Richard Mercado of the Bridgeport police department was patrolling the area on the night of the crime when he observed the defendant walking in the general vicinity of the variety store. The defendant matched the description of the suspect that had been broadcast over Mercado\u2019s police radio. Mercado detained the defendant and informed him that he was a suspect. The defendant denied any involvement in the shooting, but acknowledged that he was a member of the Latin Kings street gang. When the defendant was returned to the scene of the crime, Curwen identified him as one of the assailants. Three days later, Curwen singled out the defendant from a photographic array of eight potential suspects, each with black masks drawn over their eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Jennifer O\u2019Neill, another eyewitness, saw the defendant with another male outside of the store minutes before the shooting. She had stopped at the store to purchase some household items when she noticed two occupants \u201chunched up\u201d in the back seat of a vehicle parked directly behind hers. Both individuals looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>up as she passed the vehicle and she was able to see their faces. As she was returning to her car, she was startled by a popping noise, and turned to see two people dressed in dark clothing and wearing hoods standing by the cash register inside the store. She also observed that the two individuals whom she had noticed minutes earlier were no longer in the vehicle. She did not learn until the next morning that Reis had been murdered. On December 29,1996, O\u2019Neill identified the defendant from a photographic array as one of the individuals in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Frank Santos was working in the store on the night of the robbery. He did not notice that two men had entered the store until he heard a gunshot, at which point he fell to the floor to avoid detection. The taller of the two assailants discovered Santos, put a gun to his head, and moved him to the back of the store, while the other assailant stuffed a bag with money from the cash register. As to his emotional state throughout the incident, Santos acknowledged that he was a \u201cmanic depressive\u201d who \u201cstarted seeing flashes [and] got real scared.\u201d He was \u201cupset,\u201d \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201ccrying\u201d throughout the episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">According to Santos, the shooter was \u201ca pretty big guy,\u201d about 185 pounds and about six feet tall. He was able to recall \u201cthe bigger guy\u201d because of his eyes. The accomplice had a smaller build, with \u201cbraids or something sticking out of the hat . . . .\u201d Both the shooter and his accomplice had worn black ski masks at the time of the robbery. When the police brought the defendant back to the scene, Santos could not identify the defendant as one of the perpetrators. He cautioned, however, that \u201cI really can\u2019t say because they had ski masks on and everything . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In addition to these eyewitnesses, Nadine Huertas, a longtime Mend of both Reis and the defendant, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>seen the defendant at some point in November, 1995, with a handgun similar to the one Curwen had described as having been used during the shooting. According to Huertas, when she told the defendant that Reis had spoken harshly about him, the defendant threatened to \u201cleg\u201d Reis, meaning to shoot him in the leg or knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">According to Donald Armatino, Jr., a member of the Latin Kings who had been incarcerated with the defendant while the defendant was awaiting trial, the defendant had bragged about the killing and had given him a map that described the type and location of the gun used in the shooting. Armatino had turned the map over to the state police, who later located the gun by following the map to the stairwell of a house in Bridgeport. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court related its understanding as to the \u00a7 53-202k charge. Specifically, the trial court stated that because the statute is a sentence enhancement provision, and sentencing is a judicial function, the court alone should deal with the issue of whether a gun had been utilized in the manner charged. Accordingly, the court removed the third count of the information from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first two counts of felony murder and conspiracy. At the sentencing proceeding, the court determined that, on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had in fact committed the underlying felony by use of a proscribed firearm. Accordingly, the court sentenced the defendant, in addition to a sixty year term on the felony murder conviction, with execution suspended after fifty years, and a concurrent twenty year term on the conspiracy conviction, to a mandatory consecutive five year sentence pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court, in finding that he had used a firearm in the commission of the underlying felony, violated his federal <em>and state </em>constitutional rights, namely, his due process right to a trial by jury as guaranteed under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of the Connecticut constitution. Alternatively, the defendant claims that the trial court misinterpreted \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state, on the other hand, maintains that because this court has held that \u00a7 53-202k constitutes a sentence enhancement provision, and does not create a separate and distinct crime; see <em>State v. Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 146, 698 A.2d 297 (1997); due process safeguards, including the right to a jury determination of ultimate factual issues, do not apply. Therefore, the state argues, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statute was proper. We agree with the defendant that the trial court misread the legislature\u2019s intent in determining for itself whether the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of the underlying felony, and consequently, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 53-202k must be vacated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Our analysis is governed by well established principles of statutory construction. Statutory construction is a question of law and, therefore, our review is plenary. See id., 146-47. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tory and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 622, 741 A.2d 902 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u201cSeveral additional tenets of statutory construction guide our interpretation of a penal statute. . . . [Criminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 340, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995). . . . [U]nless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 200, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Section 53-202k was enacted \u201cas part of a comprehensive legislative plan for dealing with assault weapons.\u201d Id., 148. It provides for a mandatory five year term of imprisonment whenever a defendant, \u201cin the commission of [any class A, B or C] felony uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of, or displays, or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses any firearm, as defined in section 53a-3 . . . General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. As we stated previously, the five year sentence runs consecutively with, and is in addition to, the sentence imposed for the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The statute does not expressly delegate to the jury the task of determining whether a firearm was used during the commission of an applicable felony. We therefore discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the relevant legislative history, including the statute\u2019s relationship to existing legislation on the fair assumption that the legislature is unlikely to intend any radical departure from well established practice. See <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 461-64, 704 A.2d 222 (1997) (comparison between statutory provisions yields conclusion that individuals can be held personally liable for wage violation under General Statutes \u00a7 31-72); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 150 n.8 (comparing \u00a7 53-202k with persistent offender enhancing provisions in determining that statute does not create substantive crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 150 n.8, we acknowledged that \u00a7 53-202k constitutes a sentence enhancement provision akin to the persistent offender provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>for an enhanced prison term beyond that applicable to the charged offense whenever an accused is found to have been convicted previously of an enumerated crime. With respect to persistent offender statutes, it had long been established prior to the 1993 enactment of \u00a7 53-202k; see Public Acts 1993, No. 93-306, \u00a7 9 (P.A. 93-306); that the task of determining the existence of a designated fact that might compel the imposition of a sentencing term beyond that otherwise applicable to the underlying crime, falls upon the jury. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 171-76, 113 A. 452 (1921), this court stated plainly that in criminal matters involving defendants charged as persistent felony offenders, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and thereby subject to an enhanced sentence, the jury must address two questions. \u201c[F]irst, was the defendant guilty of the crime charged? . . . Second, if guilty, had the defendant . . . been convicted, sentenced and imprisoned? . . . The jury must by their verdict answer each of these issues. . . . [I]f the accused be found guilty on [each] issue . . . then the maximum punishment prescribed by the statute must be the sentence of the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 172-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>We implicitly reaffirmed the principle articulated in <em>Ferrone </em>by holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 287, 542 A.2d 299 (1988), that under the persistent dangerous felony offender provision of \u00a7 53a-40 (a), a trial judge may properly determine the defendant\u2019s prior conviction status only after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to a jury trial by the defendant. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>232 Conn. 455, 475-76, 656 A.2d 646 (1995) (judge determines prior conviction under \u00a7 53a-40 only after defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives jury right). We recognized that in pleading guilty to a persistent offender charge, the accused \u201cwaives several constitutional rights,\u201d including the right to a jury determination of ultimate facts that trigger the enhanced sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 287. Thus, although \u00a7 53a-40 constitutes a sentence enhancement provision, and not an independent criminal offense; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 587, 484 A.2d 435 (1984); the predicate fact of prior conviction must nevertheless be found by a jury before a judge can disregard the applicable ceiling and sentence a defendant to a greater term of years. Whether the accused qualifies as a persistent offender subject to an enhanced penalty upon conviction of a subsequent crime is a question routinely submitted to the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 400, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993) (reviewing adequacy of trial court\u2019s charge wherein jury convicted defendant under persistent serious felony offender statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>46 Conn. App. 131, 132, 698 A.2d 908 (1997) (jury finds defendant guilty under persistent dangerous felony offender statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>39 Conn. App. 789, 790-91, 667 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>1301 (1995) (jury determined that defendant qualified as persistent felony offender subject to enhanced sentence); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>37 Conn. App. 672, 687, 657 A.2d 1115, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 912, 660 A.2d 354 (1995) (jury determined defendant\u2019s persistent offender status upon testimony of correction center\u2019s records clerk); <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>15 Conn. App. 161, 173, 544 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 815, 550 A.2d 1086 (1988) (acknowledging jury\u2019s role in determining existence of prior conviction that triggers enhanced sentence for subsequent conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 150 n.8, \u00a7 53-202k is markedly similar to our persistent felony offender statutes. In specific, both statutes constitute sentence enhancement provisions, the application of which turns on the existence of a predicate fact that does not itself reflect an element of the underlying offense. \u201c[T]he only difference between \u00a7 53-202k and \u00a7 53a-40 is that the former requires proof of the commission of an offense [with a firearm], while the latter requires proof of a prior conviction.\u201d Id. We are persuaded therefore that, in the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, in enacting \u00a7 53-202k, the legislature intended to prescribe procedural safeguards with respect to the identity of the fact finder that are analogous in scope to those that apply to factual determinations made pursuant to \u00a7 53a-40.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The legislative debates surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 53-202k indicate no intention on the part of the General Assembly to deviate from the well established practice of submitting to the jury the ultimate fact that triggers the application of a sentence enhancement statute. As we stated previously in <em>Dash, </em>\u00a7 53-202k represents one component of \u201ca comprehensive legislative plan for dealing with assault weapons.\u201d Id., 148. A major theme of the legislative debates surrounding P.A. 93-306, the precursor to \u00a7 53-202k, was the constitutional implications related to the various provisions of the proposed laws, including the due process right to \u201cfair warning\u201d as it pertains to the implementation of any new criminal law statute; see 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 33, 1993 Sess., pp. 11,706-708, remarks of Representatives Michael P. Lawlor and Richard D. Tulisano; the right to remain free from self-incrimination, as implicated by the proposed certification requirement applicable to preexisting ownership of designated assault weapons; see 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 32, 1993 Sess., pp. 11,624-25, remarks of Representatives Lawlor and Peter Metz; and the right to bear arms under article first, \u00a7 15, of the Connecticut constitution, as implicated by the outright ban on certain high power assault weapons. See 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 33, 1993 Sess., pp. 11,830-35, 11,837, remarks of Representatives Arthur O\u2019Neill and Michael J. Jarjura. In light of this discussion, it is likely that one or more members of the General Assembly would have objected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>had the proposed legislation dispensed with the jury\u2019s role under the firearms enhancement provision. This is especially so given the timing of this debate, which followed decisions by this court discussing the constitutional significance of a defendant\u2019s right to a jury determination of the ultimate fact that triggers an enhanced sentencing term.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Finally, had the legislature intended to dispense with a jury finding under \u00a7 53-202k, that fact would likely have been articulated in the responses to remarks made by Representative Andrew M. Norton. In specific, Norton analogized P.A. 93-306 to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-216 (b), a statute that he claimed was \u201cso little used\u201d as to be virtually ineffective in deterring crime. See id., pp. 11,836-37. Section 53a-216 (b) is a substantive penal statute that classifies the criminal use of a firearm as a class D felony subject to a minimum nonsuspendable five year sentence. As such, that statute entrusts the jury with determining whether a firearm was used in a proscribed manner. Yet, neither Norton, nor the proponents of P.A. 93-306 who responded to his concern, pointed to any procedural distinctions, such as the identify of the fact finder, between prosecuting a crime under \u00a7 53a-216 (b) and seeking an enhanced sentence subsequent to conviction pursuant to P.A. 93-306, now codified at \u00a7 53-202k. Accordingly, in the absence of any discussion regarding the potential diminution of the jury\u2019s fact-finding role, we will not presume that the legislature intended such a result when it enacted \u00a7 53-202k.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Our conclusion that the legislature did not intend to eliminate the role of the jury as fact finder under \u00a7 53-202k is further supported by the fact that other statutes expressly designate when a factual determination is to be made by a judge. For example, the persistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>offender statutes permit the imposition of an enhanced penalty \u201c[w]hen any person <em>[is] found to be </em>a persistent . . . offender, <em>and the court is of the opinion </em>that his history and character and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct indicate that extended incarceration will best serve the public interest. . . (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (f) through (i). The statute thereby identifies those facts that must be evaluated by \u201cthe court,\u201d once the jury finds the triggering fact, that is, a prior conviction. See also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40a (same language identifies fact finder under statute allowing enhanced penalty upon conviction of crime involving bigotry or bias); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40d (utilizing similar language as it pertains to persistent offenders of crimes involving certain designated misdemeanors). The sentencing judge\u2019s authority to find facts is even more clear under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-44, which authorizes the imposition of a discretionary enhanced fine whenever an accused \u201chas gained money or property through the commission of any felony, misdemeanor or violation . . . .\u201d In providing that \u201cthe court shall make a finding as to the amount of the defendant\u2019s gain from the offense,\u201d \u00a7 53a-44 expressly designates the scope of the court\u2019s fact-finding authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We are persuaded that the grant of authority under these statutes for fact-finding by a sentencing judge is indicative of the legislature\u2019s understanding that, except in limited circumstances, the determination of ultimate facts remains the exclusive function of the jury. Had the legislature intended to deviate from that practice in the context of factual determinations made pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, it \u201ceasily could have expressed this intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>241 Conn. 439, 455, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997). In the absence of language to that effect, we are reluctant to interpret \u00a7 53-202k \u201cto the detriment of a criminal defendant in light of the well established rule that penal statutes are to be interpreted strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>against the state.\u201d Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 681, 735 A.2d 267 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cardwell, </em>246 Conn. 721, 739, 718 A.2d 954 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The defendant has challenged the trial court\u2019s authority under both the state and federal constitutions to determine whether he used a firearm in the commission of an underlying felony. This issue, however, has yet to be squarely addressed by applicable precedent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, as stated previously, because our interpretation of \u00a7 53-202k is based on fundamental tenets of statutory construction we need not decide whether, following a jury trial, the defendant is <em>constitutionally </em>entitled to have the jury make the factual determinations required by the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Finally, we must determine whether the court\u2019s improper instructions regarding \u00a7 53-202k were harmless. The state maintains that any impropriety in the trial court\u2019s instructions was harmless because the guilty verdict on the underlying felony necessarily included a finding that a firearm had been used in the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of that felony. In specific, the state contends that, because the evidence produced at trial supported only one cause of death, namely, death by a bullet wound, proof of a violation under \u00a7 53-202k was intertwined with the elements necessary to find the defendant guilty of robbery, and hence felony murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cthe only case you will have is the case of the first and second count in this information. Don\u2019t concern yourself with whether or not it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that this accused utilized a firearm in the commission of either one or both, if you so find. That is no longer a concern. . . . The clerk will only inquire as to the first two counts.\u201d As the defendant correctly pointed out at oral argument in this court, a finding of guilt on those counts was not contingent on the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The first count of the information charged the defendant with felony murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54c. The predicate felony was \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1) or (2). As the trial court correctly instructed the jury, in order to find the defendant guilty of felony murder, the jury must find that during the course of committing a qualifying felony, \u201che <em>or another participant </em>. . . cause[d] the death of [a] person other than one of the participants.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, the underlying felony was first degree robbery. Again, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that a person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when \u201che <em>or another person </em>in the [robbery] causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime, or the participants are armed, <em>one or more, </em>with a deadly weapon.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on felony murder may have been predicated on its finding that a participant to the robbery, other than the defendant, was armed. Therefore, the verdict did not <em>necessarily </em>rest on a finding that the defendant himself was armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The second count of the information charged the defendant with conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-48. Similarly, a finding that the defendant was armed was not indispensable to the guilty verdict returned on the conspiracy count. The trial court correctly charged the jury that a guilty verdict required a finding that the defendant had entered into an agreement intending to commit a crime, and that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement had been undertaken \u201cby <em>any one </em>of those persons [involved in the conspiracy].\u201d (Emphasis added.) As with the felony murder conviction, the conspiracy conviction did not <em>necessarily </em>rest on a finding that the defendant himself was armed. Indeed, the jury properly could have found the defendant guilty of conspiracy upon concluding that he had agreed to commit a robbery, but that only his coconspirator had been armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In his concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Sullivan concludes that the impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because, based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury could not have reached a contrary finding with respect to the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm. In specific, Justice Sullivan contends that the jury reasonably could not have found otherwise because the evidence that the defendant had utilized a firearm in a proscribed maimer was essentially overwhelming and undisputed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">A jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if \u201ca reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 17, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 114 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999). In <em>Neder, </em>the defendant had been charged with, inter alia, filing false federal income tax returns. Id., 6. Specifically, the government alleged that the defendant had neglected to report more than five million dollars of income that he had received from loan proceeds. Id., 6, 16. The defendant challenged the characterization of the proceeds, but never argued that his false statements with respect to those proceeds could be found immaterial. Id., 16-17. At trial, the court failed to submit to the jury the element of materiality with regard to the tax fraud charge. Id., 6. The Supreme Court concluded that this impropriety was harmless because, in that case, \u201c[t]he failure to report such substantial income incontrovertibly established] that [the defendant\u2019s] false statements were material to a determination of his income tax liability.\u201d Id., 16. In other words, because this element was uncontested and the evidence supporting materiality was so overwhelming, the Supreme Court concluded that the omission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 469, 678 A.2d 910 (1996), we held that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on an essential element of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179b, rioting in a correctional institution, constituted harmless error. In <em>Faust, </em>it was undisputed that the incident had taken place at Gamer Correctional Facility (Gamer). Witnesses for both the state and the defense testified, not only that a riot had occurred at Gamer, but that the defendant had been incarcerated at Gamer at the time. Id., 471. Indeed, the defendant himself testified to both of those facts, but asserted only that he was not involved in the incident. Id. In light of that testimony, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the juiy that it need not consider whether Gamer was a correctional institution, if it found that \u201c[the incident] occurred at Garner,\u201d constituted harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>less error. Id., 470. The evidence adduced at trial compelled the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that, \u201cin the absence of the assumed improper instruction, the jury would have concluded that the charged violation of \u00a7 53a-179b had occurred at a correctional institution.\u201d Id., 471.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Unlike the facts of <em>Faust, </em>the evidence in this case that the defendant utilized a firearm in the commission of the underlying felony was neither overwhelming nor uncontested. Unlike <em>Faus t, </em>the defendant\u2019s testimony in this case did not establish the essential element omitted from the trial court\u2019s charge. Nor did the defendant concede that element. On the contrary, by his own testimony, the defendant not only denied any involvement in the shooting, but specifically denied being in possession of a firearm. The defendant specifically stated that, prior to arriving at the convenience store, he had given his gun to another individual in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The defendant\u2019s testimony made the question of whether he utilized a firearm during the course of the robbery a contested issue. That the jury convicted him on both counts of the information means that it obviously concluded that he was involved in the crime. The guilty verdict, however, did not require a finding that he utilized a firearm; it required only a finding that he or another participant was in possession of a gun that was used to kill the victim. Although the jury rejected the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was not involved in the crime, we have no way of knowing whether they concluded that he also was armed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>228 Conn. 281, 309-10, 636 A.2d 351 (1993) (jury can credit part of testimony while rejecting other part). For us to conclude as such would require \u201cspeculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>directed towards making a judgment that the jury has never made . . . .\u201d <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 527 U.S. 38 (Scalia, J., concurring and dissenting). This is particularly true in the present case in light of the trial court\u2019s express instructions to the jury not to consider whether the defendant had been armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Furthermore, although both Curwen and Santos testified to the fact that both perpetrators had been armed, Santos\u2019 testimony established that the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm was not uncontroverted. In specific, when asked whether he could see a gun that the defendant was allegedly carrying, Santos responded, \u201cNo, not clearly because, like I said, I was in a state of shock.\u201d Moreover, although it was undisputed that two individuals had been involved in the crime, defense counsel emphasized in his closing argument that \u201cevery bit of [physical] evidence relating to a weapon . . . [pertains to] a nine millimeter.\u201d All the evidence pointed to one bullet having been fired in connection with the incident. In light of the fact that the victim unquestionably died as a result of a single nine millimeter bullet wound, defense counsel\u2019s statement reasonably could be read as disputing the assertion that both perpetrators were armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\"><em>Neder </em>and <em>Faust </em>require both that the evidence be overwhelming and uncontested. Neither requirement is met here. Accordingly, the evidence did not demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s defective instructions were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Because we conclude that a finding that the defendant used a firear m was not indispensable to the verdict, and that the evidence neither overwhelmingly nor incontrovertibly established that the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>armed, the only question remaining is whether \u00a7 53-202k applies when a participant to a qualifying felony, other than the defendant himself, utilizes a firearm in the manner proscribed by the statute. An affirmative answer to that question would require that we interpret \u00a7 53-202k, in effect, as an accomplice liability statute that subjects every participant in a crime to an enhanced sentence whenever any other participant is armed. This court has yet to determine whether an unarmed accomplice to an underlying felony falls within the scope of \u00a7 53-202k, and we decline to do so without the benefit of having received briefs from the parties on the subject. Accordingly, because the state did not present that issue as an alternate ground upon which to sustain the judgment, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We are satisfied that, under the facts of this case, the evidence that the defendant utilized a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k was neither overwhelming nor uncontested. Nor was a finding that the defendant utilized a firearm in the commission of an underlying felony implicit in the guilty verdict returned. We therefore cannot say with confidence that the impropriety did not contribute to the verdict obtained. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on whether the defendant utilized a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court deviated from proper standards of judicial conduct when it questioned certain witnesses. As a consequence of this questioning, the defendant alleges that the trial court deprived him of a fair trial as guaranteed by the due process clauses of both the state and federal constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant acknowledges that he did not object to the trial court\u2019s questioning and he therefore seeks review of his unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although we agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for our review of his constitutional claim, he cannot prevail because the trial court\u2019s behavior was not so egregious as to result in a clear violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u201cDue process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8 .... In a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is [the judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>197 Conn. 413, 424D-25, 504 A.2d 1020 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 10-11, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985). However, when it clearly appears to the judge that for one reason or another the case is not being presented intelligibly to the jury, the judge is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>required to remain silent. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 11 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 30-31, 629 A.2d 386 (1993). \u201cWhether or not the trial judge shall question a witness is within his sound discretion. The extent of the examination is likewise within his sound discretion. Its exercise will not be reviewed unless he has acted unreasonably, or, as it is more often expressed, has abused his discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 401, 439 A.2d 387 (1981). \u201cThe trial judge can question witnesses both on direct and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">. . . [I]t may be necessary to do so to clarify testimony as [the judge] has a duty to comprehend what a witness says . . . [and] to see that the witness communicates with the jury in an intelligible manner. . . . While no precise theorem can be laid down, we have held that it is proper for a trial court to question a witness in endeavoring, without harm to the parties, to bring the facts out more clearly and to ascertain the truth . . . and [intervene] where the witness is embarrassed, has a language problem or may not understand a question.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 12-13. \u201cThe risk of constitutional judicial misconduct is greatest in cases where the trial court has interceded in the merits of the trial. See [id.], 14-17 (impugning credibility of defense\u2019s only witness violated right to fair trial); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 739-42, 595 A.2d 322 (1991) (questioning of witnesses did not serve to endorse state\u2019s view of case).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Statements Made to Mercado</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The defendant objects to statements made by the trial court following the testimony of Mercado, the police officer who had detained the defendant while he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>walking on Main Street shortly after the crime occurred. On cross-examination, defense counsel had asked Mercado whether \u201cMain Street has a somewhat significant incline . . . ?\u201d Mercado acknowledged that it did. On redirect, the state referred back to that testimony, stating to Mercado that \u201c[y]ou indicated [Main Street] was a pretty steep incline.\u201d Mercado responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court questioned Mercado as to whether the description of the street being steep constituted his own characterization of Main Street or that of the prosecutor. Mercado answered that it was the prosecutor\u2019s. The court then stated: \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t do it in this courtroom again. Evidence comes from the witness stand. It\u2019s not injected into a case by a question by counsel. There is no way Main Street is steep. It is improper, inappropriate for him to put that word in that question. You don\u2019t know it and it could affect you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly assumed the role of a witness by contradicting an asserted fact with its statement that \u201c[t]here is no way that Main Street is steep.\u201d Because Mercado himself acknowledged that he was not testifying that Main Street was \u201csteep,\u201d however, the effect of the trial court\u2019s statement was to distinguish the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Main Street from that of the witness. Part of the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to conduct the proceedings \u201cin an atmosphere of perfect impartiality\u201d includes the duty to restrict evidence to facts that are elicited from sworn witness testimony, not from prosecuting attorneys. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasky, </em>43 Conn. App. 619, 635-36, 685 A.2d 336 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 959, 688 A.2d 328 (1997) (trial court properly instructed jurors that \u201cevidence consisted only of the testimony of witnesses and the exhibits, and that questions [by counsel] were not evidence\u201d); <em>Duve </em>v. <em>Duve </em>25 Conn. App. 262, 269, 594 A.2d 473, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 911, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>597 A.2d 332 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1114, 112 S. Ct. 1224, 117 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1992), citing <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>197 Conn. 141, 150, 496 A.2d476 (1985) (contempt finding improperly based on representations made by counsel); <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>22 Conn. App. 260, 263, 576 A.2d 1313, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 813, 580 A.2d 58 (1990) (in absence of sworn testimony, presentation of argument by counsel constitutes improper basis for determining factual issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Moreover, in the context of the trial, the significance of the court\u2019s statement was de minimis \u2014 -the defendant himself acknowledges in his brief that the issue of whether Main Street was steep did not relate directly to his defense of mistaken identity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>250 Conn. 526, 534, 737 A.2d 392 (1999) (stricken testimony that defendant shot victim at close range did not undermine fairness of trial wherein fact of shooting did not bear on state\u2019s claim that shooting occurred during attempted robbery); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 14 (trial court\u2019s intervention improper where questioning of witness implicates defense\u2019s theory of case). Therefore, we decline to hold that the court\u2019s comments to Mercado deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Questioning of the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The defendant claims that certain remarks made to him by the trial court improperly depreciated his credibility in front of the jury. At trial, the defendant testified that he had been in a car outside the store with several other individuals, including two friends, Will Martinez and another person he knew only as \u201cJunior.\u201d According to the defendant, he had stepped away from the vehicle to urinate, but did not go into the store. Upon his return, he observed Martinez running out of the store shouting \u201che\u2019s dead,\u201d followed by Junior who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>responded, in effect, that the victim had reached for the gun. The defendant testified that, at that point, he fled from the scene with Junior, who discarded his black jacket and ski mask in the yard of a nearby house. The defendant acknowledged that the gun that Junior was carrying had in fact belonged to him, but stated that he had loaned that gun to Junior earlier in the evening. As they were fleeing from the scene, the defendant demanded the gun back from Junior and hid it under a porch. He acknowledged that he later had given Armatino, with whom he had been incarcerated while awaiting trial, a map to the location of the gun. The defendant testified further that the gun powder residue that detectives had found on his hands was the result of fireworks that he had set off earlier that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant stated that he knew Junior only by that nickname, and that he did not know where either Junior or Martinez lived. In addition, he acknowledged that he had written a letter to Junior\u2019s sister, \u201cMilly,\u201d in which he referred to the individual who had given him the fireworks. The defendant later identified that individual as \u201cBenji.\u201d In response to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning, the defendant denied knowing the last name of either Benji or Milly. The defendant also denied knowing the last name of a friend he knew as \u201cChief\u2019 or that of Chiefs sister, or the address of either individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">At the close of the defendant\u2019s testimony, the trial court posed a series of questions, including whether the four unidentified individuals who were in the vehicle with the defendant on the night of the robbery had attended high school in this state. When the defendant indicated that he did not know, the trial court responded: \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. Now, when your counsel asked you ... I didn\u2019t want to cut in here because it\u2019s your testimony that controls. You said that you knew the two fellows in the back and the driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>knew you, did he?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t know me.\u201d The trial court then asked the defendant how it was that he had not recognized the driver of the vehicle when, as he had testified earlier, both he and the driver were members of the Latin Kings street gang, and the driver knew to give him a Latin Kings salute earlier that evening. After the defendant explained that he had been in jail for some time, the court responded, \u201cI understand that, but you didn\u2019t recognize or know him?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201c [y] ou don\u2019t know anything\u201d had the effect of depreciating his credibility before the jury, particularly in light of the insinuation raised by the state\u2019s cross-examination that he was misrepresenting the extent of his relationship with the other individuals on the belief that, if found, those persons might inculpate him in the crime. The state maintains that the trial court\u2019s remark merely reflects a confirmation of the defendant\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We need not determine whether the trial court\u2019s remark served merely to clarify the defendant\u2019s testimony, or worked to disparage his trustworthiness as it is clear from the record that the remark itself did not give rise to a constitutional violation. The trial court did not comment expressly on the defendant\u2019s credibility. The trial court neither endorsed the state\u2019s theory; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 739-42 (questioning witness on failure to identify accused from photographic array did not serve to endorse state\u2019s view of case); nor commented on the significance of the defendant\u2019s inability to provide more detailed information. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 32 (fairness not undermined by trial court\u2019s conduct absent comment on significance of evidence). Under these circumstances, we decline to read into \u201c \u2018the cold black and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>white of [the] printed record\u2019 id., 31; a constitutional violation where none is readily apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Questioning of Santos</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly asked leading questions of Santos after he had testified that he was unable positively to identify the defendant as one of the two assailants involved in the robbeiy. As stated previously, Santos, who was working in the variety store at the time of the robbeiy, had testified that although he had witnessed the robbery, he could not identify the defendant as one of the perpetrators \u201cbecause they had ski masks on and everything . . . .\u201d In response to defense counsel\u2019s question of whether there was anything distinguishing about the shorter assailant\u2019s hair style, Santos answered that although \u201c[i]t looked like he was stuffing [his hair] in [his mask],\u201d it was difficult to discern because \u201che had [the money bag] up [near his face] for one point and when he was fixing his hat.\u201d Santos acknowledged that he did not get a good look at the accomplice, and that he was in shock at the time. He testified that for the most part, he was \u201cscared,\u201d \u201cupset,\u201d \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201ccrying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Santos further testified that he recalled stating to an investigator for the public defender\u2019s office that the accomplice wore a beaded hair style that he had tucked under his mask, but that he had not mentioned that fact to the police. Defense counsel later elicited from Santos that when the police had brought the defendant to the show-up that evening, he did not have long beaded hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Soon thereafter, the trial court questioned the accuracy of Santos\u2019 recollection by suggesting that \u201cif [the mask] covered everything, you wouldn\u2019t have seen any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>thing in the hair unless it was sticking out an eye socket hole\u201d and that unless that were true, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have any other characteristic to talk about in regard to [the assailant\u2019s] hair.\u201d The trial court also questioned Santos as to whether the assailant was carrying the bag of money with his left or right hand, which hand the assailant had placed near his eye, and whether Santos could see the gun that the assailant was carrying. When Santos acknowledged that he could not see the gun clearly because he \u201cwas in a state of shock,\u201d the court queried: \u201c[Y]ou weren\u2019t able to see it clearly with a calm reflective eye. Is that what you are saying?\u201d Santos answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The court then asked whether Santos had been able to see what the assailant was doing with his free hand, namely, whether he was scratching his eye or tucking in loose hair. Santos replied that \u201che could have been adjusting the mask . . . .\u201d The court then responded: \u201cIf someone was adjusting the mask, they would hold the fabric of it and pull it in place; is that correct?\u201d Santos agreed, and the court continued: \u201cYou have no recollection of what he was actually doing . . . [y]ou don\u2019t know . . . [y]ou don\u2019t know if there was hair being stuck in . . . [o]r he was pulling the mask? I don\u2019t want to put any words in your mouth.\u201d Santos responded, \u201c[t]hat is what it was. I really, like I said, by that time, I couldn\u2019t think clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim relates to the form and persistence of the trial court\u2019s questioning of Santos.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In specific, the defendant maintains that the trial court\u2019s leading questions suggested appropriate answers to Santos that tainted his actual recollection of events. Moreover, the defendant claims that because the use of leading questions by a judge implies that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>itself believes the truth of the suggested answer, the jury improperly was influenced by the disputed line of questioning. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant is correct that as a general matter, a trial court should hesitate to interject itself into the identification aspects of a criminal proceeding. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>177 App. Div. 2d 527, 528, 575 N.Y.S.2d 915 (1991). We read the trial court\u2019s questioning of Santos, however, as an impartial attempt to clarify his testimony so to distinguish between what Santos thought the assailant was doing with the ski mask, and what Santos actually witnessed. By his own admission, Santos had established that his perception and recollection might have been affected by the traumatic nature of the events. Therefore, the trial court was fully within its discretion in questioning Santos to ensure that his testimony was communicated clearly to the jury. \u201cWhere the testimony is confusing or not altogether clear the alleged jeopardy to one side caused by the clarification of a witness\u2019s statement is certainly outweighed by the desirability of factual understanding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Moreover, Santos was not the only identification witness to the murder. As stated previously, two other individuals placed the defendant at the scene of the crime \u2014 Curwen positively identified the defendant as one of the individuals who had robbed the convenience store, while O\u2019Neill placed him in an automobile outside of the store minutes before the robbeiy occurred. A third witness, Armatino, a member of the Latin Kings and an inmate with the defendant while he was incarcerated awaiting trial, testified that the defendant had bragged about the robbery, had described the gun used in the robbery as a nine millimeter, and had given him a map leading to the location of the gun. Accordingly, although trial courts must take care to ask questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>impartially; see id., 402; we do not see how the judge\u2019s questioning in this case, in light of the totality of the evidence presented at trial, could improperly have influenced the outcome of the proceedings. The trial court\u2019s conduct did not reflect upon the merits of the defendant\u2019s case, but was instead an attempt to ensure the orderly progress of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Finally, the trial court instructed the jury, with respect to all of the testimony elicited at trial, to disregard any questions posed by the court, and any answers to those questions offered by witnesses. The court stated: \u201cSimply, you should not draw any inferences whatsoever from any questions I may have asked any witness in the case. If I did, give no consideration to the answers given to any questions which I may have asked.\u201d In the absence of an indication to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed these curative instructions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 533; <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 353, 696 A.2d 944 (1997). Accordingly, the defendant was not deprived of his right to a fair trial by the court\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The defendant claims finally that the court\u2019s instruction on the reasonable doubt standard violated his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to of the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. In specific, the defendant objects to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>trial court\u2019s characterization of a reasonable doubt as \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence in the case.\u201d According to the defendant, this description improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Because this issue was not properly preserved at trial, the defendant seeks relief under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although we agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for our review of his claim, he has failed to establish a clear constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970) .... The [reasonable doubt concept] provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014 that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. . . . [Id.], 363. At the same time, by impressing upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused, the [reasonable doubt] standard symbolizes the significance that our society attaches to the criminal sanction and thus to liberty itself. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, reh. denied, 444 U.S. 890, 100 S. Ct. 195, 62 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1979). [Consequently] [t]he defendants in a criminal case are entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge by the court that the guilt of the defendants must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 419-20, 464 A.2d 813 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>253 Conn. 195, 205-206, 749 A.2d 1192 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On appeal, claims of instructional error are reviewed to determine \u201cwhether it was . . . reasonably possible that the juiy was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>. . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Del-valle, </em>250 Conn. 466, 470, 736 A.2d 125 (1999). \u201c[T]he charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 171, 728 A.2d 466 (1999); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>supra, 470-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In relevant part, the trial court\u2019s instruction on the burden of proof is as follows: \u201cThe accused is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. . . . [Thus] the presumption of innocence alone is sufficient to acquit a defendant unless the jurors are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt after a careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case. This means that the state must prove every element necessary to constitute the crimes charged, as I will explain those elements to [you], . . . The state can sustain the burden only if the evidence before you establishes the existence of every element constituting the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. ... A reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned. It is more than a guess or a surmise. It is a doubt based upon reason and common sense. It is that kind of doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of such a compelling and convincing nature that you\u2019d be willing to rely on it without hesitation in your most important affairs of life. A reasonable doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>in other words, is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The trial court\u2019s instruction reflects a detailed explanation of the reasonable doubt standard invoking language consistently accepted by this court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 205 (reasonable doubt is \u201c \u2018a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 475 (reasonable doubt must be \u201c \u2018warranted by the evidence\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 816, 709 A.2d 522 (1998) (\u201c \u2018reasonable doubt is a real doubt, an honest doubt\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Small, </em>242 Conn. 93, 114 n.17, 700 A.2d 617 (1997) (\u201c \u2018reasonable doubt ... is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or the lack of evidence in a case\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 705, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995) (\u201c \u2018reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned\u2019 \u201d). We conclude therefore that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the challenged instructions unconstitutionally diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 53-202k and for a new jury trial on the issue of whether the defendant used a proscribed firearm in the commission of the underlying offenses; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and VERTE-FEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k provides: \u201cCommission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm: Five-year nonsuspendable sentence.

As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 347, persistent offender provisions are enforced through the use of a part B information so as not to prejudice the accused on the original charge by having the jury hear evidence in the first pari, of the trial regarding the accused\u2019s prior criminal convictions. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 173 (two part information required when proof of defendant\u2019s prior conviction used to enhance punishment for contemporaneous conviction of substantive offense). Unlike the proscribed use of a qualifying firearm, prior convictions are facts that have no legitimate bearing on the actual crime at issue. Such facts nevertheless increase the probability that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>will infer a predisposition to commit the crime with which the defendant stands charged when the evidence pertains to similar misconduct engaged in previously. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 345, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 15, 480 A.2d 489 (1984). These same concerns do not accompany the submission of evidence relevant to a factual determination under \u00a7 53-202k. Indeed, the proscribed use of a qualifying firearm requires additional factual findings relevant to the offense itself, not to the nature of the offender, and is thereby typically established by the same evidence used to demonstrate culpability for the underlying felony. Under such circumstances, there is little, if any, prejudice to the accused that would warrant the use of a separate part B information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n.6, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed 2d 311 (1999), the United States Supreme Court expressly declined to address whether the jury right guarantees of the sixth amendment apply to lads that increase the maximum penalty for an underlying crime. Instead, the court resolved the issue of whether certain provisions of the federal carjacking statute constituted essential elements of an underlying crime, or factors that bear on the ultimate sentence to be imposed, as a matter of statutory construction, thereby disposing of the need to address the larger constitutional issue. See id., 243 (construing meaning of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d under statute that exposes convicted defendant to enhanced penalty). Similarly, in <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 93, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1986), the Supreme Court upheld a statute that called for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence upon a finding by a judge that the defendant had committed an underlying felony by the use of a firearm, stating that \u201cthere is no Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing, even where the sentence turns on specific findings of fact.\u201d The court, expressly noted, however, that the statute operated solely to limit the trial court\u2019s discretion in selecting a minimum penalty within a prescribed range, but did not \u201c[alter] the maximum penalty for the crime committed . . . .\u201d Id., 87-88. Indeed, the <em>Jones </em>court confirmed \u201cthat the result [in <em>McMillan] </em>might have been different if proof of visible possession [of a firearm] had exposed a defendant to a sentence beyond the maximum that the statute otherwise set without reference to that fact.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 242, citing <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Although we do not decide this case on constitutional grounds; see footnote 9 of this opinion; we take tins opportunity to clarify our statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 150 n.9, that \u00a7 53-202k is comparable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the Pennsylvania statute at issue in <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 106 S.

Unlike in <em>McMillan, </em>which addressed a statute that called for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence upon a finding by a judge that the defendant had committed an underlying felony by the use of a firearm, the issue in <em>Dash </em>was whether \u00a7 53-202k created a sentencing enhancement provision or a separate crime upon which the defendant could be convicted. Consistent with our conclusion in <em>Dash, </em>we are persuaded by the bulk of legislative statements surrounding the passage of \u00a7 53-202k, that the statute constitutes a sentence enhancement provision rather than a provision that calls for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence. Indeed, as we noted in <em>Dash, </em>these statements themselves indicate that \u00a7 53-202k was intended not merely to restrict the judge\u2019s discretion to imposing a sentence within a prescribed range, but to expand upon the maximum range of sentences already available upon conviction. Id., 149. In specific, Representative Lawlor explained that \u201c\u00a7 53-202k was intended, [to add] five years to the end of whatever other sentence [a defendant is] receiving as a consequence of these acts. . . . This legislation requires five years to be tacked on to the end of [the] sentence [for the underlying felony] which must run consecutively and which cannot be suspended or reduced in any manner. So that would be in addition to the minimum mandatories that are already in existence for whatever the underlying crime was. So, it is <em>five additional years on top of the other sentence. </em>... 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 33, 1993 Sess., pp. 11,727-28. Similarly, Representative Reginald L. Jones, Jr., stated that this legislation deal[s] with mandatory sentences that run consecutively and cannot be plea bargained. The purpose, of course, <em>is to make the penalties greater and greater </em>if you use these weapons. . . . Id., p. 11,725. Finally, Senator Alvin W. Penn explained that the legislation requires a mandatory five year sentence ... in addition and consecutive to any imprisonment for the [underlying] felony. 36 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1993 Sess., p. 4956.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>supra, 149. \u201cThese comments strongly suggest that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 53-202k, merely sought to establish an additional penalty for a person who commits a class A, B or C felony with a firearm,\u201d rather than to compel the imposition of a predetermined minimum.

I agree with the majority\u2019s statutory analysis of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. I believe, however, that, under the facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s decision not to submit the \u00a7 53-202k matter to the jury for a factual determination of whether the defendant, Victor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Velasco, used a firearm in the commission of the crime was, although improper, harmless. Accordingly, I would not vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 53-202k and would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The defendant claimed at oral argument that, because his use of a firearm was not a required element of either felony murder or first degree robbery, and because the jury was instructed not to consider whether he had used a firearm, his conviction on both of those counts did not necessarily imply that he had used a firearm. The majority is persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument. I am not.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The gist of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the jury improperly was instructed that it need not determine whether the state had proven an essential element of a \u00a7 53-202k violation. In determining whether the trial court\u2019s instruction to a jury that it need not consider an essential element of an offense is harmless, the reviewing court does not ask whether the defendant has admitted the omitted element, or whether the government has proven the element to a metaphysical certainty. The test is whether it is \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error .... To set a barrier so high that it could never be surmounted would justify the very criticism that spawned the harmless-error doctrine in the first place: Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999) (harmless error rule applied when trial court instructed jury that finding essential element of offense was for court, not jury). Therefore, the \u201ccourt, in typical appellate-court fashion, asks whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>omitted element. If the answer to that question is no, holding the error harmless does not reflec[t] a denigration of the constitutional rights involved. ... On the contrary, it serve [s] a very useful purpose insofar as [it] block[s] setting aside convictions for small errors or defects that have little, if any, likelihood of having changed the result of the trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 19. I would answer no to the question of whether a rational fact finder could find, on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, that the defendant participated in the robbery, but did not display or use a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Accordingly, I would find that, even though the defendant was, as the majority concludes, statutorily entitled to have a jury determine whether he displayed or used a firearm for purposes of establishing his culpability under \u00a7 53-202k, the trial court\u2019s decision not to submit that issue to the jury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This is so even if it is assumed that the court\u2019s decision implicated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The majority concludes that there is a dispute about whether both participants in the robbery displayed firearms because the defendant denied both that he was a participant and that he was in possession of a firearm. The issue is not, however, whether the defendant admitted that he was one of the participants in the robbery or that he used a firearm. The issue is whether a rational jury, having concluded that the defendant was a participant, also could have concluded that he did not carry a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">It is important to note that the defendant did not claim that, even if he did participate in the robbery, he did not use a gun. Nor did he claim that only one of the two participants in the robbery used a gun. Rather, in an attempt to explain why his gun had been used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>during the robbery even though he allegedly did not participate \u2014 an explanation that the defendant apparently felt obliged to provide \u2014 the defendant claimed that he gave the gun to an associate minutes before the robbery and that he took it back minutes later when the associate ran out of the store. Although the jury could have inferred that the defendant gave a gun to an associate before the robbery and used a silver pistol himself,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there was no evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, he participated in the robbery, but that, in accordance with his claim, he did not possess a gun. In other words, the jury\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not a participant necessarily implies its rejection of his claim that he did not have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Two bystander eyewitnesses, with no apparent motive to lie, testified that both participants in the robbery had guns. Kathryn Curwen, one of the eyewitnesses, testified without qualification that the shorter of the two participants in the robbery, who later was identified as the defendant, had a shiny revolver. She also testified that the participants \u201cboth had guns.\u201d Frank Santos, the other eyewitness, testified that the taller of the participants had a \u201cLuger.\u201d When asked about whether the second participant had a gun, Santos testified that he \u201creally didn\u2019t get a good look, but . . . thought [he] saw a silver revolver.\u201d On direct examination, Santos testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u201c[Jonathan Benedict, State\u2019s Attorney]: And when [the second participant] ran out, he had a chrome pistol in one hand, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u201c[Santos]: It looked like that, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u201c[Mr. Benedict]: Some kind of gun?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201c[Santos]: Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Later, the court questioned Santos as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201cThe Court: Did he place his left hand near his eye or his right hand?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u201c[Santos]: His left \u2014 his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u201cThe Court: His right? Was his right hand carrying the gun or the bag of money?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u201c[Santos]: The gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">\u201cThe Court: When he put the gun up there, could you see the gun?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">\u201c[Santos]: No, not clearly because, like I said, I was in a state of shock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">The majority states that \u201cSantos\u2019 testimony established that the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm was not uncontroverted.\u201d When Santos\u2019 testimony is taken in context, however, it is clear that, at most, Santos was uncertain about the type of gun the second participant carried, not whether he carried one. Furthermore, even if it is assumed that Santos could not clearly see whether the second participant had a gun, that would, in no way, controvert Curwen\u2019s unequivocal and undisputed testimony that he did have one.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">The majority\u2019s characterization of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument as \u201cdisputing the assertion that both perpetrators were armed\u201d is also untenable. Contrary to the majority\u2019s reading, defense counsel did not argue, or even suggest, that only one participant in the robbery used a gun. Rather, defense counsel argued that Cur-wen\u2019s description of the second participant\u2019s gun as a \u201csilver revolver\u201d indicated that her identification of the defendant as a participant in the robbery was unreliable. Defense counsel\u2019s argument was based on evidence that tied both the defendant and the shooting to a nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>millimeter gun, specifically, evidence that the fatal wound was inflicted by a nine millimeter gun and testimony that the defendant, while in prison awaiting trial, had given information to a fellow prisoner concerning the location of the nine millimeter gun that had been used in the shooting. Defense counsel did not argue that a silver revolver was not used during the robbery, or that only one participant used a gun. Rather, he attempted to argue, albeit without factual or logical basis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that, because the second participant used a silver revolver, the second participant could not have been the defendant. The jury, in convicting the defendant, clearly rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We are bound by <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United </em>States, supra, 527 U.S. 1, in our analysis of claims impheating the defendant\u2019s rights under the United States constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, I find the rationale of the court\u2019s holding in <em>Neder </em>to be persuasive to the extent that the defendant\u2019s claims may implicate his rights under the Connecticut constitution. I, therefore, would uphold the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 53-202k.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>To the extent that the defendant also claimed that the court\u2019s instructions on the reasonable doubt standard violated his right to a fair trial under the federal and state constitutions, I agree with the majority that this claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 53-202k.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> There was testimony that the defendant possessed both a black gun with a \u201cclip\u201d and a smaller silver gun prior to the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> Even if the evidence did link the defendant with the nine millimeter gun used in the robbery, it certainly did not, as defense counsel attempted to suggest, rule out the possibility that it was the defendant who carried the silver pistol during the robbery. In fact, there was testimony that the defendant possessed both a silver-colored pistol and a larger black gun prior to the robbery, and the state conceded that the other participant in the robbery probably used the nine millimeter gun and inflicted the fatal wound. In any case, defense counsel\u2019s argument focused on the unreliability of Curwen\u2019s identification of the defendant as a participant in the robbery, and, in no way, impugned Curwen\u2019s testimony that both participants had guns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> State courts must follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions interpreting the United States constitution.
