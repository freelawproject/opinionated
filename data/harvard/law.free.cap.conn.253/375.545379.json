We answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The facts of this case as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court are as follows: \u201cOn April 12, 1995, the state filed a five count information to which the defendant [Angel Ocasio] pleaded not guilty. On May 22, 1996, the day that jury selection began, the state filed a fifteen count substitute information. On May 23, 1996, pursuant to a plea agreement, the state filed a substitute information charging the defendant with one count of conspiracy to sell narcotics in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (a) and 53a-48<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of violating the Corrupt Organizations and Racketeering Activity Act in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53-395 (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which the defendant entered a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u201cThe trial court canvassed the defendant, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7711 through 722, now \u00a7\u00a7 39-18 through 39-28, and asked, \u2018[I]s this plea voluntary?\u2019 to which the defendant stated, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Further, the trial court informed the defendant of the impact of pleading guilty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on his constitutional rights and then asked, \u2018is that what you want, sir,\u2019 to which the defendant responded, \u2018Yes.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u201cThe trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and found it was \u2018entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, with a full understanding of the offenses charged, as well as the possible consequences thereof, and after adequate and effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. Ocasio, 50 Conn. App. 748, 749-50, 718 A.2d 1018 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201cOn July 19, 1996, just prior to sentencing, the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the court that the defendant wanted to withdraw his guilty plea. The court refused to hear this motion until the court could obtain a copy of the transcript from the plea proceeding. The court encouraged the defendant\u2019s attorney to file a written motion to withdraw the plea. This was not done. Also on July 19, 1996&gt; the defendant\u2019s attorney orally moved to withdraw his appearance. That motion was denied by the court. Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s attorney filed a written motion to withdraw his appearance. That motion was also denied by the court.\u201d Id., 750 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cOn August 23, 1996, just prior to sentencing, the defendant made a second oral motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The defendant\u2019s attorney advised the trial court that the basis for the request to withdraw the plea was that the defendant \u2018was confused; he didn\u2019t realize the consequences, apparently, of the plea at the time it was entered . . . [and] he feels that the pressure was a little too great. He feels that . . . there were other matters that were also impinging his reasons for making a knowing decision at the time.\u2019 The trial court denied [the] motion, finding that the court \u2018has heard nothing ... to even permit an evidentiary hearing, much less grant an oral motion.\u2019 \u201d Id., 750-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming that the trial court improperly had accepted his guilty plea because it failed to ensure that the plea was voluntary, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 39-20, formerly Practice Book \u00a7 712.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Appellate Court agreed, holding that the trial court improperly had failed to inquire if the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was \u201c \u2018the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement\u2019 \u201d; id., 756; and that that failure required reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. Id., 757. We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 947; and we now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">This court has held repeatedly that Practice Book \u00a7 39-19<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires only substantial compliance. See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>v. <em>Domian, </em>235 Conn. 679, 689, 668 A.2d 1333 (1996) (strict adherence to \u00a7 39-19 not constitutionally mandated); id., 688 (test is whether, in light of all circumstances, trial court\u2019s failure to comply rendered guilty plea unknowing or involuntary); <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986) (literal compliance with \u00a7 39-19 not required); <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>194 Conn. 223, 226-27, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984) (deviation from specific requirements of \u00a7 39-19 does not require automatic reversal); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 360, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981) (where there has been substantial compliance, failure to comply with each and every requirement of \u00a7 39-19 does not require automatic vacating of defendant\u2019s plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We can see no reason to apply a different standard of compliance to \u00a7 39-20. The Appellate Court reasoned that, Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (l)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>anee with \u00a7 39-19 need only be \u201csubstantial\u201d for a guilty plea to be valid; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 752-53; and the substantial compliance standard is inappropriate for \u00a7 39-20, because \u00a7 39-27 (2) contains no such qualifier. Section 39-27 (2) provides simply that a guilty plea may be withdrawn if \u201c[t]he plea was involuntary . . . .\u201d The voluntariness of the plea, however, does not depend on the court\u2019s strict compliance with \u00a7 39-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">As noted in Judge Shea\u2019s dissent from the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion, both \u00a7 39-19 and \u00a7 39-20 relate to the waiver of significant constitutional rights by a defendant in a criminal case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 758 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). We stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 418, that \u201c[a] defendant can voluntarily and understandingly waive these rights without literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of Practice Book [\u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20].\u201d The defendant argues that this statement was dictum. We need not decide whether the statement was dictum, however, because we hold in this case that only substantial, rather than literal, compliance with \u00a7 39-20 is required in order to validate a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We further conclude that the test for substantial compliance is whether, in light of all of the circumstances, the trial court\u2019s literal compliance with \u00a7 39-20 would have made any difference in the trial court\u2019s determination that the plea was voluntary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Domian, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 688 (test for substantial compliance with \u00a7 39-19 is whether accurate information would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>have made any difference in defendant\u2019s decision to enter guilty plea). In light of all of the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, we conclude that the trial court substantially complied with \u00a7 39-20. We note that the trial court thoroughly canvassed the defendant before accepting his plea and that the defendant explicitly stated that his plea was voluntary. The record contains nothing to suggest that the defendant would have responded affirmatively if the trial court had asked whether his guilty plea was the result of force or threats or promises apart from the plea agreement. He made no claim of any threats or promises, and he has not made such a claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-395 (c) provides: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise to knowingly conduct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>participate in, directly or indirectly, such enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or through the collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> \u201cThe relevant portion of the colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">'The Court: And, again, have you had any difficulties in understanding the questions that I\u2019ve asked you or in your giving the answers to those questions?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u2018The Defendant: No, Your Honor, everything is okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u2018The Court: And do you fully understand, Mr. Ocasio, that if I accept these guilty pleas . . . that you will not be permitted to withdraw these pleas, you\u2019ll be sentenced accordingly, and you will have given up those constitutional rights that I have already discussed with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">\u2018The Defendant: Yes.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ocasio, </em>50 Conn.
