We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of June 30, 1996, the defendant, Hector Heredia, entered the McDonald\u2019s restaurant on Reidville Drive in Waterbury through a rear security door that had been left open inadvertently. He was wearing blue jeans, a red shirt and a white baseball cap. An employee of the restaurant, Chris Acty, saw the defendant run into the restaurant holding a gun. Acty grabbed the defendant\u2019s arm and the two men wrestled to the floor. At some point the defendant\u2019s gun discharged, wounding Acty in the arm. The defendant then aimed his gun at Acty\u2019s chest at close range and pulled the trigger several times, but the gun did not fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The restaurant manager, Jesus Quinones, upon hearing the fight and the gunshot, yelled out for everyone to leave the building. Quinones, Acty, and three other employees escaped. As they were fleeing, Quinones saw the defendant start to chase them, and Quinones heard the defendant call out to him, in English, to come back. One employee, Gayle Briggs, fell while attempting to run out of the building. The defendant ran up to Briggs, put his gun to her back, and told her, in English, to stay down, keep still and not look at him. He then told her, in English, to get some money. She explained that only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the manager could get money because he alone had the key. The defendant then asked Briggs, in English, where the manager was, and when she started to explain, the defendant finished her sentence by saying, \u201cThe one with the blue shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant brought Briggs to her feet and led her to the rear door. When they were outside he yelled out, in English, for the manager. After there was no response, the defendant brought Briggs back inside to the service counter. He demanded, in English, that she open one of the cash registers. She explained that it was locked. After the defendant had attempted unsuccessfully to open the cash register himself, he took Briggs to the safe in the manager\u2019s office, which also was locked. The defendant then pushed Briggs into a walk-in freezer. At this time, the defendant spoke to Briggs in a mixture of Spanish and English.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Meanwhile, the restaurant employees who had escaped ran through the restaurant parking lot toward Lombard Plaza, a nearby shopping center. Upon realizing that Briggs had been left behind, they returned to the restaurant to look for her. Through the restaurant windows they saw the defendant holding a gun to Briggs. Upon seeing these employees, the defendant came out of the restaurant and chased them through the empty parking lot. One of the employees, Crispin Rojas, stayed in the restaurant parking lot, and eventually he was able to reenter the restaurant and free Briggs from the freezer.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Two of the fleeing employees ran to the Burger King restaurant in the Lombard Plaza, where they were let in by the Burger King manager, who called the police. Two other employees, including Acty, called the police from another store in Lombard Plaza. After hearing Acty\u2019s account of the incident and his description of the perpetrator, the two responding police officers pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ceeded to the McDonald\u2019s. On their way, they noticed a black Oldsmobile in the plaza parking lot that seemed \u201cout of place\u201d because it was not in a parking space and because none of the businesses in the plaza were open at that time. A license plate check later determined that the car belonged to the defendant. The officers then talked to Briggs, Quinones and Rojas, who told them that the perpetrator had run into the woods directly behind the McDonald\u2019s. The police secured the perimeter of the woods and summoned two canine units.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The first canine unit arrived with a German shepherd and began to search the woods behind the restaurant. The woods were dense and rocky, with much vegetation, and it was so difficult for the policemen to move around in the woods that one of the officers fell several times while doing so. Approximately twenty-five yards into the woods, the police found a white baseball cap. Shortly thereafter, the second canine unit arrived with a bloodhound. The bloodhound was brought to the baseball cap, sniffed it and followed the scent further into the woods. Approximately twenty-five yards further into the woods, the bloodhound stopped and began to bark. The police officers looked down and saw two feet sticking out from beneath a piece of sheet metal. Underneath the sheet metal was the defendant, his torso in a kind of cave-like depression, with his shoes and shirt off, and a red T-shirt in a ball at his feet. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">During the canine searches of the woods, Briggs and Quinones were taken to police headquarters to look at mug shots and to give written statements. When word got back to headquarters that the defendant had been taken into custody, Briggs and Quinones were brought back to the restaurant, where they immediately and unequivocally identified the defendant as the perpetra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>tor. Later, Acty identified the defendant from a photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">A search of the rear of the restaurant yielded a small holster and four .38 caliber bullets. The next day, the police found a .38 caliber handgun in the woods behind the restaurant. The serial number on that gun matched that of a gun owned by Andres Baez, the defendant\u2019s former roommate. Baez had owned the gun for ten years, until it was stolen from him in November, 1995, while the defendant was living with him. Several days after the incident, a bullet core was found in the restaurant, which ballistic tests matched to the stolen gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">At trial, the defendant, whose native language is Spanish, availed himself of the services of a Spanish language interpreter, and testified in his own defense through the interpreter. He did not dispute that the alleged crimes had been committed, and he admitted that he was at the restaurant on the night of the robbery. He testified that he had had car\u2019 trouble that night and that he had attempted to call a tow truck from the McDonald\u2019s restaurant. He claimed that as he approached the rear door of the restaurant he was assaulted by an Hispanic male who was wearing sunglasses and holding a gun. According to the defendant, the man hit him on the head with the gun, took his hat and shirt, leaving him with $100 in his wallet. He then pointed the gun at the defendant and told him to run into the woods. The defendant testified further that, although he was dizzy from the blow to his head, he ran, without difficulty on a straight path, through the woods until he stopped and leaned against a board, and that he was in that position when the police found him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The jury rendered a verdict of guilty on all counts and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The defendant first claims that certain questions and comments by the state violated his rights under the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim is twofold. Specifically, he argues that the state (1) during its cross-examination of him, and (2) during its closing argument, improperly challenged the legitimacy of his use of a Spanish language interpreter, and thereby impermissibly burdened his constitutional right to have the court proceedings translated into his native language.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>It is important to underscore the doctrinal underpinning of this claim. This claim of the defendant does not rest on a contention of prosecutorial misconduct under the due process clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, the defendant presents this claim under the principle that \u201ca violation of constitutional magnitude may be established even though there has not been a complete abridgement or deprivation of the right. A constitutional violation may result, therefore, when a constitutional right has been impermissibly burdened or impaired by virtue of state action that unnecessarily chills or penalizes the free exercise of the right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 126, 672 A.2d 899, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910, 117 S. Ct. 273, 136 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In this regard, therefore, the defendant claims that the state unfairly burdened his constitutionally protected right to the assistance of an interpreter by certain questions that it posed to him on recross-examination, namely: \u201cYou say that you don\u2019t speak English that well?\u201d; \u201cYou were able to get a social security card, right, this one in your wallet?\u201d; and \u201cAre you given any kind of a test when you come to court to decide whether or not you need an interpreter?\u201d In addition, the defendant challenges, on the same ground, the following portion of the state\u2019s final argument: \u201cAnd I\u2019d ask you not to be persuaded by his demeanor when he\u2019s on the stand, when he leans over and looks, kind of sits down, slouched over, looks up at the interpreter and says, \u2018como, como,\u2019<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> like he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The following facts underlie this claim. Briggs had testified that, during her contact with the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>he repeatedly spoke and understood English, that she did not understand Spanish, and that it was only when he pushed her into the freezer that he spoke in a mixture of Spanish and English. Quinones also testified that the defendant had called out to him in English. In addition, Baez had testified that the defendant spoke \u201ca little English.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">On his direct examination, the defendant, through the interpreter, testified to the effect that, when he told the police what had happened to him, he did so in Spanish.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On cross-examination, the defendant admitted that he had lived in the United States for six years, and that he had worked at the American Eagle truck stop. He testified that when he worked at the truck stop, he tried once or twice to speak to his supervisor in English, but that she could not understand him. He also testified that he had taken English classes \u201cat city hall.\u201d On redirect examination, the defendant testified that he had been taking English classes since his arrest, that before he was arrested he did not speak or understand \u201ccertain phrases in English,\u201d and that he tried to speak English \u201cbut, when I do, they don\u2019t understand me too good.\u201d On recross-examination, the following exchange took place. The state asked the defendant: \u201cYou say that you don\u2019t speak English that well?\u201d The defendant responded: \u201cI don\u2019t speak it too well.\u201d The state then asked: \u201cYou were able to get a social security card, right, this one in your wallet?\u201d The defendant objected on the ground that the question was speculative, and the court sustained the objection. The state then asked: \u201cAre you given any kind of a test when you come to court to decide whether or not you need an interpreter?\u201d The defendant objected, without stating any ground, and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In its final argument, in addressing the identity of the defendant as the assailant, the state argued as follows: \u201cThe defendant got up there and testified that he doesn\u2019t understand English, doesn\u2019t speak any English. He also testified \u2014 we heard from Mr. Baez, the roommate. I did hear him speaking English on a few occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cHe also got up there and he testified that he had taken English at city hall. Also, he testified that he worked at the truck stop, the 76 Truck Stop in South-ington.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u201cIf you think about the words that Miss Briggs remembers hearing. Cash register. Do you think that\u2019s a word that he might become familiar with over the years of working at a truck stop? Money. Where\u2019s the money, show me the money. That\u2019s a word that you become familiar with. Safe. Show me where the safe is. Another word that if you worked at a retail business for three of four years and studied some English, you would know that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\u201cAnd what was the last thing? The manager. There was testimony about the fact that he had a supervisor. There were people in charge of him when he worked at the truck stop for a number of years. Don\u2019t you think that the word manager would have come up? Is it that far-fetched that someone who doesn\u2019t understand English might know those particular words?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">\u201cAnd I\u2019d ask you not to be persuaded by his demeanor when he\u2019s on the stand, when he leans over and looks, kind of sits down, slouched over, looks up at the interpreter and says \u2018como, como,\u2019 like he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u201cIf I loaded that gun and shut out the lights in this courtroom and put it in his hand, I think everybody would have a very different perception of how dangerous he is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>At that point, the defendant objected stating: \u201cObjection, Your Honor. This appeals to passion and emotion.\u201d The court in effect sustained the objection by directing the state: \u201cMove away from that.\u201d The defendant did not ask for a curative instruction regarding the state\u2019s argument. The state then proceeded to argue regarding the presence of the gun found in the woods, the defendant\u2019s hiding in the woods, and the presence of the red shirt found at his feet in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In his final argument, the defendant, in addressing the issue of identity, contended: \u201cNot disputed during the incident is that all the employees, except for Miss Briggs, exited the store, and she . . . was grabbed by the perpetrator . . . and that this individual spoke predominantly English, sometimes Spanish, while doing so, seeking the money, the manager, the keys to the register.\u201d He also argued as follows: \u201cAnother [issue] that the state claims is that [the defendant is] responsible for these acts is alleged by the aggressive questioning of whether or not he spoke and understood English at the time of the events. And I know you\u2019ll recall Miss Briggs\u2019 testimony that she was repeatedly questioned and ordered about the restaurant by an intruder who spoke in English.\u201d The defendant also contended: \u201cThe patrolman never indicated that [the defendant] spoke English, nor were there any officers called to take the stand and testify as to him speaking a word of English.\u201d Finally, in addressing the question of whether the red shirt was with the defendant when he was discovered in the woods, the defendant argued: \u201cIt\u2019s for you to resolve this conflict, but, resolve it in light of all of the evidence here, and by that I mean the identification situation, the presence of the car, the question about the speaking of English.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In the rebuttal portion of its final argument, the state did not advert to the question of whether the defendant spoke English. It focused, instead, on the positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>nature of the identification of the defendant by the eyewitnesses, the alleged implausibility of his version of events, and the connection between the defendant and the gun in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">There is no question, and the state does not contest, that with respect to a defendant who has only a limited understanding of English, his \u201cright to confrontation, his right to counsel and his right to be present at trial may be violated if he is not provided with a separate interpreter, who performs the functions of translating for him, into his language, the testimony of English speaking witnesses and interpreting between him and his English speaking counsel during the testimony of all witnesses, both English and nonEnglish speaking.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 133, 659 A.2d 683 (1995). We also do not question the proposition that, consistent with these rights, the court may not unduly burden their exercise by challenging before the jury the defendant\u2019s need for an interpreter. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayans, </em>17 F.3d 1174, 1180-81 (9th Cir. 1994). We conclude, nonetheless, that the defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim must be considered in the context of the only contested issue at the trial, namely, the identity of the defendant as the assailant. Furthermore, that issue must be viewed through the factual prism that the defendant, both explicitly and implicitly, presented himself as a victim of mistaken identity because, given the fact that the assailant addressed his victims mainly in English, and given the defendant\u2019s claimed inability to speak English with any degree of fluency, he could not have been the assailant. This presentation by the defendant was made explicitly by his testimony that he did not speak understandable English, and was made implicitly by his use of a Spanish interpreter. Although the state never challenged the court\u2019s appointment of an interpreter for the defendant, the jury necessarily would have had that use in mind in arriving at its deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>mination of the only contested issue in the case. Thus, in order to meet its burden of establishing the identity of the defendant as the assailant, the state was justified in attempting to counter that defense posture. The state\u2019s attempt, therefore, to undermine the defendant\u2019s use of an inteipreter was not gratuitous, but was directly related to the dispositive factual issue on which it had the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">With this background in mind, we return to the defendant\u2019s two part claim. Although the defendant has combined the two parts of his claim \u2014 based on the state\u2019s recross-examination of the defendant, and based on the state\u2019s final argument \u2014 the proper analyses require that we separate them because different principles apply to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We turn first to the part of his claim regarding the questions asked by the state. The first challenged question \u2014 \u201cYou say that you don\u2019t speak English that well?\u201d \u2014 was answered by the defendant \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t speak it too well.\u201d \u2014 without objection. Indeed, we can see no basis for an objection, given the trial context that we have just described. The other two questions, regarding his social security card, and regarding whether he was given any test in connection with his request for an interpreter, were objected to, and the court sustained the objections. Absent a basis for an inference that the state was intentionally persisting in asking questions that it knew were improper in order to elicit an impermissible reaction from the jury, or for an inference of some similar brand of prosecutorial bad faith \u2014 which the defendant does not claim to be the case \u2014 we know of no authority, and the defendant has supplied none, for the proposition that the defendant is deprived of a constitutional right by the state\u2019s merely having asked a question or questions to which the defendant successfully objects. Furthermore, the court, in its general charge to the jury, instructed it that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>not to draw any inferences from questions that were objected to and not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The defendant\u2019s challenge to the state\u2019s final argument is also unavailing. It is important to note that the defendant challenges only the following part of the state\u2019s final argument: \u201cAnd I\u2019d ask you not to be persuaded by his demeanor when he\u2019s on the stand, when he leans over and looks, kind of sits down, slouched over, looks up at the interpreter and says \u2018como, como,\u2019 like he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. If I loaded that gun and shut out the lights in this courtroom and put it in his hand, I think everybody would have a different perception of how dangerous he is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The defendant contends that this argument \u201cunduly burdened the defendant\u2019s right to proceed with the assistance of an interpreter.\u201d This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, this claim was not made at trial. In determining whether this contention was made at trial, we must consider the challenged language in the context in which it was used, which was also the context in which the jury heard it. That context demonstrates that it was preceded by a rather lengthy argument by the state, focusing on the contested issue of identity, in which the state reviewed the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to speak English.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The state noted the defendant\u2019s testimony that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand English, doesn\u2019t speak English.\u201d The state then noted the following: Baez\u2019 testimony that he had heard the defendant \u201cspeaking English on a few occasions\u201d; the defendant\u2019s testimony that \u201che had taken English at city hall\u201d and that he had worked \u201cat the truck stop\u201d; and Briggs\u2019 testimony that she had heard the assailant say the words \u2014 \u201c[c]ash register,\u201d \u201c[wjhere\u2019s the money,\u201d \u201c[s]how me where the safe is,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>and \u201c[t]he manager.\u201d The state then argued that it was not far-fetched \u201cthat someone who doesn\u2019t understand English might know these particular words.\u201d Thus, the state\u2019s argument was, at least up until this point, simply to the effect that even someone with the defendant\u2019s professed lack of fluency in English could well have said what the witnesses attributed to the assailant. Moreover, at this point, the state had not even mentioned the interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The state then moved to a different topic: the defendant\u2019s demeanor on the stand, and a possible inconsistency with that demeanor and the high degree of dangerous conduct evidenced by the assailant. In this regard, the state argued: \u201cAnd I\u2019d ask you not to be persuaded by his demeanor when he\u2019s on the stand, when he leans over and looks, kind of sits down, slouched over, looks up at the interpreter and says, \u2018como, como,\u2019 like he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>\u201cIf I loaded that gun and shut out the lights in this courtroom and put it in his hand, I think everybody would have a very different perception of how dangerous he is.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) At that point, and significantly, not before that point, the defendant objected as follows: \u201cObjection, Your Honor. This appeals to passion and emotion.\u201d The court in effect sustained the objection by directing the state to \u201c[m]ove away from that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">This record demonstrates that what the defendant was objecting to was not the reference to the interpreter, or to the use of the Spanish word \u201ccomo,\u201d but to the attempt to have the jury, despite the defendant\u2019s demeanor on the stand, imagine him with a loaded gun in his hand in the courtroom.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That is the only plausible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>meaning that can be attributed to the defendant\u2019s objection that \u201c[t]his appeals to passion and emotion.\u201d It is clear from this record, therefore, that both the trial court and the defense counsel, and most likely the jury, heard the challenged language as it was intended by the state, namely, not as a comment on the defendant\u2019s need for an inteipreter, but as a comment on his dangerousness despite his demeanor on the stand.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We consider the defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, as a claim that was not preserved at trial. It is well settled that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude, alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>250 Conn. 807, 815, 740 A.2d 371 (1999). The first two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>supra, 815. This court may dispose of the claim on any one of the conditions that the defendant does not meet. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240. We conclude that the defendant has not met the third condition because there was no violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">As our prior discussion regarding whether this claim was made at trial indicates, the state did <em>not </em>argue in such a way as to burden his right to have an interpreter translate the proceedings into his native language. That was not the thrust of the state\u2019s argument, and it was not the way in which it is likely that anyone in the courtroom \u2014 trial judge, defense counsel or jury \u2014 heard it. The thrust of the argument, instead, focused on the defendant\u2019s demeanor on the stand, and the potential conflict between that demeanor and the dangerousness of the assailant described by the state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">This does not mean that, in any case in which the defendant avails himself of the services of an interpreter, the state would be free to focus on that fact in a manner that was irrelevant to the issues in the case, or in a manner that unduly casts doubt on the necessity of those services. Nor does it mean that we approve of the state\u2019s use of the Spanish word \u201ccomo\u201d in its argument, or its brief reference to the interpreter. Although we recognize that both parties must be free to argue vigorously, and that we cannot hold an oral final argument to the scrupulous standard of a written appellate brief, we believe that the state\u2019s point could have been made just as forcefully without those references. We cannot, however, place the weight of unconstitutionality on those references, taken in their proper context, that the defendant would have us do.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The defendant next claims that in the final argument, the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct that violated his right to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly: (1) appealed to the jury\u2019s passion and emotion; (2) repeatedly referred to matters not in evidence; (3) referred to the defendant\u2019s ethnicity and language barrier in such a manner as to impugn his character; and (4) vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses, and gave his personal opinion that the defendant was guilty. We conclude that there was no pattern of prosecutorial misconduct, and that the sole, isolated instance of improper argument did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may . . . occur in the course of closing argument. . . . Such argument may be, in light of all of the facts and circumstances, so egregious that no curative instruction could reasonably be expected to remove [its] prejudicial impact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Williams, 204 Conn. 523, 539, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). \u201cWe do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 539-40. Whether the alleged pattern of prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of denying the defendant\u2019s right to due process of law and deprived him of a fair trial depends on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>number of factors, including the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument, the severity of the misconduct, the frequency of the misconduct, the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case, the strength of the curative instructions adopted, and the strength of the state\u2019s case. Id., 540. We consider the defendant\u2019s contentions, under these standards, in their inverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses and gave his own personal opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt is based on five discrete portions of the state\u2019s final argument. The prosecutor argued, in part, as follows: (1) \u201cYou hear words like the perpetrator, the assailant, the gunman. Gayle Briggs was there. Chris Acty was there. And that\u2019s the perpetrator. That\u2019s the assailant. That\u2019s the gunman.\u201d; (2) \u201c[Briggs] couldn\u2019t even handle looking at [the defendant]. Does that impress you that maybe she remembers that person? Of course she remembers him.\u201d; (3) \u201c[The defendant] shot Chris Acty, kidnapped Gayle Briggs. They came in here and testified to it.\u201d; (4) \u201cNow, Jesus Quinones, he was not a good witness. I mean, I\u2019ll admit that.\u201d; and (5) that the state\u2019s version of the case was the \u201csimplest,\u201d and that \u201cthe simplest answer is the right answer.\u201d The short answer to the defendant\u2019s contention is that all of these arguments were based on evidence in the case, and we can perceive nothing in these comments that suggests a personal opinion of the prosecutor regarding the guilt of the defendant. They constituted no more than conventional advocacy regarding how, in the state\u2019s view, the jury should view the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor impermissibly referred to the defendant\u2019s ethnicity and inability to speak English is based on the same portion of the state\u2019s final argument that we discussed in his initial claim, namely, that the state unduly burdened his right to have the proceedings translated into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>native Spanish language. As we made clear in our discussion of that claim, that portion of the state\u2019s argument, read in its proper context, was appropriately based on the evidence regarding a contested issue in the case, and had neither the intent nor the effect of commenting on the defendant\u2019s right to have the services of an interpreter during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the state improperly referred to matters not in evidence is based on two parts of its final argument. The first is that, despite the fact that there was no evidence introduced regarding the presence of a pay telephone in the area of the plaza parking lot near where, according to the defendant\u2019s testimony, his car had broken down, the state purportedly referred to such pay telephones.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we view this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>argument, however, it did not attempt to inject improper, nonevidentiary facts into the case. The references to pay telephones were simply part of the state\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s version of events was not to be believed, partly because, regardless of whether there were such telephones in the vicinity, the expected course of behavior would have been to seek such a telephone in order to seek help, rather than to do what the defendant claimed to have done in order to explain his presence at the scene of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The second aspect of this claim of the defendant is based on that portion of the state\u2019s argument referring to the defendant\u2019s likely understanding of some level of English, based on his employment at the truck stop, despite the fact that there had been no specific evidence introduced regarding whether he spoke English there.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>We can perceive nothing improper about the state\u2019s argument. It simply asked the jury to perform its appropriate function of drawing inferences from the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">This leaves the defendant\u2019s contention that the state improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s passion and emotions. This contention is based on the following portion of the argument of the prosecutor: \u201cIf I loaded that gun and shut out the lights in this courtroom and put it in his hand, I think everybody would have a very different perception of how dangerous he is.\u201d We agree with the defendant that this one sentence went beyond the bounds of proper argument, by improperly evoking feelings of fear on the part of the jurors. We disagree, however, that this one instance of improper argument is sufficient for reversal of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">First, when the defendant objected, the court in effect sustained the objection, and the state never returned to the subject. Second, the defendant did not request a curative instruction. Third, the evidence against the defendant was very strong, and his exculpatory evidence regarding the events in question was weak. Considering the isolated nature of the improper argument, we conclude that his due process right to a fair trial was not violated by the state\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-12\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the land of mental state required for commission of the crime, he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">\u201c(b) Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.

If it conveyed in the trial courtroom the meaning that the defendant attributes to it on appeal, one would expect that defense trial counsel, who was charged with the obligation of protecting his client\u2019s rights, would have at some time said so. There is no indication in this record of that happening. In fact, as the defendant demonstrates in his second set of claims on appeal, cast in terms of prosecutorial misconduct, he characterizes the language challenged here as an \u201cattempt to arouse the jury\u2019s fears over their own personal safety with the vivid suggestion that they should imagine themselves in a dark room with the defendant holding a loaded gun\u201d; he characterizes the court\u2019s ruling as a \u201cdirection to \u2018move away\u2019 from [the prosecutor\u2019s] rhetoric asking the jury to imagine the defendant in wholly fictional and menacing circumstances\u201d; and he demonstrates that trial counsel regarded the state\u2019s argument in the same manner, by having made that a ground for a posttrial motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> The defendant also makes this claim under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. Because, however, he presents no independent and adequate analysis under the state constitution, we consider his claim only under the federal constitution. See footnote 10 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> The following exchange took place during the state\u2019s final argument. The state argued: \u201c[The defendant] stays at the area of the car where they push it underneath this street light and tries to fix the car, and he\u2019s not able to fix the car. So what does he do? What would a normal person do? You\u2019d go and find a pay phone. You heard testimony it\u2019s a Stop <em>&amp; </em>Shop Plaza. There\u2019s all lands of businesses in that plaza.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The defendant objected: \u201cObjection. This is referring to facts that are not in evidence in regard to pay phones, Your Honor. No witnesses were called in that respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The court requested that the state\u2019s argument be played back by the court monitor, and without any ruling by the court the prosecutor stated: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to tell you ladies and gentlemen. You heard evidence that there was a plaza with a lot of businesses in it. Whether or not there is a pay phone there or not, would somebody think to go and look there for a pay phone? That\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to malm. I\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s a pay phone on this comer, or that there was a pay phone next door that he could have used, but, you would go and try and find a pay phone to summon help for yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">\u201cSo, what does he do? Instead of going to look for a pay phone \u2014 whether or not one is there, that\u2019s not the point \u2014 but, instead of going and looking, he decides, if you follow his version of events, that he is going to the McDonald\u2019s to find this person who just went to start work. He doesn\u2019t know the person\u2019s name. He could hardly even give a physical description of the person. He\u2019s going to go and find that person, that stranger, to make a phone call. Does that make any sense?</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">\u201cAnd he goes, actually, up to the door, and the lobby door is closed. And then if I recall correctly he said, the door was closed, he didn\u2019t know what to do, so, he sat down for a minute to think. Well, now, he can\u2019t get to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>stranger for help, so, maybe you\u2019re going to take it upon yourself to go and find a pay phone or go and find help, or do something, but, no, he decides he\u2019s got to get into that McDonald\u2019s, or he\u2019s got to find that particular person.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\u201cSo, what he\u2019s going to do, he\u2019s sitting there on the stoop at McDonald\u2019s, and he sees the cars driving around to the drive-thru, so, he decides what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll walk around to the drive-thru, and then he\u2019ll be able to communicate, I guess, with someone inside the McDonald\u2019s, and they can make the phone call for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">\u201cAs he\u2019s going around the back, that\u2019s when this person, whoever it is, pulls him in, takes his hat off, hits him in the head with a gun, and then says give me your shirt. Does that make a lot of sense?</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">\u201cAnd you heard testimony from his own mouth that he had $100 in his pocket, but, apparently, this robber is more interested in his hat and his shirt. Does that make sense?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\"> Without objection by the defendant, the state argued as follows: \u201cThe defendant got up there and testified that he doesn\u2019t understand English, doesn\u2019t speak any English. I did hear him speaking English on a few occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">\u201cHe also got up there and he testified that he had taken English at city hall. Also, he testified that he worked at the truck stop, the 76 Truck Stop in Southington.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">\u201cIf you think about the words that Miss Briggs remembers hearing. Cash register. Do you think that\u2019s a word that he might become familiar with over the years of working at a truck stop? Money. Where\u2019s the money, show me the money. That\u2019s a word that you become familiar with. Safe. Show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>me where the safe is. Another word that if you worked at a retail business for three or four years and studied some English, you would know that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">\u201cAnd what was the last thing? The manager. There was testimony about the fact that [the defendant] had a supervisor. There were people in charge of him when he worked at the truck stop for a number of years. Don\u2019t you think that the word manager would have come up? Is it that far-fetched that someone who doesn\u2019t understand that much English might know those particular words?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
