We conclude that neither the Probate Court nor the commissioner possesses such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. Michaela Lee R. (Michaela Lee), the daughter of the defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was bom in 1985. At that time, the name of her biological father was placed on her birth certificate. The father, a notorious criminal in the New Haven area who has been imprisoned for most of his adult life, never developed a relationship with the child nor contributed to her financial support. As a result, in 1994, the Probate Court for the district of Madison, terminated the parental rights of Michaela Lee\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Thereafter, the defendant, on behalf of Michaela Lee, applied to several private schools that require applicants to provide a \u201clong form\u201d birth certificate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>reviewing the application, several school officials recognized the father\u2019s name on the birth certificate and expressed concern about the possibility that he would come to campus. As a result, in February, 1996, the defendant applied to the Probate Court for the district of Madison to change Michaela Lee\u2019s surname and to remove the name of the biological father from the birth certificate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Following a hearing in March, 1996, the Probate Court granted the change of name application and ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the commissioner to remove the biological father\u2019s name from Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. The Probate Court determined that General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided courts of competent jurisdiction with the implied power to amend or to order an amendment of a birth certificate. Additionally, the Probate Court concluded that, pursuant to the commissioner\u2019s general supervisory powers over birth certificates under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-40,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the decision of the United States District Court of the District of Connecticut in <em>Darnell </em>v. Lloyd, 395 F. Sup. 1210 (D. Conn. 1975),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the commissioner had the power to amend birth certificates beyond making changes that are specifically authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Subsequently, the commissioner moved for reconsideration of the Probate Court\u2019s decision, claiming that he had not been provided with notice of the hearing and that the Probate Court\u2019s decision had been affected by factual and legal errors. The Probate Court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion, finding that notice of the hearing had been mailed to the department of public health (department) and, therefore, that the commissioner\u2019s claim was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Thereafter, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7\u00a7 45a-186 and 45a-187,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the commissioner appealed from the Probate Court\u2019s judgment to the Superior Court, arguing that only the commissioner has the authority to amend birth certificates and, therefore, that the Probate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to amend or to order the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a trial, the Superior Court, <em>DeMayo, J., </em>affirmed the judgment of the Probate Court and ordered the father\u2019s name removed from the birth certificate. The trial court, sitting as the Probate Court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> concluded that, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-98 (a),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides probate courts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the power to make orders to carry into effect the power and jurisdiction conferred on them, and General Statutes \u00a7 45a-99, which permits probate courts to grant an application for a change of name,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Probate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>had subject matter jurisdiction over the request for an amendment to the birth certificate. The trial court further concluded that probate courts have the equitable power to amend birth certificates to remove parental information when they find that an amendment is in the child\u2019s best interest and protects the child\u2019s reputation and privacy rights. Finally, the trial court concluded that, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7\u00a7 19a-41 and 19a-42 (e),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the commissioner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>authorized to amend the birth certificate, and, accordingly, ordered the commissioner to execute the Probate Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The commissioner claims on appeal that, because nothing in the General Statutes expressly authorizes probate courts to order the removal of accurate information from a birth certificate, the trial court improperly concluded that the Probate Court had subject matter jurisdiction to order the removal of the biological father\u2019s name from Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. The commissioner also argues that the Probate Court\u2019s implied and equitable powers do not provide that court with jurisdiction to amend birth certificates in the requested manner. Additionally, the commissioner contends that even <em>he </em>does not have the power to remove the father\u2019s name, because, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7\u00a7 7-42<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 19a-42,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> he may amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>birth certificates only to correct errors or omissions regarding parentage, and the defendant does not seek amendment on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The defendant argues in response that the Probate Court had the authority to order the amendment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate pursuant to both its explicit and implied statutory powers. Additionally, the defendant asserts that, because Michaela Lee\u2019s privacy interests are implicated, the commissioner must demonstrate a substantial state interest in not deleting the biological father\u2019s name. The defendant also renews several procedural claims made before the trial court as alternate grounds upon which to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The commissioner first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the Probate Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s request for a birth certificate amendment. According to the commissioner, nothing in the statutory, implied or equitable powers of probate courts provides them with such jurisdiction. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We begin by outlining the jurisdiction of probate courts and the statutory provisions specifically regarding amendments to birth certificates. It is well established that courts of probate are statutory tribunals that have no common-law jurisdiction. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 366 n.18, 488 A.2d 790 (1985); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>160 Conn. 415, 428, 279 A.2d 726 (1971); <em>Brownell </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>143 Conn. 662, 665, 124 A.2d 901 (1956); <em>Killen v. Klebanoff </em>140 Conn. 111, 115, 98 A.2d 520 (1953); <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Alcorn, </em>140 Conn. 96, 100, 99 A.2d 97 (1953). Accordingly, they \u201ccan exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by statute. . . . They have jurisdiction only when the facts exist on which the legislature has conditioned the exercise of their power. . . . <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); <em>Killen </em>v. <em>Klebanoff </em>[supra, 115]; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>120 Conn. 405, 408-409, 182 A. 138 (1935). [A] court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation. <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from </em>Probate, 199 Conn. 524, 528-29, 509 A.2d 1 (1986); <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., </em>150 Conn. 563, 565, 192 A.2d 44 (1963).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Baby Z., </em>247 Conn. 474, 485-86, 724 A.2d 1035 (1999); see also <em>Dept. of Social Services </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>247 Conn. 686, 708, 724 A.2d 1093 (1999); <em>Carten </em>v. <em>Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 614, 219 A.2d 711 (1966). \u201cOrdinarily, therefore, whether a Probate Court has jurisdiction to enter a given order depends upon the interpretation of a statute. [1 W. Locke &amp; P. Kohn, Connecticut Probate Practice (1950) p. 76].\u201d <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Alcorn, </em>supra, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Chapter 801a of the General Statutes outlines the jurisdiction and powers of probate courts. In addition to various powers regarding wills and estates, probate courts are provided with the authority to \u201cmake any lawful orders or decrees to carry into effect the power and jurisdiction conferred upon them by the laws of this state.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (6). Additionally, \u00a7 45a-99; see footnote 4 of this opinion; provides probate courts with the jurisdictional authority to grant applications for a change of name.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Other sections of the General Statutes also address the jurisdiction of probate courts. In particular, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-736 permits probate courts to change the name of an adopted person as part of its approval of an adoption agreement. See footnote 12 of this opinion. We note that none of these sections addresses the power of probate courts to amend birth certificates or to order the department to amend birth certificates beyond the specific situations cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-42 through 7-59 and \u00a7\u00a7 19a-40 through 19a-42 govern the issuance and amendment of birth certificates. Local registrars of vital statistics<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> may amend birth certificates \u201cwhenever [she or] he discovers errors upon the face thereof . . . except that all errors or omissions concerned with questions of parentage shall be within the sole jurisdiction of the [department] as provided in section 19a-42. ...\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 7-42. Section 19a-42 further governs the amendment, by the commissioner, of birth certificates and other vital records<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> by prescribing the procedures for amending such documents; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (b); and permitting amendments in certain limited circumstances. That statute also mandates that birth certificates \u201cbe amended only in accordance with sections 19a-41 to 19a-45, inclusive, chapter 93 and regulations adopted by the [commissioner] pursuant to chapter 54. . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (a). Additionally, \u00a7 19a-42 (c) permits the commissioner to amend birth certificates upon the establishment of paternity to reflect the paternity and change the child\u2019s surname. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 7-50<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> similarly permits the department to amend a birth certificate upon the establishment of paternity. Section 19a-42 (d) also permits the commissioner to amend birth certificates to reflect a new name upon the issuance of a change of name order by a court of competent jurisdiction. We note that none of the aforementioned provisions in any way confers on the Probate Court the power to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>birth certificates. With these provisions in mind, we turn our attention to the commissioner\u2019s first argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The trial court determined that the Probate Court had jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 19a-42 (d), to order an amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. We agree with the commissioner that our holding in this case is governed by the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 7-42 and 19a-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Whether the Probate Court had subject matter jurisdiction to order the removal of the biological father\u2019s name from the birth certificate involves a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 455, 724 A.2d 481 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">As with all issues of statutory interpretation, we look first to the language of the statute. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986). Nothing in the language of any statute provides probate courts with jurisdiction to order the deletion of a parent\u2019s name from a birth certificate. See <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>17 Conn. App. 627, 631-32, 554 A.2d 1109 (1989) (no statute expressly conferred jurisdiction on Superior Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>change name of minor child). Additionally, General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 7-42 specifically addresses amendments to birth certificates regarding parentage information and provides that \u201call errors or omissions concerned with questions of parentage shall be within the <em>sole jurisdiction </em>of the [department] as provided in section 19a-42 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The clear and unambiguous language of this provision vests <em>sole </em>authority concerning matters of parentage on birth certificates with the department, thereby removing it from the jurisdiction of local registrars of vital statistics and presumably from courts of probate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>according to the express terms of \u00a7 7-42, the Probate Court did not have jurisdiction to amend or order an amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate to remove her biological father\u2019s name. See <em>In re Baby Z., </em>supra, 247 Conn. 490 (Probate Court did not have jurisdiction where no statute conferred jurisdiction and another statute explicitly provided adoption review board with jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Furthermore, General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (a), to which \u00a7 7-42 refers, explicitly provides that birth certificates may be amended \u201conly in accordance with sections 19a-41 to 19a-45, inclusive, chapter 93 and regulations adopted by the [commissioner] . . . .\u2019\u2019That section, therefore, provides the only methods for amending birth certificates. None of the provisions cited, \u00a7\u00a7 19a-41 through 19a-45, chapter 93 or the department\u2019s regulations, provides a method by which courts of probate may order the commissioner to amend a birth certificate to remove the accurate name of a biological parent. Therefore, because birth certificates may be amended solely in accordance with these provisions and because these provisions do not provide express authority for probate courts to amend birth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>certificates, \u00a7 19a-42 (a) supports the conclusion that the Probate Court was without jurisdiction to order an amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 7-42 also supports the conclusion that the Probate Court did not have jurisdiction to order the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. The debate surrounding the enactment of the relevant portion of \u00a7 7-42 is highly indicative of the legislature\u2019s intention regarding alterations to birth certificates involving parentage. In 1969, the legislature amended \u00a7 7-42 to add the language vesting authority over errors and omissions concerning parentage with the department. In explaining the purpose of the bill, Senator Jay W. Jackson explained that \u201cthis [bill] takes away from the town clerks the power to correct errors on the face of their records on <em>all matters </em>concerned with questions of parentage and gives the powers to the state department of health.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 13 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1969 Sess., p. 1948. Although the Senator\u2019s statements do not specifically discuss the power of courts of probate, they demonstrate an intention to vest sole responsibility for any alterations to birth certificates regarding parentage with the department. Accordingly, this statement supports the conclusion that the department has sole jurisdiction over matters concerning parentage recorded on birth certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Our conclusion that the Probate Court did not have jurisdiction to order an amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate in these circumstances also comports with the legislative purpose underlying our vital records statutes. In examining the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting the vital records statutes, we consider the statutory scheme as a whole and presume that the legislature intended to create a harmonious body of law. <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 388, 698 A.2d 859 (1997); <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>Reliable Refuse Co., </em>212 Conn. 661, 677, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989); <em>Powers </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Ulichny, </em>185 Conn. 145, 149, 440 A.2d 885 (1981). It is emphasized that vital records may be amended only in certain limited circumstances in order \u201c[t]o protect the integrity and accuracy of vital records . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (a). As the legislature recognized in \u00a7 19a-42 (a), the accuracy and reliability of these records is vital to the many purposes for which they are used.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Vesting authority to amend these documents with the commissioner, who may only correct errors or omissions concerning parentage, provides a uniform system of amending vital records and protects their integrity and accuracy. Accordingly, having examined the statutes relating to the amendment of birth certificates, we conclude that the legislature did not choose to grant probate courts the jurisdiction to order the amendment of birth certificates to remove the accurate name of a biological parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Because nothing in the language of \u00a7 7-42, \u00a7 19a-42 or any other vital records statute permits probate courts to amend birth certificates to remove accurate parental information, and probate courts may exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by statute; see <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 428; we agree with the commissioner that the Probate Court was without jurisdiction to order an amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The defendant contends that, as the trial court concluded, the Probate Court had implied jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>derived from \u00a7\u00a7 45a-99, 45a-736 and 46b-172a to order the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We first note that the statutory sections cited by the defendant and the trial court do not relate specifically to the amendment of birth certificates. Section 45a-99; see footnote 4 of this opinion; provides courts of probate with the jurisdiction to grant applications for a change of name.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Probate courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court over this subject area. Section 45a-736 authorizes probate courts to change the name of an adopted child as part of the approval of an adoption agreement, and \u00a7 46b-172a permits courts of probate to adjudicate claims of paternity. See footnote 12 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The defendant argues, and the trial court agreed, that these statutory sections provide probate courts with implicit jurisdiction to amend parental information recorded on a child\u2019s birth certificate. The trial court explained that, in particular, \u00a7\u00a7 45a-736 and 46b-172a implicitly require probate courts to amend birth certificates to change parental information. The trial court explained that, in cases of adoption or the establishment of paternity, these sections permit probate courts to order the removal of a biological parent\u2019s name from the birth certificate and the insertion of the name of the adoptive parent or the name of the biological father established by the paternity proceeding. The trial court concluded that these provisions \u201creflect a legislative policy supportive of such changes\u201d and imply that probate courts may amend other information relevant to an individual\u2019s legal identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of these provisions and its conclusion regarding the Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>bate Court\u2019s implied powers in the circumstances of the present case. Because we have concluded herein that \u00a7\u00a7 7-42 and 19a-42 expressly vest sole authority over the amendment of parental information on birth certificates with the department, we do not interpret \u00a7\u00a7 45a-99, 45a-736 or 46b-172a as providing implicit jurisdiction to the Probate Court to amend the birth certificate in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The limitations on the implied powers of probate courts are well established. We have recognized previously that, in addition to express statutory powers, probate courts also have those powers that are reasonably implied by statute. See <em>Dept. of Social Services </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 708; <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>158 Conn. 286, 293-94, 259 A.2d 621 (1969). Exercise of implied or incidental powers, however, must be <em>necessary </em>for the Probate Court to carry out its statutory duties and to exercise the jurisdiction expressly conferred. See <em>Dept. of Social Services </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>supra, 708; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Meriden Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co., </em>103 Conn. 226, 230, 130 A. 157 (1925); <em>Massey </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>92 Conn. 25, 26, 101 A. 499 (1917). The test of necessity, therefore, is whether the existence of an implied power is necessary for the Probate Court to discharge a duty committed to it by statute. 1W. Locke &amp; P. Kohn, supra, \u00a7 87. Thus, any power implied from \u00a7\u00a7 45a-99, 45a-736 or 46b-172a must be necessary for the Probate Court to exercise ot\u00edrer powers and duties that have been granted expressly by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">None of the provisions cited by the defendant discusses the power of probate courts to amend birth certificates even in the narrow circumstances to which each section pertains. Section 45a-99 provides probate courts with jurisdiction to act upon an application for a change of name, but does not provide any authority for probate courts to amend the applicant\u2019s birth certificate to reflect the new name. Rather, the department, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>pursuant to the express language of \u00a7 19a-42 (d), amends the birth certificate upon receipt of a change of name order from a Probate Court and upon request of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Similarly, \u00a7 45a-736 permits probate courts to change an adoptee\u2019s name upon request of the adopting parent or parents as part of its approval of the adoption agreement. This section, however, does not provide probate courts with the jurisdiction to amend the adopted person\u2019s birth certificate by inserting the new name. The department again has jurisdiction over this area pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 7-53.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In cases of adoption, the department does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>amend the original birth certificate to eliminate the biological parents, but, rather, issues a new birth certificate reflecting the names of the adoptive parents, upon receipt of the record of adoption.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Both copies of the birth certificate remain on file and the original certificate may be examined in certain limited circumstances. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-736. Thus, \u00a7 45a-736 does not provide probate courts with jurisdiction to order the commissioner to issue a new or amended certificate in cases of adoption, and \u00a7 7-53 expressly delegates jurisdiction over this area to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Finally, \u00a7 46b-172a provides probate courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims of paternity by a putative father. The section does not, however, permit probate courts to change a child\u2019s name upon the establishment of paternity or to amend the child\u2019s birth certificate to reflect the name of the father. In fact, the section fails even to mention either of those issues. Rather, as we have noted herein; see footnote 20 of this opinion; pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>suant to \u00a7\u00a7 7-50 and 19a-42 (c), the commissioner has the authority to amend a birth certificate to show the adjudication of paternity if paternity is not already indicated on the birth certificate or to change the child\u2019s name. Accordingly, as in \u00a7\u00a7 45a-99 and 45a-736, nothing in the language of \u00a7 46b-172a permits probate courts to amend birth certificates even in the narrow circumstance of a paternity adjudication, and other statutes\u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 7-50 and 19a-42 (c) \u2014 expressly provide jurisdiction over the matter elsewhere.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Finally, we note that the exercise of implicit jurisdiction to amend birth certificates is not necessary for probate courts to carry out any of their other statutory duties. See <em>Marcus' Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 528-29. Probate courts are not required to remove parental information from birth certificates under any provision of the General Statutes. Additionally, the implied power to amend birth certificates is not \u201cnecessary\u201d for probate courts to carry out any of their statutory duties, such as reviewing change of name applications and adjudicating paternity. In the circumstances of the present case, the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate was not necessary to the Probate Court\u2019s resolution of the matter before it, namely, the change of name application. The Probate Court was able to exercise its power under \u00a7 45a-99 to grant the name change without amending the birth certificate to delete the father\u2019s name. \u201cThe test is the necessity\u201d; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>63 Conn. 332, 342, 28 A. 544 (1893); and the present case fails that test. We agree with the commissioner, therefore, that \u201c[njothing in [\u00a7\u00a7 45a-99, 45a-736 and 46b-172a] remotely suggests that the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ture, in enacting [those statutes] intended to give probate courts the power to order the amendment of birth records to remove accurate information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The commissioner also claims that the trial court improperly ruled that it was within the equitable powers of the Probate Court to order the commissioner to amend Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. We agree with the commissioner and conclude that, in the circumstances of the present case, it was not proper for the Probate Court to exercise its equitable powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">We have emphasized the narrow limits of probate courts\u2019 equitable powers in a long line of cases extending over more than one century. \u201c[C]ourts of probate do not have any general equity jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 63 Conn. 344; <em>see Killen v. Klebanoff, </em>supra, 140 Conn. 118. Similar to implied powers, probate courts possess only those equitable powers as are necessary for the performance of their statutory duties. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>supra, 344. \u201c[T]he equity which the Probate Court administers must grow out of and be inseparably connected with the matter the court is acting upon.\u201d <em>Killen </em>v. <em>Klebanoff, </em>supra, 118; see <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, 160 Conn. 429; <em>Hewitt\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>53 Conn. 24, 37, 1 A. 815 (1885). \u201cThe situation, therefore, in which the Probate Court may exercise equitable jurisdiction must be one which arises within the framework of a matter already before it, and wherein the application of equity is but a necessary step in the direction of the final determination of the entire matter.\u201d <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>supra, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">We have concluded herein; see part IB of this opinion; that the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate was not necessaiy to the performance of any of the Probate Court\u2019s statutory duties. Additionally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>removal of the biological father\u2019s name was not inseparably connected to any of the issues properly before the Probate Court. Although the defendant applied to the Probate Court for both a change of name order and deletion of the father\u2019s name from the birth certificate, as we have concluded, no statutory provision provided the Probate Court with jurisdiction to amend the birth certificate. Additionally, the removal of the father\u2019s name was not \u201ca necessary step in the final determination\u201d of the change of name application, the only matter properly before the Probate Court. Accordingly, we conclude that the prerequisites for the Probate Court\u2019s exercise of its equitable powers were not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The commissioner also challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the commissioner had the authority to amend the birth certificate. First, the commissioner asserts that even he did not have the statutory authority to delete the name of Miehaela Lee\u2019s biological father from her birth certificate. The commissioner also argues that the trial court improperly considered Miehaela Lee\u2019s privacy interests in sustaining the Probate Court\u2019s order. The defendant contends, to the contrary, that the trial court correctly noted that, because the birth certificate implicated Miehaela Lee\u2019s constitutionally protected privacy interests, the commissioner was required to demonstrate a substantial reason for refusing to amend her birth certificate. Although we conclude that the commissioner has jurisdiction over the amendment of parental information on birth certificates, we agree with the commissioner that he does not have the authority to amend birth certificates unless the parental information contains an error or omission. We also conclude that the presence of her father\u2019s name on Miehaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate does not implicate a constitutional right to privacy. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>reverse the judgment of the trial court ordering the commissioner to amend Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The trial court concluded that, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 19a-41 and 19a-42 (e), the commissioner had the authority to obey the order of the Probate Court and amend Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. The commissioner claims that, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7-42 and 19a-42, he may amend parental information contained on birth certificates only when there is an error or omission in the information. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The issue of whether the commissioner had the authority to follow the directive of the Probate Court is a question of statutory interpretation. Accordingly, we are guided by the aforementioned principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Whether the commissioner had the authority to amend the birth certificate raises the distinction between the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction over the amendment of birth certificates and his authority to act in the specific manner requested. \u201cWant of jurisdiction is one thing, and an erroneous exercise of an admitted jurisdiction is quite another; although the line that separates the one from the other is not always a plain one.\u201d <em>Terry\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>67 Conn. 181, 185, 34 A. 1032 (1896). Additionally, \u201can administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority . . . .It cannot modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Section 19a-41, relied on by the trial court, provides the commissioner with general jurisdiction over the amendment of vital records and directs him to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>regulations to carry out this duty. Section 19a-42 (e), also relied on by the trial court, directs the commissioner to hold hearings if he has cause to doubt the validity or accuracy of information submitted in support of an amendment. As previously discussed, \u00a7\u00a7 7-50 and 19a-42 (c) permit the department or the commissioner to amend a birth certificate upon the establishment of paternity. Additionally, \u00a7 19a-42 (d) directs the department to amend a birth certificate to show a new name upon receipt of a change of name order from a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject area of amendments to birth certificates is not unlimited, however, and must be exercised within the parameters of the relevant statutory provisions. See <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 728, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999) (\u201c \u2018[t]he power of the [commissioner] to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, although the commissioner has the general jurisdiction to amend birth certificates, he retains the authority to amend only in the specific manner permitted by statute. In the present case, the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate to remove her father\u2019s name exceeds the commissioner\u2019s express authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (a) limits the commissioner\u2019s authority to amend vital records by providing that \u201ca certificate . . . may be amended only in accordance with sections 19a-41 to 19a-45, inclusive, chapter 93 and regulations adopted by the [commissioner] pursuant to chapter 54. ...\u201d None of the statutory provisions cited in this subsection permits the commissioner to amend parental information on birth certificates in the manner requested in the present case. Section 7-42 further restricts the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>authority to amend birth certificates. That provision specifically limits amendments of parental information to the correction of \u201cerrors or omissions concerned with questions of parentage ... as provided in section 19a-42 . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 7-42. Thus, under \u00a7 7-42, the authority of the commissioner to amend parental information on birth certificates is expressly limited. In the present case, there is no suggestion that the father\u2019s name on Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate was inaccurate. Accordingly, the commissioner did not have the authority to amend the birth certificate to delete the father\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We conclude that the commissioner had jurisdiction over the matter of the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate but did not have the authority to take the requested action. See <em>Cantoni </em>v. <em>Xerox </em>Corp., 251 Conn. 153, 164, 740 A.2d 796 (1999) (distinguishing between jurisdiction and authority to act); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 267-68 n.4, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999); <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 728-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The defendant relies primarily on <em>Darnell </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>supra, 395 F. Sup. 1210, in arguing that, because Michaela Lee\u2019s privacy interests are implicated, the commissioner must demonstrate a substantial state interest in not deleting the biological father\u2019s name from the birth certificate. In <em>Darnell, </em>the United States District Court concluded that the commissioner\u2019s refusal to change the sex recorded on the plaintiffs birth certificate from male to female in order to reflect her sex reassignment surgery, potentially implicated the plaintiffs rights to marriage, travel and privacy. Id., 1214. The court concluded, therefore, that the commissioner, in refusing to amend the birth certificate, was required to show a substantial state interest sufficient to over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>come the plaintiffs privacy interests.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Id. While not specifically reaching the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the trial court in the present case also noted that the state\u2019s control over birth certificates implicated Michaela Lee\u2019s reputational and privacy interests and the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to care, manage and control her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The commissioner argues that Michaela Lee\u2019s privacy interests are not implicated by the continued presence of her father\u2019s name on her birth certificate. The commissioner explains that there is no constitutional right to the nondisclosure of personal information. Additionally, the commissioner claims that, even if Michaela Lee\u2019s privacy interests are implicated, he has demonstrated a substantial state interest, namely, the accuracy and integrity of vital records \u2014 sufficient to overcome the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim. We agree with the commissioner that his refusal to amend the birth certificate did not violate Michaela Lee\u2019s privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">\u201cWhile there is no right of privacy found in any specific guarantee of the Constitution, the [United States Supreme] Court has recognized that zones of privacy may be created by more specific constitutional guarantees and thereby impose limits upon government power.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>50 Conn. App. 654, 662, 718 A.2d 1009, cert. granted, 247 Conn. 948, 723 A.2d 324 (1998). \u201c[T]he [court] has recognized a right to privacy in the penumbra of the Bill of Rights, specifically in the protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tions of the first, third, fourth and fifth amendments. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965). . . .

Ct. 564, 72 L. Ed. 944 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). Although the court has . . . construed this right to privacy narrowly; <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140, reh. denied, 478 U.S. 1039, 107 S. Ct. 29, 92 L. Ed. 2d 779 (1986); it has held that personal rights that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty ... or deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. [Id.], 192, quoting <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531 (1977).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, </em>209 Conn. 692, 699-700, 553 A.2d 596 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\u201c[Aside from the unreasonable search and seizure privacy cases, the] other right of privacy cases, while defying categorical description, deal generally with substantive aspects of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .

We conclude, however, that parental information on a birth certificate does not fall within one of the limited categories that the United States Supreme Court has determined implicates a fundamental right to privacy. Although the parental information on Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate appears to raise an issue within the protected privacy area of family relationships, the information listed on the birth certificate does not impact the most basic personal decisions such as contraception, marriage or the decision to procreate, which the court has deemed within the constitutionally protected sphere of privacy. There is no suggestion here that the state has interfered with the relationship between the defendant and her daughter. Rather, the defendant simply alleges that the publication of family information on the birth certificate implicates the right to privacy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he [defendant\u2019s] conception of privacy which [she] seeks to protect bears no analogy to those spheres of privacy which have previously won constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Felber </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>321 F. Sup. 85, 88 (D. Conn. 1970) (no constitutional right to privacy in physician-patient relationship). Accordingly, the commissioner is not required to demonstrate a substantial reason for not amending the birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We also note that, even if Michaela Lee had a constitutional right to privacy in the parental information con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>tained in her birth certificate, there is no showing here that the state violated that right by impermissibly disclosing that information. The defendant, not the state, provided the birth certificate as part of Michaela Lee\u2019s application to various schools. The state in no way forced the defendant to make this information public or published the information without her permission.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Although we recognize the difficult situation the defendant and Michaela Lee have encountered in applying for admission to private schools and acknowledge the embarrassment the father\u2019s name on the birth certificate may have caused them, the state has not created the situation. Additionally, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 7-55; see footnote 3 of this opinion; a short form birth certificate, which does not contain parental information, has the same legal effect as a long form certificate. As the commissioner acknowledged at oral argument, because pursuant to \u00a7 7-55 a short form certificate has the \u201csame force and effect\u201d as along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>form certificate, provision of a short form certificate should be sufficient for school application purposes.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Finally, we conclude that the holding in <em>Darnell </em>does not control our decision in this case. The court in <em>Darnell </em>interpreted Connecticut law regarding the powers of probate courts. Although an interpretation of our state statutes by a federal court may be persuasive authority, it, of course, is not binding on this court. See <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, 212, 603 A.2d 385 (1992); <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 301, 305, 472 A.2d 316 (1984); <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>46 Conn. App. 759, 770, 700 A.2d 1377 (1997); <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Kimberly Clark Corp., </em>28 Conn. App. 660, 672, 613 A.2d 838 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Furthermore, <em>Darnell </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Darnell, </em>the court found that the presence of the plaintiffs sex on her birth certificate potentially prevented her from obtaining a license or passport and may have barred her from marrying.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Darnell </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>supra, 395 F. Sup. 1214. Although we acknowledge that the presence of her biological father\u2019s name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>on the birth certificate may have caused Michaela Lee and the defendant embarrassment, the presence of the name will not prevent Michaela Lee from engaging in the fundamental activities that were implicated in <em>Darnell. </em>Additionally, unlike parental information, gender is listed on both the long and short form versions of birth certificates. See footnote 3 of this opinion. While Michaela Lee has the option of producing a short form birth certificate to avoid disclosing her parental information, the plaintiff in <em>Darnell </em>had no such choice.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The defendant also submits three alternate grounds for affirming the decision of the (rial court. She argues that we should uphold the decision of the trial court because: (1) the commissioner is estopped from denying jurisdiction because the department directed the defendant to the Probate Court for relief; (2) the commissioner\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the Probate Court was not timely; and (3) the commissioner improperly served the defendant with notice of his motion for appeal. We reject the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Testimony at the March 12,1992 Probate Court hearing and before the trial court established that two employees of the department of vital statistics directed the defendant to obtain a decree from the Probate Court ordering the removal of the father\u2019s name from Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. The defendant claims that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>because the department induced the defendant to seek relief in the Probate Court, the commissioner should now be estopped from denying that the Probate Court had jurisdiction to issue the order. We conclude that the requirements for estoppel against a government agency are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\u201cUnder our well-established law, any claim of estoppel is predicated on proof of two essential elements: the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. ... It is fundamental that a person who claims an estoppel must show that he has exercised due diligence to know the truth, and that he not only did not know the true state of things but also lacked any reasonably available means of acquiring knowledge. ... In addition, estoppel against a public agency is limited and may be invoked: (1) only with great caution; (2) only when the action in question has been induced by an agent having authority in such matters; and (3) only when special circumstances make it highly inequitable or oppressive not to estop the agency. <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 148, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). Finally, a claim for promissory estoppel will not he against the state unless the party claiming estoppel would be subjected to substantial loss if the public agency were permitted to negate the acts of its agents. Id.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chotkowski </em>v. <em>State, </em>240 Conn. 246, 268-69, 690 A.2d 368 (1997); see also <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 353, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The defendant has not offered any proof that the department employees were empowered to bind the commissioner and the department. See <em>Chotkowski </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>State, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 269. Additionally, the defendant has shown no special circumstances that make it highly inequitable or oppressive to estop the commissioner from denying jurisdiction. The defendant simply makes the blanket assertion that, because she followed the advice of those department employees, the commissioner is now subject to estoppel. Finally, the defendant has not demonstrated that she or Michaela Lee will be subject to substantial loss if the commissioner is permitted to negate the acts of his employees. Rather, the father\u2019s name will remain on the birth certificate and Michaela Lee\u2019s position will be unchanged from the time the defendant sought the advice of the department employees. Accordingly, because the defendant has not demonstrated that the requirements for estoppel against a government agency exist in the present case, we reject the alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The defendant also asserts that the commissioner\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Probate Court was not filed within the time limits prescribed by \u00a7 45a-187 (a). See footnote 8 of this opinion. The defendant argues that the commissioner had thirty days from the Probate Court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration on July 12, 1996, in which to appeal to the trial court. The commissioner argues in response that, because he did not have notice of the March 6, 1996 hearing before the Probate Court, pursuant to \u00a7 45a-187 (a), he had twelve months from the March 12, 1996 Probate Court order to file the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defendant raised an identical claim before the trial court in a motion to dismiss the commissioner\u2019s appeal. The trial court, <em>O\u2019Keefe, J., </em>concluded that \u00a7 45a-187 permits appeals from probate \u201cto be taken within twelve months if the aggrieved person had no notice to be present and was not present.\u201d In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court concluded that, because the plaintiff did not have notice of the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the appeal filed on October 15, 1996, within twelve months of the Probate Court order, was timely. We see no reason to depart from the judgment of the trial court and, accordingly, reject the defendant\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the commissioner\u2019s motion to appeal from the judgment of the Probate Court had been served and returned to court improperly because it had not been served twelve days prior to the return date as required by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-46 and 52-46a.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>O\u2019Keefe, J., </em>rejected an identical claim by the defendant in denying her motion to dismiss the commissioner\u2019s appeal. The trial court concluded that, although notice had not been served in compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 52-46 and 52-46a, the error in the return date was attributable to the Probate Court, not the commissioner. The trial court, citing <em>Donovan\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>40 Conn. 154, 156 (1873), denied the defendant\u2019s motion, therefore, because \u201c[a]n appeal from probate is an absolute right of an aggrieved person which cannot be deprived by any omission of Probate Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We agree with the trial court that the commissioner\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 52-46 and 52-46a was not fatal to his appeal. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-192,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>it is the duty of probate courts to make process returnable on a proper return date. Although the Probate Court specified a return date that was not in compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 52-46 and 52-46a, that omission did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over the commissioner\u2019s appeal. \u201cThe provision requiring notice is a separate section . . . from that giving a right of appeal; it relates to the duties of the Court of Probate and not of the appellant; it is merely directory; when the appeal is properly taken and allowed, the jurisdiction of the Superior Court over the cause attaches . . . .\u201d <em>Coughlan </em>v.

Although the trial court noted in its decision that the amended language in \u00a7 7-50 \u201cexpressly authorized the removal of a father\u2019s name from a child\u2019s birth certificate in paternity actions,\u201d we do not find this amendment determinative of the present case. First, the amendment permits the removal of a father\u2019s name from a birth certificate only in very limited circumstances. Specifically, the name may be removed when, following a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity or an adjudication of paternity, the father\u2019s name had been entered on the birth certificate, and then only upon the filing of a rescission, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2), in the paternity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>registry or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, \u00a7 46b-172 further limits the circumstances in which a rescission of paternity may be filed. The rescission must be filed within sixty days of the acknowledgment of paternity or prior to the date of an agreement to provide child support. After that time period, an acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged \u201conly on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-172 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The present situation differs from the circumstances to which the 1997 amendment applies. Here, the father\u2019s name had been entered on Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate at birth. The entry was not the result of a later acknowledgment of paternity or a court adjudication of paternity. Accordingly, the amendment does not apply to the circumstances of the present case. Additionally, even if the amended statutes were applicable, the amendment became effective after the relevant proceedings in this case. The relevant inquiry is whether, at the time of the Probate Court\u2019s order, it was vested with such jurisdiction. The defendant does not argue, and we do not find, that the amended statutes control the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> Vital records such as birth, marriage and death certificates are used as prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein in numerous instances.

As we previously have explained; see footnote 21 of this opinion; the data contained in vital records is used for a variety of important purposes, including governmental purposes. For example, the state uses parental information listed on birth certificates as part of its enforcement of child support obligations. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 19a-42 (c) (1). Additionally, vital records data assists the state in planning a number of public health programs. Accurate and consistent information is essential to these functions. The state, therefore, has a substantial interest in limiting alterations and amendments that potentially may jeopardize the accuracy of the records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> In <em>Darnell, </em>subsequent to the District Court\u2019s denial of the commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the parties settled the case.

The plaintiffs original gender designation was not altered and remained on the certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> Because we have concluded herein that neither the Probate Court nor the commissioner had the authority to order an amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate, we need not address the commissioner\u2019s final argument that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the commissioner had authority to amend the birth certificate was incorrect, because the amendment of Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate would jeopardize the accuracy and integrity of the vital records statutes. We have acknowledged the importance of the vital records statutes and the state\u2019s interests in maintaining the accuracy of those records, and we reiterate that conclusion here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-46 provides: \u201cTime for service.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"agl-dedup-0\">dissenting in part and concurring in the result. The majority agrees with the commissioner\u2019s claim that Michaela Lee has no constitutional right to the nondisclosure of personal information contained on a birth certificate. It suggests that privacy interests are limited to only \u201cthe most basic personal decisions such as contraception, marriage or the decision to procreate,\u201d and holds that this category does not include Michaela Lee\u2019s privacy interest in her birth records. I disagree. I do not believe that we need to decide in this case that Michaela Lee has no constitutional privacy interest in the parental information contained in the state\u2019s birth records. Instead, I would hold that she may have such an interest, but the record in this case does not show that it was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has recognized that there may be a constitutional privacy interest in public records containing sensitive personal information, and that that privacy interest should be protected by statutory confidentiality requirements. In <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 591, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1977), the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the New York State Controlled Substances Act of 1972; N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3300 et seq. (McKinney Sup. 1976-1977); which required the recording, in a centralized computer file, of the names and addresses of all persons who had obtained certain drugs pursuant to a doctor\u2019s prescription. The court wrote, \u201c[t]he cases sometimes characterized as protecting \u2018privacy\u2019 have in fact involved at least two different kinds of interests. One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions. . . . The mere existence in readily available form of the information about patients\u2019 use of Schedule II drugs creates a genuine concern that the information will become publicly known and that it will adversely affect their reputations.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 598-600. \u201cWe are not unaware of the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of vast amounts of personal information in computerized data banks or other massive government files. . . . The right to collect and use such data for public purposes is typically accompanied by a concomitant statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures. Recognizing that in some circumstances that duty arguably has its roots in the Constitution, nevertheless New York\u2019s statutory scheme, and its implementing administrative procedures, evidence a proper concern with, and protection of, the individual\u2019s interest in privacy. We therefore need not, and do not, decide any question which might be presented by the unwarranted disclosure of accumu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>lated private data \u2014 whether intentional or unintentional \u2014 or by a system that did not contain comparable security provisions. We simply hold that this record does not establish an invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., 605-606; see also id., 607 (Brennan, J., concurring) (because recordkeeping scheme contains numerous safeguards of confidentiality, it does not amount to deprivation of constitutionally protected privacy interest, and, therefore, state need not show that challenged statute is absolutely necessary to accomplish legitimate goal); <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>428 U.S. 52, 79-80, 96 S. Ct. 2831, 49 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1976) (considering state\u2019s recordkeeping requirements for health facilities and physicians concerned with abortion and holding that recordkeeping requirements that respect patient\u2019s confidentiality are permissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Relying on these cases, I would hold that Michaela Lee may have a constitutional privacy interest in her birth records, which reveal, among other things, the identity of her birth parents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the facts of this case show, there may be very good reasons, which the state should respect, that a person does not wish the information in those records to be made public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>is assumed, however, that Michaela Lee has such a constitutional right, I do not believe that that right has been infringed in this case. First, I note that the state has a substantial interest in maintaining the accuracy and integrity of birth records. The value of accurate and detailed genealogical records has been recognized since time immemorial. See, e.g., 1 Chronicles 1:1-9:44 (commonly known as \u201cthe begats\u201d). The United States Supreme Court cases suggest, however, that, even when the state has a vital interest in keeping records containing sensitive personal information, it must take steps to protect the confidentiality of those records. The statutes governing the maintenance of birth records in Connecticut do provide such protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, as the majority has noted, the state has done nothing to publicize the information on Michaela Lee\u2019s birth certificate. Rather, the defendant herself voluntarily provided the birth certificate to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In summary, I would hold that Michaela Lee may have a constitutional privacy interest in the information contained in her birth records, but that the state has a countervailing interest in maintaining complete and accurate records. Furthermore, I would find that any such interest that Michaela Lee may have is adequately protected under Connecticut\u2019s statutory recordkeeping scheme. Accordingly, I dissent in part and concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\"> Although Michaela Lee may have a privacy interest in her birth records that requires the state to take steps to maintain their confidentiality, I do not believe that Michaela Lee\u2019s interest can be extended to include a right to alter confidential records to delete information that she finds embarrassing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\"> In <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 170-71, 635 A.2d 783 (1993), this court looked to tort law to construe the phrase \u201cinvasion of personal privacy\u201d for purposes of defining the scope of that exception to the Freedom of Information Act. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2), now General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2). We held that the exception applied \u201cwhen the information sought . . . does not pertain to legitimate matters of public concern and is highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of lnforrnation Commission, </em>supra, 175. Tort law might also be the starting point for the development of a constitutional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Because, however, as stated elsewhere in this dissenting opinion, there was no disclosure of any information by the state in this case, there is no need to decide whether disclosure of birth records could, in some circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>stances, be \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person\u201d; id.; or could constitute an invasion of personal privacy in a constitutional sense. Nevertheless, I do not see any need to rule out such a possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\"> As noted in footnote 29 of the majority opinion, birth certificates are protected from general public disclosure pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-51.
