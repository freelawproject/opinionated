We conclude that those services are subject to sales and use taxes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, therefore, we reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">The relevant facts and procedural history are undisputed. At all times relevant to this appeal, the plaintiff, Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. (Oxford), was engaged in the business of removing used automobile tires from the premises of various commercial enterprises, including tire dealers and gas stations. Oxford removed the scrap tires for a fee and transported them to its facility in Plainfield, where they were sorted. Oxford thereafter delivered the tires to Exeter Energy (Exeter), a tire burning plant located in Sterling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Oxford\u2019s smaller customers typically stored scrap tires on their business premises pending their removal. Oxford\u2019s larger customers generally warehoused their scrap tires in trailers that Oxford had provided to them. Oxford served numerous customers throughout Connecticut and removed millions of scrap tires annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">During the two audit periods that are the subject of this appeal, January 1,1989, through December 31,1991, and January 1,1992, through December 31,1994, Oxford did not charge or collect sales taxes from its customers for its tire removal services. In November, 1993, the defendant, the commissioner of revenue services (commissioner), assessed sales taxes against Oxford pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-415,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>scrap tire removal services that Oxford had rendered during the audit periods. Thereafter, Oxford petitioned the commissioner for reassessment under General Statutes \u00a7 12-418,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claiming that its tire removal services were not subject to sales tax based on General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which exempts from such taxation services that are rendered in the \u201cvoluntary . . . removal of hazardous waste, as defined in [General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Statutes \u00a7] 22a-115,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or other contaminants of air, water or soil . . . .\u201d The commissioner denied Oxford\u2019s petitions, and Oxford appealed<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the Superior Court from the denial of the petitions pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-422, as amended by Public Acts 1995, Nos. 95-26, \u00a7 18, and 95-220, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>After a trial,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court found that scrap tires, when exposed to the environment over time, leach certain contaminants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the basis of this and related findings,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the court sustained the plaintiffs appeals<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and rendered judgments in favor of Oxford, concluding that the removal of scrap tires is exempt from sales tax because scrap tires constitute hazardous waste under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I). <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 508, 511, 514, 725 A.2d 1009 (1998). The trial court also noted that, even if it had found that scrap tires were not hazardous waste within the meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), the removal thereof still would be exempt from sales tax because scrap tires \u201cwould certainly constitute \u2018other contaminants of air, water [or] soil\u2019 . . . .\u201d Id., 514 n.4, quoting General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The commissioner appealed from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. On appeal, the commissioner claims that the scrap tire removal services rendered by Oxford are not exempt from sales tax under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">During the pendency of this appeal, the legislature amended the definition of hazardous waste found in \u00a7 22a-115 (1); see footnote 6 of this opinion; by expressly excluding scrap tires from the purview of that definition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Public Acts 1999, No. 99-225, \u00a7 30 (P.A. 99-225). Consequently, we, sua sponte, ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on the following two issues: \u201c(1) Is [P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30] retroactive . . . [and] (2) [i]f the answer to [the first] question ... is yes, what effect, if any, does that retroactivity have on the question of whether scrap tires are (a) hazardous waste, or (b) contaminants of air, water [or] soil, within the meaning of ... \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I)?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We conclude that: (1) P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, is retroactive and, consequently, scrap tires do not constitute hazardous waste for purposes of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I); and (2) scrap tires are not \u201ccontaminants of air, water or soil\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I). We, therefore, agree with the commissioner that the trial court improperly determined that Oxford is entitled to a sales tax exemption for its scrap tire removal services rendered during the six year period from January 1,1989, through December 31, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Before considering the commissioner\u2019s claims, we note that our resolution of the issues raised by this appeal is governed by several well established principles. First, the determination of whether Oxford\u2019s tire removal services qualify for a sales tax exemption pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) is a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>ITT Hartford, </em>251 Conn. 106, 110, 752 A.2d 1063 (1999). Second, \u201c[i]n construing any statute, [including taxing statutes] we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sharper Image Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>240 Conn. 531, 536, 692 A.2d 774 (1997). Finally, \u201c[t]o ascertain the intention of the legislature with respect to a tax exemption, we employ three overlapping presumptions. First, statutes that provide exemptions from taxation are a matter of legislative grace that must be strictly construed against the taxpayer. Second, any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. Third, the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving the error in an adverse assessment concerning an exemption. <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 365, 369, 567 A.2d 1218 (1990); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752-53, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>United Church of Christ </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>206 Conn. 711, 718-19, 539 A.2d 573 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Common Fund </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>228 Conn. 375, 380-81, 636 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>A.2d 795 (1994). Guided by these principles, we turn to the issues raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We first address the commissioner\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly determined that Oxford\u2019s tire removal services constituted services rendered in the \u201cvoluntary . . . removal of hazardous waste\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I). We are persuaded that P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, retrospectively excluded scrap tires from the applicable definition of hazardous waste and that Oxford thus cannot avail itself of the sales tax exemption for services rendered in the voluntary removal of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">As we previously have indicated, the exemption for services rendered in the removal of hazardous waste incorporates the definition of such waste under \u00a7 22a-115 (1). From the date that this action was commenced until approximately six months after the trial court had rendered judgments, \u00a7 22a-115 (1) contained no express reference to scrap tires. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Public Act 99-225, \u00a7 30, however, amended \u00a7 22a-115 (1) by explicitly excluding scrap tires from the definition of hazardous waste. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Thus, if P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, has retrospective applicability, then the scrap tire removal services rendered by Oxford do not fall within the statutory sales tax exemption for the voluntary removal of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\u201cWhether to apply [P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30] retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. ... In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of <em>presumed </em>legislative intent that statutes affecting <em>substantive </em>rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, may be rebutted when the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. . . . Where an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect. . . . We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative history to ascertain whether the legislature intended that the amendment be given retrospective effect.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden </em>F., 250 Conn. 674, 695-96, 741 A.2d 873 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The language of P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, provides no indication whether the legislature intended that it be applied prospectively only or retrospectively as well. The pertinent legislative history, however, contains compelling evidence that the legislature intended to clarify, rather than to change, the definition of hazardous waste under \u00a7 22a-115 (1). In particular, Representative Patricia Widlitz, who, along with another representative, introduced an amendment to a bill, which eventually became P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, explained that it \u201cis a <em>technical </em>amendment <em>clarifying </em>the meaning of hazardous waste.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1999 Sess., p. 2897. In the absence of anything in the scant legislative history of P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, to contradict Representative Widlitz\u2019 direct and unequivocal statement regarding the amendment\u2019s clarifying purpose, we afford substantial weight to her characterization of its objective and effect. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 40-41, 699 A.2d 101 (1997) (statements by legislators that amendment clarifies existing law signify legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>intent regarding retroactivity of amendment); <em>Edelstein </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>240 Conn. 658, 668, 692 A.2d 803 (1997) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 281-82, 528 A.2d 760 (1987) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Another \u201cfactor [that] we have deemed to be significant in determining the clarifying character of legislation is that the legislation was enacted in direct response to a judicial decision that the legislature deemed incorrect.\u201d <em>Dept. of Social Services </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>247 Conn. 686, 702, 724 A.2d 1093 (1999); see also <em>Toise v. Rowe, </em>243 Conn. 623, 628-29, 707 A.2d 25 (1998) (reasonable to conclude that prompt legislative response to controversy regarding interpretation of original act evinces legislative intent to clarify meaning of that act); <em>Edelstein </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 669 (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>239 Conn. 638, 651, 687 A.2d 134 (1997) (same). As Oxford concedes, P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, was enacted directly in response to the holding of the trial court in this case that scrap tires constitute hazardous waste under \u00a7 22a-115 (1) and that, consequently, scrap tire removal services are exempt from sales tax under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The legislature\u2019s prompt and unambiguous response to the trial court\u2019s decision provides persuasive support for the commissioner\u2019s contention that the legislature intended to clarify, rather than to change, the statutory definition of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the legislature intended P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, to be retroactive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Because the amendment makes clear that scrap tires do not constitute hazardous waste for purposes of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), we reject Oxford\u2019s claim, and the trial court\u2019s determination, to the contrary.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The commissioner also challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that Oxford is entitled to a sales tax exemption because its scrap tire removal services constitute services rendered in the voluntary removal of \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I). See <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 45 Conn. Sup. 514 n.4. Oxford asserts that its services fall within the statutory exemption for other contaminants of air, water or soil because scrap tires leach substances that contaminate the environment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree with the commissioner that scrap tires do not constitute other contaminants of air, water or soil for purposes of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Our determination of whether scrap tires constitute other contaminants of air, soil or water within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ing of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) also presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself. . . . The words of a statute are to be given their commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peabody N.E., Inc. v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>250 Conn. 105, 122, 735 A.2d 782 (1999); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Because the word \u201ccontaminant\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 12-407, \u201cit is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 263, 726 A.2d 531, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 969, 120 S. Ct. 409, 145 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1999). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ccontaminant\u201d as \u201csomething that contaminates.\u201d That dictionary defines \u201ccontaminate\u201d as \u201cto soil, stain, corrupt, or infect by contact or association . . . [to] make inferior or impure by mixture . . . [or] to render unfit for use by the introduction of unwholesome or undesirable elements . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Although scrap tires leach substances that \u201ccontaminate\u201d air, water or soil, it is the leachate, and not the scrap tire, itself, that adversely affects the air, water or soil with which it comes into contact. In other words, although scrap tires contain certain substances that may leach into the environment and contaminate it, the tires, themselves, are not the corrupting or infecting agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Oxford contends that the trial court properly determined that the sales tax exemption for other contaminants of air, water or soil applies to its scrap tire removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>services because the commissioner\u2019s own definition of \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d includes some of the substances contained in scrap tires that have been found to leach into the environment. There is no dispute that leachate from scrap tires contains some substances that fall within the commissioner\u2019s definition, particularly those substances for which the state department of environmental protection (department) or federal Environmental Protection Agency has established cleanup standards.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that this fact buttresses Oxford\u2019s claim. As we previously have explained, it is not the scrap tire, itself, that contaminates the environment, but, rather, the leachate that emanates from that tire due to the tire\u2019s exposure to the environment. It is undoubtedly for that reason that neither the department nor the Environmental Protection Agency has established cleanup standards for scrap tires; instead, the state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>federal cleanup standards apply to substances, including some of the components of scrap tires, that contaminate the environment. Thus, although those components are \u201ccontaminants,\u201d as that term has been defined by the commissioner for purposes of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), scrap tires are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Furthermore, scrap tires pose little or no threat to the environment when they are stored properly, that is, when they are stored in such a manner that the harmful substances contained therein do not leach into the environment to any appreciable extent. In such circumstances, the scrap tires reasonably cannot be characterized as contaminants, whereas the harmful substances contained therein do not lose their identity as such. This fact provides further support for the conclusion that the leachate from a scrap tire, and not the tire, itself, constitutes \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>An important and final consideration provides additional support for the statutory interpretation urged by the commissioner: if we were to construe the language, \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I); to include scrap tires, that language reasonably could be interpreted to include most, if not all, kinds of nonhazardous solid waste, including household garbage. Because many types of solid waste leach substances for which the department or the Environmental Protection Agency has established cleanup standards, a strong argument can be made that, under the statutory construction advanced by Oxford, the sales tax exemption of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) extends to all solid waste removal service providers, including refuse haulers. See footnote 20 of this opinion. We do not believe that the legislature intended to create such a broad tax exemption. Indeed, had the legislature intended to exclude all nonhazardous solid waste from the purview of our sales tax statute, it easily could have expressed this intent. See, e.g., <em>LoPresto </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 424, 435, 662 A.2d 738 (1995); <em>Rockville Fish &amp; Game Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>231 Conn. 451, 461, 650 A.2d 545 (1994). Furthermore, such a construction would be inconsistent with our long-standing precedent requiring that tax exemptions be construed strictly against the taxpayer and that any ambiguity in the language of the exemption be resolved in favor of the commissioner. E.g., <em>Common Fund </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that scrap tires are not \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I). Because we already have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>determined that scrap tires are not hazardous waste under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), the trial court improperly concluded that Oxford is entitled to a sales tax exemption for its scrap tire removal services rendered between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The judgments are reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgments for the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> Because the primary issue in this case deals with the applicability of the sales tax to scrap tire removal services, we hereinafter refer only to that tax and not to the use tax. We note, however, that our holding applies to both the sales and use taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> CMS Energy, a Michigan utility corporation, owns 100 percent of Oxford and 50 percent of Exeter.

Indeed, the analysis of the legislation contained in the official summary of the 1999 Public Acts expressly refers to the trial court\u2019s decision. See Office of Legislative Research, Connecticut General Assembly, Summary of 1999 Public Acts (1999) p. 91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> Oxford asserts that, because P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, became effective upon its passage, the legislature necessarily intended that P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, be given prospective effect only. Oxford, however, provides no support for this contention. As we previously have explained, although P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, contains no express language regarding its retrospective applicability, its legislative history convincingly demonstrates that the legislature intended to clarify the definition of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Oxford also maintains that it had a vested right to a sales tax exemption for its scrap tire removal services under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (T), and that the retrospective application of P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, violates that right. It is true that \u201c[t]he retroactive nature of clarifying legislation has limits . . . and must not operate in a manner that would unjustly abrogate vested rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">. . . A vested right is one that equates to legal or equitable title to the present or future enjoyment of property, or to the present or future enforcement of a demand, or a legal exception from a demand made by another.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Toise </em>v. Rowe, supra, 243 Conn. 631. In support of its claim, Oxford relies on testimony adduced at trial that other businesses performing scrap tire removal services were not assessed a sales tax on those services. Even if this fact were true, this fact alone is not sufficient to establish that Oxford reasonably and justifiably relied to its detriment on an expectation that it would not be assessed sales tax on its services. See id. Indeed, the department of environmental protection (department) and the Connecticut siting council (council) never have treated scrap tires as hazardous waste. Specifically, Charles W. Atkins, a department engineer, testified at trial that, since at least 1975, the department has classified scrap tires as \u201cspecial waste,\u201d and not hazardous waste; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-209-l; and, in 1996, the department issued letters to Oxford and the commissioner in which it characterized scrap tires as \u201cnonhazardous solid\u201d waste. Moreover, the council never has required scrap tire disposal plants, including Exeter; see footnote 2 of this opinion and accompanying text; to obtain permits required for the operation of a hazardous waste disposal facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b713-5\"> The sales tax exemption for services \u201crendered in the voluntary evaluation, prevention, treatment, containment or removal of . . . other contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d was enacted in 1994; Public Acts, Spec. Sess., May, 1994, No. 94-4, \u00a7 13 (Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4); but was made \u201capplicable to income years commencing on or after July 1,1989 Id., \u00a7 85. Thus, even if Oxford were to prevail on its claim that its services fall within the sales tax exemption for services \u201crendered in the voluntary . . . removal of . . . other contaminants of air, water or soil,\u201d it cannot claim an exemption from sales tax for those services rendered between January 1, 1989, and June 30, 1989, which marks the beginning of the first audit period at issue in this case, simply because such a sales tax exemption did not exist during that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\"> Oxford also contends that the legislature implicitly approved the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the language, \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil,\u201d as including scrap tires because the legislature did not expressly exclude scrap tires from that category when it amended \u00a7 22a-115 (1) in P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, in which it expressly excluded scrap tires from the definition of hazardous waste. We are not persuaded by this argument. As the trial court indicated, its decision was \u201c[b]ased upon the persuasive evidence presented by [Oxford] that scrap tires are hazardous waste.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 45 Conn. Sup. 514. It is true that the trial court also stated that, \u201ceven if [it] were to find that scrap tires were not considered hazardous waste, they would certainly constitute other contaminants of air, water [or] soil based upon the evidence presented at the trial as to their composition and propensity to break down.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 514 n.4. The court, however, rendered this alternative conclusion in a brief footnote at the end of its decision and, moreover, provided no other explanation or analysis in support of its determination. See generally id. In such circumstances, we are unwilling to conclude that the legislature\u2019s failure to address this issue in P.A. 99-225, \u00a7 30, signifies its tacit approval of the trial court\u2019s summary treatment of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) provides: \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b715-4\"> In 1995, the commissioner issued Special Notice 95(17) (notice), entitled \u201cCertain Environmental Services Excluded from Sales and Use Taxes.\u201d The notice defines \u201cother contaminants of air, water or soil\u201d under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I).

Indeed, in letters issued by the department to Oxford and the commissioner; see footnote 15 of this opinion; Michael J. Harder, the director of the permitting, enforcement and remediation division of the department\u2019s bureau of water management, explained that, in the department\u2019s view, the sales tax exemption for other contaminants of air, water or soil does not apply to the routine removal of nonhazardous solid waste. As Harder further stated in his letter to the commissioner, \u2018\u2018[w]ere it otherwise, the services retained by every municipality and every person in the [s]tate to haul away and dispose of garbage would be tax exempt.\u201d According to Harder, prior to Public Acts, Spec.

[The 1994 amendment] did no more than extend this policy to (i) clean-ups of substances in addition to hazardous waste which do or may threaten human health or the environment and (ii) activities \u2014 evaluation and treatment \u2014 often associated, frequently as necessary preconditions, with clean-ups of environmental releases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Harder testified at trial and reiterated the department\u2019s interpretation of the exemption for other contaminants of air, water or soil under \u00a7 12-407 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(2) (i) (I). Although Harder acknowledged that scrap tires are a potential source of environmental contamination, he testified that the substances that leach from the tires, and not the tires, themselves, create the risk of contamination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
