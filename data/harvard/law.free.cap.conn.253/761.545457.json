The principal issues in this appeal are: (1) whether the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into the definition of \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) if so, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim a deduction under the tax benefit rule due to the pass-through of certain losses incurred by subchapter S corporations of which William Berkley was a shareholder, even though the plaintiffs previously had avoided paying $1,297,189.63 in Connecticut capital gains, dividends and interest taxes as a result of those same passed-through losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We conclude that the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into the definition of adjusted gross income contained in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). We further conclude that the plaintiffs had already received a tax benefit due to the aforementioned losses by virtue of the resultant reduction in their 1988,1989, and 1990 federal adjusted gross income, which allowed them to avoid paying $1,297,189.63 in Connecticut capital gains, dividends and interest taxes. Therefore, they were not entitled to claim such a benefit a second time on their 1994 Connecticut income tax return. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The parties in this case have stipulated to the following relevant facts. The plaintiffs are a married couple residing in Greenwich. William Berkley was a shareholder in three S corporations:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Farm Acquisition Corporation (Farm Acquisition), Interlaken Grove Investors, Inc. (Interlaken Grove), and Caring Communities, Inc. (Caring Communities). Two of those corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>rations, Farm Acquisition and Caring Communities, reported ordinary losses on their 1988, 1989, and 1990 federal income tax returns and the third corporation, Interlaken Grove, reported ordinary losses on its 1989 and 1990 tax returns. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1366 (a) (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiffs deducted William Berkley\u2019s pro rata share of the losses reported by Farm Acquisition and Caring Communities on their federal income tax returns for those three years, and his pro rata share of the losses reported by Interlaken Grove for the 1989 and 1990 tax years. William Berkley\u2019s bases in the stock of those three corporations then was reduced by the amount of the deductions. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">During 1988, 1989 and 1990, Connecticut imposed a tax on capital gains, dividends and interest income (capital gains tax) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-505 through 12-522, but did not tax any other income. For each of those years, the tax rates on capital gains, dividends and interest income were tied to the taxpayer\u2019s federal adjusted gross income.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If, however, a tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>payer\u2019s federal adjusted gross income fell below a certain level, that taxpayer had no obligation to pay Connecticut\u2019s capital gains tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">As a result of the losses passed through the three S corporations in which William Berkley was a shareholder, the plaintiffs\u2019 federal adjusted gross income for the tax years 1988,1989 and 1990 was negative. Accordingly, the plaintiffs paid no state capital gains tax for those three years. If the plaintiffs\u2019 federal adjusted gross income for those years had not been reduced by their deduction of the pass-through <em>losses </em>from the three S corporations, the plaintiffs would have owed a total of $1,297,189.63 in state capital gains taxes for those three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">For the 1994 tax year, the plaintiffs reported \u201cworthless stock\u201d losses for federal income tax purposes with respect to William Berkley\u2019s stock in all three S corporations. At that time, his bases in the stock of the three S corporations had been reduced to $3,623,671. The federal tax code allowed the plaintiffs to deduct the adjusted bases of $3,623,671 from their 1994 long-term capital gains reported in their 1994 federal income tax return. The plaintiffs\u2019 federal adjusted gross income for the 1994 tax year was $8,342,817.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In October, 1995, the plaintiffs timely filed a \u201cForm CT-1040 Connecticut Resident Income Tax Return\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the 1994 tax year, on which they reported an overpayment of $496,123. In computing their 1994 Connecticut taxable income, the plaintiffs subtracted from their federal adjusted gross income of $8,342,817, the sum of $9,743,387, representing the aggregate reductions to the bases of the stock held by William Berkley in the three S corporations in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The plaintiffs subsequently agreed to limit the contested basis adjustment to $6,541,489, representing the total basis adjustment excluding depreciation and amortization.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the plaintiffs\u2019 deduction of the basis adjustment from the Connecticut basis in William Berkley\u2019s S corporation stock in computing their Connecticut adjusted gross income for 1994 were permissible, the plaintiffs would be entitled to a refund of $294,367, plus interest, for the 1994 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In addition, the record reveals the following other relevant facts. In February, 1996, the defendant notified the plaintiffs of a proposed recalculation of their 1994 Connecticut income tax, under which the defendant intended to assess against the plaintiffs an additional liability of $393,263.01. In April, 1996, the defendant sent a notice of the additional assessment to the plaintiffs. On May 17,1996, the plaintiffs appealed the defendant\u2019s assessment to the Tax Session of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The trial court issued a written memorandum of decision in favor of the defendant. In that memorandum, the trial court initially concluded that \u201c[t]he tax benefit rule is alive and well in Connecticut.\u201d The trial court further concluded, however, that \u201cthe [plaintiffs] avoided paying a Connecticut [capital gains tax] on a substantial amount of income because . . . the pass-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>through losses of the three S corporations were used in the determination of their federal adjusted gross income for 1989-90. They are not now entitled to a double benefit by excluding the losses in the determination of the basis of the three S corporations for capital gains purposes in determining their adjusted gross income under the Connecticut personal income tax.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. Thereafter, the plaintiffs appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we granted the defendant\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that, although the trial court properly concluded that the federal tax benefit rule applies to Connecticut\u2019s personal income tax, the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 S coiporation losses could not be excluded, pursuant to the tax benefit rule, from the plaintiffs\u2019 Connecticut adjusted gross income. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">At the outset, a brief explanation of the federal tax benefit rule is warranted. The tax benefit rule is \u201ca judicially developed principle that allays some of the inflexibilities of the annual accounting system. An annual accounting system is a practical necessity if the federal income tax is to produce revenue ascertainable and payable at regular intervals. <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Sanford &amp; Brooks Co., </em>282 U.S. 359, 365, [51 S. Ct. 150, 75 L. Ed. 2 383] (1931). Nevertheless, strict adherence to an annual accounting system would create transactional inequities. Often an apparently completed transaction will reopen unexpectedly in a subsequent tax year, rendering the initial reporting improper. For instance, if a taxpayer held a note that became apparently uncollect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ible early in the taxable year, but the debtor made an unexpected financial recovery before the close of the year and paid the debt, the transaction would have no tax consequences for the taxpayer, for the repayment of the principal would be recovery of capital. If, however, the debtor\u2019s financial recovery and the resulting repayment took place after the close of the taxable year, the taxpayer would have a deduction for the apparently bad debt in the first year under \u00a7 166 (a) of the [Internal Revenue] Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166 (a). Without the tax benefit rule, the repayment in the second year, representing a return of capital, would not be taxable. The second transaction, then, although economically identical to the first, could, because of the differences in accounting, yield drastically different tax consequences. The Government, by allowing a deduction that it could not have known to be improper at the time, would be foreclosed from recouping any of the tax saved because of the improper deduction. Recognizing and seeking to avoid the possible distortions of income, the courts have long required the taxpayer to recognize the repayment in the second year as income.\u201d <em>Hillsboro National Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>460 U.S. 370, 377-79, 103 S. Ct. 1134, 75 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The tax benefit rule may be illustrated further by the following hypothetical example: If a taxpayer is owed $100 in connection with his trade or business and the debtor fails to pay the debt when it is due, the taxpayer may deduct the $100 loss as a bad debt. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166 (a) (1). If the taxpayer\u2019s taxes, are reduced as a result of the deduction (in other words, if he receives a \u201ctax benefit\u201d), and the taxpayer recovers the debt in a subsequent tax year, he must report the $100 as income. This represents the \u201cinclusionary\u201d aspect of the rule. See <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>936 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1991). If, however, the taxpayer received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>no tax benefit from the original deduction, he is not required to report the subsequent recovery, because he never received any tax benefit as a result of the loss. This represents the \u201cexclusionary\u201d aspect of the rule. See id.; see also 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (a) (\u201c[g]ross income does not include income attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any amount deducted in any prior taxable year to the extent such amount did not reduce the amount of tax imposed by this chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Having delineated the parameters of the federal tax benefit rule, we now turn to the first issue in this appeal, namely, whether the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into Connecticut\u2019s definition of adjusted gross income contained in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). The trial court concluded that the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into Connecticut\u2019s personal income tax scheme. The plaintiffs contend that, in this respect, the trial court was correct. The defendant, to the contrary, contends that the federal tax benefit rule is not incorporated into our personal income tax scheme. We agree with the trial court and the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The question of whether the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) is one of statutory interpretation, which we review according to well settled principles. \u201cStatutory interpretation is a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. ... In construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number><em>alty Ins.

This definition is a part of Connecticut\u2019s overall personal income tax scheme. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-700 et seq. Section 12-701 (a) (20)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> further modifies the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>tion contained in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) by enumerating eigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>teen specific modifications, none of which is relevant to this case, that may be made to a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The central question that \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) raises, but does not answer, is whether the phrase \u201cas determined for federal income tax purposes,\u201d means as determined in accordance with federal income tax methodology, or as reported on a taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return. Although there is no legislative history on this point, an examination of our prior case law leads us to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>elude that the former interpretation is the correct one, and that, therefore, \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) does incorporate the federal tax benefit rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We long have held that \u201cwhen our tax statutes refer to the federal tax code, federal tax concepts are incorporated into state law. <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>196 Conn. 1, 7, 490 A.2d 991 (1985); <em>Yaeger v. Dubno, </em>188 Conn. 206, 210, 211-12, 449 A.2d 144 (1982); <em>Woodruff v. Tax Commissioner, </em>185 Conn. 186, 191, 440 A.2d 854 (1981); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>163 Conn. 520, 525, 313 A.2d 49 (1972); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 518-19, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973); <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>142 Conn. 483, 489-93, 115 A.2d 455 (1955), appeal dismissed, 350 U.S. 927, 76 S. Ct. 305, 100 L. Ed. 811 (1956); <em>McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>130 Conn. 460, 461-64, 35 A.2d 865 (1944).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 133, 139, 506 A.2d 93 (1986). Although this rule does not require the wholesale incorporation of the entire body of federal tax principles into our state income tax scheme, where a reference to the federal tax code expressly is made in the language of a statute, and where incorporation of federal tax principles makes sense in light of the statutory language at issue, our prior cases uniformly have held that incorporation should take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\"><em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 133, is an excellent example of such a scenario. The issue in <em>Harper </em>was whether patent sales fell within the ambit of the definition of taxable gains contained in General Statutes (Rev. to 1973) \u00a7 12-505, as amended by Public Acts 1973, No. 73-356, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which expressly defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>taxable gains as \u201cnet gain <em>as determined for federal income tax purposes </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 139. We therefore referred to the federal tax code\u2019s treatment of patent sales in order to determine whether such sales constituted taxable gains. Id. <em>Harper </em>is not the only case in which we have employed such an approach. See, e.g., <em>The B. F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 7 (lack of any reference to federal tax code in text of General Statutes \u00a7 12-218 [2] meant court would not incorporate federal tax principles); <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 190-91 (\u00a7 12-505 specifically incorporates \u201cfederal income tax scheme\u201d); <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 492 (statutory definition of gross income \u201c \u2018as defined in the federal corporation net income tax law\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">It is a generally accepted principle that we construe statutes in accordance with the dictates of logic and common sense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 550, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999). On the basis of this principle, we have, in the past, construed general statutory references to the federal tax code as incorporating federal tax principles into our statutes. We see no reason to reverse this policy, and to hamstring our legislature by requiring it to anticipate, and specifically refer to each and every doctrine of federal tax law whenever it concludes that employing federal tax methodology would be beneficial. We therefore conclude that the phrase \u201cas determined for federal income tax purposes\u201d contained in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) incorporates the federal tax benefit rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The defendant advances two principal arguments in support of his claim that the federal tax benefit rule is not incorporated into \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). We find neither of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>The defendant first contends that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 19, 566 A.2d 658 (1989), militates against the incorporation of the tax benefit rule into \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). The issue in <em>Ruskewich </em>was \u201cwhether the [plaintiffs could] carry over and deduct a capital loss to calculate net gain on their Connecticut capital gains and dividends tax return when they [had] reported no carryover loss on their federal income tax return for the same taxable year.\u201d Id., 20. In order to decide that issue, the court was required to construe General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 12-505 \u2014 specifically, the phrase \u201c \u2018after due allowance for losses and holding periods.\u2019 \u201d Id., 26. The court concluded that, based on the references in \u00a7 12-505 to the federal tax code, the language of \u00a7 12-505 at issue properly could be understood only by incorporation of federal tax principles. Id., 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The defendant claims that our incorporation of federal tax principles <em>in Ruskewich </em>was based on the inherent ambiguity of the phrase \u201c \u2018after due allowance for losses and holding periods,\u2019 \u201d and that, absent that ambiguous language in \u00a7 12-505, \u201c[i]t is likely that <em>Ruskewich . . </em>. would have been decided differently . . . .\u201d We do not agree with the defendant\u2019s conclusion. Although our opinion in <em>Ruskewich </em>seeks guidance from federal tax principles in order to clarify the meaning of \u00a7 12-505, it does not set forth a rigid rule requiring ambiguity in our state tax statutes before reference may be made to federal tax law. Indeed, <em>Ruskew-ich </em>expressly relied on the basic premise of <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 139, namely, that \u201cwhen our tax statutes refer to the federal tax code, federal tax concepts are incorporated into state law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 26. We therefore see no reason to cull from our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number><em>in. Ruskewich </em>additional restrictions on the applicability of federal tax concepts to our state income tax.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that because \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20) contains a specific list of the modifications that may be made to a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income; see footnote 8 of this opinion; that , list evidences the legislature\u2019s intent not to allow any other modifications to the adjusted gross income calculation. This contention ignores the plain language of the statute, which provides that \u201c \u2018Connecticut adjusted gross income\u2019 <em>means adjusted gross </em>income, with the following modifications . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20), as amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-74, \u00a7 39, and Public Acts, Spec. Sess., May, 1994, No. 94-4, \u00a7 26. This crucial phrase is itself defined in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) as \u201cadjusted gross income ... as determined for federal income tax purposes.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) as a part of the definitional phrase \u201cadjusted gross income,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>as one of the eighteen modifications set forth in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20). See footnote 8 of this opinion. Therefore, the question of whether the legislature intended that list to be exclusive is irrelevant to our determination of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In sum, we do not view this case as warranting a departure from our long-standing practice of allowing the legislature to refer to federal tax principles through the use of general referential language. Such a practice is in accord both with common sense, and our canons of statutory construction. We therefore conclude that the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into the definition of \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d contained in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We turn next to the final issue in. this appeal, namely, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim a deduction under the tax benefit rule due to the pass-through of certain losses incurred by the S corporations of which William Berkley was a shareholder, even though the plaintiffs previously had avoided paying $1,297,189.63 in Connecticut capital gains taxes as a result of those same passed-through losses. The defendant argues, as the trial court concluded, that the plaintiffs had received a tax benefit from those losses, and therefore were not entitled to claim such a benefit a second time on their 1994 Connecticut income tax return. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">It is well settled \u201cthat deductions from otherwise taxable income are a matter of legislative grace and hence are strictly construed against the taxpayer. . . . <em>Skaarup Shipping Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 346, 352, 507 A.2d 988 (1986); <em>Golf Digest/Tennis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>203 Conn. 455, 464, 525 A.2d 106 (1987). Thus, in order for the taxpayers to prevail in their challenge of the commissioner\u2019s disallowance of these claimed deductions, they must establish clearly and unambiguously the right to claim a deduction .... <em>Golf Digest/Tennis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra, 465.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 220, 227-28, 567 A.2d 371 (1989).

See <em>Home Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue , </em>639 F.2d 333, 343 n.26 (7th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>1017, 101 S. Ct. 3005, 69 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1981) (\u201c[t]he tax benefit rule is not limited to the recoveries of deductions\u201d). Above all, it bears emphasis that the tax benefit rule \u201cis an equitable doctrine which should be carried to an equitable conclusion. \u201d <em>Alice Phelan Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>381 F.2d 399, 403 n.5 (Ct. Cl. 1967); see also <em>Hillsboro National Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 377 (\u201cstrict adherence to an annual accounting system would create transactional inequities\u201d); 1 J. Mertens, Federal Income Taxation (1999 Rev.) \u00a7 7:26, p.7-77 (\u201c[t]he purpose of the tax benefit rule is not merely to tax recoveries, but to approximate the results produced by a tax system based on transactional rather than annual accounting\u201d). The salient inquiry in any tax benefit case, therefore, must be whether the application of the rule would help to \u201cavoid . . . possible distortions of income\u201d; <em>Hillsboro National Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>supra, 378; that result from the inflexibilities of an annual accounting system.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In the present case, it is undisputed that because the plaintiffs\u2019 income greatly was reduced by the pass-through of the S corporation losses to William Berkley, the plaintiffs did not have to pay almost $1.3 million in Connecticut capital gains taxes in the 1988, 1989, and 1990 tax years. It also is undisputed that the plaintiffs\u2019 deduction of the pass-through losses from the three S corporations was the sole reason that they were able to avoid paying capital gains taxes for those three years. Given those two predicate facts, it would violate the purpose and spirit of the tax benefit rule were we to conclude that the plaintiffs have not already received a tax benefit from the pass-through of the S corporation losses. Such a conclusion would have the undesirable effect of allowing the plaintiffs to receive a double benefit from a single set of losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Although the plaintiffs make much of the alleged distinction between a deduction under the tax benefit rule, and the reduction in federal adjusted gross income that allowed them to avoid paying Connecticut capital gains taxes, that is a distinction without a difference. The tax benefit rule never has been constrained by such technicalities. Rather, courts generally have viewed it as a practical rule designed to ensure the smooth functioning of our tax system. See <em>Hillsboro National Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 377. In this case, the fact that the plaintiffs received a prior tax savings due to their pass-through losses is enough to prohibit them from claiming such a benefit a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) provides: \u201c \u2018Adjusted gross income\u2019 means the adjusted gross income of a natural person with respect to any taxable year, as determined for federal income tax purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\"> An S corporation is a small business corporation that qualifies for certain tax and financial prerogatives.

Specifically, the dissent notes that line 1 of the form \u201csimply requires the taxpayer to report the line item amount calculated on the federal form,\u201d and from this the dissent infers, based on the legislature\u2019s failure to amend \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) subsequent to the issuance of the form, the legislature\u2019s acquiescence to that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">It is true that \u201c[t]he legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation of a statute and ... its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Plainville, </em>240 Conn. 105, 110, 689 A.2d 1125 (1997).\u201d <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, </em>250 Conn. 763, 783, 739 A.2d 238 (1999). It is also true, as the dissent notes, that we have applied this doctrine of legislative acquiescence to administrative interpretations of statutes. See id., 782-83; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 36, 602 A.2d 560 (1992). The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, that two of the links in the logical chain of the legislative acquiescence doctrine are missing from the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>First, the presumption of legislative awareness of prior administrative interpretations of a statute on which the doctrine is based has, as its factual underpinning, an interpretation in 1he form of a published <em>administrative opinion or ruling. </em>See, <em>e.g.,Hansen v. Gordon, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 36 (interpretation of statutory definition of \u201coccupational diseases\u201d in <em>Cortes </em>v. <em>Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp., </em>1 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp.

Ct. 548, 38 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1973) (written opinion of attorney general). We cannot say that a single line on a preprinted tax form should enjoy the same presumption of legislative awareness as those other written and published opinions. We think it unlikely that the legislature either was aware of that line on the form, or that the legislature understood that line as an interpretation of \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Second, the legislative acquiescence doctrine requires actual acquiescence on the part of the legislature. In most of our prior cases, we have employed the doctrine not simply because of legislative inaction, but because the legislature affirmatively amended the statute subsequent to a judicial or administrative interpretation, but chose not to amend the specific provision of the statute at issue. The record in this case is devoid of evidence that the legislature made such a choice with respect to \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> The dissent posits a hypothetical scenario in which a taxpayer, in the same tax year, receives a federal tax benefit due to a loss, but does not receive a Connecticut tax benefit from that same loss.

I would hold that, while the dollar amount of \u201cadjusted gross income ... as determined for federal income tax purposes\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19); reflects the operation of the <em>federal </em>tax benefit rule, there is no separate Connecticut tax benefit rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The majority concludes that it would \u201chamstring our legislature\u201d to require it to anticipate and identify each doctrine of federal tax methodology that it wishes to incorporate into Connecticut tax statutes. I believe, however, that the majority has usurped the legislative function by incorporating a federal tax methodology, namely, the federal tax benefit rule, into \u00a7 12-701 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>(19) when there is no indication that the legislature contemplated the incorporation of any such rule. In each case relied on by the majority in support of its stated principle that this court has \u201cconstrued general statutory references to the federal tax code as incorporating federal tax principles into our statutes,\u201d this court had found in the particular statute under review: (1) an explicit reference to federal tax law; (2) a term that requires interpretation by reference to general tax concepts; and (3) <em>some </em>indication that the legislature intended the term under review to be interpreted in light of federal tax concepts. See, e.g., <em>Ruskewich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 19, 25-27, 566 A.2d 658 (1989) (construing statutory language \u201cafter due allowance for losses and holding periods,\u201d noting that \u201cthe legislature clearly intended that losses be accounted for when net gain is computed,\u201d that \u201c[t]he only guidance the legislature [gave] on how to account for losses [was] through its reference to federal tax law\u201d and that statute made \u201crepeated reference to federal tax code,\u201d and holding that federal tax concepts applied for purposes of treating capital loss carryovers under Connecticut capital gains tax [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 133, 138-39, 506 A.2d 93 (1986) (considering whether sale of patent should be treated as sale of capital asset for purposes of statute governing Connecticut capital gains tax, which explicitly refers to federal tax code, and holding that federal tax concepts applied); see also <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 505-507, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S.Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973) (noting that \u201cit is obvious that the legislature intended to incorporate and adopt\u201d federal tax concepts and that statute shows a clear intent to adopt federal tax methodology, and holding that federal tax concepts apply for purposes of construing terms \u201coccurring\u201d and \u201cnet gains\u201d in statute govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ing Connecticut capital gains tax [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In contrast to those cases, there is no explicit reference to the federal tax code in the income tax statute at issue in this case. Rather, the statute refers to \u201cadjusted gross income ... as determined for federal income tax purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). For reasons set forth more fully later in this dissenting opinion, I believe that this phrase simply refers to a number, not a methodology. Accordingly, I do not believe that the statute contains any term, phrase or concept that requires interpretation by reference to the federal tax code. Therefore, I am not persuaded that the cases relied on by the majority support its conclusion that \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) incoiporates federal tax methodology. Rather, that statute incorporates the specific number derived from that methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The majority holds that, even though \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) makes no explicit reference to the federal tax code, much less to the tax benefit rule, \u201c[i]t is clear. . . that the federal tax benefit rule is incorporated into \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) as a part of the definitional phrase \u2018adjusted gross income\u2019 . . . .\u201d The issue, however, is not whether the <em>federal </em>tax benefit rule will operate to exclude from taxation under the Connecticut statute income covered by the exclusionary aspect of the federal rule, or to include income covered by the inclu-sionary aspect of the rule. There is no dispute that it will. This is because, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 111,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the exclusionary aspect of the federal tax benefit rule, such income is not included in the calculation of federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>adjusted gross income that is reported on the federal tax return, on which the Connecticut income tax is imposed, as such reported income is modified, for Connecticut income tax purposes, pursuant to the modification provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Likewise, under the operation of the inclusionary aspect of the federal tax benefit rule, federal adjusted gross income will include recovered losses subject to the rule. The issue in this case is whether, after gross income is adjusted for purposes of the federal income tax, including adjustments to gross income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7111, the adjusted gross income reported on the federal income tax return may be adjusted further pursuant to a <em>Connecticut </em>tax benefit rule for Connecticut income tax purposes. I do not see any reason why it should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The following hypothetical, which is somewhat simpler than the facts of this case, illustrates one ramification of the majority\u2019s holding: A taxpayer, in year one, incurs a loss and receives a federal tax benefit because his income is reduced by that loss. For some reason, however, he receives no Connecticut tax benefit from the loss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In year two, the taxpayer recovers the loss. The taxpayer must pay federal income tax on the recovered income in year two, pursuant to the inclusionary aspect of the tax benefit rule. Under the majority\u2019s holding, however, because the taxpayer received no Connecticut tax benefit in year one, he may exclude the recovered income for Connecticut income tax purposes in year two. Accordingly, the adjusted gross income reported on the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return in year two would have to be modified on his Connecticut income tax return to reflect the exclusion of the recovered loss for Connecticut income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>I do not see how such a modification could be \u201cfor federal income tax purposes\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). Furthermore, nothing in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20), as amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-74, \u00a7 39, and Public Acts, Spec. Sess., May, 1994, No. 94-4, \u00a7 26, suggests that such a modification was contemplated by the legislature. In that portion of the statute, the legislature, in defining \u201c \u2018Connecticut adjusted gross income,\u2019 \u201d provided eighteen specific modifications to adjusted gross income, not including any modification equivalent to the federal tax benefit rule. As the majority notes, this court repeatedly has held \u201cthat deductions from otherwise taxable income are a matter of legislative grace and hence are strictly construed against the taxpayer. . . . Thus, in order for the taxpayers to prevail in their challenge of the commissioner\u2019s disallowance of [their] claimed deductions, they must establish clearly and unambiguously the right to claim a deduction . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>nal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 220, 227-28, 567 A.2d 371 (1989); see footnote 7 of the majority opinion. I believe that the deduction for a taxpayer\u2019s windfall recovery of a previous loss for Connecticut income tax purposes, pursuant to the exclusionary aspect of a Connecticut tax benefit rule, should be a matter of legislative grace, not of judicial fiat. In my view, the plaintiffs in this case have not established any statutory basis for such a deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The majority suggests, and I do not necessarily disagree, that the tax benefit rule is a matter of \u201ccommon sense\u201d and that it is \u201c \u2018an equitable doctrine.\u2019 \u201d The majority also enumerates several policy justifications for the rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See part III of the majority opinion. This court previously has indicated, however, that \u201cthe fairness of [Connecticut\u2019s] tax [statutes] is within the prerogative of the legislature, and not of this court.\u201d <em>Yaeger </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>188 Conn. 206, 213, 449 A.2d 144 (1982). Whether the federal tax benefit rule may be a sensible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>or equitable rule is irrelevant in determining whether the legislature intended to incorporate such a rule in Connecticut income tax statutes. There is no reason to believe that the legislature had any such intention. Additionally, I would note that there may be other unforeseen, adverse consequences to incorporating the entire body of federal income tax methodology into the phrase \u201cadjusted gross income ... as determined for federal income tax purposes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19). Accordingly, I believe that that phrase simply means what it says: adjusted gross income as determined for purposes of calculating the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax. In other words, it is the adjusted gross income reported on the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax form.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">My conclusion is supported by a comparison of Connecticut Form CT-1040 for the 1994 tax year, issued by the department of revenue services, with United States Individual Income Tax Return Form 1040 for the same tax year. The Connecticut form does not require the taxpayer to calculate federal adjusted gross income in accordance with the federal methodology. Rather, line 1 of the Connecticut form, which provides, \u201cFederal Adjusted Gross Income (from Federal Form 1040, Line 31 or Form 1040A, Line 16, or Form 1040EZ, Line 3),\u201d simply requires the taxpayer to report the line item amount calculated on the federal form. It fairly may be assumed that the legislature was aware of the form and content of the 1994 Connecticut Form CT-1040. The legislature has never suggested that that form was inconsistent with the intent of the tax legislation that it was designed to implement. When the legislature is aware of an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute and is silent concerning that interpretation, this court \u201cconstrue [s] the legislative silence as legislative concurrence in that interpretation. That legislative concurrence is presumptive evidence of the correctness of the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>trative inteipretation. . . . This presumptive evidence of correctness we add to the persuasive effect normally given to an administrative interpretation. Coupled, these two considerations outweigh any arguments that might be advanced for a contrary interpretation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control </em>Authority, 176 Conn. 191, 199, 405 A.2d 638 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In summary, I do not believe that the legislature intended to incorporate a Connecticut tax benefit rule into the Connecticut income tax statutes. Accordingly, I dissent in part. To the extent that the majority upholds the trial court\u2019s disallowance of the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed deduction under the tax benefit rule, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) provides: \u201c \u2018Adjusted gross income\u2019 means the acljusted gross income of a natural person with respect to any taxable year, as determined for federal income tax purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-8\"> Title 26 of the United States Code, \u00a7 111, provides in relevant part: \u201cGross income does not include income attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any amount deducted in any prior taxable year to the extent such amount did not reduce the amount of tax imposed by this chapter. . . .\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">See footnote 8 of the majority opinion for the text of the relevant revision of General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">This can occur, even without the loss, because modifications to the taxpayer\u2019s income, pursuant to \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20), may reduce the taxpayer\u2019s income to an amount not subject to the imposition of the income tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> The majority states that the existence of a Connecticut tax benefit rule for purposes of determining Connecticut adjusted gross income \u201cdoes not involve any determination of the existence, or nonexistence, of an exemption or deduction, inasmuch as the proper methodology for determining adjusted gross income predates, in the chronology of our income tax scheme, the question of exemptions or deductions.\u201d Footnote 7 of the majority opinion. I recognize that the federal tax benefit rule does not involve the determination of the existence or nonexistence of an exemption or deduction inasmuch as a recovered loss is not treated as a deduction under the exclusionary aspect of the rule; it simply is not considered income. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (1994). The majority begs the question, however, when it states that the existence of a Connecticut tax benefit rule does not involve the determination of the existence of an exemption or deduction. The majority assumes what it should demonstrate: that \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19) incorporates the methodologies of the federal income tax scheme, as distinct from the number derived from those methodologies.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Unlike the federal income tax scheme, Connecticut\u2019s income tax statutes do not make a distinction between nonincome items and deductions. Section 12-701 (a) defines adjusted gross income as \u201cadjusted gross income . . . for federal income tax purposes\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19); and then provides for eighteen specific modifications to that number for purposes of calculating Connecticut adjusted gross income. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-701 (a) (20), as amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-74, \u00a7 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>and Public Acts, Spec. Sess.. May, 1994, No. 94-4, \u00a7 26. I believe that if the taxpayer wishes to modify adjusted gross income for some purpose unrelated to federal tax purposes, and the modification results in a reduction in taxable income for Connecticut income tax purposes, the taxpayer clearly and unambiguously must establish the right to make that modification. <em>Bolt Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 220, 227-28, 567 A.2d 371 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> I would point out, however, that there may be sound reasons why the legislature would not want to adopt such a rule. First, because the dollar amount of adjusted gross income reported on a taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return already reflects the operation of the federal tax benefit rule, the state and the taxpayer will generally, alt hough, as the facts of this case suggest, not always, obtain 1he benefits of the rule, even without the operation of a separate Connecticut rule. Thus, the policy reasons supporting the federal rule are not as compelling when advanced in support of a Connecticut rule. Second, it appears that the use of a specific dollar amount from the federal income tax form, as opposed to the incorporation of the entire methodology for calculating that dollar amount, makes the determination of adjusted gross income for Connecticut income tax purposes vastly simpler for both the taxpayer and the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
