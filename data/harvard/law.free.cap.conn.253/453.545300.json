The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its administrative appeal from a decision of the named defendant, the department of public utility control (department), concerning universal telephone service contributions. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) federal law does not preempt General Statutes \u00a7 16-247e<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that it requires commercial mobile radio service providers to contribute to the state universal service program; (2) the assessment methodology employed pursuant to \u00a7 16-247e does not violate federal law; and (3) \u00a7 16-247e does not have an unlawful discriminatory effect among commercial mobile radio service providers such as the plaintiff. We disagree with the plaintiffs claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">A brief review of the relevant historical development of the statutory and regulatory framework governing telecommunications is necessary to an understanding of this case. In the mid-1970s, pursuant to the federal Communications Act of 1934; 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.; the commission allocated certain radio frequencies for the development of cellular telephone service. The commission anticipated licensing one cellular telephone system, operated by the local telephone company, in each local market. In the 1980s, however, as a result of increased demand and in order to promote competition, the commission decided to increase the spectrum allocation, and subsequently divided it between two competing cellular carriers in each market. See <em>Connecticut Dept. of Public Utility Control </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>78 F.3d 842, 845 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Prior to 1993, the Communications Act of 1934 distinguished between \u201ccommon carrier\u201d service and \u201cprivate carrier\u201d service, the former of which was much more regulated than the latter. Common carriers were subject to both federal and state regulation, whereas private carriers generally were not. This, coupled with the way in which the commission defined \u201cprivate carrier\u201d service, created the possibility of generally unregulated private carriers directly competing with heavily regulated common carriers. See generally Second Report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and Order, Implementation of Sections 3 (n) and 332 of the Communications Act, 9 F.C.C.R. 1411, 1414 \u2014 16 (1994) (Second Report); <em>Connecticut Dept. of Public Utility Control </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>supra, 78 F.3d 845. Although private carriers and common carriers had become virtually indistinguishable, they were subject to differing regulatory schemes. H.R. Rep. No. 103-111, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 261 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 378, 586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">As part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act); Pub. L. No. 103-66, 107 Stat. 312 (1993), codified in relevant part at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c); Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to revise the regulation of the wireless telecommunications industry, which encompasses cellular telephone service. Congress had two principal objectives in amending 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332: (1) to ensure that similar mobile services are subject to consistent regulatory treatment; and (2) to impose only the level of regulation necessary to promote competition and protect mobile communications customers. Second Report, supra, 9 F.C.C.R. 1418; see also H.R. Rep.

Second Report, supra, 9 F.C.C.R. 1417. Commercial mobile radio service is defined as \u201cany mobile service . . . that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available (A) to the public or (B) to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (d) (1) (Sup. II 1996). Private mobile radio service is defined as \u201cany mobile service . . . that is not a commercial mobile service or the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile service, as specified by regulation by the Commission.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (d) (3) (Sup. II 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Allowing private mobile radio service to remain unregulated, Congress amended 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 in order to establish a new federal regulatory scheme for commercial mobile radio service. Section 332 also, however, provides a general preemption of state regulation for both private mobile radio service and commercial mobile radio service: \u201c[N]o State or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service . . . .\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A). The objective of the preemption provision was to preclude state regulatory practices that would conflict with the objectives of \u00a7 332 either by impairing the regulatory parity between commercial mobile radio service and private mobile radio service created by \u00a7 332 or by otherwise unnecessarily burdening competition. Second Report, supra, 9 F.C.C.R. 1413, 1421.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Under certain circumstances, however, a state may petition the commission for permission to regulate the rates for commercial mobile radio service. Section 332 (c) (3) (A) provides that state rate regulation is appropriate when: (1) market conditions have failed to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable commercial mobile radio service rates or commercial mobile radio service rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; or (2) such conditions exist and commercial mobile radio service is a replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of such service within the state. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A); Second Report, supra, 9 F.C.C.R. 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>As part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996; Pub.

Prior to 1996, universal service programs consisted of external subsidies, namely, payments between companies, and internal subsidies, namely, the subsidized provision of service to high cost subscribers by low cost subscribers. H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 66 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 31. This provision, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, was enacted because Congress anticipated that the market created by the other amendments would make internal subsidies less viable, in that deregulation would remove providers\u2019 ability to subsidize high cost customers through rates charged to low cost customers. H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 67-68 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Subsections (d) and (f) of \u00a7 254 of title 47 of the United States Code (Sup. II 1996) set forth the scope of universal service requirements. Subsection (d) of \u00a7 254 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service. ...\u201d The federal universal service program was created pursuant to this provision. State universal service programs, however, fall within the ambit of subsection (f) of \u00a7 254, which specifically provides: \u201cA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Subsection (a) of \u00a7 254 directed the commission to convene a federal-state joint board to make recommendations regarding the preservation and advancement of universal telecommunications services at affordable rates to all Americans. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (a); see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 128 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 139. In developing universal service programs, the joint board was to be guided by the six principles set forth by new subsection (b) of \u00a7 254.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One of those principles provides that \u201c[a]ll providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In 1997, pursuant to the recommendations of the Federal-State Joint Board, the commission issued a final rule reforming the federal universal service program. In the Matter of Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Report and Order (CC Docket No. 96-45), 12 F.C.C.R. 8776 (1997) (universal service decision). In its order, the commission stated: \u201cLifeline service should be provided to low-income consumers in every state, irrespective of whether the state provides matching funds . . . .\u201d Id., 8952.

The department shall apportion the funding for the lifeline program among telecommunications carriers on an equitable basis based on the gross revenues of each telecommunications carrier that are generated in Connecticut, both interstate and intrastate. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-247e (a) (2). Pursuant to the mandate in \u00a7 16-247e (a), and in light of the commission\u2019s universal service decision, the department issued its final decision; see Department of Public Utility Control, Review of the Connecticut Lifeline Program, Docket No. 97-07-12 (March 25, 1998) pp. 3, 4, 30, 33 (lifeline decision); in which it ordered that all telecommunications providers, including commercial mobile radio service providers, were obligated pursuant to \u00a7 16-247e, as amended by No. 97-121 of the 1997 Public Acts, to contribute to the state lifeline program according to their intrastate and interstate gross revenues subject to Connecticut sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the lifeline decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>35<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 4-183.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that: (1) federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>law preempts the department\u2019s imposition of universal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>service assessments on commercial mobile radio service providers; (2) \u00a7 16-247e has an inequitable, discriminating and unlawful effect on commercial mobile radio service providers; and (3) \u00a7 16-247e violates the separation of powers provision of article second of the Connecticut constitution. The trial court rejected the plaintiffs claims and affirmed the decision of the department. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Before reaching the plaintiffs claims, we briefly address the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe standard of review of an agency decision is well established. Ordinarily, this court affords deference to the construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tion of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference. . . . [I]t is for the courts, and not administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 642-43, 708 A.2d 202 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 389, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">To the extent that the commission\u2019s interpretation of the relevant federal statutes is implicated, we set out the analytical framework in which we give deference to a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of federal statutes.

The department contends, however, that such a finding is not required because 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f) expressly authorizes states to assess all telecommunications providers, including commercial mobile radio service providers, for contributions to the states\u2019 univer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>sal service programs. The department also contends that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) preempts only state regulation of the entry of and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, and that such preemption does not apply to the department\u2019s assessments against the plaintiff for universal service funding. Additionally, the department argues that the substitutability condition contained in \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) does not apply to universal service funding assessments. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u201cThe question of preemption is one of federal law, arising under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution. . . . Determining whether Congress has exercised its power to preempt state law is a question of legislative intent. . . . Express preemption occurs to the extent that a federal statute expressly directs that state law be ousted to some degree from a certain field. . . . <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 791, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied [sub nom. <em>Slotnik </em>v.

Although this issue requires our analysis of several statutory provisions, our starting point is title 47 of the United States Code, \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A), which was enacted as part of the Budget Act of 1993.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>first sentence of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) sets forth a general prohibition against the regulation by states of \u201cthe entry of or the rates charged by\u201d commercial mobile radio service and private mobile radio service providers. The first sentence also expressly provides, however, that states may regulate \u201cthe other terms and conditions\u201d of commercial mobile radio service. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The second sentence of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) then begins with language of exception, namely: \u201cNothing in this subparagraph shall exempt [commercial mobile radio service] providers . . . .\u201d By this language, the second sentence carves out an exception to the general prohibition contained in the first sentence. Specifically, the second sentence of \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) allows states to impose requirements on commercial mobile radio service providers in order to ensure universal availability of telephone service, under the condition set forth by the parenthetical contained therein, namely, the substitutability condition \u2014 \u201cwhere [commercial mobile radio] services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Read in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>text of the first sentence, the second sentence does not preempt any state regulation, but rather confers additional authority upon the states \u2014 authority that would otherwise be prohibited by the first sentence. Finally, the third sentence of \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) provides that a state may petition the commission for permission to regulate the rates for any commercial mobile radio service provider, and that such petition shall be granted, provided that the state demonstrates that: (1) market conditions have not protected subscribers from rates that are unjust and unreasonable, or rates that are unjustly and unreasonably discriminatory; or (2) such market conditions exist and commercial mobile radio service serves as a substitute for land line service for a substantial portion of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We next construe the language of title 47 of the United States Code, \u00a7 254 (f) (Sup. II 1996), enacted as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which provides: \u201cA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Also, as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress enacted 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 (c) (1), which provides: \u201cThis Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not be construed to modify, impair, or supersede Federal, State, or local law unless expressly so provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in such Act or amendments.\u201d We therefore must construe 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f) in a manner that does not \u201cmodify, impair, or supersede\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">By its language, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f) expressly authorizes states to establish regulations in order to ensure the universal availability of telephone service within each state. Section 254 (f) provides that state programs may require universal service contributions from \u201c[e] very telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services,\u201d and that they may do so to the extent that the state funding mechanisms \u201cdo not rely on or burden\u201d federal funding mechanisms. There is no language in \u00a7 254 (f) to suggest that commercial mobile radio service providers are not encompassed by the provision\u2019s application to \u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier . . . .\u201d Similarly, there is no indication that the provision should be construed to \u201cmodify, impair, or supersede\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A). Our reading of \u00a7 254 (f) does not conflict with \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A), and therefore is consistent with the directive in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 (c) to construe the statute in a manner that does not \u201cmodify, impair, or supersede\u201d federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">We next look to the legislative histoiy of the relevant statutes. There is nothing in the legislative history of the statutory scheme to support the argument that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) prohibits states from imposing universal service funding assessments on commercial mobile radio service providers unless they satisfy the substitutability condition. To the contrary, the legislative history supports our conclusion that federal law does not preempt states\u2019 imposition of such assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Although the terms \u201crates,\u201d \u201centry\u201d and \u201cother terms and conditions,\u201d as used in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>axe not statutorily defined, the legislative history of \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) suggests that universal service funding regulation is encompassed by the phrase \u201cother terms and conditions\u201d and, therefore, may be regulated by the states in the absence of a substitutability showing. The most explicit legislative statement on this issue is located in the House Report, which states that \u201c[b]y \u2018terms and conditions,\u2019 the Committee intends to include such matters as customer billing information and practices and billing disputes and other consumer protection matters; facilities siting issues (e.g., zoning); transfers of control; the bundling of services and equipment; and the requirement that carriers make capacity available on a wholesale basis or such other matters as fall within a state\u2019s lawful authority. This list is intended to be illustrative only and not meant to preclude other matters generally understood to fall under \u2018terms and conditions.\u2019 \u201d H.R. Rep. No. 103-111, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 261 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 378, 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The expressly listed matters, given only as examples, undermine the plaintiffs argument that universal service contribution assessments constitute rate or entry regulation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> State regulation of many of the Usted items \u2014 for example, wholesale capacity requirements \u2014 may have an indirect impact on the entry of or the rates charged by a commercial mobile radio service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>provider, in that they may result in additional costs of doing business to the provider that might be passed on to the customer. The legislative history suggests, however, that that fact does not convert a regulation of what would generally be understood to be a term or condition of doing business into rate or entry regulation. Similarly, the fact that universal service funding requirements may have an indirect effect on rates does not require, or even suggest, the conclusion that such a program constitutes state rate regulation. To conclude that any state requirement that may increase the cost of doing business constitutes rate regulation would prohibit virtually all state regulation in this area, and would therefore negate the effect of the \u201cother terms and conditions\u201d language of the first sentence of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The legislative history of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 also gives us some guidance. The House Report explicitly describes universal service contribution requirements as a \u201ccondition <em>for </em>doing business.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 69 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 34. We read this to suggest that such requirements are more appropriately characterized as \u201cterms and conditions\u201d for providing service rather than as rate or entry regulation, and hence are not within the scope of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The House Report, the Senate Report and the House Conference Report all suggest that Congress believed that universal service requirements for commercial mobile radio service providers are not preempted by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A). The House Report explicitly states that, in enacting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, Congress intended that <em>\u201call </em>telecommunications carriers would participate in the provision and advancement of universal service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 68 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 33-34. Although other sections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>legislative history; see, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 126-27 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 93-94; address differential treatment of commercial mobile radio service providers whose services have not been found to be a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of communications within a state, no reference is made to a preexisting exemption for those providers pursuant to. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) with respect to state universal service requirements. This suggests that Congress did not believe that such an exemption existed. The Senate Report states that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \u201cestablishes a new section ... to clearly articulate the policy of Congress that universal service is a cornerstone of the Nation\u2019s communications system. This new section is intended to make explicit the current implicit authority of the [commission] <em>and the States </em>to require common carriers to provide universal service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) S. Rep. No. 104-23, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 25 (1995). The House Conference Report notes that \u201c[a] state may adopt <em>any measure </em>with respect to universal service that is not inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s [universal service] rules.\u201d (Emphasis added.) H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 132 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 124, 143. This suggests that all measures, as opposed to only those measures that exempt certain commercial mobile radio service providers, consistent with those rules are within the authority retained by the states. This legislative history supports our conclusion that \u00a7 16-247e, as implemented by the department\u2019s lifeline decision, is not violative of the federal statutory and regulatory framework set forth primarily by \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) and the 1996 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Furthermore, both the Federal-State Joint Board and the commission have rejected the plaintiffs preemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The commission expressly adopted the interpretation of the Federal-State Joint Board, that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) \u201cdoes not preclude states from requiring [commercial mobile radio service] providers to contribute to state support mechanisms.\u201d Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Report and Order, 12 F.C.C.R. 8776, 9181-82 (1997). The commission later reaffirmed its position. <em>In the Matter of Petition of Pittencrieff Communications, Inc., </em>13 F.C.C.R. 1735, 1737 (1997), aff'd sub nom. <em>Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>168 F.3d 1332 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The commission adopted rules allowing states to require cellular providers to contribute to universal service programs. The commission\u2019s report and orders that promulgate those rules rejected the claim that such requirements established pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f) conflict with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A). See generally 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 36, 54 and 69 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Furthermore, all of the other appellate courts that have construed 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) have held that it does not preempt states from requiring commercial mobile radio service participation in state universal service programs. See <em>Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>183 F.3d 393, 431 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Celpage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>States Supreme Court, Docket No. 99-1072 (May 30, 2000); <em>Mountain Solutions, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Corp. Commission of Kansas, </em>966 F. Sup. 1043, 1049 (D. Kan. 1997), aff'd sub nom. <em>Sprint Spectrum </em>v. <em>State Corp. Commission of Kansas, </em>149 F.3d 1058, 1061 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>In the Matter of Petition of Pittencrieff Communications, Inc., </em>supra, 13 F.C.C.R. 1737.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The plaintiff does not dispute that the only case in which a court has construed 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) in the manner that it suggests is <em>Metro Mobile CTS of Fairfield County, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV 950051275S (December 11, 1996), appeal dismissed, 243 Conn. 235, 702 A.2d 1179 (1997). The court in <em>Metro Mobile CTS of Fairfield County, Inc., </em>concluded, as the plaintiff here urges us to do, that the second sentence of \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) assumes that universal service assessments are not among \u201cthe other terms and conditions\u201d of cellular service. Id. Otherwise, according to the Superior Court, the second sentence is redundant. Id. Accordingly, the court held that the Budget Act preempted the department from assessing cellular providers for universal service contributions. Id. Simply put, we are not persuaded by the reasoning of the Superior Court in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We next address the specific arguments advanced by the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that the second sentence assumes that universal service assessments constitute regulation, and that our interpretation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) violates the so-called canon of statutory construction that all statutory language must be given effect. According to the plaintiff, if we conclude that universal service requirements are encompassed by the clause \u201cother terms and conditions,\u201d then the second sentence would be redundant. Stated another way, according to the plaintiff, it would serve no pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>pose to provide in the second sentence that commercial mobile radio service providers are not exempt from universal service funding requirements only when the substitutability condition is satisfied if states already may impose such requirements pursuant to the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">As stated previously, however, the second sentence of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) provides an exception to the general prohibition in the first sentence against state regulation of rates and entry. The second sentence allows state rate regulation in the name of universal availability when cellular service serves as a substantial substitute to land line service, whereas the clause \u201cother terms and conditions\u201d encompasses universal service contribution requirements under any circumstance. Therefore, states may regulate the terms and conditions of providing cellular service. States may regulate the entry of and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, in order to ensure universal service, when cellular service serves as a substantial substitute for land line service. The second sentence confers authority that the states would otherwise be prohibited from exercising under the first sentence. Our construction of \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A), therefore, does not result in redundant language.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The plaintiff also relies on \u00a7 152 (b) of 47 U.S.C., also referred to as \u00a7 2 (b) of the Communications Act of 1934, which provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in . . . section 332 of this title . . . nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to (1) charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service by wire or radio of any carrier . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that this provision, as amended by the Budget Act, \u201cfurther underscore^] federal preemption of any State authority over cellular communications,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>while maintaining states\u2019 juiisdictionally intrastate authority over intrastate communications matters. In this connection, the plaintiff contends that, by virtue of the reference to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (b), the exemption includes state laws regarding \u201ccharges, classifications, practices, services, facilities or regulations.\u201d We are unpersuaded. Section 152 (b) of 47 U.S.C. explicitly imposes jurisdictional limitations on the power of the commission and says nothing about the jurisdiction of the states. See <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Board, </em>525 U.S. 366, 380, 119 S. Ct. 721, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1999); <em>Louisiana Public Service Commission </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>476 U.S. 355, 371-76, 106 S. Ct. 1890, 90 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1986). There is no reason, at least in this instance, to interpret a statute, which by its terms expressly limits only federal authority, to prohibit state regulation as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The plaintiff also relies on 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 253 (e), which provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall affect the application of section 332 (c) (3) of this title to commercial mobile service providers.\u201d The plaintiff argues that this provision \u201cexpressly preserves the preemption provisions of the Budget Act. Congress has therefore precluded any interpretation of the [Telecommunications] Act that might undercut the general preemptive effect of the Budget Act\u2019s language.\u201d This argument, however, does not alter our conclusion that the department\u2019s order is not preempted by \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A). Because 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) does not preempt the department\u2019s order, and we must construe the Telecommunications Act pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 (c), it is not then preempted by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 253 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The plaintiff also argues that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f), which provides that states may establish universal service funds, applies only to commercial mobile radio service providers when the substitutability condition of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) has been satisfied. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>conceded at oral argument before this court that its \u00a7 254 argument depended on the viability of its \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A) argument. Because we reject the plaintiffs \u00a7 332 argument, we accordingly reject its argument based on \u00a7 254 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In sum, we conclude that federal law does not preempt the department from imposing universal service contribution assessments on commercial mobile radio service providers. In so doing, we conclude that the phrase \u201cother terms and conditions\u201d contained in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A), which states may regulate without having to satisfy the substitutability condition, encompasses universal service funding requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The plaintiff next claims that, even if the substitutability condition does not apply to the department\u2019s imposition of universal funding requirements on commercial mobile radio service providers, \u00a7 16-247e violates federal law because it permits the department to exact contributions based in part on interstate revenues. The department responds that the plaintiff did not properly raise this issue before the trial court and, therefore, may not seek review of this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">We have stated repeatedly that we ordinarily will not review an issue that has not been properly raised before the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 219-20, 682 A.2d 106 (1996) (court \u201cnot required to consider any claim that was not properly preserved in the trial court\u201d); <em>Yale University </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>225 Conn. 32, 36 n.4, 621 A.2d 1304 (1993) (court declined to consider issues briefed on appeal but not raised at trial); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\u201ccourt shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial\u201d). We agree in part with the department. Because we perceive the plaintiffs claim to be two distinct claims, we consider them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The plaintiffs principal argument is that federal law precludes the lifeline assessment from being based on the interstate revenues of commercial mobile radio service providers because states only have jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications and, therefore, may only base the assessment on intrastate revenues. A thorough review of its briefs filed in the administrative proceedings and the trial court, however, reveals that at no point did the plaintiff even functionally make; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 198, 506 A.2d 118 (1986); this particular argument. Instead, in its trial brief, the plaintiff argued that commercial mobile radio service is inherently interstate and, therefore, such providers are exempt from state universal service assessments in their entirety. We perceive that claim, however, to be distinct from the alternative claim that the plaintiff now makes, namely, that states only have the jurisdiction to base lifeline assessments on intrastate revenues, and that, therefore, only the plaintiffs intrastate revenues may be assessed for state lifeline contribution purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In its reply brief, in defending against the department\u2019s assertion that the plaintiffs claim was not raised in the trial court, the plaintiff merely restates its first claim on appeal, namely, that states may not assess commercial mobile radio service providers for state lifeline programs unless they satisfy the substitutability condition of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332 (c) (3) (A). The plaintiff also argues that its argument is supported by <em>Texas Office of Public Utility Counsels. Federal Communications Commission, </em>supra, 183 F.3d 393, a decision rendered after the trial court in the present case issued its judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Neither of these arguments, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>refutes the fact that the claim was not made in the trial court. We therefore decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Second, the plaintiff makes, albeit in two sentences, what we perceive to be the distinct claim, namely, that \u00a7 16-247e would have \u201ca discriminatory effect on [the plaintiff] and other cellular providers given that [commercial mobile radio service] providers already contribute to federal universal programs based on their interstate revenues. Taxing those revenues twice imposes an unfair and inequitable burden on interstate providers, considering that intrastate providers would not have borne the brunt of that double hit.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">With respect to whether this argument was made in the trial court, the plaintiff, in its brief to the department and in its trial brief, distinctly argued that \u00a7 16-247e is discriminatory against commercial mobile radio service providers, and therefore contrary to federal law, because it effects a double taxation in the manner described previously. We therefore consider the merits of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We perceive only two sources that may form the basis for the plaintiffs claim that federal law prohibits \u00a7 16-247e from having a discriminatory effect on commercial mobile radio service providers to the extent that the universal service assessment is based on interstate revenues: (1) federal statutory law; and (2) federal constitutional law. The plaintiff, however, in its brief, does not direct our attention to any federal statutory provision or any federal constitutional principle or provision, most notably, the commerce clause, to support its claim. In fact, at oral argument before this court, a question from the\" bench, expressly based on the understanding that there was no <em>constitutional </em>principle that prohibited mere double taxation, elicited a clarification of the plaintiffs claim on appeal. In response to the question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the plaintiffs counsel stated: \u201cWe\u2019re not arguing that, in and of itself, a double hit is in some way unlawful. But rather, given the language of the statute in [\u00a7] 254 (f), which says that the state mechanism cannot burden the federal mechanism, there\u2019s implicit in the language of [\u00a7] 254, the idea that there is going to be a division between the funding for the state program on intrastate telecommunications and funding for interstate.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We again first look to the controlling statutory language. Section 254 (f) of 47 U.S.C. (Sup. II 1996) states that \u201c[a] State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards <em>that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As described previously, by its broad language, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (i) permits states to establish universal service funds and to require \u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services\u201d to contribute to such funds. Section 254 (f) permits such a scheme so long as the state funding mechanisms \u201cdo not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.\u201d Beyond its claim that the funds may not overlap in terms of its revenue base, the plaintiff has not claimed, nor is there any evidence in the record to establish, that the state funding mecha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>nisms have relied on or burdened the federal funding mechanisms under \u00a7 254 (d). Contrary to the plaintiffs position, merely because there may be an overlapping in terms of the revenues being assessed for both funds does not suggest that the <em>federal funding mechanisms </em>have been relied on or burdened in any way, which is what the statute prohibits. We therefore reject the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the lifeline decision is contrary to federal law because its cost recovery mechanism imposes an inequitable burden on cellular providers, such as the plaintiff, and therefore it violates the mandate in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 253 and 254 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which provides that state universal funding requirements must be \u201cequitable and nondiscriminatory.\u201d The plaintiff directs our attention to two ways in which such a discriminatory effect may result. First, the plaintiff maintains, \u201c[b]ecause the [department] does not regulate [commercial mobile radio service] providers, it does not know which providers are currently providing telecommunications in the state, and therefore its assessments for lifeline contributions will be discriminatory.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that, although the lifeline decision orders that \u201ceach telecommunications company providing service in Connecticut\u201d contribute to the lifeline program, the decision does not specify how the department will identify providers required to participate. Second, according to the plaintiff, the department neither identifies nor assesses new commercial mobile radio service providers. The department, to the contrary, argues that the plaintiff has provided no evidence in the record to support its claim. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff fail[ed] to support [its] discrimination claim with any reference to the record, which would demonstrate the inequitable impact on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>[commercial mobile radio service] providers.\u201d We agree with the department and the trial court that the plaintiff failed to sustain its burden in establishing the factual underpinnings of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u201cIn the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it is improvident for the court to invalidate a statute on its face.\u201d <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 778, 629 A.2d 357 (1993); <em>Lehrer v. </em>Davis, 214 Conn. 232, 235, 571 A.2d 691 (1990); <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>203 Conn. 63, 75, 523 A.2d 486 (1987). \u201c[Constitutional issues do not exist in a vacuum. . . . The best teaching of this Court\u2019s experience admonishes us not to entertain constitutional questions in advance of the strictest necessity. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>338 U.S. 327, 333, 70 S.

A party mounting a constitutional challenge to the validity of a statute must provide an adequate factual record in order to meet its burden of demonstrating the statute\u2019s adverse impact on some protected interest of its own, in its own particular case, and not merely under some hypothetical set of facts as yet unproven. . . . We do not give advisory opinions, nor do we sit as roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of legislative enactments. Determination of the scope and constitutionality of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function. . . . <em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 234 \u2014 35; <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 37 </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>347 U.S. 222, 224, 74 S.

The plaintiff refers to no evidence in the record to support its claim that the department\u2019s decision effects a disparate result. If we were to address this claim, we would do so in a factual vacuum. Our precedent \u201ccounsels against embarking on such an expedition in the absence of an adequate factual record. <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 779; <em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 234-35; <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 75 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hall v.

The application shall conform to the requirements prescribed by rule of the judges of the Superior Court. After such hearing as the court determines is necessary, the court shall render its judgment on the application, which judgment shall contain a statement of the facts the court has found, with its conclusions thereon.

I believe, however, that the portion of General Statutes \u00a7 16-247e that imposes an assessment on revenues from interstate telecommunications is inequitable and discriminatory in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, I believe that that portion of the statute potentially subjects revenues from interstate telecommunications to multistate taxation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and that it therefore violates the commerce clause of the United States constitution. Accordingly, I would invalidate that portion of the statute. See <em>State </em>v. Dupree, 196 Conn. 655, 660, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S. Ct. 318, 88 L.

In <em>Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>183 F.3d 393 (5th Cir. 1999), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission (commission) had no authority to assess intrastate revenues in its calculation of universal service contributions pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Connecticut telecommunications providers that provide only intrastate services are not subject to any assessment by the commission, while providers of interstate services pay an assessment on their revenue from those services to both the state of Connecticut and the commission. Furthermore, as set forth more fully later in this dissenting opinion, the revenue from those services potentially could be subject to taxation in other states.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subjecting revenues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>from interstate telecommunications to multiple taxation is, in my view, clearly inequitable and discriminatory against the providers of those services in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">I also believe that this assessment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> violates the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>merce clause of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>488 U.S. 252, 109 S. Ct. 582, 102 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1989), the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of an Illinois statute imposing a tax on interstate telecommunications. The court wrote that \u201ca state tax will withstand scrutiny under the Commerce Clause if \u2018the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u2019 \u201d Id., 257. The court recognized that such \u201ca tax must be structured so that if every State were to impose an identical tax, no multiple taxation would result\u201d; id., 261; and that a state may tax \u201conly that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed.\u201d Id., 262. The Illinois statute under review taxed interstate calls that originated or terminated in Illinois and that were charged to an Illinois service address. Id. The court found that, because other states would have a sufficient nexus to tax telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>calls that originated or terminated in those states and that were billed or paid within those states, there was a possibility of multiple taxation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 263. The court held, however, that the statute\u2019s credit provision for taxes that were paid in other states eliminated the possibility of multiple taxation, and that the statute was, therefore, constitutional. Id., 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Section 16-247e imposes an assessment on \u201cthe gross revenues of each telecommunications carrier that are generated in Connecticut, both interstate and intrastate.\u201d The phrase \u201cgenerated in Connecticut\u201d is not defined. As written, the statute could allow Connecticut to assess, for example, revenue from interstate telecommunications that originate and are charged to a service address in another state, and that terminate and are billed or paid in Connecticut. If the other state had a statute like \u00a7 16-247e, that state could also assess revenues from the telecommunication, thereby subjecting the revenues from the call to multiple taxation. Section 16-247e contains no provision allowing a credit for assessments paid in other states. Therefore, I believe that the portion of the statute assessing revenues from interstate telecommunications cannot withstand scrutiny under the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The department in its decision ruled that \u201cfunding of the Lifeline Program credit should be based on each carrier\u2019s intrastate and interstate gross revenues subject to Connecticut sales tax. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This court previously has held that \u201cthe constitutionality of a statute [should not] be made to depend upon the way in which it is finally administered by those who are charged with its execution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>96 Conn. 190, 196, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>A. 385 (1921). Therefore, even if it is assumed that the department\u2019s construction of the statute is proper, and even if it is assumed that that construction could withstand scrutiny under the commerce clause, that would not cure the statute\u2019s constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> Title 47 of the United States Code (Sup.
