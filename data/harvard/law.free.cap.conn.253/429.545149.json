We must consider whether the trial court properly denied an employer, which has paid benefits to a claimant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-433C,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commonly referred to as the Heart and Hypertension Act, the right to intervene, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the intervention provision of the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Compensation Act, in a civil action brought by the claimant against a third party tortfeasor. We conclude that the city, as an employer that has paid \u00a7 7-433c benefits to the plaintiff, may intervene in this case pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a). Therefore, we must also consider whether the trial court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s motion to intervene can be affirmed on the alternate ground that the city had failed to file a certificate of good faith, which the plaintiff argues is required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the city was not required to file such a certificate. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying the city\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On January 4, 1996, the plaintiff, then a firefighter employed by the city, suffered an acute myocardial infarction. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c. Based on the nature of his injury and his status as a firefighter, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner awarded the plaintiff \u00a7 7-433c benefits. Subsequently, the plaintiffs attorney, pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a, filed a certificate of good faith stating that he had a good faith belief that grounds existed for an action against the defendant, his treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The plaintiff then filed a one count complaint against the defendant, alleging that the defendant\u2019s negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>caused the plaintiff to suffer the acute myocardial infarction. The city moved to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) as a coplaintiff in the underlying action against the defendant, seeking to recover from the defendant sums of money that it had paid and had become obligated to pay to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c. The trial court, <em>Leheny, J., </em>denied the city\u2019s motion to intervene. The city appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s motion to intervene, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cA threshold inquiry of this court upon every appeal presented to it is the question of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kulmacz </em>v. <em>Kulmacz, </em>177 Conn. 410, 412, 418 A.2d 76 (1979). \u201cIt is well established that the subject matter jurisdiction of the Appellate Court and of this court is governed by [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-263,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides that an <em>aggrieved party </em>may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the <em>final judgment </em>of the court.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>249 Conn. 36, 45, 730 A.2d 51 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">We consider the aggrievement prong first. \u201cThe fundamental test for establishing classical aggrievement is well settled: [FJirst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>legal interest in the subject matter of the decision . . . . Second, the party claiming aggrievement also must demonstrate that its asserted interest has been specially and injuriously affected in a way that is cognizable by law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>250 Conn. 476, 480, 736 A.2d 131 (1999). The city\u2019s interest in gaining reimbursement from any recovery by the plaintiff is a \u201cspecific personal and legal interest . . . [that was] specially and injuriously affected\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; by the trial court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s motion to intervene. Therefore, we conclude that the city is aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We next consider whether the trial court\u2019s denial of the city\u2019s motion to intervene, although interlocutory, is a final judgment for purposes of this appeal. This issue is controlled by <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990), in which we stated: \u201cThe test for determining whether an order denying a motion to intervene constitutes a final judgment is whether the would-be intervenor can make a colorable claim to intervention as a matter of right. ... In this case, [the would-be inteivenor] has made a colorable claim to intervention as a matter of right because \u00a7 31-293 specifically grants an employer who has paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee the right to join as a party plaintiff in the employee\u2019s action against third party tortfeasors. . . . Accordingly, [the would-be intervenor] has appealed from a final judgment . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 536. Although, in this case, the city\u2019s liability to the plaintiff arose under \u00a7 7-433c rather than directly under the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the city has made a colorable claim that \u00a7 7-433c incoiporates the \u00a7 31-293 (a) right to intervention in the plaintiffs civil action against the defendant. Therefore, we conclude that the city is appealing from a final judgment for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Finally, we consider whether a litigant that has moved to intervene as a party in an underlying action has the requisite party status to invoke our appellate jurisdiction. We begin by noting that this court frequently has considered the appeals of unsuccessful would-be intervenors. See, e.g., <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, </em>225 Conn. 700, 704, 626 A.2d 702 (1993); <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 274-78, 618 A.2d 1 (1992); <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 536; <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Stanadyne, Inc., </em>181 Conn. 321, 322-24, 435 A.2d 352 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Although, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 735 A.2d 333 (1999), we stated that \u201creview by way of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263 is available only to parties to an underlying action\u201d; id., 152; we did not consider whether would-be intervenors, namely, litigants that are seeking to become parties, can have sufficient party status to bring an appeal. As \u201c[i]t is the general rule that a case resolves only those issues explicitly decided in the case\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 161; we conclude that <em>Salmon </em>did not overrule our long line of earlier cases in which we considered the appeals of would-be intervenors. See, e.g., <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bristol Hospital, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 704; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 536. Therefore, we conclude that if a would-be intervenor has a \u201ccolorable claim to intervention as a matter of right\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>supra, 536; both the final judgment and party status prongs of our test for appellate jurisdiction are satisfied. Accordingly, having concluded that we have appellate jurisdiction, we consider the city\u2019s appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">We first consider whether the city, which has paid benefits to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c, has the right to intervene, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>brought by the plaintiff against the defendant. The plaintiff claims that the city has no right under \u00a7 31-293 (a) to recover benefits the city has paid to him under \u00a7 7-433c. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the city\u2019s right to inteivene under \u00a7 31-293 (a) is limited to third party tortfeasor actions involving injuries compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The plaintiff further argues that, because the benefits the city had paid to him did not constitute compensation paid under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but, rather, compensation paid under the Heart and Hypertension Act, the city has no right to intervene under \u00a7 31-293 (a). Finally, the plaintiff claims that the prohibition against double recovery in workers\u2019 compensation cases is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The city claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion to inteivene. Specifically, the city argues that \u00a7 31-293 (a) is incorporated by reference into \u00a7 7-433c. The city argues that, because it paid benefits to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c, it has a right to inteivene, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), in a civil action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant. Finally, the city argues that the long-standing rule against double recovery in workers\u2019 compensation cases would be violated if the city were denied the right to inteivene in the underlying case because the plaintiff would be allowed to recover twice for his disability. We agree with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">This issue requires us to construe \u00a7 7-433c and \u00a7 31-293 (a) and the relationship between the two provisions. \u201cStatutory construction . . . presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. . . . According to our long-standing principles of statutoiy construction, our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. ... In determining the intent of a statute, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>stances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>ITT Hartford, </em>251 Conn. 106, 110, 752 A.2d 1063 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We begin our analysis with the text of \u00a7 7-433c. General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a) provides that compensation paid thereunder shall be paid in <em>\u201cthe same manner </em>(emphasis added); as that paid under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a) provides that \u201c[t]he benefits provided by this section shall be in lieu of any other benefits ... [a] fireman . . . may be entitled to receive from his municipal employer <em>under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] . </em>. . <em>except as provided by this section, </em>as a result of any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This text suggests that the legislature considered benefits conferred under \u00a7 7-433c to be benefits that are functionally provided \u201cunder the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Consistent with such language, we previously have concluded that an award pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c <em>\u201cis </em>a workers\u2019] compensation award in the sense that its benefits are payable and procedurally administered under the Workers\u2019] Compensation Act . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>243 Conn. 747, 759, 707 A.2d 706 (1998), quoting <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>1 Conn. App. 58, 65-66, 467 A.2d 1258 (1983), cert. dismissed, 192 Conn. 803, 471 A.2d 244 (1984). We also have noted that the essential difference between \u00a7 7-433c benefits and Workers\u2019 Compensation Act benefits is that the receipt of \u00a7 7-433c benefits \u201crequires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>no proof of eligibility or liability under the Work[ers\u2019] Compensation Act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 760, quoting <em>Mid-dletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>supra, 65. Thus, a \u00a7 7-433c \u201caward is <em>payable under the provisions of the Work[ers\u2019] Compensation Act, </em>although the liability for its payment is not.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>supra, 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Next, we consider the text of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any injury for which compensation is <em>payable under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] </em>has been sustained under circumstances creating in a person other than an employer ... a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee . . . may proceed at law against such person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer . . . <em>having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] </em>may bring an action against such person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. If the employee . . . brings an action against such person . . . the [employer] may join as [a party] plaintiff in the action . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Thus, from the plain language of \u00a7 31-293 (a), intervention is allowed when an employer has \u201cpaid . . . compensation under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a). We previously have concluded that benefits awarded to an employee pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c are <em>\u201cpayable . . . under the Work[ers\u2019] Compensation Act </em>. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 759. Therefore, we conclude that an employer that has paid a claimant benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7~433c has paid such benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tion Act for purposes of the right to intervene, pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), in an action brought by the claimant against a third party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Our conclusion is further strengthened by the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment and amendment of \u00a7 7-433c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 7-433c were reviewed extensively in <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 425 A.2d 131 (1979), in which we stated: \u201cConnecticut statutes concerning compensation for policemen and firemen who die or are disabled as a result of hypertension or heart disease have had a rather tumultuous history. In 1951, the General Assembly enacted a statute providing that any impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in the total or partial disability of a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty. [General Statutes (Sup. 1951) \u00a7] 175b. The rebuttable presumption afforded to firemen was, in 1953, made applicable to regular members of paid, municipal police departments; [General Statutes (Sup. 1953) \u00a7] 308c; and, in 1955, was applied to situations where death, as well as disability, results. [General Statutes (Sup. 1955) \u00a7] 407d.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cThis provision, which was repealed and reenacted in 1961 . . . Public Acts 1961, No. 330, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; was amended by the legislature in 1967 making it explicit that the statute applies whether the condition occurs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>while the policeman or fireman is on duty or off duty at the time. Public Acts 1967, No. 770, \u00a7 1. Apparently still dissatisfied with the restrictive implementation of those provisions, the General Assembly, in 1969, again amended the statute by making the state retirement system applicable to this section and by substituting a conclusive presumption that the hypertension or heart disease arose out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment in lieu of the simple presumption. Public Acts 1969, No. 380, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cIn <em>Ducharme </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>161 Conn. 135, 285 A.2d 318 [1971], however, this court held . . . that the conclusive presumption prescribed ... in the adjudication of workers\u2019] compensation cases was in contravention of the due process clauses of both the state and federal constitutions since it operated to completely bar an employer from attempting to prove the negative fact that in a contested case a heart ailment was not causally connected with the employment. [Id., 143], <em>In obvious response to the suggestion in </em>Ducharme <em>that the objective of this legislation might be constitutionally attained by legislation requiring municipalities to provide special compensation or a bonus for policemen and firemen or supplemental or special risk insurance in the case of such occupations-, </em>id., 144; the General Assembly thereafter enacted \u00a7 7-433c .... Upon a subsequent constitutional challenge, the validity of \u00a7 7-433c was sustained in 1975 in <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>168 Conn. 84, 357 A.2d 922, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 805, 96 S. Ct. 14, 46 L. Ed. 2d 26 [1975]. In <em>Grover, </em>we concluded that this statute, which simply [provides] special compensation, or even an outright bonus, to qualifying policemen and firemen, serves a proper public purpose and does not create a class preference which contravenes \u00a7 1 of article first ofthe Connecticut constitution. Id., 88-89 . . . .\u2019\u2019(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>omitted.) <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 178 Conn. 667-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The legislative history of House Bill No. 9245, the bill eventually enacted as Public Acts 1971, No. 524, \u00a7 1, and codified at \u00a7 7-433c, clearly and unequivocally demonstrates that the legislature enacted \u00a7 7-433c in direct response to our decision in <em>Ducharme. </em>See 14 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1971 Sess., pp. 2803-2804, remarks of Senator Wilbur Smith (\u201cHouse Bill 9245, has been raised [in] response to the [Supreme Court\u2019s] decision and has been drafted with the court\u2019s suggestion. It provides a means of carrying out what has been the clear and consistent intent of this legislation since 1959.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In 1977, the legislature amended \u00a7 7-433c to provide that benefits conferred under the Heart and Hypertension Act are in lieu of any benefits that a policeman or fireman might be entitled to receive under other sections of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Public Acts 1977, No. 77-520, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 77-520). The legislative history of House Bill No. 8095, the bill eventually enacted as P.A. 77-520, \u00a7 1, which amended \u00a7 7-433c, \u201cdemonstrates that it was intended to place those policemen [or firemen] who die or are disabled as a result of heart disease or hypertension in the same position vis-a-vis compensation benefits as policemen [or firemen] who die or are disabled as a result of service related injuries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 146, 480 A.2d 519 (1984); see 20 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1977 Sess., p. 1817, remarks of Representative Samuel Gejdenson (\u201c[w]hat this bill does is sees that [a person collecting benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c] gets no more than if he [or she] was collecting benefits under workers\u2019] compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Thus, from the legislative history and the circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 7-433c, the following can be concluded. First, prior to our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>in <em>Ducharme, </em>the legislature had included heart and hypertension benefits for firefighters among the benefits provided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Thus, the legislature had evinced an unequivocal intent to have the intervention provision of \u00a7 31-293 (a) apply to heart and hypertension benefits, inasmuch as such benefits were paid pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act itself. Second, the legislature, in response to <em>Ducharme, </em>adopted \u00a7 7-433c as a means of \u201ccarrying out what [had] been the clear and consistent intent of th[e] legislation since 1959.\u201d 14 S. Proc., supra, p. 2804, remarks of Senator Smith. As we previously stated, that intent included having \u00a7 31-293 (a) apply to employers that make heart or hypertension benefit payments to a claimant. In contrast, there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that when the legislature adopted \u00a7 7-433c, it intended to strip employers of their right to intervene in third party tortfeasor cases when the employer has provided the claimant with heart or hypertension benefits. Third, the legislative history of the 1977 amendment to \u00a7 7~433c; Public Acts 1977, No. 77-520, \u00a7 1; provides further support for the conclusion that the legislature intended for claimants receiving \u00a7 7-433c benefits to receive \u201cno more than if [they were] collecting benefits under workers\u2019] compensation.\u201d 20 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 1817, remarks of Representative Gejdenson. Thus, the legislative history and the circumstances surrounding the enactment and amendment of \u00a7 7-433c bolster our conclusion that \u00a7 7-433c benefits are payable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and, therefore, that \u00a7 31-293 (a) authorizes the city to intervene in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Finally, were the plaintiff to prevail against the defendant in the underlying action, he would receive a double recovery under his construction of \u00a7 7-433c and \u00a7 31-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>293 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIf we were to accept the plaintiffs position and conclude that \u00a7 7-433c benefits are not to be considered workers\u2019] compensation payments . . . the plaintiff would not be placed in the same position ... as other . . . [firemen] who die or who are disabled as a direct result of service-related injuries; rather, he would be placed in a superior position . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 151. Should the plaintiff recover damages in his action against the defendant, an unwarranted windfall would result, namely, he would recover the \u00a7 7-433c benefits paid by the city, as well as damages from the defendant, for the same disability, and he would not have to repay his \u00a7 7-433c benefits from the money received from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The plaintiff claimed at oral argument that the public policy against this double recovery constitutes the \u201cbonus\u201d that the legislature intended by enacting \u00a7 7-433c. See, e.g., <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 88 (\u00a7 7-433c benefits constitute \u201cspecial compensation or even an outright <em>bonus, </em>to qualifying policemen and firemen\u201d [emphasis added]). We have held, however, that \u201cthe \u2018bonus\u2019 aspect of \u00a7 7-433c benefits is that the claimant is not required to prove that his or her heart disease or hypertension is causally connected to his or her employment, proof that would be required for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Carriero </em>v. <em>Nauga-tuck, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 754-55.\u201d <em>Gauger </em>v. <em>Frankl, </em>252 Conn. 708, 713, 752 A.2d 1077 (2000). There is no merit to the plaintiffs contention that the bonus referred to in <em>Grover </em>is the opportunity to receive a double recovery. Furthermore, we have held that \u00a7 7-433c should be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>strued so as to <em>prevent </em>the double recovery of benefits. See <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 151; see also <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>supra, 1 Conn. App. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">By contrast, our construction of \u00a7 7-433c, which allows the city to recover the benefits that it has paid to the plaintiff should the plaintiff prevail in his lawsuit against the defendant, furthers the statute\u2019s legislative purpose \u201cto protect against a wage loss, not to give some firemen and policemen a double recovery for the same wage loss.\u201d <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>supra, 1 Conn. App. 63. Likewise, our construction of \u00a7 31-293 (a) promotes one of that statute\u2019s primary purposes: preventing double recovery by an employee. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lighthouse Restaurant, Inc., </em>246 Conn. 156, 164, 716 A.2d 71 (1998) (\u201cthe employer\u2019s statutory right to subrogation of the proceeds of the employee\u2019s claim against the tortfeasor implements the public policy of preventing double recovery by an injured employee\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the \u201cstrong public policy against double recovery\u201d; id., 168; embodied in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act bolsters our conclusion that the city may intervene in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In reaching our conclusion, we distinguish a number of cases upon which the plaintiff relies. First, the plaintiff relies upon our decision in <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 178 Conn. 673, for the proposition that \u00a7 7-433c benefits are not payable under any part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We have, however, previously distinguished <em>Plainville </em>as being inapplicable in a case, such as the present case, in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>a claimant would receive a double benefit based on a particular construction of \u00a7 7-433c. See <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 150-51. In <em>Maciejew-ski, </em>we relied upon the Appellate Court\u2019s \u201cwell reasoned decision\u201d; id., 151; in <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>supra, 1 Conn. App. 58, in which that court stated: \u201cThe court in <em>Plainville . . . </em>held that the defendant insurance company was not required to pay benefits arising under . . . \u00a7 7-433c because such benefits were not workers\u2019] compensation benefits under an insurance policy providing coverage for workers\u2019] compensation benefits. Underlying the court\u2019s decision was the fact that basic contractual principles require a determination of what the parties intended as the risk to be covered. . . . The court . . . makes it clear that its holding is limited to the facts and context of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u201cThe <em>Plainville </em>court overruled an earlier case, <em>Pyne </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>177 Conn. 456, 418 A.2d 899 (1979), to the extent that <em>Pyne </em>expressed a contrary view. That portion of <em>Pyne </em>which expresses the legislative purpose of ... \u00a7 7-433c is not disturbed. The intent of the legislation is to place qualifying firemen and policemen who die or are disabled as the result of hypertension or heart disease in the same compensation position as those who die or are disabled as the result of on-duty, service-related injuries. Its purpose is not to exalt those firemen and policemen who die of heart disease not work-related over those who die of the same disease during the course of or as a result of their on-duty services. <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, [178 Conn.] 670. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u201cThe holding of <em>Plainville </em>does not require a result in th[is] . . . case which would give the defendant a double, concurrent collection of benefits . . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>supra, 1 Conn. App. 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Similarly, the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 475 A.2d 283 (1984), <em>and McNulty </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>37 Conn. App. 835, 657 A.2d 1126 (1995), also is misplaced. Both <em>Bakelaar </em>and <em>McNulty, </em>like <em>Plainville, </em>involved instances in which a party other than a municipality allegedly was liable for the payment of benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. See <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 69-70 (city carries insurance coverage for claims under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act but not for claims under \u00a7 7-433c); <em>McNulty </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 845 (second injury fund not liable for payment of benefits under \u00a7 7-433c). By contrast, in <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 150-51, and <em>Middletown v. Local 1073, </em>supra, 1 Conn. App. 60-61, as in this case, the issue was whether \u00a7 7-433c should be construed so as to allow a claimant to receive \u00a7 7-433c benefits, in addition to benefits from a separate source, for the same disability. It is clear that the facts and legal issues raised in this case are similar to those in <em>Maciejewski </em>and <em>Local 1073, </em>but not to those in <em>Plainville, Bakelaar </em>and <em>McNulty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>208 Conn. 576, 546 A.2d 243 (1988), upon which the plaintiff also relies, is similarly inapposite. In <em>Morgan, </em>the issue was \u201cwhether an award made pursuant to ... \u00a7 7-433c for a permanent partial disability [was] an asset of a deceased recipient\u2019s estate.\u201d Id., 577-78. Although we stated in dicta that \u201cthe substantive law of \u00a7 7-433c governs claims under that section . . . [and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] is used only for puiposes of computation\u201d; id., 585 n. 12; it is clear that we merely were restating our earlier conclusion that the express language of \u00a7 7-433c, which limits benefits to the claimant \u201cor his dependents, as the case may be\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 581; controlled the issue in <em>Morgan. </em>Furthermore, in <em>Morgan, </em>we also stated: \u201cWe previously have noted the sound reasoning of the Appellate Court in . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Local 1073 . . </em>. on other issues relating to \u00a7 7-433c; see <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>[supra, 194 Com. 151] <em>(hypertension and heart disease benefits can be deducted as workers\u2019 compensation benefits </em>for purposes of establishing municipal pension benefits).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>supra, 586. Thus, it is clear that <em>Morgan </em>does not stand for the proposition that \u00a7 7-433c benefits are never to be considered workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We next consider whether the trial court\u2019s order denying intervention can be affirmed on the alternate ground that the city had failed to file a certificate of good faith pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a. The plaintiff argues that each complaining party in a negligence action against a health care provider, including intervening parties, must file a certificate of good faith. The plaintiff claims that, because the city has failed to file such a certificate, it is barred from proceeding further.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The city argues that this claim is not ripe because the trial court did not decide this issue in its memorandum of decision addressing the propriety of the city\u2019s motion to intervene, and because the city has not filed an intervening complaint. On the merits, the city argues that the purpose of \u00a7 52-190a was fulfilled when the plaintiff filed its certificate of good faith in the underlying action. The city further argues that, because it was not the original party filing the underlying action against the defendant, makes no new claims against the defendant, and merely seeks apportionment of any damages that the plaintiff may recover, it has no duty to file a certificate of good faith. We agree with the city on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">We first consider whether this issue is ripe. First, although the trial court did not consider this issue, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>plaintiff clearly raised it before the trial court and the record is adequate for our review. The city provides no authority for its claim that \u201c[a]n issue not addressed by the trial court is not ripe for appeal.\u201d On the contrary, if the trial court fails to rule on an issue raised by an appellee in the trial court, the appellee\u2019s failure to raise the issue on appeal may constitute an abandonment thereof. See, e.g., <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>181 Conn. 482, 490 &amp; n.4, 436 A.2d 8 (1980). Thus, it was proper for the plaintiff to have filed a preliminary statement of issues containing this alternate ground for affirmance. See <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 3713, </em>35 Conn. App. 804, 805 n.1, 647 A.2d 755 (1994) (when trial court does not rule on alternate ground, burden is on appellee to provide adequate record for review of alternate ground). Therefore, the trial court\u2019s failure to rule on this issue does not mean that it is not ripe for our review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Second, we reject the city\u2019s argument that, because the trial court denied the city\u2019s motion to intervene, this claim is not ripe inasmuch as the city argues that it has not filed an intervening <em>complaint. </em>General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a provides, for those litigants subject to its requirements, that a certificate of good faith must be filed with the \u201ccomplaint or <em>initial </em>pleading.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The city has filed its initial pleading in this case, namely, a motion to intervene. Thus, the city\u2019s failure to file a good faith certificate presents a live controversy as to whether its motion to intervene was legally deficient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plaintiffs alternate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ground for affirmance is ripe for our review and we consider the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We begin our analysis with the text of General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cNo civil action shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless the attorney or party filing the action has made a reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. The complaint or initial pleading shall contain a certificate, on a form prescribed by the rules of the superior court, of the attorney or party filing the action that such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We note that the legislature used the terms \u201cattorney,\u201d \u201cparty,\u201d \u201ccomplaint,\u201d \u201cpleading\u201d and \u201ccertificate\u201d in the singular, suggesting an intent to require the filing of one certificate. The text of the statute suggests that its purpose is to prevent frivolous lawsuits against health care providers. See <em>Bruttomesso </em>v. <em>Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Inc., </em>242 Conn. 1, 15, 698 A.2d 795 (1997) (\u201c[t]he purpose of [\u00a7 52-190a] is to inhibit a plaintiff from bringing an inadequately investigated cause of action, whether in tort or in contract, claiming negligence by a health care provider\u201d); <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 710, 579 A.2d 1 (1990) (\u201cthe general purpose of \u00a7 52-190a is to discourage the filing of baseless lawsuits against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>health care providers\u201d). By contrast, there is nothing in either the text of the statute or its underlying purpose to suggest that the legislature intended to require a would-be intervenor, under the facts of this case, to file a good faith certificate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the plaintiff conceded at oral argument that he had found no legislative histoiy to support such a construction. We conclude that the purpose of \u00a7 52-190a has been fulfilled in this case because the plaintiff has filed a certificate of good faith, as required by \u00a7 52-190a, and the city asserts no new claims against the defendant, but merely seeks apportionment of the damages. Thus, we conclude that the city was not required to file a certificate of good faith pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a in order to intervene in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The order denying the motion to intervene is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the motion to intervene, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any provision of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] or any other general statute, charter, special act or ordinance to the contrary, in the event a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment ....
