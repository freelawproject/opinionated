ORS 138.060(3). We review for errors of law, <em>Dyer v. R.E. Christiansen Trucking, Inc., </em>118 Or App 320, 848 P2d 104, <em>rev allowed </em>317 Or 583 (1993), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Motor Vehicles Division revoked the driving privileges of all three defendants. The licenses of defendants Walmsley and Hammerton were revoked for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. ORS 809.410(4). Defendant Daniels\u2019 license was revoked three times, most recently as a habitual traffic offender. ORS 809.600. Because of the grounds on which their licenses were revoked, all defendants were subject to being charged with felony driving while revoked if they operated a motor vehicle while their licenses remained revoked. ORS 811.182.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> Each of the revocation orders specified a period of revocation. All three defendants were charged with felony driving while revoked for driving after the period of revocation had expired on their respective revocation orders, but before they had obtained new drivers\u2019 licenses. Before trial, each defendant moved to prohibit introduction of the license revocation order,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that it was irrelevant because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>period of revocation specified in each had expired. The trial court granted each defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The state acknowledges that the revocation periods specified in each revocation order had expired before the incidents for which defendants were charged, but argues that the trial court nevertheless erred in excluding the orders. It cites <em>State v. Foster, </em>54 Or App 405, 635 P2d 11 (1981), and argues that defendants\u2019 driving privileges remained revoked even after the period of revocation had expired, because defendants had not taken steps to reestablish their driving privileges. Therefore, it argues, the revocation orders should have been admitted as relevant evidence of the \u201crevoked\u201d status of defendants\u2019 driving privileges at the time of the incidents for which they are charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In <em>State v. Foster, supra, </em>we held that the trial court erred in suppressing evidence of an order revoking the defendant\u2019s driving privileges, even though the revocation period had expired before the driving incident for which he was charged. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">\u201cThe term revocation embraces the concept of finality. \u2018Revocation\u2019 is defined by ORS 482.030(1) to mean:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201c \u2018* * * that the licensee\u2019s privilege to drive * * * is <em>terminated. </em>A new license may be obtained only as permitted by law.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">\u201cIt follows that [on the date of the revocation,] defendant\u2019s license was <em>revoked </em>forever. The only way he could legally drive again was by applying for a <em>new </em>license as prescribed by law.\u201d 54 Or App at 408. (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Since <em>Foster, </em>the legislature has reorganized and revised the motor vehicle code. Or Laws 1983, ch 338; Or Laws 1985, ch 16. However, the definition of revocation remains virtually unchanged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants concede that <em>Foster </em>has not been affected by the statutory changes. They also concede that revocation continues after the expiration of the period of revocation. They argue that a defendant who drives after the period of revocation has expired may be cited only for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>infraction for driving while revoked, instead of being charged with felony driving while revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The classification of driving while revoked as a felony is based on <em>the reason for the original revocation, </em>not on whether the revocation period has expired. ORS 811.182(3). The revocation period is simply the statutory period of time during which a person whose license has been revoked may not attempt to reestablish driving privileges. ORS 809.390(2). Nothing in the motor vehicle statutes provides for a felony charge to be reduced to an infraction after the passage of time, and we will not insert that which has been omitted. ORS 174.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The orders were evidence of both the \u201crevoked\u201d status of each defendant\u2019s driving privileges and of the reason for the original revocation. Therefore, they were relevant to prove an element of the crime with which each defendant was charged. The trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\"> ORS 811.182 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of criminal driving while suspended or revoked * * * if the person violates ORS 811.175 and the suspension or revocation is one described in this section * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">&lt;&lt;* <em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">\u201c(3) The crime is a Class C felony if the suspension or revocation resulted from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">\u201c(a) Habitual offender status under ORS 809.640.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">C&lt;s)s # ifr <em>Ht </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\">\u201c(c) Any crime punishable as a felony with proof of a material element involving the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d ORS 811.175 provides, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-14\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of infraction driving while * * * revoked * <em>* </em>* if the person * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\">\u201c(a) Drives a motor vehicle upon a highway during a period when the person\u2019s driving privileges or right to apply for driving privileges have been suspended or revoked in this state by a court or by the division.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-16\"> Defendant Daniels moved to prohibit introduction of three separate orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> ORS 801.435 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-11\">\u201c \u2018Revoked\u2019 with reference to driving privileges * * * means the termination thereof with new driving privileges * * * obtainable only as permitted by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
