On review of a summary judgment, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We view any evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Stevens v. Bispham, </em>316 Or 221, 851 P2d 556 (1993). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Plaintiff Zavalas is the personal representative of two children who died when Donna Shonkwiler struck them wdth her automobile. Plaintiff Olivares is the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of two other children injured in the same incident. Individual plaintiffs Benjamin J. Olivares and Maria Cruz Jimenez are the parents of the injured children. Defendant treated Shonkwdler prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On June 14, 1988, Shonkwdler, who was on probation for a 1985 conviction for possession of heroin, had an appointment wdth defendant at his office. Shonkwiler made the appointment because a neighbor had told her that defendant was \u201ceasy\u201d about prescribing the psychoactive drug Xanax. About an hour before the appointment, Shonkwiler injected herself wdth heroin. During the appointment she \u201ccried and cried and cried.\u201d She described her symptoms and depression. She also told defendant that in the past she had taken a number of prescription drugs, including lithium, Limbitrol, Mellaril, Valium and Xanax.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Defendant met wdth Shonkwdler for approximately 45 minutes. He estimated that about 20 minutes into their meeting she began to cry, and recounted that it was difficult to get answers from her. Defendant did not conduct a physical examination of Shonkwdler, so did not notice needle marks on her arms from injecting drugs. Neither did he obtain a complete history, because \u201cto obtain history and do a proper examination would have taken the rest of the morning, and I didn\u2019t have the rest of the morning.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the end of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>meeting, defendant gave Shonkwiler a prescription for 100 tablets of Xanax to help control her anxiety. He prescribed that quantity because Shonkwiler told him that she had difficulty with transportation and because the drug was less expensive when purchased in quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Three days later, Shonkwiler called defendant\u2019s office and the Beaverton Police Department and reported that her purse and Xanax prescription had been stolen. The police department confirmed the report and offered to pay for a refill from its reserve fund. Defendant authorized a drug store to dispense a refill.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On the evening of June 19, 1988, Shonkwiler attempted suicide by an overdose of Xanax and heroin. The next day, with Xanax, heroin, cocaine and marijuana in her system, she drove her car and struck the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Plaintiffs executed a covenant not to sue Shonkwiler and filed these claims against defendant. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged that he was negligent in prescribing Xanax to Shonkwiler when she presented symptoms of \u201cpsychotic illness, depression, chronic bipolar mental disorder and chronic drug use,\u201d and in authorizing the refill of that prescription. They alleged that, as a foreseeable result of defendant\u2019s negligence, Shonkwiler drove her car while under the influence of Xanax, and that Xanax was a substantial factor in impairing her ability to drive safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Defendant did not answer. Instead, he filed various motions under ORCP 21, including a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. ORCP 21A(8). That motion was denied. Defendant then moved for summary judgment. He argued that, regardless of whether his conduct unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of the type of harm suffered, as a physician he owes no duty to nonpatients. The trial court granted that motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Determining whether summary judgment was appropriate requires us to examine the role of \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cno duty\u201d in negligence cases involving a defendant physician and plaintiffs who are not patients of that physician. The Supreme Court in <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School District No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 734 P2d 1326 (1987), held that unless a status, relationship or particular standard of conduct creates, defines or limits a defendant\u2019s responsibility, the issue of liability for harm resulting from a defendant\u2019s conduct properly depends on whether the conduct unreasonably created a foreseeable risk to a protected interest of the kind of harm that befell a plaintiff. The court concluded that \u201c[d]uty remains a formal element of the plaintiffs claim only in the sense that the plaintiff loses if the defendant persuades a court to phrase such a limit in terms of \u2018no duty.\u2019 \u201d 303 Or at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The court elaborated on the \u201cno duty\u201d defense in <em>Donaca v. Curry Co., </em>303 Or 30, 734 P2d 1339 (1987). It characterized \u201cno duty\u201d defenses as being of two kinds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201cSometimes \u2018no duty\u2019 excludes whole categories of claimants or of claims, for instance economic or psychic loss caused by physical injury to another person. At other times \u2018no duty\u2019 refers narrowly to an aspect of the particular circumstances before the court. This often amounts to a claim that no rational factfinder could find defendant\u2019s conduct unreasonably to pose a foreseeable risk to the plaintiff but does not really assert any categorical rule.\u201d 303 Or at 32-33. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The \u201cno duty\u201d defense asserted by defendant is of the first kind. According to him, an entire category of claimants \u2014 nonpatients\u2014is prohibited from recovering against a physician for alleged acts of negligence in treating a patient. He asks us to hold, as a matter of law, that a physician has no duty to third parties and, therefore, that a physician is shielded from liability to third parties who claim that the physician\u2019s negligent treatment of a patient was the foreseeable cause of their harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Defendant makes three arguments in support of his theory that a physician can never be liable to nonpatients. The first is that physicians are shielded from liability to third persons by the standard of care they owe to their patients. That standard is articulated in ORS 677.095, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201cA physician * * * licensed to practice medicine * * * has the duty to use that degree of care, skill and diligence which is used by ordinarily careful physicians * * * in the same or similar circumstances in the community of the physician * * * or a similar community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In construing a statute, our responsibility is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d ORS 174.010. We generally apply clear, unambiguous statutes according to their plain meaning, without resort to extrinsic evidence of legislative intent, unless literal application would produce an absurd or unreasonable result. <em>Satterfield v. Satterfield, </em>292 Or 780, 643 P2d 336 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">ORS 677.095 declares the duty of care that licensed physicians must satisfy when engaged in the practice of medicine in Oregon. It holds physicians to the degree of care, skill and diligence of ordinarily careful physicians in the community of the physician or a similar community. The language of the statute states the nature of the physician\u2019s duty of care. It is notably silent about the extent or reach of that duty. Defendant would have us read into the statute language that is conspicuously absent regarding the extent of the physician\u2019s duty. We are not at liberty to do so. ORS 174.010. Defendant\u2019s reliance on ORS 677.095 in support of his defense of \u201cno duty\u201d is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Defendant next argues that, \u201cin the absence of a physician-patient relationship, plaintiffs simply have no claim for medical negligence against [defendant].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant cites only one authority for that position, <em>Webb v. Jarvis, </em>575 NE2d 992 (Ind 1991). Defendant is correct that the Indiana court held that a physician who had prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>anabolic steroids for a patient who subsequently became violent and injured a third party was not liable to the third party under the facts of that case. However, the court explicitly rejected the position that defendant would have us adopt. It said, \u201c[W]e agree with [plaintiff] that the lack of privity between him and [defendant physician], alone, does not mandate the conclusion that there was no duty.\u201d 575 NE2d at 996. It concluded that, although physicians generally do not owe a duty to unknown nonpatients who may be injured by the physician\u2019s treatment of a patient, \u201c[t]his conclusion should not be interpreted as inoculating physicians so as to give them complete immunity against third person claims.\u201d Justice Dickson concurred, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">\u201cI concur separately to reflect my understanding that by our opinion today this Court does not intend to unequivocally declare that physicians generally have no duty toward unknown third persons foreseeably at risk of injury resulting from the negligent administration or prescription of medication.\u201d 575 NE2d at 998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Like the court in <em>Webb </em>and courts in several other jurisdictions, we reject defendant\u2019s position that under no circumstances can a physician ever be liable to a nonpatient third party. <em>See, e.g., Watkins v. United States, </em>589 F2d 214 (5th Cir 1979); <em>Welke v. Kuzilla, </em>144 Mich App 245, 375 NW2d 403 (1985); <em>Wharton Transport Corp. v. Bridges, </em>606 SW2d 521 (Tenn 1980). Defendant offers no basis for holding that, under the particular circumstances of this case, he should prevail on his \u201cno duty\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Finally, defendant contends that our decision in <em>Doe v. Portland Health Centers, Inc., </em>99 Or App 423, 782 P2d 446 (1989), <em>rev dismissed </em>310 Or 476 (1990), \u201cis dispositive\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In <em>Doe, </em>the defendant disclosed to a third person that the plaintiffs daughter had been hospitalized after a suicide attempt. The plaintiff, a practicing psychologist, claimed that she suffered business losses, loss of reputation and emotional distress because of the disclosures. She maintained that the duty of confidentiality owed to her daughter extended to her. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claim, and held that, under the facts of that case, the defendant\u2019s statutory duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>confidentiality, ORS 677.190(5), did not extend beyond the patient with respect to the disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We disagree with defendant that the holding in <em>Doe </em>can be generalized to support his theory that under no circumstances can a physician be held liable to third parties for the negligent treatment of a patient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Doe, </em>we declined the invitation \u201cto attempt to define the scope of the duty [of confidentiality] under all circumstances [.]\u201d 99 Or App at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that as a physician he is shielded from plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in this case by the defense of \u201cno duty\u201d fails for the reasons explained above. Defendant was not entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because this appeal from summary judgment is before us only on defendant\u2019s \u201cno duty\u201d theory, we do not address whether plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to support the claim that defendant\u2019s negligence was the foreseeable cause of their harm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\"> ORS 677.190(25) provides that the Board of Medical Examiners may suspend or revoke a license to practice medicine in Oregon for \u201cprescribing controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>substances * * * without following accepted procedures for examination of patients * * * &gt;)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-10\"> Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment presented purely legal issues. The dissent contends, nonetheless, that the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 injuries were unforeseeable. Because the language used by the trial court is ambiguous, we think it more reasonable to conclude that the motion was granted on the ground upon which it was argued. We treat the judgment as such. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Moreover, if the trial court had granted summary judgment on the basis of the unforeseeability of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, that would have been error. Because defendant did not contest the foreseeability of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, plaintiffs were not required to present proof on that issue in order to withstand the motion. <em>Reed v. Jackson County, </em>105 Or App 24, 31-32, 803 P2d 1194 (1990), <em>rev den </em>311 Or 261 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> Defendant acknowledges one exception to that argument; namely, the physician\u2019s duty to warn. <em>See Docken v. Ciba-Geigy, </em>86 Or App 277, 739 P2d 591, <em>rev den </em>304 Or 405 (1987). Defendant emphasizes that \u201c[tjhis case, however, is not a failure to warn case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\"> <em>Cf. Docken v. Ciba-Geigy, supra, </em>where we held that a physician\u2019s liability for negligently failing to warn of the dangers of a prescription drug extends to anyone foreseeably injured by that negligence. In that case, the defendant\u2019s claim of \u201cno duty\u201d was not based on any statute, status or rule. We characterized the \u201cno duty\u201d defense as merely another way of stating that the harm suffered by a boy who used a drug prescribed for his brother was not a foreseeable risk of the conduct alleged as negligence in the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\"> The dissent would conclude that defendant was entitled to summary judgment due to the insufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of foreseeability. However, on appeal from a summary judgment, we do not review the sufficiency of the pleadings. We review to determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact, and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Park v. Hoffard, </em>315 Or 624, 627, 847 P2d 852 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\"> Nothing in <em>Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., </em>316 Or 499, 853 P2d 798 (1993), affects our decision in this case. The dissent is correct that, at the trial court level, <em>Buckler </em>was resolved by summary judgment, as was this case. It does not contend that the comparison goes any further. We agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b204-7\">De MUNIZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">I do not agree with the majority\u2019s reading of the trial court\u2019s statement on summary judgment, its characterization of the issues on appeal or its relegating to a footnote the recent controlling Supreme Court opinion in <em>Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., </em>316 Or 499, 853 P2d 798 (1993). I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Defendant brought his motion for summary judgment on the ground that he owed a duty only to his patients. Plaintiffs\u2019 countering argument was that allegations that defendant negligently prescribed Xanax to Shonkwiler are sufficient to present a question for the jury under the foreseeability analysis of <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School District No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 734 P2d 1326 (1987). The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant. However, I do not agree with the majority that, in reaching that conclusion, \u201cthe language used by the trial court is ambiguous,\u201d 124 Or App at 170 n 2, or with the majority\u2019s persistence in analyzing only the issue of whether a doctor ever owes a duty to persons other than the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The trial court applied the foreseeability standard of whether defendant\u2019s conduct, which resulted in harm to plaintiffs, was unreasonable under the circumstances and the risk of harm to the class of persons to whom plaintiffs belong was foreseeable. <em>Fuhrer v. Gearhart By The Sea, Inc., </em>306 Or 434, 437, 760 P2d 874 (1988); <em>Donaca v. Curry Co., </em>303 Or 30, 734 P2d 1339 (1987); <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, supra. </em>Under that standard, it concluded that plaintiffs here did not come within the protected class of persons. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cIf you read the opinion in the <em>Fazzolari </em>case and then in the <em>Donaca </em>case, the key language to me is whether the conduct that plaintiff complains about of the doctor unreasonably caused a foreseeable risk of harm to an interest of the kind for which the plaintiff claims damages, and to me that means the protected group for which the plaintiff claims damages, and the difficulty I\u2019m having with this case is the link that the plaintiff is making from Shonkwiler going out and using more of the pills than she should have or perhaps just using the pills if she was using them in combination with other pills and getting in a vehicle and injuring someone with the vehicle. That\u2019s the difficult part (unintelligible) and I\u2019m not prepared to say that this theory [from <em>Fazzolari </em>and Donaca] reaches that far. I\u2019m satisfied that although the result here was tragic, that the remedy is not in a negligence action against the doctor, because if you follow that theory to its logical conclusion, then a doctor has to protect against that next step from every patient, that being the patient misusing the pills or using them and then going to work or getting in a car or whatever else that might cause some risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>harm to someone else and I\u2019m not satisfied that these cases have expanded negligence law in this state to that degree and I\u2019m going to grant the motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The majority glosses over the fact that this is <em>plaintiffs \u2019 </em>appeal. Plaintiffs continue to argue that the correct analysis to determine defendant\u2019s liability is foreseeability, but they do not explain why the court\u2019s foreseeability analysis was erroneous. Neither does the majority, stating only conclusorily that, \u201cif the trial court had granted summary judgment on the basis of the unforeseeability of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, that would have been error.\u201d 124 Or App at 170 n 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority also ignores its own admonition that our role, \u201c[o]n review of a summary judgment, [is to] determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d 124 Or App at 169. As a matter of law, the trial court was correct under the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions on foreseeability before <em>Buchler </em>and even more correct under <em>Buchler.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In <em>Buchler, </em>the plaintiffs decedent had been killed by a prisoner who had escaped from a work crew of a forest work camp. The prisoner had driven away in the state\u2019s van, in which the keys had been left in the ignition, and had later stolen a gun with which he shot the decedent. The Supreme Court held that the Corrections Division could not be liable for the actions of the prisoner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Buchler </em>controls here and demonstrates that this case should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">This case is before us in the same procedural posture as <em>Buckler </em>was before the Supreme Court: The defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>been granted summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court affirmed that judgment by looking to the allegations of the complaint and the evidence established on the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We should do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Here, <em>after </em>evidence was presented and summary judgment granted, plaintiffs filed amended complaints <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>They rely on those amended complaints. The complaints allege that defendant was negligent in giving Shonkwiler a prescription for 100 tablets of Xanax on June 14,1988, and in authorizing the drug store to dispense 100 tablets of Xanax to Shonkwiler on June 17,1988. Plaintiffs\u2019 position is that those allegations are sufficient to create a question for the jury. The majority, by focusing only on the issue of a physician\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d to nonpatients, apparently agrees. I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In support of their position that a defendant\u2019s liability for the acts of a third party is a question for the jury, plaintiffs cite <em>Kimbler v. Stillwell, </em>303 Or 23, 27, 734 P2d 1344 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cThe fact that a plaintiffs injury was inflicted by the intentional, even criminal, act of a third person does not foreclose liability if such an act was a foreseeable risk facilitated by the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In <em>Buchler, </em>the Supreme Court expressly held that <em>\u201cKimbler </em>should not be considered as precedent in the future.\u201d 316 Or at 513. Its analysis in reaching that conclusion applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The Supreme Court characterized the above language from <em>Kimbler </em>as the \u201c \u2018facilitation rationale\u2019 \u201d and described the limitations of its application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201c[W]e think the breadth of <em>Kimbler\u2019s </em>holding cannot be supported by a foreseeability analysis that requires that a defendant, to be liable, must have <em>unreasonably </em>created the risk of the sort of harm to plaintiff that befell him. Certainly it cannot be supported by such analysis on a motion for summary judgment, where there are no claimed facts showing defendant\u2019s knowledge of unreasonable risk of danger to the particular plaintiffs involved. In the instant case, there also is no evidence to show any such knowledge by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><em>\u201cWe </em>decline to apply the \u2018facilitation\u2019 rationale of <em>Kimbler v. Stillwell, supra, </em>to this case. An intervening criminal instrumentality caused the harm and created the risk in that case, as in the present case. While it is generally foreseeable that criminals may commit crimes and that prisoners may escape and engage in criminal activity while at large, that level of foreseeability does not make the criminal\u2019s acts the legal responsibility of everyone who may have contributed in some way to the criminal opportunity. In other words, in our society it is foreseeable that crimes may occur and that the criminals perpetrating them may cause harm. Thus, in a general sense, it is foreseeable that anyone whose conduct may in any way facilitate the criminal in committing the crime has played some part in the resulting harm. But mere \u2018facilitation\u2019 of an unintended adverse result, where intervening intentional criminality of another person is the harm-producing force, does not cause the harm so as to support liability for it.\u201d <em>Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., supra, </em>316 Or at 511. (Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Any decision to prescribe medication carries a risk that the patient will abuse or misuse the medication, resulting in injurious consequences. Here, before defendant is to be held liable for the consequences of Shonkwiler\u2019s intervening act of driving under the influence of intoxicants, plaintiffs must allege facts to show the link between the prescribing of the medication and the foreseeable consequence. <em>See Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., supra, </em>316 Or at 513. Plaintiffs alleged that, when Shonkwiler saw defendant, she exhibited symptoms that included psychotic illness, depression, chronic bipolar mental disorder and chronic drug use. However, there is no allegation in plaintiffs amended complaint that a prescription for Xanax was medically incorrect for a person displaying those symptoms. There is no allegation that defendant knew, or should have known, that Shonkwiler would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>abuse Xanax and drive or would abuse Xanax along with other drugs and drive. There is no allegation that defendant failed to warn Shonkwiler not to drive or failed to instruct her as to the correct use of Xanax.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, as in <em>Buckler, </em>there are no claimed facts that show that defendant had knowledge of an unreasonable risk of danger to the particular plaintiffs involved and no evidence that he had such knowledge. The trial court was correct, as a matter of law. I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\"> The majority does not address defendant\u2019s claim that the judgment should be sustained \u201ceven under <em>theFazzolari </em>foreseeability analysis,\u201d because he had no duty to prevent Shonkwiler from driving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\"> I could not disagree more with the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[njothing in <em>Buckler </em>* * * affects our decision in this case.\u201d 124 Or App at 174 n 6. I cannot understand how the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent analysis of the concepts of \u201cduty \u201d and \u201cforeseeability\u201d can possibly <em>not </em>affect our analysis here. <em>See Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., supra, </em>316 Or at 509.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> In its analysis, the Supreme Court notes the general rule of non-liability for the conduct of others in the absence of a special relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff. <em>Restatement (Second) Torts </em>\u00a7 315 (1965). In <em>Buchler, </em>a jailer had custody of a prisoner, and the court adopted section 319 as the law of Oregon. That section delineates the custodian\u2019s duty to control the conduct of others. However, the court did not preclude liability on the basis of the common-law rule in section 315. Rather, it proceeded to analyze two claims of \u201cgeneral negligence\u201d under the foreseeability/facilitator analysis discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> I am perplexed by the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he dissent is correct that, at the trial court level, <em>Buchler </em>was resolved by summary judgment, as was this case. It does not contend that the comparison goes any further. We agree.\u201d 124 Or App at 174 n 6.1 do not know how to make it clearer that I do not find anything in the way this case was presented to the trial court, decided there, or argued on appeal that precludes our addressing plaintiffs\u2019 arguments regarding foreseeability. In short, I contend that the comparison between this case and <em>Buchler </em>goes so far as for the latter to be controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\"> The majority asserts that, on summary judgment, we \u201cdo not review the sufficiency of the pleadings.\u201d 124 Or App at 174 n 5. However, that is what the Supreme Court did in resolving <em>Buckler. </em>It assessed the \u201cclaimed facts\u201d and the \u201cevidence.\u201d <em>See Buchler v. Oregon Corrections Div., supra, </em>316 Or at 513.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b209-4\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint made many of those allegations. However, plaintiffs did not replead those allegations, and they stress that this is not a failure to warn case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
