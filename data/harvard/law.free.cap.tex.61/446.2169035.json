Tried below before D. E. Bassett, Esq., special judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-12\">The suit was begun December 15,1880, on two notes executed by appellee, W. H. Dixon, to R. W. Allison, August 23, 1875, both payable six months after date, one to Allison or bearer, the other to Allison alone. It was alleged in the original petition that Allison indorsed the notes in blank and delivered them to appellant; but that appellant only thereby became the legal owner of the notes, the beneficial ownership remaining in Allison, who, it was alleged, died September 1, 1878, and that no administration had been had on his estate; that his widow and heirs became the equitable own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ers of the notes at his death, and that the suit was brought for their benefit. It was alleged that the notes were given for the purchase money of land described in the petition for which Allison had made a deed to appellee, W. H. Dixon, the maker of the notes, and the purchaser of the land from Allison, no lien being reserved in the deed. The other appellees were purchasers from W. H. Dixon with notice, etc. A foreclosure of the vendor\u2019s lien was prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">\u00d3n February 28,1882, the appellees filed their original answer as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">1.

Plea that appellant was not the legal owner of the notes, and that the widow and heirs of Allison were not the equitable owners, because about the time the notes were made, Allison, for a valuable consideration to him,paid by one J. Y. Atkinson, sold, indorsed and delivered the notes to Atkinson, wkereby they became and were still the property of Atkinson, and if Allison ever had possession of the notes afterwards, he obtained it by fraud, deception or theft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-13\">7.

Com. App.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ASR1\">The only question to be determined in this case is whether the statute of limitations was suspended by the death of B. W. Allison. The notes were executed in August, 1875. They became due in February, 1876. They were transferred to the plaintiff Davis in July, 1876, and Allison died in September, 1878.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Our statute provides that \u201c In case of the death of any person in whose favor there may be a cause of action, the law of limitation shall cease to run against such cause of action until twelve months after such death, unless an administrator or executor shall have sooner qualified according to law upon such deceased person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u25a0estate; then and in that case the said law of limitation shall only cease to run until such qualification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The courts, both of England and America, in construing the statute of limitations of January 1st, have generally held that when a right of action accrued to a party after one\u2019s death, limitation would not commence to run until administration was taken out upon his estate. Indeed, they considered the words \u201ccause of action\u201d as implying that there was some person <em>in esse </em>capable of bringing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">But they uniformly held that if the party were living when the right of action accrued, his subsequent death would not stop the running of the statute. See Angell on Lim., ch. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In this state the terms of limitation in some cases are very short, and the ruling of the courts might in such cases work serious hardship. Hence the propriety of the statute, which provides that in -case of the death of the party the statute \u201cshall cease to run\u201d for a specified time.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">But the whole doctrine of suspending the running of the statute proceeds upon the hypothesis that there is no one <em>in esse </em>capable of bringing suit,\u2014 the courts having followed the maxim of the civil law, \u201c <em>Contra, non valentum qgere, non currit jpreserijjtio.\u201d </em>It will not apply to a case where there is some one <em>in esse </em>Avho can bring the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In this case a cause of action accrued to the plaintiff when the notes were transferred to him, and it Avas not taken from him by the death of Allison. AVithout discussing the subject, we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">[Opinion adopted April 29, 1884.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
