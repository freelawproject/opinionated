From the affidavit itself no one could tell what judgment it referred to, as it contains no description which would identify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The reasons for which certainty sufficient to properly identify the judgment sought to be revised is required in. appeal bonds apply also to appeals taken upon affidavit of poverty. As they are familiar and established by frequent decisions, it will not be necessary to repeat them, but it will suffice to refer to some of the cases in which they will be found.
