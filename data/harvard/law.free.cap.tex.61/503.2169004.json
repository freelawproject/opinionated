Contributory negligence \u2014 Damages.\u2014When one enters upon a railway track under circumstances which make it obviously an act of imminent danger on account of the rapid approach of an engine and tender, and receives hurt therefrom, he cannot, on account of his own negligence, recover damages ; and this though the injury was inflicted in an incorporated city by an engine running backward with tender in front, without ringing the bell or sounding the whistle, and at a rate of speed forbidden by the ordinances of the city.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b519-14\">Appeal from Tarrant. Tried below before J. F. Cooper, Esq., special judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-15\">This suit was brought by appellants, stating that on the 15th of November, 1882, they resided in Pennsylvania, and were the father and mother of Holland H. Hoover, who was of the age of twenty-two years. That on that day appellee, being engaged in running cars by means of steam locomotives in the city of Fort Worth, negligently ran an engine tender backwards and thereby killed the said Holland H.

Judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>At the request of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys the court stated in writing its conclusions of law and facts found at the trial, which were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-5\">\u201c <em>First. </em>. That the plaintiffs, W. C. Hoover and Louisa C. Hoover, are husband and wife and father and mother of one Holland H. Hoover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\"><em>\u201c Second. </em>That on the 15th day of November, 1882, the said Holland H. Hoover was of the age of twenty-two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-7\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>That on said day the defendants, who are duly incorporated under the laws of the state of Texas, were engaged in running and propelling cars over the railroad owned by them, and running through the city of Forth Worth, and through their depot grounds there, known as the T. <em>&amp; </em>P. yard</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-8\">\u201c <em>Fourth. </em>That on said day, and through their said yard, the defendant while running its engine and tender, ran the same over the said Holland H. Hoover and thereby inflicted great bodily injury upon him, from the effect of which he died in a few hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\">\u201c <em>Fifth. </em>That when the said engine and tender ran over the said Hoover, it was running backwards with the tender in front, at the rate of twelve to fifteen miles per hour. That running at said rate of speed was in violation of the ordinances of the city of Fort Worth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-10\">\u201c <em>Sixth. </em>That, at the time said engine and tender ran over said Hoover, the bell of the engine was neither ringing nor was the whistle sounding. That moving the engine without continuously ringing its bell or sounding its whistle was in violation of the ordinances of said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-11\">\u201c <em>Seventh. </em>That by reason of the manner in which, and the rate of speed at which, said engine and tender was, at the time of the accident, being run by the servants of the defendant, the defendant was guilty of gross negligence, and that said negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries then inflicted upon the said Hoover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-12\"><em>\u201cEighth. </em>That, at the time Hoover received said injuries, he was walking between the rails of the track of the defendant\u2019s road, but was not a trespasser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-13\">\u201c <em>Ninth. </em>That, at the time said Hoover entered upon said track (as appears by the depositions of W. E. Hamilton and B. M. King, plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses), the danger from said engine and tender was imminent; and that, in then getting upon the defendant\u2019s track, the said Hoover was guilty of ordinary negligence, and that said negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries received by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-14\">\u201c And the court concludes that the negligence of the said Holland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>H. Hoover and the defendant was concurrent, and that the negligence of said Hoover contributed to the injuries received by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-4\">\u201c Wherefore the court concludes, as a matter of law, that the plaintiffs ought not to have judgment in this suit against defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">\u201c J.

Pierce on Railroads, p. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-24\">The record shows that at the period when the deceased entered upon the appellee\u2019s track, the danger from the engine and tender was imminent, and that in so doing he was unquestionably guilty of negligence that was the proximate cause of the injuries received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>him.
