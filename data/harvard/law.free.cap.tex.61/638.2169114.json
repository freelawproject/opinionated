Tried below before the Hon. T. B. Wheeler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-14\">Appellees, Chas. G. Burnett and wife, recovered a judgment against appellant for $1,000, as damages for personal injuries alleged to have been received by the wife of Charles G. Burnett in a collision between two of appellant\u2019s trains at the town of Cisco, in Eastland county, on or about July 31, 1882, the said Charles and Sarah being then man and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-15\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error was that the court erred m overruling defendant\u2019s first special exception to plaintiff\u2019s amended petition, because it appeared from plaintiff\u2019s petition that the right of action, if any there was, was community property and vested in the husband, and the wife was an improper party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-16\">It appears from plaintiff\u2019s petition that before and at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the alleged injuries, the appellees were husband and wife, and so were at the date of the institution of the suit; that the alleged injuries were to the wife alone, and that the husband and wife joined in the suit to recover damages therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-6\">Defendant excepted to the misjoinder, the exception was overruled and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-7\"><em>Alexander &amp; Winter, </em>for plaintiff in error, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad0\">R.

The wife is, ordinarily, neither a proper nor a necessary party to such a suit. It follows, therefore, that the district court was in error, in this case, in refusing to sustain the special exception of the defendant below, which brought in question the right of the wife to join her husband.

Pl. &amp; Pr., sec. 278; Stachely <em>v. </em>Pierce, 28 Tex., 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">For this error the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for such further action as may be right and proper in the premises. Emmons <em>v. </em>Oldham, 12 Tex., 26; Johnson <em>v. </em>Davis, 7 Tex., 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">[Opinion delivered May 27, 1884.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
