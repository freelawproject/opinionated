See Act of February 1, 1850. See, also, 1st vol. Pasch. Dig. of Laws, pp. 248-253.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The record, too, discloses the fact that these very lands in suit had been surveyed by John Harvey, the proper officer, several years before the date of De Cordova\u2019s deed to Considerant.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The premium certificates that were afterwards issued were by authority of the legislature (Act 1st February, 1856) applied to the original field notes of Harvey\u2019s surveys.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">We are of opinion that the evidence showed in Considerant a superior legal title to the lands in suit to that exhibited by appellees, and that the appellants had the legal right to avail themselves of it to defeat a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">As the case was tried by the court below without a jury, this court now proceeding to render the judgment that the district court should have rendered, it is ordered that the appellees take nothing by this suit, and that the same be dissmised, and appellants go hence without day, with costs, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">[Opinion delivered May 27, 1884.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
