Continuance \u2014 Due diligence.\u2014 An application for a continuance, made in May, 1883, on account of the absence of a witness residing in the county, who was alleged to have been subpoenaed in May, 1882, no other fact in regard to due diligence being shown, was properly overruled. The witness may have refused at a former term to obey the subpoena.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b583-7\">2. Raised check \u2014 Fraud \u2014 Contract \u2014 Right of action. \u2014 B., desiring to remit, as a present, $500 to his son-in-law (Frank Crandall), went into a bank with C., who owed B., and who agreed to furnish him a draft for the amount. C. drew his check on the bank for \u00a7500, B. informing the cashier that he wanted exchange for Crandall for that amount on New York. The cashier thereupon drew his draft as follows:</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b583-9\">\u201c\u00a7500.

The figures $500 were by some unauthorized person afterwards changed to \u00a75,000, and it was paid in New York as a draft for that amount. The mistake was discovered by the bank on the 19th of October following. In a suit brought against the bank by B. to recover money deposited by him with the bank, and which it refused to pay or deliver, the bank set up the mistake and the subsequent fraudulent alteration, and payment of the check, and sought to make B. liable for \u00a71,500. <em>Held:</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-16\">(1) There was no contract between the bank and B. which created any liability from B. to the bank, nor did B. commit any unlawful act from which a liability could arise.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-17\">(2) B., having'no notice of the mistake and receiving no benefit from it, could not be made liable for any fraud the payee may have committed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-18\">3.

An unreasonable delay in doing this should be avoided, and, when such delay occurs, the failure of the judge to state his conclusions will be no cause for reversal.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-20\">Appeal from Tarrant. Tried below before the Hon. A. J. Hood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-21\">This was an action brought by the appellee, Stout, against the City \u00a1National Bank of' Fort Worth for the recovery of $1,428.29, which plaintiff alleged he deposited with defendant, and that defendant failed and refused to pay him that amount, although requested so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aiq\">The appellant, in its answer, substantially admitted that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>deposited the money and that it had never been repaid, but set up in avoidance of plaintiff\u2019s demand and pleaded in offset as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-4\">That on the 21st day of September, 1881, plaintiff went into defendant\u2019s banking house and requested defendant to sell him certain exchange on the city of New York to the amount of $500, and to make its draft or bill of exchange on some bank in New York for the $500, payable to one Frank Crandall, who was plaintiff\u2019s son-in-law; that the bank then, through its cashier, S. W. Lomax, drew its draft as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">\u201c$500.

T. Wooten, wfio paid defendant for the same; and that Wooten paid the same on an indebtedness which he, Wooten, owed plaintiff; that in total ignorance that the draft was for $5,000, plaintiff gave the draft to defendant and requested the bank to mail it to Crandall, which the bank did, and that plaintiff made a gift of the draft to Crandall through the bank; that if the draft was for the sum of $5,000 instead of for $500, then it was issued by defendant and mailed by defendant to Crandall, and plaintiff was then innocent that any mistake had occurred, and in law should not be chargeable with the negligence of defendant and to account for its carelessness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">On the 21st day of May, 1883, both parties announced ready for trial, and waived a jury, and plaintiff\u2019s petition was read, when court adjourned over until the 22d inst., without further action in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">On the reassembling of court on the 22d inst., and before the trial had progressed, defendant asked leave of the court to withdraw its announcement of ready for trial, and present an application for a continuance ; and the court having granted leave, defendant presented its application for a continuance, referred to in the opinion, which was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-7\">Judgment for plaintiff for $1,586.95.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-8\">One Wooten owed the appellee, who desired to remit as a present $500 to his son-in-law, Crandall. Wooten and appellee entered the bank, when Wooten, who had money deposited there, drew his check in favor of appellee for\"that amount. The cashier being informed by appellee that he wished to remit $500 to Crandall, drew a draft for that amount, a copy of which is in the syllabus. Appellee never examined the draft, and knew nothing of the mistake until after it was drawn. The draft was placed in a letter previously written by appellee\u2019s wife to Crandall, and the letter and draft handed to Lomax, the cashier, who, by request, directed the envelope in which he placed them to Crandall, and mailed it with the bank mail. Appellee had the amount of money in the bank sued for, when it refused to pay him. Lomax, the cashier, testified that a mistake was made in drawing the check as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Ball &amp; </em>McGart, for appellants, on the application for continuance, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJOP\">R.

The parties having announced ready for trial on the preceding day, the pleadings for the plaintiff having been read on that day, on the morning of 22d, leave was given to the defendant to withdraw its announcement for trial, whereupon it made an application for continuance, based on the absence of a witness stated to be a resident of the county and subpoenaed on May 5, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The bill of exceptions does not show whether the application for a continuance was the first, second or third; but it ivas in substance such an application as the statute requires for a first continuance, except that it did not state that due diligence had been used to procure the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The application was defective if considered a first application; and, if it was a second or third application, had but few of the statements required, and the court did not err in overruling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">\u2022 A bill of exceptions should show whether an application for a continuance was a first or subsequent application (Arnold v. Hockney, 51 Tex., 46); and when a witness has been subpoenaed so long before the appheation is made, it should clearly appear that due diligence had been used. This is not sufficiently shown in this case, for the witness may have disobeyed the subpoena at former terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">The appellee could become responsible to the appellant only by reason of a contract or tort. There was no contract between them from which any liability whatever could arise; nor does the evidence show that the appellee was guilty of any wrongful act which would create a liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">The mistake in the amount for which the draft was drawn was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>made by the cashier of the bank, and it does not appear that the appellee had any notice whatever of the mistake when he handed back the draft to the cashier with request that he would inclose it in an envelope, direct it to Crandall, and deposit it in the postoffice with the bank\u2019s mail. The appellee received no benefit from the mistake, and however fraudulent may have been the conduct of Crandall in receiving $5,000 on the draft, which he most probably knew was intended to enable him to receive five hundred only, yet the mere fact that he was tlie son-in-law of Stout, to whom Stout intended to make a present of $500, could not render Stout liable to the appellant for an injury which resulted from its own want of due care and the fraud of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">If it were shown that Stout knew of the mistake before he caused the draft to be mailed to Crandall a different question would arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">It is not to be presumed that a judge who tries a cause will refuse to give a statement of his conclusions of fact and law when requested to do so, and that a judge has so refused must be made to appear in some way before the matter could be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">\u2022 In this case it appears that a motion was filed and entered on the motion docket requesting such a statement, but it does not appear that this was ever called to the attention of the court; in fact, the motion seems to have been filed nearly a month after the trial of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Such applications should be made promptly, while the matter is fresh in the mind of the court, and, if made after an unreasonable delay, even a refusal to make the statement ought not to be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">As presented, this question cannot be revised; but we cannot see that the appellant has been in any way prejudiced by the want of such statement. There is a full statement of facts, and the case is not such a one as required such a statement for the proper presentation or understanding of it in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">\u25a0 There is no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">[Opinion delivered May 13, 1884.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
