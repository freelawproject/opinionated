On the occasion in issue, the exact date of which was not determined, the defendant was in the home where Deborah resided with her parents. Deborah testified that on that occasion the defendant followed her upstairs and hid in a bedroom. She further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cQ. What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">A. Well, I went up to the bathroom and he followed me up there. And he hid in the bedroom\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Q. He did what, Deborah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">A. He hid in his bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">Q. And what happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\"><em>THE COURT: </em>Are you the girl\u2019s mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\"><em>MRS. RUSH: </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">Q. Deborah, can you tell us what happened then?' Your mother\u2019s here and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-13\">A. He messed with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-14\"><em>MRS. RUSH: </em>Speak up, Deborah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-15\">A. He messed with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">Q. By messing with you, Deborah, can you tell Judge what he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-17\">A. He felt my privates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-18\">Q. Did he have you do anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-20\">Q. What did he have you do ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-21\">A. He had me feel him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-22\">Q. His privates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-24\">* # \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-25\">Q. Deborah, did he do this \u2014 strike that. Did you have any clothes on, Deborah, when he felt your private parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-27\">* # * $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-28\">Q. Deborah, did he put his hands under your clothes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-29\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-30\">The mother of the prosecuting witness testified that she and her husband had a conversation with the defendant concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the incident related, and that he started crying and said to her husband'that he did not try to put it in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The father of the prosecuting witness testified that she had told him that the defendant had molested her, and that Defendant admitted it to him and said that he did not put it in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Upon the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, Defendant has raised several questions that will here be treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Defendant complains that one of the allegations of the affidavit upon which he was tried was that the offense took place on or about July 15,. 1968, and that there was no evidence of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In instances when time of the offense is not of the essence, the offense may be proved as having occurred at any date within the statute of limitations preceding the filing of the affidavit or indictment. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>State </em>(1965), 247 Ind. 7, 210 N. E. 2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Although the precise date of the offense was not determined, it is clear that it occurred in mid-summer 1968. Time in no way being of the essence of the offense, there being no claim or indication that the defendant was in anyway mislead or prejudiced by the date charged in the affidavit and it clearly appearing that the offense took place in the period of the statute of limitations, Defendant\u2019s position on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">Defendant next contends that he was convicted upon the uncorroborated testimony of Deborah, an eleven year old girl and that this cannot be permitted. Neither the evidence nor the law bear him out. He overlooks the testimony of Deborah\u2019s parents to the effect that he admitted the offense to them. Even if we were to disregard the parents\u2019 testimony, it has long been the law in Indiana that a conviction for rape, incest or assault with intent to rape may be had on the uncorroborated testimony of the prosecuting witness provided such testimony was sufficient to convince the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>trier of the facts of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>State </em>(1970), 254 Ind. 150, 258 N. E. 2d 407; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 250 Ind. 132, 235 N. E. 2d 479; <em>Kuslulis </em>v. <em>State </em>(1930), 201 Ind. 660, 171 N. E. 5. And there is no reason why such a rule should not be extended to a case such as this where the defendant is charged with assault and battery with intent to gratify sexual desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Defendant\u2019s claim that there is no evidence that the defendant \u201cfondled\u201d and \u201ccaressed\u201d Deborah is contrary to her testimony hereinbefore set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendant asserts that the time lapse of approximately three to four months between the date of the offense and the date it was reported by Deborah is significant under the case of <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 252 Ind. 1, 238 N. E. 2d 281. In that case, however, the prosecuting witness was at the time of his testimony and for three and one-half years prior to it, a formally committed inmate of a mental institution. He was hostile towards the defendant and had contradicted his story. The fact that three and one-half months elapsed between the alleged offense and his report of it was a factor in the court\u2019s determination that the evidence was not substantial and probative, but it was in no way controlling. True, there was a time lapse there and in the case under review, but there the similarity ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Defendant next argues that there was no evidence that the touching of Deborah was done with intent to gratify sexual desires. Deborah\u2019s testimony was: \u201cHe messed with me. * * * He felt my privates. * * * He had me feel him.\u201d Question: \u201cHis privates?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes.\u201d With credit to Mr. Justice Frankfurter writing in <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1948), 338 U. S. 49, 93 L. Ed. 1801, 1805, \u201c* * * And there comes a point where this Court should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case on March 20th, Defendant moved for a discharge upon grounds addressed to the sufficiency of the evidence. The trial court indicated grave concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>in view of the seriousness of the offense and the tender years of the prosecuting witness. He took the matter under advisement and asked for briefs upon the question of whether or not he could, upon his own motion, submit Deborah to a psychological examination. The record does not indicate that briefs were filed, but on March 25th Defendant filed a written motion to require Deborah to submit to a \u201cpsychiatric examination to determine her credibility and competency as a witness\u201d. A written memorandum accompanying the motion was, in effect, a brief upon the question and supported by authorities. The State consented to such motion. The record at this point shows: \u201cPetition granted in part and denied in part. Court orders psychological test given the witness Deborah Rush by Dr. Edwin Strain.\u201d Pursuant to such order Deborah submitted to Dr. Strain for psychological testing on April 7th, and on April 10th his written report was filed with the court. The trial was resumed on April 14th, and thereupon the court presented the psychologists\u2019s report and asked counsel for the defendant if he had seen it; and he replied that he had had an opportunity to read it. No objections were made by counsel for Defendant to the consideration of the report, and the court thereupon proceeded to announce that from the test given it concluded that the witness was competent and that the motion for discharge was accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">By his brief Defendant complains that the examination of Deborah being by a psychologist rather than by a psychiatrist in accordance with his motion was, in effect, done on the court\u2019s own motion, and that under the authority of <em>Maddix </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 250 Ind. 261, 235 N. E. 2d 475, Defendant was entitled to be discharged, contending that the only logical inference to be drawn from the ordering of the examination, after the witness had testified, was that the court had some doubt as to her competency, that therefore a reasonable doubt of Defendant\u2019s guilt existed and that it was improper and prejudicial for the court to consider the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In the <em>Maddix </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the court, after a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>guilty, offered a polygraph test to be considered with regard to sentencing. The test results indicated that the defendant had lied. This Court, in reversing the judgment of the trial court, held that it was reversible error to consider such a test subsequent to a finding of guilty, because it was not properly in the record; that if a reasonable doubt existed at the conclusion of the trial, the court could only make a finding of not guilty, and that a subsequent polygraph test is superfluous and irrelevant. The court could neither withdraw a finding of guilty, on the basis of evidence not in the record, nor suspend a sentence because of a belief in innocence. The case at bar is not analogous to the <em>Maddix </em>case, <em>supra. </em>Here, there had been no finding at the time the testing was done and the report considered. Although there may be questions concerning the propriety of the psychological examination at that stage of the proceedings and a consideration of the report as evidence in the cause, the defendant made no objection to the test being given or to the results being received, nor was there any motion to strike, although there was ample opportunity for these protests. It is a well settled principle that this Court will not reverse by reason of the admission of evidence to which there was no objection. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 251 Ind. 313, 241 N. E. 2d 148; <em>Hanrahan </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 251 Ind. 325, 241 N. E. 2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Finding no error the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-6\">Arterburn, C.J., Givan, DeBruler and Hunter, JJ., concur.
