Hennings, with the crime of first degree murder. Following a trial by jury, a verdict of guilty as charged was returned on April 24, 1968, and the defendant was thereafter sentenced to the Indiana State Prison for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The evidence most favorable to the State shows that on January 21,1967, the defendant and his brother-in-law, Floyd Jackson, Jr., spent most of the day together, commencing at approximately 1:00 a.m. and terminating after a fight in which the defendant stabbed Floyd Jackson, Jr., ten times, and that Floyd Jackson, Jr., died as a result of multiple stab wounds. There is evidence that both the defendant and the decedent had consumed alcoholic beverages beginning at approximately 2:00 a.m. and continuing until after 2:00 p.m., and that they had slept at the Hennings\u2019 home between 4:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">The defendant and Floyd Jackson had an argument at a filling station at approximately 3:00 p.m. Another argument between the two men took place at the defendant\u2019s home, after which both men left. Soon thereafter, however, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>met Jackson in a road near defendant\u2019s house and still another argument occurred, resulting in a fight observed by defendant\u2019s step-daughter and by several other juveniles. The parties struck each other and then defendant kicked and stabbed Jackson. Several witnesses testified regarding a camera in Jackson\u2019s hand; no witness saw a gun. After the stabbing, defendant placed his brother-in-law in his automobile and drove him to Elkhart General Hospital where he soon died.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Only one issue requires consideration on this appeal. Captain Melvin Troyer of the Elkhart County Police Department was called as a witness by the State in its case in chief and in the course of his testimony, the following questions and responses resulted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201cQ. Other than the conversations with the knives, Captain, did you have occasion to talk to Mr. Hennings again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Q. And when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">A. On the first Friday of his arraignment. I think on the 27th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">Q. The 27th of what month, Captain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">A. Of January \u2014 the first time I brought him over to court on his arraignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">Q. You say you think it was January 27 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">Q. And is that 1967?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">Q. And how did you bring him over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">A. I brought him over with other prisoners also from the County Jail to the Court, in my car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">Q. What happened at that time, if anything ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">A. Well, we were talking in the car, and which we always do when we come back and forth, and he made the remark that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-20\">MR. McLAUGHLIN: May I ask a preliminary question before any remarks get in. He was in custody at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-21\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>MR. McLAUGHLIN: And was this a spontaneous volunteered remark, or in answer to a question of yourself ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">A. No question of mine. In fact he was talking to other prisoners in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">MR. McLAUGHLIN: This was a conversation you overheard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">Q. He was talking to other prisoners in the automobile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">Q. What, if anything, did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">A. Well, he said that they are trying to hang me with first degree murder; that he killed somebody in Chicago, and he didn\u2019t get anything out of it, and now they are trying to hang me with first degree murder on this one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">MR. McLAUGHLIN: The defendant moves that the remarks of the defendant be stricken, as highly prejudicial, and not in any way connected with this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">The court overruled this motion of the defendant. Proof by the State of crimes other than the one for which defendant is being tried is not admissible except in certain cases not pertinent here. 1 Ewbanks Indiana Criminal Law, Symmes Ed. \u00a7384, p. 236. In <em>Woods </em>v. <em>State </em>(1968), 250 Ind. 132, 143, 235 N. E. 2d 479, 486, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">\u201cThe general rule in Indiana is that evidence of separate, independent and distinct crimes is inadmissible to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged except to show intent, motive, purpose, identification, or a common scheme or plan. <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>State </em>(1969), 249 Ind. 659, 234 N. E. 2d 629, opinion filed March 1, 1968, cause number 30910; <em>Watts v. State </em>(1950), 229 Ind. 80, 95 N. E. 2d 570.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">We note that the testimony objected to was offered during the State\u2019s case in chief and further that the State thereafter never offered any evidence that the defendant did in fact kill anyone in Chicago. This testimony had no relevancy whatever to the case being tried. Although the State contends that the testimony was admissible to establish the credibility of the defend\u00e1nt, the defendant had not yet taken the witness stand. It is very possible that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ant may have felt compelled to take the stand solely to meet this testimony, and for that reason we cannot hold it to be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The judgment of the trial court is therefore reversed and a new trial is granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-6\">Givan, Prentice, DeBruler and Hunter, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 267 N.
