Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958 (4th Cir.1996). We have thoroughly reviewed the briefs and joint appendix and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court. <em>Cobb v. Potter, </em>Nos. 1:04-cv-00128; 1:05-cv-00300, 2006 WL 2457812 (W.D.N.C. filed Aug. 22, 2006; entered Aug. 23, 2006).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decision making process.</p>\n<p id=\"AMe\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">We note that, in addressing Cobb\u2019s hostile work environment claim, the district court erroneously relied on <em>Jennings v. Univ. of North Carolina, at Chapel Hill, </em>444 F.3d 255, 269 (4th Cir.2006), when the opinion in that case had been vacated by a grant of rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 35(c)(granting of rehearing en banc vacates previous panel judgment and opinion). This error does not change the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision, however, because the district court cited <em>Jennings </em>for legal principles that were set forth in <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
