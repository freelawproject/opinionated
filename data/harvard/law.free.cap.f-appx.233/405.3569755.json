Hernandez argues that this court\u2019s practice of affording a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range violates <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He properly concedes that this argument is foreclosed, but he raises the issue to preserve it for further review. He further argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because the district court failed to explicitly address the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in light of the mitigating evidence he presented. Hernandez also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 offense charged in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The record reflects that the district court implicitly considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) when it determined that a 37-month term of imprisonment was a fair and reasonable sentence in Hernandez\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Hernandez has not shown that this sentence was unreasonable or that this court should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">Hernandez\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
