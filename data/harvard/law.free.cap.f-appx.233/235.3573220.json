(MAWV) brought a declaratory judgment action in federal court against the United States, the subrogee of MAWVs insured, Dr. Prakob Srichai, to establish that it has no obligation to pay a medical malpractice claim against the doctor. The case went to trial, and MAWV contended that Dr. Srichai had breached the terms of his insurance policy by failing to notify MAWV of the claim \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of the United States and against MAWV. The district court denied MAWVs motion for judgment as a matter of law and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the United States as Dr. Srichai\u2019s subrogee. We conclude that because MAWV received no notice of the claim until four years after Dr. Srichai first became aware of it, and Dr. Srichai offered no reasonable explanation for the delay, the jury had no basis for excusing Dr. Srichai\u2019s breach of the policy\u2019s notification provision. MAWV was thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The underlying medical malpractice claim arose from an automobile accident caused by Terry Hoosier, one of Dr. Srichai\u2019s patients. At the time, Dr. Srichai was employed by the Community Health Foundation of Man (CHF), a federally funded clinic covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233. The representative of the accident victims, Gorman Osbourne, sued Hoosier in West Virginia state court. Osbourne also initiated an administrative proceeding with the United States Department of Health and Human Services against Dr. Srichai and CHF in March 1999. Osbourne alleged that the accident occurred while Hoosier was under the influence of drugs negligently prescribed by Dr. Srichai. After Osbourne exhausted the administrative process, he was permitted to add Dr. Srichai and CHF as defendants in the suit against Hoosier. Because Dr. Srichai and CHF qualified as federal employees, the United States intervened in the suit, removed the case to federal court, and had itself substituted for Dr. Srichai as a defendant in accordance with the FTCA. In October 2002 the parties settled the case with an agreement by the United States to pay the plaintiffs $3.9 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The United States subsequently discovered that Dr. Srichai held a $1 million private insurance policy with MAWV that covered the malpractice incident. In June 2003 the United States sent a letter to MAWV \u201cmaking a subrogation demand in the amount of $916,667\u201d under the policy. MAWV refused to pay, claiming that Dr. Srichai had breached the policy by failing to comply with the requirement that the insured notify the company of covered claims \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d Prior to the United States\u2019s letter, MAWV had no notice of the malpractice claim against Dr. Srichai.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The United States argues that the delay does not bar coverage because the United States mistakenly believed that the policy had expired and Dr. Srichai may have been under the impression that the policy covered only surgical treatment. MAWV argues that these explanations are insufficient as a matter of law. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>ABT Bldg. Prods. Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>472 F.3d 99, 113 (4th Cir.2006). We must assess whether the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, is sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Under West Virginia law a violation of an insurance policy\u2019s notice provision does not always bar a claim against the insurer. If the insured offers a reasonable explanation for the delay, \u201cthe burden shifts to the insurance company to show that the delay in notification prejudiced [its] investigation and defense of the claim.\u201d <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Voshel, </em>189 W.Va. 121, 428 S.E.2d 542, 546 (1993). The reasonableness of a delay is generally a question of fact. <em>Colonial Ins. Co. v. Barrett, </em>208 W.Va. 706, 542 S.E.2d 869, 875 (2000). However, when the insured offers no explanation, the delay is considered unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>See Ragland v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>146 W.Va. 403, 120 S.E.2d 482, 490-91 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Dr. Srichai\u2019s insurance policy requires him to notify MAWV of any claim or potential claim \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d to guarantee coverage. Dr. Srichai first had notice of a potential malpractice claim when Osbourne commenced administrative proceedings against him in 1999. However, MAWV did not receive notice of the claim until the United States demanded payment under the policy (as Dr. Srichai\u2019s subrogee) four years after the proceedings against Dr. Srichai began. Under the policy Dr. Srichai had a duty to report the claim to MAWV throughout this period. Thus, we consider only whether a reasonable explanation has been offered for his failure to notify MAWV as soon as he became aware of the malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The United States attempts to explain Dr. Srichai\u2019s failure to notify MAWV by asserting that he mistakenly believed the policy covered only his surgical practice. Although the policy plainly covers all \u201cmedical incidents,\u201d the United States points to two letters to claim that Dr. Srichai was under the mistaken impression that the policy did not cover the claim. The first letter, from CHF\u2019s insurance agent to MAWV, seeks to add CHF to Dr. Srichai\u2019s policy as an additional insured \u201cbecause he is a general surgeon and his specialty does not meet the federal guidelines\u201d for FTCA coverage. This may suggest some confusion on the part of CHF, but it does not show that Dr. Srichai thought the policy was limited to his surgical practice. The second letter, from CHF to the federal officials handling the administrative claim, states that the policy \u201cwas purchased to insure the surgical practice of [Dr. Srichai].\u201d Again, however, Dr. Srichai neither drafted the letter nor is there any indication that he received a copy. Thus, neither letter shows that Dr. Srichai had been mistaken or deceived as to the scope of the policy, and a jury could not reasonably conclude that he had a valid reason for his failure to notify MAWV. An unexplained, four-year delay in notice is unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>See Ragland, </em>120 S.E.2d at 490-91 (unexplained delay of more than five months unreasonable as a matter of law). The district court thus erred in denying MAWV\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Similarly, because MAWV did not erroneously disclaim liability under the policy, the United States is not entitled to the award of attorney\u2019s fees granted by the district court. <em>See Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas., </em>177 W.Va. 323, 352 S.E.2d 73, 80 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The judgment entered in favor of the United States and the order awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the United States are</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
