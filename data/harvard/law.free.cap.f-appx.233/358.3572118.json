FloresPizana first challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), which was based on his conviction of assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 326 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">In light of <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 880-82 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1351, 167 L.Ed.2d 144 (2007), which was issued after sentencing in this case, the imposition of the enhancement was erroneous. Further, because the government has not shown or even argued that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed, the error was not harmless. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266, 273 (5th Cir.2007); see <em>also United States v. Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 765 (5th Cir.2005). We reject the government\u2019s argument that we should follow <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>325 F.3d 553, 558-61 (5th Cir.2003), rather than <em>Villegas-Hernandez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">Flores-Pizana also contends that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Flores-Pizana contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Flores-Pizana properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the conviction, VACATE the sentence, and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
