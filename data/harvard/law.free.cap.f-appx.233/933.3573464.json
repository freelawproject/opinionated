We consider his two contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Louis first contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to compel the government to disclose the identity of a confidential informant who helped make arrangements for Louis to sell drugs to an undercover law enforcement agent. If the confidential informant had been able to testify, Louis asserts, he would have substantiated Louis\u2019 entrapment defense. We review the denial of the motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>931 F.2d 1482, 1490 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">In determining whether the government must disclose a confidential informant\u2019s identity, a district court must balance \u201cthe public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>606 F.2d 70, 74 (5th Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have identified three factors that guide that inquiry: (1) \u201cthe extent of the informant\u2019s participation in the criminal activity\u201d; (2) \u201cthe directness of the relationship between the defendant\u2019s asserted defense and the probable testimony of the informant\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in non-disclosure.\u201d <em>Gutierrez, </em>931 F.2d at 1490 (quoting <em>United States v. Tenorio-Angel, </em>756 F.2d 1505, 1511 (11th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">After Louis alleged that the government induced him to sell the drugs, the district court conducted an in camera, ex parte interview of the informant to see if he would corroborate Louis\u2019 story. That interview led the district court to conclude that two of the three factors favored nondisclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. Although the district court found that the informant\u2019s participation in Louis\u2019 drug sales was \u201cnot insubstantial,\u201d it concluded that his testimony \u201cwould not support [Louis\u2019] claim of entrapment in any of the specifics alleged in the motion, or in any other fashion\u201d and furthermore that the government \u201cha[d] a legitimate interest in the nondisclosure of the informant\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">Louis bears the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing on appeal that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Costa, </em>947 F.2d 919, 923 (11th Cir.1991). No transcript was made of the district court\u2019s interview of the informant, and without any transcript, \u201cwe are limited in reviewing this issue to the representations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>made in the briefs and the district court\u2019s statements.... \u201d <em>Gutierrez, </em>931 F.2d at 1491. There is nothing in the record that undermines the district court\u2019s conclusions after the in camera interview with respect to the three disclosure factors. Accordingly, we have no basis to disturb Louis\u2019 conviction on the ground that the district court abused its discretion by deciding not to compel the disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Second, Louis contends that the district court violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause by admitting into evidence a tape recording (and its corresponding transcript) that included certain statements by the confidential informant, whom Louis was unable to cross-examine. In particular, Louis\u2019 contention centers on a conversation in which the two men briefly discussed Louis\u2019 payment to the informant of a fifty-dollar commission that Louis earned in the sale and had agreed to pay over to the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">This contention fails because the informant\u2019s statements on this topic were offered merely to give context to Louis\u2019 own statements during the conversation (the admission of which is not contested here) and not for their truth. Accordingly, the informant\u2019s statements do not fall within the ambit of the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1369 n. 9, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (noting that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-12\">.

City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
