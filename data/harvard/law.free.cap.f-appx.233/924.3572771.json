For the reasons set forth more fully below, we vacate Henderson\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">In February 2006, Henderson\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court to issue a summons for Henderson on the grounds that Henderson had committed the following three violations of the mandatory conditions of his supervised release: (1) Henderson was charged with the offense of possession of cocaine; (2) Henderson was charged with the offense of resisting arrest; and (3) Henderson illegally possessed a controlled substance. In May 2006, the probation officer filed an amended petition for issuance of a summons, adding that Henderson had committed another violation of the mandatory conditions of his supervised release, namely, that he had sustained an additional charge for the offense of possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">At his revocation hearing, Henderson denied guilt as to each of the four violations that the probation officer had alleged. After both parties had presented evidence, the district court determined that Henderson was guilty of the three counts as charged in the probation officer\u2019s February 2006 petition, but that Henderson was not guilty of the fourth charge, as presented in the May 2006 amended petition. The court concluded that Henderson had committed Grade B violations of his supervised release and that his criminal history category was II, as it was calculated in his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that was prepared for his underlying offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then revoked Henderson\u2019s super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>vised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(g) based upon its determination that Henderson had committed the offense of possession of a controlled substance. As to the term of imprisonment that Henderson should serve upon the revocation of his supervised release, his counsel requested one of the following sentences: either (1) a term of home arrest; (2) a term of custody at a halfway house; or (3) a term of imprisonment of one year and one day. Henderson\u2019s counsel argued that, with the exception of a few late filings of his monthly reports, Henderson had not violated the terms of his supervised release until the instant offenses. His counsel further claimed that Henderson had opened a business and did not have a drug problem. His counsel maintained that a sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment was \u201csimply greater than necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">After revoking Henderson\u2019s supervised release, the court imposed a 24-month term of imprisonment. The court then stated that it had \u201ctaken into consideration the policy statements in chapter seven of the guidelines manual, the guideline range, and all relevant information in imposing a sentence of 24 months.\u201d The court made no further comment regarding Henderson\u2019s sentence. The court then clarified an issue with regard to Henderson\u2019s bond amount and ordered the court in recess, but failed to inquire whether the parties had any further objections with regard to Henderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">A. <em>Jones </em>violation</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">According to <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993), a district court, after imposing a sentence, must give an additional opportunity to parties to object to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the manner in which the sentence is pronounced. <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1102. We have clarified that the <em>Jones </em>rule applies to supervised release revocation proceedings. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cUnder this rule, when a district court fails to elicit objections after imposing a sentence, we normally vacate the sentence and remand to the district court to give the parties an opportunity to present their objections. A remand is unnecessary, however, when the record on appeal is sufficient to enable review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Henderson does not argue on appeal that the district court failed to elicit objections as required by <em>Jones, </em>nor does the government raise the issue. The government does argue, however, that Henderson failed to object and raise his arguments before the district court, and, thus, this Court should employ plain error review. Given the government\u2019s assertion that Henderson did not preserve his arguments, we must first determine whether the district court properly allowed Henderson the opportunity to present his objections to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">At Henderson\u2019s revocation hearing, the district court imposed Henderson\u2019s 24-month imprisonment term, questioned the parties with regard to Henderson\u2019s applicable bond amount, and then indicated that the court was in recess until further order. At no time did the court elicit any objections to the sentence as imposed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Henderson did not raise the sentencing issues that he now raises on appeal. Therefore, the district court violated <em>Jones </em>by failing to elicit objections from Henderson after imposing his sentence for the revocation of his supervised release. The question of whether the record on appeal is sufficient to enable review of either of the two issues presented in Henderson\u2019s brief, thereby making remand because of the technical <em>Jones </em>violation unnecessary, is discussed more fully below.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">B. Consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Henderson argues that the district court violated \u00a7 3553(a) by failing to consider its various factors in imposing his 24-month sentence. Henderson contends that he made arguments at the revocation hearing regarding many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but that the court erroneously failed to discuss or respond to those arguments. He also argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to meet the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In so arguing, Henderson appears to concede that his sentence was within the applicable guideline range, but he does not make this entirely clear nor does he indicate his actual guideline range. He nonetheless argues that the only factor that the court considered was his guideline range and that the court\u2019s singularly focused analysis was erroneous. He further maintains that, in light of his history and the circumstances of his violation, his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">We review the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). The government argues here that plain error review should apply because Henderson failed to object to his sentence before the district court. However, as explained above, the district court violated <em>Jones </em>by failing to elicit objections after it imposed Henderson\u2019s sentence. Therefore, we review Henderson\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, as if his arguments were preserved below. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1348 (concluding that an appellant had not waived his sentencing argument where the district court failed to comply with the <em>Jones </em>rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), the revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release is mandatory if the defendant unlawfully possessed a controlled substance while serving his term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1). Here, the court found that Henderson had possessed a controlled substance, and, thus, revoked his supervised release explicitly pursuant to \u00a7 3583(g). If a district court finds that the defendant unlawfully possessed a controlled substance, the court must revoke his term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment \u201cnot to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under\u201d \u00a7 3583(e)(3). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). According to subsection (e)(3), \u201cif the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony,\u201d the court cannot sentence the defendant to serve more than five years\u2019 imprisonment upon the revocation of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In Henderson\u2019s case, his underlying offense of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), was a class A felony because it carried a maximum imprisonment term of life. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(1). Therefore, the maximum term of imprisonment for Henderson\u2019s revocation of his supervised release was five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">With regard to Henderson\u2019s applicable guideline range upon the revocation of his supervised release, the policy statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines indicate that a defendant with a Grade B violation of his supervised release, and an underlying criminal history category of II, has a resulting guideline range of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). As explained above, the district court found, and Henderson did not dispute, that he had committed Grade B violations of his supervised release and that he had an underlying criminal history category of II.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in sentencing Henderson, the district court did not explicitly state Henderson\u2019s guideline range, nor did the parties indicate the applicable range. Even though review of \u00a7 7B1.4(a) appears to indicate that Henderson\u2019s guideline range was 6 to 12 months, Henderson seemingly concedes on appeal that his ultimate sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment was within his guideline range. Thus, to the extent that the district court erred in calculating Henderson\u2019s guideline range, he has abandoned that issue on appeal. <em>See Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">At the revocation hearing, the court gave only a very brief discussion of its decision-making process regarding imposition of the 24-month sentence, and failed to elicit objections after it imposed the sentence, as required in <em>Jones. </em>Therefore, the record is insufficient to enable review of Henderson\u2019s arguments regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As such, we vacate Henderson\u2019s sentence, under <em>Jones, </em>and remand to the district court for the court to elicit objections and to address Henderson\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">C. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Henderson also argues that the district court\u2019s broad and vague statement regarding its imposition of the 24-month sentence was insufficient to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(1). He maintains that it is impossible to discern what reasons the court had for imposing the sentence and that the court\u2019s failure to respond to his counsel\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence further complicated the analysis of why the court imposed the sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Henderson further argues that the court\u2019s broad statement did not provide any means for this Court to conduct a meaningful appellate review of the court\u2019s sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(1). <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(c)(1), the sentencing court shall state the reason for imposing a particular sentence within the guideline range, if the sentence \u201cis of the kind, and within the [recommended guideline] range ... and that range exceeds 24 months....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Here, the district court found that Henderson had committed a Grade B violation of his supervised release and that his underlying criminal history category was II. The court thus revoked his sentence pursuant to the mandatory revocation provision of \u00a7 3583(g). Thereafter, the court imposed a 24-month term of imprisonment and stated it had \u201ctaken into consideration the policy statements in chapter seven of the guidelines manual, the guideline range, and all relevant information in imposing a sentence of 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>months.\u201d The problem in this case arises due to the court\u2019s failure to explicitly specify Henderson\u2019s exact guideline range and whether the 24-month sentence was within or outside of that range. Based upon an independent review of the chapter seven policy statements, it is clear that, if a defendant committed a Grade B violation of his supervised release and had an underlying criminal history category of II, then his resulting guideline range would be 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). As such, it appears that Henderson\u2019s 24-month sentence exceeded his guideline range. The consequence of such a sentence is that, rather than having to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(1), which specifically relates to sentences within the guideline range, the court would have been required to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (requiring that, if a sentence is outside of the guideline range, the sentencing court must state \u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence [outside of the guideline range], which reasons must also be stated with specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">If, in fact, Henderson was sentenced outside of his guideline range, then \u00a7 3553(c)(1) would not have applied to his sentence, and, therefore, his arguments on appeal, which rely exclusively on \u00a7 3553(c)(1), would be misplaced. However, given that (1) the court never indicated what Henderson\u2019s guideline range was; (2) Henderson seemingly proceeds on appeal as if he was sentenced within his guideline range; (3) the government fails to indicate what it believed the guideline range to be or whether Henderson\u2019s sentence fell within that range; and (4) the top-end of the guideline range applicable to Henderson\u2019s circumstances of having a Grade B violation and a criminal history category of II is 12 months below his actual sentence, we cannot determine which subsection, either \u00a7 3553(c)(1) or (c)(2), applies here. Because the district court failed to elicit objections to the sentence after it was imposed, in violation of <em>Jones, </em>the parties had no opportunity to inform the court of the potential error and allow the court to clarify the guideline range upon which it relied. It is essential that this Court know the applicable guideline range because it is the range that determines whether \u00a7 3553(c)(1) applies to Henderson\u2019s case, as he argues on appeal. Accordingly, we vacate and remand based upon the <em>Jones </em>violation, to afford the district court the opportunity to clarify the applicable guideline range and to allow the parties on remand to raise their objections to the sentence as imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">In light of the foregoing, Henderson\u2019s 24-month sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-10\">. Henderson pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 5 years\u2019 of supervised release. As conditions of his supervised release, Henderson was prohibited from committing another federal, state, or local crime, and from illegally possessing a controlled substance. Henderson had been released from custody and was serving his term of supervised release when the facts underlying the instant appeal arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">. Pursuant to the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, \"conduct constituting any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year\u201d is a Grade B violation of supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(2). As calculated in Henderson\u2019s PSI, which was prepared for his sentencing on his underlying offense, Henderson\u2019s criminal history category was II. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a) (indicating that the applicable criminal history category used in calculating a defendant\u2019s guideline range after revocation of supervised release \"is the category applicable at the time the defendant originally was sentenced to a term of supervision\u201d). Henderson does not contest the court\u2019s finding that his violations constitute Grade B violations of his supervision or that his prior criminal history category was II. According to the 2005 Sentencing Guidelines manual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Grade B violations and a criminal history category of II would have resulted in a guideline range for Henderson\u2019s term of imprisonment after revocation of his supervised release of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a). However, as discussed below, the district court never explicitly indicated Henderson\u2019s applicable guideline range, nor do the parties provide it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b948-5\">. At his revocation hearing, Henderson denied the probation officer\u2019s charge that he violated the conditions of his supervised release by possessing cocaine. Henderson does not raise the argument on appeal that the district court erred by finding that he violated the conditions of his supervised release. Therefore, he has abandoned it. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the defendant abandoned an issue on appeal by failing to offer any argument on the issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
