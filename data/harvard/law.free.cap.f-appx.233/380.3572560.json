Although his advisory guidelines imprisonment range was 77 to 96 months, the district court sentenced Dibbles to the statutory maximum sentence of 120 months of imprisonment. The court found that Dibbles\u2019s criminal record warranted an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. The court further found that a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) was justified because of the nature and circumstances of Dibbles\u2019s conduct and the history and characteristics of his past. The sentence was thus based on both an upward departure from the guidelines range and a non-guidelines sentence, or \u201cvariance\u201d from the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 721 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>75 U.S.L.W. 3585 (U.S. Apr. 18, 2007) (No. 06-1381); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706-07 (5th Cir.2006). A non-guidelines sentence is ultimately reviewed for unreasonableness.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 706. An upward departure is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">\u201cBoth a district court\u2019s post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing discretion and the reasonableness inquiry on appeal must be guided by the sentencing considerations set forth in [] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706. These factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2). A district court must also consider these factors when imposing a sentence that represents an upward departure from the advisory guidelines range. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">Dibbles argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>failed to consider his mitigating circumstances in imposing the sentence. He argues that consideration of his mitigating circumstances was mandated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that the court abused its discretion by failing to account for them in either its oral or written reasons for imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A district court must more thoroughly articulate its reasons when it imposes a non-guidelines sentence than when it imposes a sentence under the guidelines. <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707. However, a \u201cchecklist recitation\u201d of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not necessary for a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Dibbles has not shown that the district court failed to consider a required factor under \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s sentence thus was proper under either plain-error or reasonableness review.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Dibbles did not raise this challenge to his sentence in the district court. His argument may thus be subject to plain-error review rather than reasonableness review. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Zuniga, </em>2007 WL 1289984 at *1 (5th Cir.2007). This court need not decide which standard applies, however, because Dibbles\u2019s sentence was proper under either standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
