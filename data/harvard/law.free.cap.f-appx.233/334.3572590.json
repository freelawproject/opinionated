The district court granted summary judgment to Cingular and Richard now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Richard was employed by Cingular as a Radio Frequency Performance Engineer IV, a position with responsibilities that included interviewing and recommending applicants for the position of Radio Frequency Specialist. In September 2003, Richard interviewed three applicants for an available Radio Frequency Specialist position. Richard subsequently sent an email to his superior, Ramiro Peredo (\u201cPeredo\u201d), recommending that Dwayne Barnes (\u201cBarnes\u201d) be selected for the position. Cingular alleges that before sending this email, Richard showed it to Barnes and told Barnes that he was Richard\u2019s \u201cpick.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, however, Richard met with Peredo, who expressed several concerns about Barnes\u2019s fitness for the Radio Frequency Specialist position. Richard then revised his recommendations, and someone other than Barnes was hired for the open position. Richard informed Barnes that he would not be getting the position because \u201cupper management did not want him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Thereafter, Barnes approached human resources employee Kim Willey (\u201cWilley\u201d), related to her his conversations with Richard, and complained about his failure to be offered the Radio Frequency Specialist position. Willey alerted Richard\u2019s supervisors to the alleged conversations. When questioned about whether he had showed Barnes the email or otherwise told Barnes that Barnes was being recommended, Richard twice denied showing or telling Barnes anything of the sort. Cingular commenced an investigation into the matter, led by Susan Horcharik (\u201cHorcharik\u201d). According to Horcharik, Barnes repeated his account of his conversations with Richard but later refused to sign a statement confirming the same. Richard, however, did sign a statement admitting that he had told Barnes he was being recommended, showed Barnes the email, and subsequently lied about both events. In October 2003, Richard was demoted to a non-managerial position, Radio Frequency Performance Engineer II. This demotion entailed a salary decrease from $78,000 to $65,000, which, after an initial oversight, went into effect in February 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">On February 24, 2004, Richard called Cingular\u2019s Ethics Line and complained that he had been \u201cforced to unfairly disregard an African-American candidate\u201d (Barnes) and that his demotion had been in retaliation for his initial recommendation of Barnes. Cingular investigated this complaint and concluded that the facts \u201cfully supported] the decision and the reasons for which in their entirety.\u201d On March 24, 2004, Richard filed an EEOC charge alleging that he was unlawfully demoted in retaliation for opposing practices made illegal by Title VII. On May 27, 2004, the EEOC dismissed the charge and issued Richard a right to sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">On May 28, 2004, Barnes began to receive calls from Richard\u2019s wife, Maria Richard, on his Cingular-issued cellphone. Maria Richard left Barnes a voicemail stating, among other things, that he was evil, arrogant, and had ruined her husband\u2019s career, and that she wanted to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>him so \u201cshe could look him in the eyes.\u201d On June 1, 2004, Barnes reported the phone calls and voicemail to Willey. Barnes indicated that he did not welcome the phone calls and did not want to meet Mrs. Richard, and that Barnes\u2019s wife had heard the message and feared for Barnes\u2019s safety. Willey has stated that while Richard initially denied that his wife made the calls, he then admitted that he had given her Barnes\u2019s cellphone number. Willey reported Barnes\u2019s complaint to Horcharik, who began another investigation. Horcharik discovered that additional calls to Barnes\u2019s cellphone had been placed from Richard\u2019s home and Richard\u2019s own Cingular-issued cellphone. On June 8, 2004, Richard met with his superiors, including Peredo and Horcharik. Richard refused to answer many of the questions posed to him regarding the phone calls. Following the meeting, Richard\u2019s employment at Cingular was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">On August 5, 2004, Richard and Maria Richard filed suit against Cingular in the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that Richard\u2019s demotion and termination constituted unlawful retaliation under Title VII. Cingular filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of both Richard and Maria Richard\u2019s claims. On February 22, 2006, the district court issued an order granting Cingular\u2019s motion as to both plaintiffs. The district court held that because Maria Richard had never been an employee of Cingular and her claims were wholly derivative of Richard\u2019s, she could not maintain an action against Cingular under Title VII. Maria Richard has not appealed. The district court also held that Richard had not satisfied his burden of creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Cingular\u2019s proffered non-retaliatory reasons for his demotion and termination were pretextual. Richard now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The district court\u2019s February 22, 2006 ruling was a final judgment that disposed of all of Richard\u2019s claims. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>1. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dallas County Hosp. Dist. v. Assocs. Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>293 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper when the \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact-finder could return a verdict for the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). When deciding whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, this court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Daniels v. City of Arlington, </em>246 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\n<em>2. Title VII Retaliation Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Under Title VII, it is \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice\u201d by the statute or \u201cbecause [the employee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\u201d under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u00a7 2000e-3(a). To establish a claim of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Fabela v. Socorro Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>329 F.3d 409, 414 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A plaintiff alleging Title VII retaliation may establish a causal link in two ways: either by presenting direct evidence of retaliatory motive or by providing circumstantial evidence that creates a rebuttable presumption of retaliatory motive. <em>Id. </em>at 414-15. Where the plaintiff provides only circumstantial evidence of causation, the burden-shifting framework set out in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), applies. <em>Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 893, 896 (5th Cir.2002). Under that framework, the employee must first make a prima facie case for the- three elements of retaliation. This prima facie case is satisfied by the production of evidence; persuasion is not necessary at this stage. <em>Baker v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>430 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2005). If the employee succeeds in making a prima facie ease, the burden of production shifts to the employer to state a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the employment action. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55. If the defendant meets its burden, the presumption of discrimination created by the prima facie case disappears, and the plaintiff is left with the ultimate burden of proving that the protected activity was the but-for cause of the adverse employment action. <em>See Montemayor v. City of San Antonio, </em>276 F.3d 687, 692 (5th Cir.2001). In other words, the employee must show that the employer\u2019s putative justification is unworthy of credence and is instead a pretext for retaliation. <em>Mato v. Baldauf </em>267 F.3d 444, 452 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>3. Richard\u2019s Demotion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Richard argues that he has made out a prima facie case that his demotion was retaliatory and has created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Cingular\u2019s proffered reasons for his demotion were pretextual. The district court held that Richard had failed to demonstrate that Cingular\u2019s non-retaliatory reasons were mere pretext. This court may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any grounds supported by the record. <em>Lifecare Hosps., Inc. v. Health Plus of La., Inc., </em>418 F.3d 436, 439 (5th Cir.2005). Here, we do not reach the issue of pretext because we hold that Richard has not made out his prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Richard has failed to produce evidence that he engaged in activity protected by Title VII prior to his demotion. Protected activity in the context of a retaliation claim is (1) opposing discriminatory practices or (2) making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). At the time of his demotion, Richard had not yet called the Cingular Ethics Line to complain, nor had he filed his charge with the EEOC. Richard presents as protected activity prior to the demotion his acts of (1) recommending that Barnes be given the Radio Frequency Specialist position and (2) telling Barnes that he would not be receiving the position and encouraging him to \u201cseek justice.\u201d Richard\u2019s act of recommending Barnes for the open position does not qualify as protected activity because it did not oppose or protest an unlawful employment practice. <em>See Moore v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>150 Fed.Appx. 315, 319 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished). Richard\u2019s subsequent conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tion with Barnes also fails to qualify as protected conduct. Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that telling a co-worker that he had suffered unlawful discrimination is protected activity, Richard does not allege nor produce any evidence that he suggested to Barnes that Barnes\u2019s failure to receive the available position was due to racial discrimination. To satisfy the protected activity requirement, an employee must oppose conduct made unlawful by Title VII; complaining of unfair or undesirable treatment not addressed by Title VII will not suffice. See <em>id.; see also Harris-Childs v. Medco Health Solutions, Inc., </em>169 Fed.Appx. 913, 916 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). We therefore conclude that Richard has not demonstrated that he engaged in protected activity prior to the demotion. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Cingular on Richard\u2019s claim that his demotion was retaliatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">A <em>Richard\u2019s Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Richard also brings a claim for retaliation on the basis of his termination by Cingular. Before his termination, Richard had called the Cingular Ethics Line to complain of retaliatory demotion and had also filed a complaint with the EEOC. We therefore conclude that Richard had engaged in activity protected by Title VII. <em>See Walker v. Thompson, </em>214 F.3d 615, 629 (5th Cir.2000). Richard\u2019s termination qualifies as an adverse employment action, thus satisfying the second prong of his prima facie retaliation case. <em>DeHart v. Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 437, 441 (5th Cir.2007). We therefore turn to whether Richard has demonstrated that a causal link existed between his protected activity and subsequent termination. Cingular argues that Richard has made no such showing. This court allows, however, for an inference of causation to be drawn where the adverse employment action occurs in close temporal proximity to the protected conduct. <em>Evans v. City of Houston, </em>246 F.3d 344, 354 (5th Cir.2001). In <em>Evans, </em>we relied upon decisions from district courts in this circuit that found \u201ca time lapse of up to four months ... sufficient to satisfy the causal connection for summary judgment purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In this case, the time span between Richard\u2019s EEOC complaint and his termination was roughly two and a half months. We therefore will allow for an inference of causation, and we conclude that Richard has made out his prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Cingular, however, has satisfied its burden of stating a legitimate, non-retaliatory justification for Richard\u2019s termination. Cingular presented several such justifications: (1) Richard\u2019s wife\u2019s harassing phone calls to Barnes, which were in violation of Cingular\u2019s policy against employee harassment; (2) Richard\u2019s refusal to cooperate fully with Cingular\u2019s investigation into his involvement in the harassing phone calls; and (3) Richard\u2019s earlier lies to Cingular supervisors regarding his conversations with Barnes. The burden therefore falls to Richard to demonstrate that retaliation was the but-for cause of his termination. <em>See Montemayor, </em>276 F.3d at 692. Accordingly, at the summary judgment stage, Richard must demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Cingular\u2019s justifications were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Richard first argues that he presented evidence that Barnes did not find the phone calls from Maria Richards threatening. He cites to a memorandum by Willey in which she stated that Barnes told her that Maria Richard\u2019s voicemail was \u201cnot very nice.\u201d This memorandum, however, also stated that Barnes\u2019s wife feared for his safety after the calls. Based on Barnes\u2019s statements to Willey, Cingular could have concluded that Richard\u2019s wife had made phone calls to a Cingular employee that were, if not physically threatening, certainly harassing and inappropriate. Cingular also could have concluded, in light of the facts that Maria Richards called Barnes\u2019s Cingular-issued cellphone and that Barnes \u201cheard a male voice in the background\u201d during the voicemail, that Richard was complicit in his wife\u2019s calls. We agree with the district court that Richard has not demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Cingular\u2019s justification based on Maria Richards\u2019 phone calls was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Richard then proposes that Cingular\u2019s justification based on his failure to cooperate with their investigation into the phone calls was mere pretext because he was, in fact, cooperative. While Richard concedes that he did not answer numerous questions posed during the meeting with his supervisors, Richard argues that he was told that he could have additional time to answer these questions in writing. The parties dispute how long Richard was told he would have to submit these answers\u2014 Richard claims forty-eight hours, Cingular claims twenty-four \u2014 and when exactly the decision was made to terminate Richard\u2014 Richard argues that the decision was made before even twenty-four hours had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Even if we were to conclude that Richard had demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether his alleged lack of cooperation was merely a pretext, however, Richard \u201cmust put forward evidence rebutting each of the nondiseriminatory reasons the employer articulates\u201d to satisfy his burden. <em>Wallace v. Methodist Hosp. Sys., </em>271 F.3d 212, 220 (5th Cir.2001). As we have seen, Richard has not successfully rebutted Cingular\u2019s justification based on his wife\u2019s phone calls to Barnes. Richard has also not rebutted Cingular\u2019s justification based on his earlier lies to his supervisors regarding his conversations with Barnes. Richard argues that \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence in the record that [he] lied to his superiors, except for the self-serving reports generated by Cingular.\u201d On the contrary, Cingular has presented a statement signed by Richard, dated October 6, 2003, admitting that he lied twice to Cingular personnel regarding his statements to Barnes because he \u201cwas afraid of what would happen\u201d to him. Even if Richard could establish that he did not in fact he, \u201can incorrect belief that an employee\u2019s performance is inadequate constitutes a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason\u201d for termination. Little <em>v. Republic Ref. Co., </em>924 F.2d 93, 97 (5th Cir.1991). Based on Richard\u2019s conduct and admissions at the time, Cingular could have believed that Richard had lied to his supervisors. We conclude that Richard has not demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Cingular\u2019s justification based on Richard\u2019s false statements to his superiors was unworthy of credence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In sum, Richard has not satisfied his burden under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework of demonstrating that Cingular\u2019s proffered reasons for his termination were pretextual and that retaliation was the but-for cause of his termination. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to Cingular on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Richard\u2019s claim that his termination was retaliatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of the district court granting summary judgment to Cingular.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">.

We note, however, that the Supreme Court has acknowledged other circuit court decisions that found three and four month periods too long to allow for an inference of causation. <em>Clark County Sch.
