Liberally construing Holt\u2019s appellate brief, <em>see Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998), Holt argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint and that the district court failed to comply with its obligations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), which required the district court to \u201cmake a <em>de novo </em>determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (emphasis added). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">As an initial matter, the district court\u2019s statement that it had reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and Holt\u2019s objections is sufficient to satisfy us that it engaged in the requisite <em>de novo </em>review. \u201cThe <em>de novo </em>review requirement is essential to the constitutionality of section 636.\u201d <em>Jeffrey S. v. State Bd. of Educ. of State of Ga., </em>896 F.2d 507, 512 (11th Cir.1990). \u201c[A]n appellate court must be satisfied that a district judge has exercised his non-delegable authority by considering the actual testimony, and not merely by reviewing the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendations.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Singletary, </em>952 F.2d 1567, 1576 (11th Cir.1992) (citation and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">In this case, this very experienced district judge stated that he had reviewed the report and recommendation and Holt\u2019s objections. \u2018We assume that the district court performed its review function properly in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Green v. Branson, </em>108 F.3d 1296, 1305 (10th Cir.1997); <em>see also Burrell v. Bd. of Trs. of Ga. Military Coll, </em>125 F.3d 1390, 1395 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c\u2018Trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it in making their decisions.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Applying such an as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>sumption, the Fifth Circuit rejected the contention that review was not <em>de novo </em>when the district court\u2019s order stated that \u201c \u2018[f]or the reasons set forth in the Magistrate\u2019s Report to which an objection was filed; IT IS ORDERED that ... the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Longmire v. Guste, </em>921 F.2d 620, 623 (5th Cir.1991) (alteration and omission in original). We likewise cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s statement indicates a failure to engage in the requisite <em>de novo </em>review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Turning to the merits of the dismissal of Holt\u2019s complaint, we discern no error. \u2018We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Behrens v. Regier, </em>422 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-5\">The district court may only grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss where it is demonstrated beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Although the threshold is exceedingly low for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may nonetheless dismiss a complaint on a dispositive issue of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-6\"><em>Day v. Taylor, </em>400 F.3d 1272, 1275 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must do more than merely state legal conclusions; they are required to allege some specific factual bases for those conclusions or face dismissal of their claims.\u201d <em>Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1263 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[Cjonclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (citation and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1088-89 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Holt\u2019s complaint alleges violations of his Constitutional rights based on a state criminal prosecution brought against him. He sought monetary damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and, invoking the pendent jurisdiction of the district court, the issuance of a writ of mandamus, writ of prohibition, and writ of quo warranto \u201cto protect the interests of the people as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[T]he under-color-of-state-law element of \u00a7 1983 excludes from its reach merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.\u201d <em>Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir.2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 453, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). However, \u201cprivate defendants can be held liable in a \u00a7 1983 action if they act in concert with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>the state officials in depriving a plaintiff of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Bendiburg v. Dempsey, </em>909 F.2d 463, 468 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Holt\u2019s malpractice and ineffective assistance of counsel claims against defense attorney Suskauer are based on allegations that Suskauer failed to file various motions as Holt\u2019s counsel during the state criminal proceedings. Thus, these claims cannot proceed under \u00a7 1983 because Suskauer was not acting under color of state law. <em>Polk County, </em>454 U.S. at 325, 102 S.Ct. at 453. Holt\u2019s complaint only contains a general, conclusory allegation of a conspiracy and, therefore, the conspiracy claim was properly dismissed. <em>See Jackson, </em>372 F.3d at 1262-63 (\u201c[C]onelusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Furthermore, the district court did not err in finding that Judge Brown and prosecutors Krischer, Faro, and Vise\u00f3me were immune from damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-7\">Judges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. This immunity applies even when the judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-8\"><em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotation marks omitted). As all of the allegations Holt made against Judge Brown relate to orders entered and actions taken (or not taken) in a case pending before her, the district court did not err in finding that Judge Brown was entitled to judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Similarly, all of Holt\u2019s allegations against prosecutors Krischer, Faro, and Vise\u00f3me only relate to actions taken in their prosecutorial role. However, \u201cin initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State\u2019s case, the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S.Ct. 984, 995, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Immunity extends to charging a defendant without probable cause and to the knowing proffer of perjured testimony and fabricated exhibits at trial. <em>Rowe v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>279 F.3d 1271, 1279-81 (11th Cir.2002). A prosecutor only can be liable for conspiracy \u201cif his agreement to join the conspiracy or conduct knowingly done in furtherance of it occurred while he was not in his prosecutorial role. [A prosecutor] cannot ... be held hable for conspiring to violate [a person\u2019s] rights by prosecuting him, because he is absolutely immune from liability for\u201d that prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1282. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that Krischer, Faro, and Vise\u00f3me were entitled to prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The district court also did not err in dismissing Holt\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. All of Holt\u2019s factual allegations related to past conduct, he made no allegation of a continuing injury, and the possibility that he will be subject to criminal prosecution in the future is insufficient to state a claim for declaratory relief. <em>See Emory v. Peeler, </em>756 F.2d 1547, 1552 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe remote possibility that a future injury may happen is not sufficient to satisfy the \u2018actual controversy\u2019 requirement for declaratory judgments.\u201d); <em>see also Malowney v. Fed. Collection Deposit Group, </em>193 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cInjury in the past, however, does not support a finding of an Article III case or controversy when the only relief sought is a declaratory judgment.\u201d). In order to warrant injunctive relief, the party must demonstrate a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>stantial likelihood of irreparable injury, which is \u201cneither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\u201d <em>Siegel v. Le-Pore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1176-77 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). Holt, however, failed to allege an actual and imminent threat of future injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">\u201cThe decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendant state claims rests within the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Raney, </em>370 F.3d at 1088-89. \u201cWe have encouraged district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when ... the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1089. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Holt\u2019s pendant claims for a writ of mandamus, writ of prohibition, and writ of quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that the district court fulfilled its obligation to conduct <em>de novo </em>review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) and that its dismissal of Holt\u2019s complaint was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. Although there was no testimony presented in this case, <em>de novo </em>review of a recommendation to dismiss for failure to state a claim must still encompass an independent review of the record. <em>See LoConte v. Dugger, </em>847 F.2d 745, 750 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that consideration of a challenged factual issue must be independent and based upon the record before the court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-7\"><em>. </em>This case involves the granting of a motion to dismiss. Consequently, the district judge was not reviewing testimony nor exhibits but reviewing <em>de novo </em>whether the allegations of the complaint stated a claim for relief under the law. Of course, it would be helpful if orders of this sort stated specifically that \"a <em>de novo </em>review\u201d was conducted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
