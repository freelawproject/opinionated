He was sentenced within his advisory guideline sentencing range to 285 months in prison. On appeal, his attorney has filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, noting that, because Stakes waived the right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement, there were no meritorious issues on appeal. Nonetheless, the brief questions whether Stakes\u2019 sentence was unreasonably harsh. Although informed of his right to do so, Stakes has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on the waiver. We grant the motion in part and dismiss the appeal of Stakes\u2019 sentence. After a review of the record under <em>Anders, </em>we affirm Stakes\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742 (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Any such waiver must be made by a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to appeal. <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995). Whether a defendant has effectively waived his right to appeal is an issue of law we review de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">To the extent Stakes is appealing his sentence, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. The district court\u2019s plea colloquy was thorough and conformed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the dictates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Moreover, Stukes does not challenge the voluntariness of his waiver. Because Stukes knowingly and voluntarily entered into the plea agreement, the waiver is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The waiver expressly precluded Stukes from appealing any sentence that was either within or below the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. Because the sentence imposed was within the advisory range, any challenge to the district court\u2019s sentence, including Stakes\u2019 claims that his sentence was unreasonably harsh, falls within the scope of that waiver. As such, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Stakes\u2019 appeal to the extent that Stukes appeals his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">However, the waiver\u2019s enforceability does not completely dispose of this appeal. Our interpretation of Stakes\u2019 plea agreement is guided by contract law. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1997). The appellate waiver was limited to Stakes\u2019 right to appeal his sentence. Accordingly, the waiver provision does not foreclose Stakes\u2019 right to appeal with respect to issues not expressly covered by the waiver. <em>See United States v. Craig, </em>985 F.2d 175, 178 (4th Cir.1993). As such, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as it relates to the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Although Stukes does not raise a specific challenge to his guilty plea, pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we must also review Stakes\u2019 conviction for any potentially meritorious issues. As outlined above, a review of the Rule 11 hearing demonstrates that Stakes\u2019 plea was knowing and voluntary, and he does not assert otherwise. Accordingly, his convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-18\">. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-18\">. Stukes asserts that the Government should have moved to dismiss earlier in the proceedings and that its failure to do so has caused \"the wasteful use of limited resources.\u201d (Motion at p. 2). However, because Stukes\u2019 waiver did not cover all possible appellate issues, the Government could not move to dismiss the appeal until it was clear what issues were being raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
