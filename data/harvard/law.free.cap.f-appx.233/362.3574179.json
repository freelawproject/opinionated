We vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-25\">I. Background and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b382-26\">Stavroula Rees pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry after deportation and having previously been convicted of an aggravated felony. The presentence report (PSR) assigned Rees a base offense level of eight. The PSR increased Rees\u2019 base offense level 16 levels under section 2L1.2(a) of the Guidelines because her deportation occurred following her 2002 Ohio conviction for burglary, a crime of violence. According to the PSR, Rees was also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>victed in Ohio of two counts of burglary in 2003. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the PSR set Rees\u2019 total offense level at 21. That offense level, combined with a criminal history category of IV, yielded a recommended sentencing guidelines range of 57 to 71 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Rees objected to the PSR, challenging the 16-level enhancement, and repeated her objection at sentencing. The district court overruled Rees\u2019 objection, finding that her prior convictions constituted admes of violence, and sentenced Rees to 57 months imprisonment and a two-year term of supervised release. Rees timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 602 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that, <em>post-Booker, </em>this Court continues to use same standards of review when considering district court\u2019s application of Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Rees argues that her prior Ohio burglary convictions do not qualify as crimes of violence under the Guidelines. Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Guidelines provides for a 16-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if she was previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence. The Application Notes define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as (1) any of the specific enumerated offenses, which include \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d or (2) \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u201cIn determining whether a prior offense is equivalent to an enumerated offense that is not defined in the Guidelines, like \u2018burglary of a dwelling,\u2019\u201d we define \u201cthe enumerated offense according to its \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019\u201d and rely \u201con a uniform definition, regardless of the labels employed by the various States\u2019 criminal codes.\u201d <em>United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2006). This Court uses a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to determine whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as \u201can enumerated offense as that offense is understood in its ordinary, contemporary, and common meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he generic, contemporary meaning of burglary contains at least ... an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). \u201c[B]urglary of a dwelling\u201d \u201calso includes, at a minimum, tents or vessels used for human habitation.\u201d <em>Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Rees was convicted of third-degree felony burglary of an occupied structure under the Ohio burglary statute. The Ohio statute\u2019s definition of \u201coccupied structure\u201d includes structures that are not dwellings, such as \u201cany building, outbuilding, ... railroad car, truck, trailer, ... or other structure\u201d if \u201c[a]t the time, any person is present or likely to be present in it.\u201d Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2909.01(B)(7)(C). Therefore, as Rees contends, and as the government concedes, her prior state court convictions for burglary do not qualify as the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d 479, 482 (5th Cir.2006)(finding that Arkansas statute defining burglary as entering or remaining unlawfully in \u201can occupiable structure of another person\u201d included structures that were not dwellings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>precludes qualifying as enumerated offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">When determining whether an offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, this Court adopts the categorical approach and \u201cexamines the elements of the offense, rather than the facts underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d at 482. The Ohio statute under which Rees was convicted does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. Indeed, a burglary under the Ohio statute can be committed against property, rather than a person. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2911.12(A)(3). As with the enumerated offense definition, the government concedes that Rees\u2019 convictions do not meet this alternative definition of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Rees also challenges the constitutionality of section 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Rees concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and was only raised here to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005)(\u201cThis court has repeatedly rejected arguments like [this] one ... and has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Rees\u2019 sentence, and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
