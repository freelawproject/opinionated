Ward, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>who was sentenced in October 1983 to, <em>inter alia, </em>a 15-year term of special parole, claims that the United States Parole Commission (\u201cUSPC\u201d) terminated its jurisdiction over him by issuing a certificate of discharge in May 2000, while he was on regular parole. He challenges the USPC\u2019s continued exercise of jurisdiction, including the issuance of a violator\u2019s warrant in November 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Ward has moved to supplement the record on appeal. His motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">A term of special parole \u201cis an additional period of supervision which commences upon completion of any period on parole or mandatory release supervision from the regular sentence; or if the prisoner is released without supervision, commences upon such release.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.57(a). If a parolee is granted early termination of regular parole pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.43, \u201cthe Special Parole Term commences to run at that point in time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEarly termination from supervision from a Special Parole Term may occur as in the case of a regular parole term, except that the time periods considered shall commence from the beginning of the Special Parole Term.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A notice of discharge issued by mistake does not estop the USPC from acting on a violator\u2019s warrant absent a showing of affirmative misconduct by the government and a showing that the parolee was prejudiced. <em>See Russie v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>708 F.2d 1445, 1448-49 (9th Cir.1983); <em>cf. Llerena v. United States, </em>508 F.2d 78, 82 (5th Cir.1975) (stating that error by district court does not provide immunity from a term of special parole). Our review of the record reveals no indication that the USPC considered early termination of Ward\u2019s 15-year term of special parole; indeed, under the governing regulations, the USPC could not validly grant early termination of a mandatory term of special parole where, as here, such a term had yet to commence. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.57(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">At most, the record indicates a mistake in the issuance of the certificate of discharge, which did not prejudice Ward, who has admitted that he was unaware of the certificate. In view of the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying mandamus relief on this claim. <em>See United States v. Denson, </em>603 F.2d 1143, 1146 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Ward, who contends that the violator\u2019s warrant was validly executed in December 2000, argues that the USPC denied him due process because it failed to hold a revocation hearing following execution of the warrant. Ward concedes in his reply brief, however, that a revocation hearing was conducted by the USPC on April 11, 2006, and he does dispute the district court\u2019s determination that he received credit for the time served between his arrest and his conviction on money laundering charges in 2001. Accordingly, Ward\u2019s demand for mandamus relief in the form of a revocation hearing and sentence credit is moot. <em>See Musgrave v. Amow, </em>497 F.2d 111, 111 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
