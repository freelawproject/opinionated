He also contends that the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination was an abuse of discretion that rose to the level of a violation of his due process rights. He does not specifically challenge the BIA\u2019s decision, nor does he challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that he did not show hardship that was sufficient to merit cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">The BIA conducted its own review of the record and did not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, and thus this court does not have authority to review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir.2002). Because Shark-Duru challenges only statements and determinations by the IJ that this court lacks authority to review and does not challenge any of the BIA\u2019s determinations, he has abandoned the only issues before this court. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, Shark-Duru has not shown any error in the BIA\u2019s dismissal, and his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
