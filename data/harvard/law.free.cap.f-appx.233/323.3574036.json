Seeley admitted the first three alleged violations; however, he denied the last two violations \u2014 whether he had broken state laws by feloniously manufacturing and feloniously possessing marijuana. The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Seeley committed the five alleged violations and sentenced him to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment. Seeley timely noted his appeal and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). On appeal, Seeley alleges that the evidence was insufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated the conditions of his supervised release by committing the new state offenses. In letters to this Court, Seeley also challenges the credibility of his wife in her initial statement to the police and while on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">A decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court need only find a violation by a preponderance of the evidence to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 and Supp.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Seeley committed the alleged state law violations. The district court heard Mrs. Seeley\u2019s initial statement to police that she believed Seeley was growing marijuana in the backyard, that she observed Seeley daily in the backyard, that Seeley informed her he had planted something back there, and that she was not to go out there. The court also heard that Seeley\u2019s wife\u2019s daughter told police she believed Seeley was checking on something in the backyard. Moreover, marijuana was located where Officer Bloom had discovered, on a prior occasion, seedlings he believed were marijuana. Accordingly, the Government established both allegations Seeley complains of by a preponderance of the evidence, and the district court, therefore, did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>discretion in revoking Seeley\u2019s supervised release. Additionally, Seeley\u2019s attack on appeal on his wife\u2019s credibility does not afford him any relief. <em>See United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Seeley, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Seeley requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Seeley.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
