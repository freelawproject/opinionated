He argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. The district court stated that it had considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and gave the following reasons for the sentence: (1) the sentence was within the applicable guidelines sentencing range for the offenses (\u00a7 3553(a)(4)) and (2) Wannamaker pleaded guilty to all 16 counts of the indictment without a plea agreement, he accepted responsibility for the offenses, and he cooperated with the Government (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)). The district court also heard and considered the testimony of Wannamaker\u2019s wife and one of the victims of Wannamaker\u2019s offenses. Wannamaker has not shown that the district court misapplied the Guidelines, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, failed to give reasons for the sentence, or considered improper factors in imposing the sentence. Therefore, Wannamaker has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 611, 518-20 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-21\">Wannamaker also argues that the language in <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551 (5th Cir.2006), is improper. We have not, however, relied on <em>Alonzo </em>and its rebuttable presumption of reasonableness in deciding this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
