On appeal, Zamor argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his objection to the government\u2019s admission of Maktoine Thomas\u2019s birth certificate, where the government had not disclosed the birth certificate to Zamor during pre-trial discovery. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">At Zamor\u2019s trial, the government presented the following evidence. First, Special Agent Scott Banker, an agent for the Diplomatic Security Service in the United States Department of State, testified that he investigates passport and visa violations and in that capacity was called to Palm Beach County to conduct an interview of someone who identified himself as Maktoine Thomas. Banker brought a copy of a passport application with him to the interview, which application Banker had obtained based upon a passport number he had been given. According to Banker, the name on the passport application was Maktoine Thomas and the picture attached to the application was of Zamor. Further, the passport that had been recovered from Zamor\u2019s pocket at the time of his arrest contained a picture of Zamor, a birth date of November 27, 1979, and was issued to the name Maktoine Thomas. During Banker\u2019s interview of Zamor, he elicited that Zamor had completed the passport application that Banker had and that Zamor\u2019s photograph was the one attached to the passport application. Zamor told Banker that his name was Maktoine Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">After the interview, Banker located driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards in a government database that contained the name Maktoine Thomas and a birth date in November 1979. Pictures on two of the licenses did not match. Banker found licenses and identification cards in the name of Phillippe Zamor and those cards contained pictures of Zamor. Banker continued his investigation in Naples, Florida, where he located three high school yearbooks that contained pictures and the name of Maktoine Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">Maktoine Thomas then testified that he was born on November 27, 1979, was a citizen of the United States, and had one sister and six brothers, including a half-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>brother named Phillippe Zamor. The government then asked Thomas to take out his birth certificate. Thomas testified that the government had made a copy of his birth certificate the previous day, and the government then moved to admit the copy of the birth certificate into evidence. Zamor\u2019s counsel objected, alleging a discovery violation because it was the first time that he had seen Thomas\u2019s birth certificate. Zamor\u2019s counsel clarified that he was not objecting on authenticity grounds. Counsel argued that, because of the government\u2019s failure to disclose the document when it was received, he was \u201cprejudiced in [his] inability to do a more thorough examination.\u201d The court excused the jury and the following discussion then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaf\">Court: I am not suggesting there is bad motive or effort to circumvent the rules.... If the Government agent knows there is a document that they are probably going to use and elects to allow a third party to hold on to it so the agent doesn\u2019t hold on to it, I am going to treat that is [sic] and was in the possession of the Government and that obviously is the beginning situation, because you have some situations where something is in the possession of law enforcement and it is not turned over, and that is considered a discovery violation. I am going to start out treating this as though it is a discovery violation.... The case law is clear, in order to prevail on a discovery violation, the defendant has to show that he has been prejudiced ---- What is the prejudice in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">Zamor\u2019s counsel: Your Honor, I had no opportunity to check out the validity of this document to see if it is a valid document. I am going on the appearance that I see it in court, and I\u2019ve suffered some prejudice in that regard. Court: ... In retrospect ... it probably would have been better had the agent made a copy of it so the copy could have been disclosed to the defense as part of pretrial discovery procedures, but I think it is clear this was not done in any effort to cause surprise or to sandbag the defense.... Second, I don\u2019t think the defense has shown substantial prejudice in this. This is a document that is really self authenticating. The whole issue in this case is one of identity and, obviously, Mr. Thomas himself is present in court indicating who he is, and so on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">The document is simply corroborative evidence of his own oral testimony. We are in the middle of a trial. A recess or anything else, really, wouldn\u2019t achieve any benefit at all. So, I am finding for the sake of the record, there has been a discovery violation, but, nonetheless, I am finding that there is no prejudice resulting from this, and so, therefore, I would overrule the objection....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">The jury was then returned to the courtroom and, continuing with its direct examination of Thomas, the government asked Thomas if he knew if his brother was in the courtroom or if he could identify his brother. Thomas testified that he could not identify his brother because he had not seen him in 20 years. Thomas recognized his name and date of birth on the passport application, but he did not write that on the application nor did anyone else write it for him. With regard to the driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards in evidence, Thomas testified that it was not his picture on two of the licenses. Further, the name and date of birth on the passport at issue was his, but the picture on the passport was not of him. Thomas also identified the high school yearbook pictures as being of himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">Next, Jacqueline Thomas testified that she was Maktoine Thomas\u2019s sister and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>identified Thomas as the man who testified immediately before her. Jacqueline stated that her parents had told her that she had a half-brother named Phillippe Zamor, but that she had never met him. Jacqueline identified her brother Maktoine\u2019s picture on one of the driver\u2019s licenses in evidence, but she stated that the pictures on the other two licenses were not of Maktoine. Norman Lee Parrish, an immigration inspector at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, testified that, in 1984, an individual named Phillippe Zamor had filed an application for asylum, which application included fingerprints of that individual. Parrish stated that the asylum application was still pending at the time of the instant trial. Deputy United States Marshall Michael Witkowski stated that, at the time of defendant Zamor\u2019s instant arrest, he took Zamor\u2019s fingerprints and photograph. Deputy Witkowski further testified that the defendant signed \u201cZamor Phillippe\u201d when directed to sign his name on his fingerprint card. Lastly, the government tendered Officer Gregory Parkinson as an expert in fingerprint comparison. Officer Parkinson stated that he had performed a fingerprint comparison on all the fingerprints that were in evidence in the instant case, and that he determined that all the fingerprints belonged to the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Zamor did not testify on his own behalf, nor did he present any other witnesses. The jury found Zamor guilty of all four counts of the superseding indictment. Thereafter, the court sentenced Zamor to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Zamor argues on appeal that this Court should vacate his conviction based upon the district court\u2019s erroneous admission of Maktoine Thomas\u2019s birth certificate. Zamor contends that the admission of the birth certificate was \u201ccentral\u201d to the government\u2019s claim that Zamor was not the true Maktoine Thomas. He further asserts that the birth certificate was not merely corroborating evidence of Thomas\u2019s testimony, but was actually the \u201cofficial document\u201d corroborating Thomas\u2019s claim that he was the true Maktoine Thomas. He concludes that the admission of the birth certificate was erroneous because he had no time to prepare for it, and its admission resulted in complete surprise and substantial prejudice to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s admission of evidence over a defendant\u2019s objection based upon a discovery violation. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>799 F.2d 649, 652 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, the government must, upon the defendant\u2019s request, allow the defendant to inspect and copy all documents that \u201cthe government intends to use ... in its case-in-chief at trial.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E)(ii). \u201cA discovery violation under [Rule 16] or a standing discovery order is reversible error only when it violates a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d 993, 998 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cSubstantial prejudice exists when a defendant is unduly surprised and lacks an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense, or if the mistake substantially influences the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 998-99. \u201cInadvertence does not render a discovery violation harmless; rather, the purpose of rule 16 is to protect a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial rather than to punish the government\u2019s non-compliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 999. \u201cThe actual prejudice will often turn on the strength of the Government\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>799 F.2d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">In Zamor\u2019s case, it is not disputed that the district court correctly determined that the government had violated the standing discovery order by failing to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Thomas\u2019s birth certificate to Zamor. The issue on appeal is whether Zamor suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the government\u2019s discovery violation. <em>See Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d at 998-99. On this record, Zamor has not established that he suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In addition to Thomas\u2019s birth certificate, the government submitted overwhelming evidence that Zamor was not the true Maktoine Thomas, and, thus, that he had committed the offenses alleged in his indictment. First, Agent Banker discovered, during his investigation of the instant case, driver\u2019s licenses that contained pictures of Zamor with the name \u201cMaktoine Thomas.\u201d Second, Thomas appeared in court and testified that it was his name, but not his picture, on the driver\u2019s licenses and passport application in evidence. Thomas also identified the three pictures from the high school yearbooks as being his with the name \u201cMaktoine Thomas\u201d next to them. Moreover, Thomas\u2019s sister, who testified immediately following Maktoine, identified the individual who testified before her as her brother Maktoine, and she testified that the driver\u2019s licenses contained Maktoine\u2019s name, but the pictures were not of Maktoine. Lastly, the testimony of several witnesses revealed that the fingerprints from Phillippe Zamor\u2019s asylum application matched the fingerprints taken from Zamor on the day of his instant arrest. This evidence collectively supports the jury finding that the defendant Zamor was actually Phillippe Zamor and not the true Maktoine Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">In light of all of the government\u2019s evidence, the birth certificate served as another piece of evidence corroborating Thomas\u2019s true identity. During the sidebar discussion following Zamor\u2019s objection to the admission of the birth certificate, Zamor\u2019s counsel first conceded the authenticity of the birth certificate, but then stated, when asked by the court to explain any prejudice, that he \u201chad no opportunity to check out the validity of this document to see if it is a valid document. I am going on the appearance that I see it in court, and I\u2019ve suffered some prejudice in that regard.\u201d Zamor did not explain further the prejudice that he suffered, nor does he expound on the argument before this Court. Furthermore, Zamor did not cross-examine Thomas regarding the birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Given the government\u2019s overwhelming evidence of Zamor\u2019s guilt, and the lack of specific arguments from Zamor detailing exactly how he was prejudiced, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Zamor had not suffered substantial prejudice due to the government\u2019s discovery violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Zamor\u2019s convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">. Zamor also argues on appeal that his convictions should be vacated because his case is factually similar to <em>Camargo-Vergara, </em>a case in which we held that the defendant was substantially prejudiced by the government\u2019s discovery violation. <em>See Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d at 998-99. Upon review of our decision in <em>Camargo-Vergara </em>and the record in Zamor\u2019s case, Zamor\u2019s argument is without merit because he does not demonstrate, as the defendant did in <em>Camargo-Vergara, </em>that he intended to present a defense based upon the lack of Thomas's birth certificate being in evidence, nor does Zamor explain how his trial strategy was affected by the government's surprise disclosure of the birth certificate. As such, Zamor\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Camargo-Vergara.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
