Banks filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The appointed trustee in bankruptcy filed a report of no assets. In 2005, Banks filed many adversary actions, including the three at issue in these related appeals. The Bankruptcy Court, holding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over these adversary actions (and others that we do not presently consider) because they related only to post-petition acts unrelated to the administration of Banks\u2019 bankruptcy case, dismissed them. Banks appealed to the District Court. The District Court affirmed the order dismissing the adversary actions. Banks appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-28\">The District Court had jurisdiction to review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>suant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a), and we have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) &amp; 1291. We exercise the same standard of review as the District Court, subjecting the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s legal determinations to plenary review and reviewing its factual findings for clear error. <em>See In re United Healthcare Sys., </em>396 F.3d 247, 249 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We will summarily affirm because no substantial question is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. The Bankruptcy Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the three listed adversary actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334 and 157, provide the source of a bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Binder v. Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., </em>372 F.3d 154, 161 (3d Cir.2004). Under these statutes, and relevant to our analysis here, a bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over those cases \u201c \u2018at least \u201crelated to\u201d the bankruptcy.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marcus Hook Dev. Park, Inc., </em>943 F.2d 261, 266 (3d Cir.1991) (citations omitted). Litigation is related to a bankruptcy if its outcome could \u201cconceivably have any effect on the estate being administrated in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>See Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, </em>743 F.2d 984, 994 (3d Cir.1984); <em>see also In re Marcus Hook Dev. Park, Inc., </em>943 F.2d at 264 (stressing the term \u201cconceivably\u201d). More specifically, an action is related to bankruptcy if its outcome \u201ccould alter the debtor\u2019s rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action (either positively or negatively) and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>See Pacor, </em>743 F.2d at 994. The three adversary actions were unrelated to bankruptcy because, as Banks plainly alleged in his complaints, the supposed wrongs occurred in 2002 and 2003, at the earliest, after he had filed for bankruptcy protection. Accordingly, they are not property of the bankruptcy estate such that their resolution would affect the handling or administration of the estate. <em>See In re Bobroff, </em>766 F.2d 797, 803 (3d Cir.1985) (citing 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 for the proposition that \u201cthe only property interests of a debtor that become part of the estate are those existing \u2018as of the commencement of the case.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In sum, because the Bankruptcy Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, we will affirm the order insomuch as it dismissed the three listed adversary actions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">. Although Banks took issue in the District Court with the Bankruptcy Court's action to dismiss his adversary actions <em>sua sponte, </em>as the District Court explained, the Bankruptcy Court was obligated to evaluate its jurisdiction and dismiss the actions over which it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
