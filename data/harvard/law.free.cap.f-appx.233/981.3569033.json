In two separate orders issued on the same day, January 3, 2007, the district court granted motions to dismiss filed by the State and the GDHR and the eight individuals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">Garnett was an administrative operations manager employed by the Richmond County Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS). She was terminated on March 3, 2004. In her seven-count complaint, Garnett seeks compensatory and punitive damages, and also asks for injunctive relief to be reinstated in her previous employment position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-18\">In Count I of her complaint, Garnett claims that she was terminated in retaliation for her actions in instituting proceedings related to the enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>Count II claims that defendants continued their retaliatory conduct under the FLSA when they failed to rehire her. Counts III, IV and V set forth claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of Garnett\u2019s constitutional right of free speech, also claiming that her termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>violated substantive and procedural due process rights. Count VI sets forth a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. Count VII alleges a violation of the Georgia Whistle Blower statute, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-1-4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">We have carefully reviewed the record and the briefs and the arguments of counsel contained therein. The district court correctly analyzed the claims asserted by Garnett and the controlling law in each of its two January 3 orders granting the named defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Finding no error, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">. Four months later, and unopposed by the defendants, the district court granted Gar-nett\u2019s motion to amend the two January 3 orders, deeming certification appropriate as \"there is no just reason for delay,\" in that final judgment respecting Garnett and the named defendants would not prejudice any claims against the unknown John and Jane Doe defendants. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">. For purposes of this appeal, Garnett acquiesced in the dismissal of the State. Neither does she challenge the district court\u2019s rulings as to her FSLA claims, nor does she dispute that she failed to state a substantive due process claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
