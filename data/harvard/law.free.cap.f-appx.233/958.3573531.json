The district court sentenced him to serve 180 months in prison, the minimum sentence the court was able to impose under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). ACCA\u2019s 180-month mandatory minimum applies to any person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and has had three previous convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At sentencing, after reviewing the presentence investigation report prepared by the probation office, the district court concluded that Peters was subject to ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum because he had three previous convictions, each of which qualified as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">One of the three felonies that the district court treated as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for ACCA purposes was Peters\u2019s 1981 conviction for attempted second degree burglary under Tennessee law. On appeal, Peters argues that the district court miscalculated his sentence because, he says, his 1981 conviction for attempted burglary, as defined by Tennessee law, cannot be considered a violent felony under ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and therefore affirm Peters\u2019s sentence. Our analysis of this appeal tracks the approach set forth by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-15\">The term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined by ACCA as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-16\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-17\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-18\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-20\">At the time Peters was convicted, Tennessee defined second degree burglary as follows: \u201cBurglary in the second degree is the breaking and entering into a dwelling house or any other house, building, room or rooms therein used and occupied by any person or persons as a dwelling place or lodging either permanently or temporarily and whether as owner, renter, tenant, lessee or paying guest, by day, with the intent to commit a felony.\u201d Tenn. Stat. \u00a7 39-903 (repealed 1989). Peters was convicted under Tennessee\u2019s general attempt statute, which at the time provided as follows: \u201cIf any person ... attempts] to commit[] any felony or crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, where the punishment is not otherwise prescribed, he shall, on conviction, be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five (5) years, or, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>discretion of the jury, by imprisonment in the county workhouse or jail not more than one (1) year.\u201d Tenn. Stat. \u00a7 39-603 (repealed 1989); <em>see State v. Staggs, </em>554 S.W.2d 620, 624 (Tenn.1977) (\u201cWe hold that Sec. 39-603 is our general attempt statute.\u201d). Second degree burglary was a felony for purposes of the general attempt statute. <em>See State v. Cole, </em>665 S.W.2d 407, 408 (Tenn.Cr.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">At the time Peters was convicted, Tennessee\u2019s \u201claw of criminal attempt, though sanctioned by various statutes, was judicially defined.\u201d <em>State v. Reeves, </em>916 S.W.2d 909, 910-11 (Tenn.1996). As defined by the Tennessee courts, the elements of criminal attempt were: \u201c(1) an intent to commit a specific crime; (2) an overt act toward the commission of that crime; and (3) a failure to consummate the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911. As required for application of ACCA, Peters\u2019s conviction for attempted second degree burglary was \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B); <em>see Rafferty v. State, </em>91 Tenn. 655, 16 S.W. 728, 728 (1891) (construing former version of \u00a7 39-603 and holding that \u201c[t]he fact that the punishment for the attempt is in the alternative, either by imprisonment in the penitentiary or by fine and imprisonment in the county jail, does not make it any less an offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, or take from it the characteristic of a felony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">As did the parties in <em>James, </em>which involved a conviction for attempted burglary under Florida law, the parties here agree that Peters\u2019s attempted burglary conviction cannot be considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under clause (i) of ACCA\u2019s definition because attempted second degree burglary under Tennessee law does not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i); <em>see James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1591. And as the Court recognized in <em>James, </em>attempted burglary cannot qualify as any of the crimes specifically enumerated in clause (ii). <em>Id. </em>That is because attempted burglary is not arson or extortion and does not involve the use of explosives. Nor does attempted burglary qualify as \u201cburglary\u201d under clause (ii) because it does not meet the ACCA definition of burglary set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990): \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d Attempted burglary is not Taylor-defined burglary because one of the required elements of attempted burglary under Tennessee law is \u201ca failure to consummate the [underlying] crime.\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>916 S.W.2d at 911; see <em>James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1591 (noting that attempted burglary under Florida law is not <em>Taylor-defined </em>burglary because it requires that the defendant \u201c\u2018fai[l] in the perpetration or [be] intercepted or prevented in the execution\u2019 of the underlying offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">Thus, the only question presented in this appeal, similar to the question addressed by the Court in <em>James </em>with respect to Florida law, is whether attempted second degree burglary, as defined by Tennessee law at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction, falls within ACCA\u2019s clause (ii) residual provision for crimes that \u201cotherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">To answer this question, we must use the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Supreme Court for the purpose of defining other ACCA offenses. <em>See James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1593. \u201cUnder this approach, we look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense and do not generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction. That is, we consider whether the <em>elements of the offense </em>are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">We must look first to Tennessee law to determine what type of conduct constituted attempted burglary at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction. The general attempt statute under which Peters was convicted is unhelpful for that purpose because, as we noted above, the law of criminal attempt in 1981 was judicially, not statutorily, defined. At that time, Tennessee courts required as an element of attempted burglary that the defendant engage in an \u201covert act directed to [the] commission\u201d of burglary. <em>See Gervin v. State, </em>212 Tenn. 653, 371 S.W.2d 449, 450 (1963). Without citing any authority that supports the proposition, Peters maintains that Tennessee\u2019s attempt statute is construed \u201cin an extremely broad manner,\u201d so broad that in Peters\u2019s view \u201ca defendant would be guilty of attempted burglary by merely collecting some burglar tools and driving around a neighborhood looking for an empty house.\u201d Peters Br. at 16. Based on this observation, Peters reasons that attempted burglary under Tennessee law is not a violent felony under ACCA because it does not \u201cpresen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We disagree with Peters\u2019s view of Tennessee law and thus his conclusion about the applicability of ACCA in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">The gist of Peters\u2019s argument, much like the petitioner\u2019s argument in <em>James, </em>is that in Tennessee a person can be convicted of attempted burglary by engaging in merely preparatory conduct \u2014 conduct that does not pose a physical risk to others. <em>See James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594 (\u201cJames contends that this broad statutory language sweeps in merely preparatory activity that poses no real danger of harm to others \u2014 for example, acquiring burglars\u2019 tools or casing a structure while planning a burglary.\u201d). But that is not an accurate statement of the law in Tennessee today, nor is it an accurate statement of the law in Tennessee at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction in 1981. The leading case on criminal attempts in Tennessee at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction was <em>Dupuy v. State, </em>204 Tenn. 624, 325 S.W.2d 238 (1959), <em>overruled by Reeves, </em>916 S.W.2d at 914 (recognizing <em>Dupuy </em>as the \u201cbest example\u201d of Tennessee courts\u2019 pre-1989 interpretation of criminal attempt).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the typical phrasing of the overt act element of a criminal attempt, as recited in <em>Gervin </em>and other Tennessee cases, may seem fairly broad in a general sense \u2014 the act must be \u201cdirected at the commission of\u2019 burglary<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014the Tennessee Supreme Court in <em>Dupuy </em>had significantly restricted the meaning and application of that element, stating that \u201c[t]he overt act necessary to constitute an attempt to commit crime must go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>beyond mere preparation, and <em>commission of the crime must be at least apparently possible to the reasonable apprehension of [the] </em>accused.\u201d 325 S.W.2d at 240 (emphasis added). The Court in <em>Dupuy </em>characterized the overt act as \u201cthe direct movement toward the commission [of the crime] after the preparations have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Citing <em>Dupuy </em>as the archetypal case on the application of the overt act requirement, the Tennessee Supreme Court in <em>Reeves </em>confirmed that, prior to 1989, \u201cTennessee courts [following the lead of <em>Dupuy] </em>construed the term \u2018overt act\u2019 <em>very narrowly.\u201d </em>916 S.W.2d at 911 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>James </em>similarly recognized that the Florida Supreme Court, applying Florida\u2019s attempt statute in the burglary context, has \u201cconsiderably narrowed\u201d the statute\u2019s broad language by requiring that a defendant engage in some \u201covert act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance.\u201d <em>James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594 (citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>608 So.2d 797, 799 (Fla.1992)). The Court in <em>James </em>pointed out that this \u201cnarrowed\u201d application of Florida\u2019s attempt statute confirms the fact that \u201c[m]ere preparation is not enough\u201d to sustain a conviction for attempted burglary in Florida. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, and contrary to Peters\u2019s argument on appeal, it is clear from the Tennessee case law that mere preparation would not have been enough to sustain a conviction for attempted second degree burglary in 1981. <em>See Dupuy, </em>325 S.W.2d at 239 (\u201cA mere preparation is not enough.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 240 (\u201cFor example the procurement by a prisoner of tools adapted to breaking jail does not render him guilty of an attempt to break jail.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">We think that the \u201cheightened standard,\u201d <em>James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594, used by Florida courts to apply the overt act requirement of Florida\u2019s attempt statute in the burglary context is materially indistinguishable from the \u201cvery narro[w],\u201d <em>Reeves, </em>916 S.W.2d at 911, construction given to the overt act requirement by Tennessee courts at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction. In Florida, to be convicted of attempted burglary, a defendant must engage in some conduct \u201cdirected toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance.\u201d <em>James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594. This formulation of the rule is, in our view, merely another way of stating, in the burglary context, the overt act standard applied by Tennessee courts at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction. At that time, to be convicted of attempted burglary in Tennessee, a defendant must have been in such close proximity to the targeted structure that the \u201ccommission of the [burglary] [would have been] at least apparently possible to the reasonable apprehension of [the] accused.\u201d <em>Dupuy, </em>325 S.W.2d at 240. Stated differently, it is inconceivable to think that, under Tennessee law, a burglary could have been \u201capparently possible to the ... accused\u201d unless the accused had engaged in some conduct substantially similar to that required under Florida law \u2014 conduct found by the Court in <em>James </em>to pose a serious potential risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">Our reading of Tennessee law is consistent with the conclusion reached by the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States v. Bureau, </em>52 F.3d 584 (6th Cir.1995), in which the court was faced with the exact same question presented in this appeal. There, the court surveyed \u201caffirmed convictions for attempted burglary in Tennessee, under both \u00a7 39-603 and its replacement\u201d and concluded \u201cthat a defendant convicted of this crime likely <em>entered or nearly entered a building.\u201d Bureau, </em>52 F.3d at 592 (emphasis added). On the basis of that survey, which confirms <em>Dupuy\u2019s </em>restrictive interpretation of the overt act requirement, the Sixth Circuit in <em>Bureau </em>determined that attempted burglary, as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>by pre-1989 Tennessee law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> constitutes as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA\u2019s residual provision for crimes that \u201cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see Bureau, </em>52 F.3d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Our reading of Tennessee law in this respect is also supported by <em>James, </em>in which the Supreme Court identified the Sixth Circuit \u2014 specifically, its decision in <em>Bureau </em>\u2014 as one of seven Courts of Appeal that \u201chas construed an attempted burglary law <em>similar in scope to Florida\u2019s.\u201d </em>\u2014 U.S. at - &amp; n. 3, 127 S.Ct. at 1595 &amp; n. 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>James </em>concluded that attempted burglary under Florida law is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual provision of ACCA\u2019s clause (ii) because, as narrowly construed by the Florida courts, it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Having determined that attempted second degree burglary, as defined by pre-1989 Tennessee case law, is materially indistinguishable from attempted burglary under Florida law, we too are bound to conclude, for the reasons stated by the Supreme Court in <em>James, </em>that Peters\u2019s 1981 conviction for attempted second degree burglary is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual provision of clause (ii). <em>See James, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Peters\u2019s 180-month sentence is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-10\">. Peters does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that his other two felonies constituted \u201cviolent felonfies]\u201d under ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. Although Peters does not so argue in this appeal, we note that the Court in <em>James </em>rejected the argument that attempt crimes are categorically excluded from the scope of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) 's residual provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b981-10\">. In 1989, Tennessee\u2019s general attempt statute, \u00a7 39-603, was replaced with a substantive attempt statute, \u00a7 39-12-101, which displaces the judicially imposed \"overt act\u201d requirement in favor of a statutorily imposed \"substantial step\u201d requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b981-16\">. <em>See James, </em>- U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 1594 (noting the breadth of the virtually identical language used in Florida\u2019s attempt statute \u2014 requiring \"any act toward the commission\u201d of burglary).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b983-14\">. The court in <em>Bureau </em>also surveyed affirmed attempted burglary convictions under the post-1989, \"substantial step\u201d attempt statute, but we are not concerned with those cases because our focus is necessarily constrained to the law as it existed at the time of Peters\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
