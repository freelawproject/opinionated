Hegmon appeals his seventy-eight month sentence the district court imposed after Hegmon pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of distribution of a quantity of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>In post-Booker<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sentencing, district courts must calculate the appropriate Guidelines range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">On appeal, Hegmon contends that the district court erroneously calculated his advisory Guideline range by attributing to him a quantity of drugs and possession of a firearm that were not admitted as a part of his guilty plea. However, a sentencing court treating the Guidelines as advisory continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Hegmon also contends that the presumption of reasonableness this court affords <em>post-Booker </em>sentences that are within a properly calculated Guidelines range is unconstitutional. A plethora of circuit precedent forecloses this argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), petition for cert. filed, \u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because one panel of this court cannot overrule another, we decline Hegmon\u2019s invitation to ignore established circuit authority. <em>See United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346-47 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">Finally, Hegmon asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because it is it greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). A defendant can only rebut the presumption a properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable \u201cby demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural and substantive reasons. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable, for example, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons.... A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court relies on an improper factor or rejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-22\">Hegmon\u2019s seventy-eight month sentence is presumptively reasonable because it is within both the properly calculated Guidelines range and the applicable statutory maximum. Moreover, the record reflects that the district court complied with \u00a7 3553(a), and explicitly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, Hegmon\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-23\"> <em>United States v.
