The alleged victim and Kelley both testified at the supervised release revocation hearing, as did Kelley\u2019s pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ported sister-in-law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who testified Kelley was at her residence on the date of the incident, and the girlfriend of Kelley\u2019s brother, who testified the victim indicated she was \u201cjumped\u201d by \u201ca group of girls.\u201d Although the district court remarked the victim\u2019s testimony contained inconsistencies when compared to her previous statements to police, the court found the victim\u2019s testimony was more credible than the accounts claiming Kelley was not involved in her assault. Finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Kelley violated the terms of supervised release, the court sentenced Kelley to two years\u2019 imprisonment <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with no further supervised release, and Kelley appealed. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). Factual determinations informing the conclusion that a violation occurred are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On appeal, Kelley assails the district court\u2019s credibility determination and characterizes the victim\u2019s testimony as inherently incredible. However, we decline to second-guess the factfinder\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Whalen, </em>82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir.1996) (finding district court\u2019s credibility determinations concerning evidence presented at supervised release revocation hearing not reviewable on appeal). Thus, we do not disturb the district court\u2019s credibility determinations on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Kelley also contends the victim\u2019s testimony cannot serve as the basis for finding Kelley violated his supervised release because the testimony was uncorroborated. The uncorroborated testimony of one witness may be sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997). Furthermore, after thoroughly reviewing the evidence and testimony before the district court, we find the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. We conclude the Government proved Kelley\u2019s violation by a preponderance of the evidence and the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Kelley\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\">. For his underlying offense, Kelley pled guilty to making false statements in an application for a passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542 (2000), and a federal district court sentenced Kelley to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">. The witness was not in fact Kelley\u2019s sister-in-law, even though Kelley and the witness both represented to the probation officer that she was. Instead, her husband\u2019s father assisted in raising Kelley, though Kelley was not blood-related to the witness' husband\u2019s father and Kelley did not have this individual listed as a relative in his presentence report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-14\">. On appeal, Kelley does not contend the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
