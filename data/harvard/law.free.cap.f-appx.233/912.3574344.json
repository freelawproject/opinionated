For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">In November 2002, Baxter was charged in a seven-count indictment with distributing at least five grams of crack cocaine on August 21, 2002 (Count 1); distributing at least five grams of crack cocaine on August 29, 2002 (Count 2); maintaining premises located at 2645 N.W. 21st Avenue, Oakland Park, Florida, for the purpose of distributing crack cocaine from approximately August 21, 2002 to October 9, 2002 (Count 3); possessing with the intent to distribute at least five grams of crack cocaine on October 9, 2002 (Count 4); possessing with the intent to distribute cocaine on October 9, 2002 (Count 5); being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count 6); and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime (Count 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Before trial, Baxter twice moved to suppress the evidence seized during an October 9, 2002 search of his residence, located at 2465 N.W. 21st Avenue in Oakland Park, Florida. During the search, law enforcement agents seized, <em>inter alia, </em>one-half kilograms of powder cocaine, a crack-cocaine cookie weighing 24.1 grams, and a loaded revolver. In both of his motions, Baxter focused primarily on the following statements from Crawford\u2019s warrant affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>On August 21, 2002, [BAXTER] sold approximately 15 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover DEA Special Agent (hereinafter \u201cundercover agent\u201d) in a public area immediately adjacent to 2645 N.W. 21st Avenue, Oakland Park, Florida....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\">On August 29, 2002, [BAXTER] sold approximately 40 grams of crack cocaine to the undercover agent. [Baxter] supplied the crack cocaine purchased by the undercover agent to a confidential source inside the target location [2645 N.W. 21st Avenue]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">According to Broward County property records, 2645 N.W. 21st Avenue, Oakland Park, Florida is owned by J.V. BAXTER and Lillian BAXTER. On September 18, 2002, the U.S. Postal Service indicated that [BAXTER] receives U.S. mail at the target residence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-6\">On October 3, 2002, BAXTER was contacted at the target location and agreed to sellj\u00e9 kilogram of cocaine hydrochloride (powder) to the undercover agent. Arrangements were made to obtain the cocaine from BAXTER on Wednesday, October 9, 2002. BAXTER agreed that the sale would take place at a location other than the target residence because the undercover agent felt uncomfortable bringing a large amount of cash ($13,000) to the area around 2645 N.W. 21st Ave., Oakland Park, Florida. BAXTER was not told exactly where the sale would take place. Although the location has not been finalized, BAXTER indicated that he would be ready to complete the transaction on Wednesday, October 9, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In his first motion, Baxter alleged that the facts in the warrant affidavit were stale, because the cocaine sales on August 21st and August 29th did not provide probable cause to search his residence some six weeks later on October 9th. In Baxter\u2019s second motion, he alleged that Crawford made materially false statements in the affidavit, for example, falsely stating that Baxter had taken a call from an undercover agent \u201cat his apartment\u201d on October 3rd. Following suppression hearings, the magistrate judge denied both motions. After a five-day jury trial, Baxter was convicted of Counts 1 and 5, but was acquitted of the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Baxter appealed his convictions to this court, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>the denial of his motion to suppress on the grounds that the Government submitted stale information and false statements in support of the probable cause affidavit. In an unpublished opinion, this court affirmed Baxter\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Baxter, </em>03-16578, 127 Fed.Appx. 471 (11th Cir. Jan. 4), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds by </em>544 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 1994, 161 L.Ed.2d 847 (2005) <em>(\u2018Baxter </em>I\u201d). In so holding, we concluded that the alleged misstatements \u201cwere immaterial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also concluded that the information about Baxter\u2019s August 2002 cocaine sales at his residence established the ongoing nature of his criminal enterprise, so that those sales, coupled with Baxter\u2019s October 3rd agreement to sell cocaine to an undercover agent, supported a finding of probable cause. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that the facts underlying the probable cause determination were not stale. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">In November 2005, Baxter, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a <em>Bivens </em>action against Crawford, alleging that Crawford had violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights by intentionally misleading a federal magistrate into issuing a warrant on October 8, 2002 to search his residence. Baxter conceded that he had sold cocaine to a government informant on August 21st and August 29th at his 2645 N.W. 21st Avenue residence. According to Baxter, however, these August cocaine sales were too re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>mote in time to provide probable cause to search for \u201ccontraband\u201d at his residence on October 9th, some six weeks later. He also alleged that he never had a conversation with a government agent on October 3rd and that Crawford\u2019s misrepresentation on this point was material because without it, there would not have been probable cause to issue the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">After performing the required screening under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2), the magistrate judge liberally construed Baxter\u2019s complaint as alleging Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations. The magistrate also concluded that Baxter\u2019s claims were not foreclosed under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because even if Baxter succeeded on his claims, his \u201cconviction might still be valid due to the doctrines of inevitable discovery, independent source, and harmless error.\u201d The district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s prehminary determination and allowed the suit to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Crawford filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the claims were vague and conclusory; he was entitled to qualified immunity; the claims were iTec/c-barred; and the claims were barred by res judicata because they had been litigated during Baxter\u2019s criminal trial and on direct appeal of his conviction. The magistrate judge converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, and informed Baxter of his right to respond to Crawford\u2019s motion. Baxter filed a response to the motion, and Baxter filed a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court grant summary judgment in favor of Crawford on the grounds that Baxter\u2019s claims were Nec/c-barred. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and granted summary judgment in favor of Crawford. Baxter then filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. Baxter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">On appeal, Baxter argues that the grant of summary judgment to Crawford was improper because the district court erred in finding that his claims were precluded under <em>Heck. </em>\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts \u2014 as supported by the evidence in the record \u2014 and reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">Under <em>Heck, </em>a prisoner may not bring a damages action under <em>Bivens </em>if a judgment in the prisoner\u2019s favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that <em>Heck </em>applies both to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions filed by state prisoners and <em>Bivens </em>actions filed by federal prisoners). Thus, unless the prisoner can demonstrate that his conviction or sentence has already been invalidated, his complaint must be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>missed. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. But when \u201cthe [prisoner\u2019s] action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against [him], the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372-73 (emphasis in original, footnotes omitted). For example, \u201c[b]e-cause an illegal search or arrest may be followed by a valid conviction, a successful <em>[Bivens </em>] action for Fourth Amendment search and seizure violations does not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction. As a result, <em>Heck </em>does not <em>generally </em>bar such claims.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citations and footnote omitted, emphasis added). Nevertheless, <em>not all </em>Fourth Amendment claims fit this exception to <em>Heck, </em>rather, courts \u201cmust look both to the claims raised ... <em>and </em>to the specific offenses for which the ... claimant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1160 n. 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Here, Baxter contends that his claims relate only to conduct for which he was acquitted so that success on his claims would not necessarily call into question the validity of his convictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">First, Baxter\u2019s assertion that his complaint relates only to conduct for which he was acquitted is incorrect, as the cocaine seized during the search of 2645 N.W. 21st Avenue \u2014 the search conducted pursuant to the warrant Baxter challenges in the instant action \u2014 served as the basis for his conviction on Count 5 (possessing with the intent to distribute cocaine on October 9, 2002). Second, the factual basis for Baxter\u2019s claims in the instant action directly impugns his conviction on Count 5. As stated above, in affirming Baxter\u2019s conviction on Count 5, this court expressly rejected Baxter\u2019s assertions that the information in the warrant affidavit was stale and that Crawford had made material misrepresentations. <em>Baxter I, </em>03-16578. We concluded that the information contained in the affidavit regarding Baxter\u2019s cocaine sales at his residence in August 2002, coupled with his October 3rd agreement to sell cocaine to an undercover agent, supported a finding of probable cause to search his residence on October 9th. Hence, without the information regarding Baxter\u2019s August 2002 cocaine sales (which Baxter challenges as stale) and Crawford\u2019s assertions regarding Baxter\u2019s conversation with the undercover agent (which Baxter challenges as materially false), there would have been <em>no </em>probable cause to search his residence on October 9th, and the challenged search warrant would not have been issued. But for the execution of the search warrant, however, the cocaine at issue in Count 5 would not have been seized from Baxter\u2019s residence, and therefore, Baxter\u2019s conviction on Count 5 could not stand. As such, if Baxter were to succeed on his claims in the instant action, he would necessarily call into question the validity of his conviction on Count 5. Thus, although a Fourth Amendment claim of improper search and seizure does not necessarily undermine a conviction, <em>see Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160, the factual basis for <em>Baxter\u2019s </em>claims <em>does </em>necessarily undermine <em>his </em>conviction. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court properly found that Baxter\u2019s claims are Heck-barred, and the grant of summary judgment to Crawford was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Fed.
