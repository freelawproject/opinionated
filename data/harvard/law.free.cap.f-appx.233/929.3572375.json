He argues that the BIA failed to make an adverse credibility finding, and his credible testimony was sufficient, without corroboration, to establish eligibility for relief. Lin further asserts that the BIA erred in its determination that he could not qualify as a \u201cspouse\u201d under INA \u00a7 101(a)(42), because he was not \u201clegally\u201d married. Moreover, Lin contends, the BIA did not sufficiently explain how he had not qualified for relief based on \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s coercive population control measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-19\">Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) decision, so we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Arboleda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1222 (11th Cir.2006). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). In addition, \u201c[w]e review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo,\u201d </em>and apply the test set forth in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See Usmani v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 1147, 1149 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, if the intent of Congress is unclear, and a \u201cstatute is ambiguous,\u201d we will defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>BIA\u2019s construction is reasonable and, thus, controls, if it is not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A, Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will \u201caffirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weighting] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA or IJ must make an \u201cexplicit\u201d credibility determination. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General both have the discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (as amended by the REAL ID Act). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap1\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor, in this case political opinion, will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. An alien may establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing that: (1) he fears persecution based on his membership in a protected group; (2) there is a reasonable possibility that he will suffer persecution if removed to his native country; and (3) he could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect relocation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2), (3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">The INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See INA \u00a7 </em>101(a)(42). It does provide, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-11\">For purposes of determinations under this chapter, a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). The BIA has held that an act of persecution in the form of forced sterilization or abortion against one\u2019s spouse can be imputed to the other spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>to establish past persecution. <em>Matter of C-Y-Z, </em>211 &amp; N Dec. 915, 918 (BIA 1997). The BIA has further explained, however, that the imputed protections do not extend to unmarried couples, but instead, only to individuals who are legally married. <em>Matter of S-L-L, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 1, 4 (BIA 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">According to the BIA, if an unmarried applicant asserts persecution based on his partner\u2019s forced abortion, the applicant must demonstrate \u201cthat he or she qualifies under the terms of the \u201cother resistance\u201d clause in section 101(a)(42).\u201d <em>Matter of SL-L, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. at 4. To do so, the applicant must demonstrate resistance, and \u201cthat he has suffered harm amounting to persecution on account of that resistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. The BIA has further explained that, \u201c[i]n the context of coercive family planning, the term \u2018resistance\u2019 covers a wide range of circumstances, including expressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases, and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of the family planing law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Along with seeking asylum, the alien also may seek withholding of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). One significant difference between proving asylum eligibility and withholding of removal eligibility is that, to merit the latter, the alien must prove that future persecution would occur \u201cmore-likely-than-not.\u201d <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). As the more-likely-than-not standard that applies to withholding of removal is more stringent than the well-founded-fear standard that applies to asylum, ineligibility for asylum generally precludes withholding of removal eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">In addition, the alien may seek relief under the CAT if the applicant establishes that he more likely than not would be tortured if he returned to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). As with withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant who cannot establish asylum eligibility usually cannot establish CAT eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Accepting Lin\u2019s allegations as true, nonetheless, we conclude from the record that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Lin failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. First, the BIA\u2019s interpretation relating to the who qualifies as a \u201cspouse\u201d under INA \u00a7 101(a)(42) is subject to our deference because Congress\u2019 intent is not clear from the language itself, and there is no indication that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable. <em>See Usmani, </em>483 F.3d at 1149; <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. As such, Lin\u2019s assertion that his girlfriend was forced to undergo an abortion does not in and of itself demonstrate that Lin was persecuted because undisputed evidence in the record shows that Lin was not \u201clegally\u201d married to his girlfriend. <em>See Matter of S-L-L, </em>24 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Moreover, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Lin failed to qualify for asylum under the \u201cother resistance\u201d clause of \u00a7 101(a)(42), because Lin failed to present any evidence tending to establish resistance to China\u2019s family-planning policy. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42); <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286; <em>Matter of S-L-L, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. at 10. Because Lin has failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, it necessarily follows that his claim for withholding of removal also fails. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93. In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Lin failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief because he presented no evidence suggesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>the possibility of torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. Accordingly, we deny Lin\u2019s petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
