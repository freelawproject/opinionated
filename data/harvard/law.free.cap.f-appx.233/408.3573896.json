Specifically, she contends that she would be denied employment and educational opportunities because she is a \u201cwesternized woman\u201d and fears that she \u201cmight\u201d be forced to marry instead of al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>lowed to pursue an education if she is removed to India.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The Immigration Judge (IJ) found that although Tailor presented a credible application for relief, she failed to establish her burden of showing that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted based upon her membership in a particular group. In finding that Tailor was not entitled to withholding of removal, the IJ concluded that he was \u201cunaware of any law relating to gender based discrimination in education and employment that qualifies one for asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d Tailor failed to address or challenge this finding before the BIA, or in her brief in support of her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Because Tailor has failed to address this finding, which is critical to a determination of her entitlement to relief under section 1231, she has waived any challenge to that finding. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, 809 </em>F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Accordingly, Tailor\u2019s petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\">. The only evidence that such a marriage might occur is Tailor\u2019s testimony that all her female relatives living in India had had arranged marriages; there is no evidence any of them (or anyone else) intended or were planning to arrange a marriage for Tailor. And, Tailor testified she did not think she would have anything to fear if she refused to marry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-26\">. We also note that the IJ (and BIA) found that the \"discrimination\u201d Tailor (who had never been subject to any past persecution) would likely face in India would not \"amount to persecution\u201d so as to entitle her to withholding of removal under the INA. The record does not compel a contrary conclusion or finding. <em>See, e.g., Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187 n. 4, 188 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
