Tahsoh seeks review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that denied her motion to reopen deportation proceedings. In August 2000 an Immigration Judge (IJ) determined that Tahsoh was removable, and the BIA affirmed that decision in July 2003. In October 2003 Tahsoh filed her first motion to reopen, which the BIA denied. In July 2005 Tahsoh filed her second motion to reopen, which the BIA denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Tahsoh\u2019s petition for review, filed October 3, 2005, is timely only as to the BIA\u2019s September 2, 2005, denial of her second motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Zhang v. INS, </em>348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir.2003). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, 404 </em>F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The BIA denied Tahsoh\u2019s second motion to reopen as numerically barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Tahsoh asserts that she met the legal threshold for a motion to reopen because hers was based on changed circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Tahsoh asserts that she filed an asylum application with her second motion to reopen. However, this assertion is belied by the record. The regulations require that \u201c[a] motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Tahsoh makes no argument that her motion <em>to </em>reopen, based loosely on changed country circumstances but unaccompanied by an asylum application, falls within \u00a7 1003(c)(2)(ii)\u2019s exception to the numeric limitation of \u00a7 1003(c)(2). She has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion by denying her second motion to reopen as numerically barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">Tahsoh\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
