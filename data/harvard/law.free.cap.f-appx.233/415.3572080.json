We have reviewed with care the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, and have considered with equal care the memorandum opinion and order granting motions for summary judgment likewise signed by the district court on December 20, 2006. Based on our consideration of the material facts, which are not in genuine dispute, and the law applicable to the actions filed by Plaintiffs-Appellants herein, we affirm judgment of the district court dismissing all claims with prejudice. In light of our ruling, we deny as moot the motion of Defendants-Appellees Latter &amp; Blum, Virginia McCoy, Marjorie Schroeder, and Stephanie McConnell to be dismissed as defendants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Atr\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
