She contends that the sentencing evidence, as set forth in the Presentence Report (PSR), was inadequate to establish the loss figure and was based on unsupported assertions by an ATF Agent, S. Whittaker. Fisk also argues that the district court erred by counting legitimate portions of insurance claims as loss amounts, instead of counting only those portions of claims that were deemed to be fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"AWjj\">A sentence imposed in the advent of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), will generally be affirmed if it is \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 517-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). After <em>Booker, </em>we still review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 389 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">\u201c \u2018Actual loss\u2019 means the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i)). \u201cThe court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence. For this reason, the court\u2019s loss determination is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tied to appropriate deference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(c)). \u201cIn resolving any dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a), p.s. \u201cA district court \u2018may adopt the facts contained in a[PSR] without further inquiry if those facts have an adequate evidentiary basis with sufficient indicia of reliability and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence or otherwise demonstrate that the information in the PSR is unreliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 456, 166 L.Ed.2d 310 (2006). When a district court relies on such PSR information, the defendant has the burden to show that it is materially untrue. <em>Id.; see </em>\u00a7 6A1.3, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In arriving at the loss figure in Fisk\u2019s case, the district court reasoned that the Government discharged its burden of proof by showing that at least some portion of each of 10 insurance claims by Fisk was fraudulent. The court indicated that the burden then shifted to Fisk to show that certain portions of each insurance claim was legitimate, but Fisk submitted no evidence to make such a showing. The court\u2019s reasoning was sound, because an insured party generally is not entitled to benefit from an insurance contract when that party has inflated or exaggerated his claims or has otherwise engaged in fraud. <em>See, e.g., Chaachou v. American Century Ins. Co., </em>241 F.2d 889, 892 (5th Cir.1957); <em>Kulubis v. Texas Farm Bureau Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>706 S.W.2d 953, 955 (Tex.1986); <em>see also </em>Tex. Ins.Code \u00a7 551.104(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Fisk\u2019s assertions that the loss figure was supported only by the conclusional assertions of Agent Whittaker is contradicted by the record. Whittaker\u2019s report of Fisk\u2019s history of insurance fraud was painstakingly thorough and was based both on documents seized from Fisk\u2019s homes and through grand-jury subpoenas and on interviews with named and unnamed witnesses. The information was more than sufficient to warrant the loss calculation. <em>See Valdez, </em>453 F.3d at 262; <em>United States v. Gracia, </em>983 F.2d 625, 629-30 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Fisk also contends that the district court erred in applying a two-level increase through an arson \u201ccross-reference\u201d in the fraud guideline. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.4(a)(3). This increase was based on a determination that Fisk had committed arson with respect to a storage shed that burned on January 28, 2001, a fire for which Fisk had filed an insurance claim. Fisk argues that the sentencing information was insufficient to show that she committed arson. She is incorrect. The PSR showed that the January 2001 storage-shed was very similar to a July 1999 fire at another storage shed rented by Fisk; that investigations of each could not rule out arson as a cause; that, after both fires, Fisk allegedly discarded destroyed items before the insurance agent arrived; that the loss claims after both fires was based at least partially on fraudulent and altered receipts; that Fisk\u2019s property policy was set to expire only two weeks after the January 28, 2001 fire; that at least one named witness testified that Fisk had told him that she started a fire in one of her houses and solicited him to start a fire in another of her residences. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that this circumstantial evidence supported a determination that Fisk start<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ed the January 28, 2001 fire. <em>See Lewis, </em>476 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The January 28, 2001 arson fire was at least arguably part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d to commit insurance fraud, as set forth in the indictment counts. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(a)(1)(A) and (2), (c)(2); \u00a7 2K1.4(a)(3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.9). The 2001 fire reflected a \u201ccommon purpose\u201d and \u201csimilar <em>modus operandi </em>\u201d to the 1999 storage-shed fire and two subsequent fires at Fisk\u2019s homes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A)). Because the guidelines require that an amount-of-loss calculation should be \u201cgrouped,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d), the district court did not err in concluding that the arson cross-reference applied in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
