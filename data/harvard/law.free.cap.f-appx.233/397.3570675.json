We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">1. We will not disturb the district court\u2019s credibility finding with respect to the officers\u2019 testimony of an ongoing investigation into White\u2019s suspected drug trafficking. <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cthis court reviews factual findings, including credibility choices, for clear error ... Where a district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion is based on live oral testimony, the clearly erroneous standard is particularly strong because the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">2. Viewed as a drug investigation, the brief detention necessary to satisfy a canine\u2019s olfactory curiosity was not unreasonable. <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 511 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (\u201cThere is, however, no constitutional stopwatch on traffic stops. Instead, the relevant question in assessing whether a detention extends beyond a reasonable duration is whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). The officers testified at the suppression hearing that when White\u2019s visitors began to disperse from his house, Deputy Ungles was instructed to follow White\u2019s truck and establish probable cause if possible. Ungles did just that, and when Ungles determined that White was in fact in the truck, Deputies MeCowen and McNeely arrived at the scene with the canine. Regardless of the precise order of the return of the computer checks and the request for consent to search \u2014 which when denied led the officers to walk the canine around the truck \u2014 the record is clear that any residual delay was far short of what we could call unreasonable in light of the officers\u2019 ongoing investigation into suspected drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">3. There being no constitutional violation in the course of the traffic stop, the subsequent search of White\u2019s home was not tainted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
