The claim is that prison officials retaliated against Murry after she filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) complaint. She had previously received \u201cOutstanding\u201d employee evaluations, but after she filed the EEO complaint, her evaluations were lower. In addition, she was temporarily transferred from her position \u2014 as cook supervisor at the low security facility of the Federal Correctional Complex at Coleman, Florida \u2014 to the institution warehouse. She was also required to submit to psychological and physical fitness-for-duty examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-23\">Title VII prohibits discrimination with respect to an employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Title VII\u2019s retaliation provisions also protect certain kinds of activity. <em>EEOC v. Total Sys. Sews., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2000). Under the \u201copposition clause,\u201d an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee \u201chas opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Similarly, under the \u201cparticipation clause,\u201d an employer may not retaliate against an employee because the employee \u201chas made a charge, testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>f\u00eded, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">\u201c[T]o establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) she participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Gupta v. Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir.2000). A plaintiff can show participation in a protected activity by demonstrating that she had a subjective, good-faith belief that her employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices and that her belief was objectively reasonable in light of the facts and record presented. <em>Little v. United Techs. Carrier Transicold Div., </em>103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">\u201cTo establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Gupta, </em>212 F.3d at 590 (internal citation omitted). \u201cDiscrimination is about actual knowledge, and real intent, not constructive knowledge and assumed intent. When evaluating a charge of employment discrimination, then, we must focus on the actual knowledge and actions of the decision-maker.\u201d <em>Walker v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>286 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2002) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Once a <em>prima facie </em>case is established, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption of retaliation by producing legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action. <em>Sullivan v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>170 F.3d 1056, 1059 (11th Cir.1999). If the employer offers legitimate reasons, the presumption of retaliation disappears. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff must then show that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons for taking the adverse action were actually a pretext for prohibited retaliatory conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The district court committed no error in granting summary judgment because Murry did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. Only her temporary transfer to the institutional warehouse and compulsory fitness-for-duty examinations arguably constituted adverse employment actions. However, she did not establish a causal connection between the filing of her initial EEO complaint and the adverse employment actions. Moreover, the Attorney General established legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for her transfer and fitness-for-duty examinations. Based on Murry\u2019s outbursts and in light of her statements regarding her brain tumor, the warden was legitimately concerned that she could no longer perform her job duties. Murry failed to offer any evidence to show that the Attorney General\u2019s stated reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
