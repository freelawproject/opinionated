We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-24\">Huang seeks to challenge the Board\u2019s denial of asylum based on its finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>he failed to timely file his application within one year of his arrival in the United States. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000). We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review this determination and the Board\u2019s denial of asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8) (2000). <em>See Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 747-48 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the Board\u2019s ruling on the asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2006). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To obtain relief under the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We accord broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). We will uphold the final agency determination if it is not \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determinations that Huang failed to meet his burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
