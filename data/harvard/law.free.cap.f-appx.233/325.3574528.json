We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Barry\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (b) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Barry, </em>No. A96-085139 (B.I.A. June. 6, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
