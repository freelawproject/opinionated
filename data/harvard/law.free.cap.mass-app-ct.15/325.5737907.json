Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>369 Mass. 535 (1976), certain of the plaintiffs in that case filed a complaint in the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) in which they charged the plaintiffs herein (plaintiffs) and others with a variety of monopolistic practices and by which they sought (among other relief) revocation of the licenses to operate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tail liquor stores which had been issued to most of the plaintiffs under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15. Following fifteen days of hearings conducted by its then chairman, the commission, acting by the chairman and one of its other then members (Vernon R. Farnsworth, Jr.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rendered a decision adverse to the plaintiffs. They seasonably sought review in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">A judge of that court, acting on the basis of evidence that was put before him by agreement of the parties, found that there had been unauthorized ex parte communications between Farnsworth and special counsel to the commission (Mr. Harold Kowal) on the one hand and counsel for the complainants (Mr. Harold Hestnes) on the other in the course of which \u201cFarnsworth and Kowal provided Hestnes with [a] file [of documents which Farnsworth had obtained from a private source] knowing that it contained information which the complainants did not possess and knowing that the information would help them substantiate their allegations .... Neither Farnsworth nor Kowal ever notified [the plaintiffs] of their ex parte contact with Hestnes, nor did they give notice that Farnsworth had obtained the file . . . and turned it over to the complainants . . . .\u201d \u201c[T]he plaintiffs learned about Farnsworth\u2019s ex parte contact with Hestnes and his provision of the documents to the complainants\u201d \u201c[t]wo days before the scheduled . . . adjudicatory hearing date.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The judge struck the commission\u2019s findings, rulings and order, and remanded the case to the commission (the membership of which had completely changed) for the formulation of entirely new findings and rulings. The order of remand provided that the commission could render its new decision on the basis of the evidence that had already been introduced at the public hearing, together with such new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>evidence as the commission might choose to take.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have appealed, confining their arguments to the proposition that compliance with the mechanics of the order of remand would result in depriving the plaintiffs of procedural due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither the commission nor the intervener has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The order of remand is purely interlocutory so far as the plaintiffs are concerned. Compare <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>372 Mass. 469, 475-476 (1977); <em>Brooksbank </em>v. <em>Epstein, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 377, 378 (1977). The commission points to instances in which we have responded to the traditional abhorrence of piecemeal appellate review (see <em>Pollack, </em>at 470-472 by dismissing appeals from interlocutory orders of remand (see, e.g., <em>Roberts-Haverhill Associates </em>v. <em>City Council of Haverhill, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 715, 719-720 [1974]; <em>Politano </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Nahant, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 739-740, 746 [1981]) and tempts us to follow that course here. The plaintiffs point to the provisions of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and urge us to resist the temptation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The conflicting contentions of the parties require us to consider the history of \u00a7 15. That section, as originally inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, read as set out in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Marlborough Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>346 Mass. 737 (1964), the court read the portion of the section which is italicized in n.7 hereof in light of the \u201cfinality\u201d stricture of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 19, as in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 62,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that an order of remand to an administrative officer for a further hearing was interlocutory in nature and would have to await an appeal from any final decree that might ultimately be entered in the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 26, as also in effect prior to St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 62. Accordingly, the appeal from the order of remand was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The plaintiffs point to the fact that G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, in its present form (n.6 hereof) no longer contains any language comparable to that which has been italicized in n.7 and would have us wish the <em>Marlborough Hosp. </em>case away as some sort of sport in the old equity practice. The difficulty with such wishful thinking is its failure to recognize the fact that the \u201cfinality\u201d concept of the old G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 19, which was repealed by St. 1973, c. 1114 (\u201cAn Act improv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ing the procedure in civil trials and appeals\u201d), \u00a7 62, immediately resurfaced in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 113, as appearing in \u00a7 202 of the same c. 1114.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We see nothing more to the 1973 amendment of \u00a7 15 than another instance of the many changes in the General Laws which were designed to accommodate the abolition of the procedural distinctions between actions at law and suits in equity which was effectuated by Mass.R.Civ.P. 2, 365 Mass. 733 (1974). See, e.g., <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Admr. of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 2 n.3 (1975); <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 46-49 (1977); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Harwich, </em>388 Mass. 42, 46 n.5, 48, 49 &amp; n.6 (1983). Compare <em>Boston Seaman's Friend Soc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>379 Mass. 414, 415-417 (1980). Indeed, a survey of the cases decided under the present \u00a7 15 discloses that the only instances in which either of our appellate courts has entertained an appeal from an order of remand to an administrative agency have been ones in which the order has included a final determination of the rights of an appellant. See <em>Cliff House Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>378 Mass. 189, 190-191 (1979); <em>Massachusetts State Pharmaceutical Assn. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>387 Mass. 122, 137-138 (1982); <em>Blue Moon Saloon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 890, 890-891 (1980).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no comparable determination of the rights of the plaintiffs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>As nothing in the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure or in the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure purports to enlarge the jurisdiction of either of the appellate courts (see Mass.R.A.P. l[b], 365 Mass. 844 [1974]; <em>Rollins Environmental Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 174, 178 [1975]), the entry is</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The third member had disqualified himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> No question has been raised as to the accuracy of any of the quoted findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> Although it is not entirely clear, the judge appears to have contemplated that the commission would follow the procedure authorized by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (7), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, for use in cases in which a majority of those who must participate in an official decision have neither heard nor read the evidence.
