We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The sole witness heard by the grand jury was James Leahy, a Braintree police officer who, in addition to what he learned from his investigation and those of fellow officers, based much of his testimony on statements made by the victim of the crime, Ralph Sassi. In summary, Leahy\u2019s account was as follows: Three men entered Sassi\u2019s apartment by forcing open the sliding glass doors of a balcony. Sassi, who is legally blind but has some slight vision, recognized the voice of one of the men as that of a cab driver for Shore Taxi whom he knew as John Smith. That driver had taken Sassi from the Quincy Square MBTA stop to his Brain-tree apartment at least seven times, and had been in his apartment on two occasions. During the course of the theft, the man whose voice Sassi recognized was addressed as John by one of the perpetrators. Among the items stolen from the apartment were receipts the cab driver had given to the victim, which had been signed \u201cJohn Smith.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Leahy\u2019s investigation took him to the offices of the Shore Taxi Company. No John Smith was employed there, but Shore Taxi had one employee with the first name, John; his last name was Francil. Through his investigation Leahy eliminated the other drivers as suspects, and satisfied himself that John Smith and John Francil were one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">On appeal the defendant urges for the first time that the grand jury failed to \u201chear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused.\u201d In so doing, he relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982), which was decided well after the instant case was tried. We consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the issue only to determine whether there has been a showing of grave prejudice or of substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 123 (1979). There was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>dealt with an absence of any evidence of criminal activity by the defendant. See also <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 572, 577 (1973). The <em>McCarthy </em>decision did not alter the established principle that when there is evidence of criminal activity by the defendant put before the grand jury, a court will not sift through that evidence to test whether it is enough or whether it is persuasive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>323 Mass. 205, 211-212 (1948). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>368 Mass. 518, 524-525 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>373 Mass. 591, 592-593 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saya, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 509, 514 (1982). As Mr. Justice Black observed in <em>Costello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 359, 363 (1956), \u201cIf indictments were to be held open to challenge on the ground that there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury, the resulting delay would be great indeed.\u201d Compare Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 340.5 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In this case the grand jury heard evidence which, at the least, wove a thread of identification around the defendant. The police officer had testified that: save for the defendant, he had eliminated as suspects all the drivers on Shore Taxi\u2019s roster; the only driver named \u201cJohn\u201d whom Shore Taxi employed was the defendant; and the victim, during the course of the break into his apartment, heard one of the three persons who broke in address as \u201cJohn\u201d the man whose voice the victim recognized as that of the taxi driver. It was not a defect in the evidence presented to the grand jury that a fair portion of it was hearsay. Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(c), 378 Mass. 849 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 654-657 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>2. <em>Integrity of the Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Based on the series of questions and answers set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant moved that the indictment ought to be dismissed because the integrity of the grand jury proceeding had been impaired. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gib</em>son, 368 Mass. at 525. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the proceedings became tainted because Officer Leahy\u2019s answers to the grand jury were inaccurate and misleading and that the stain deepened when the prosecutor failed to correct the inaccuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">After hearing, the trial judge found that the officer\u2019s testimony \u201cwas an honest presentation of his views and opinions held, based upon substantive evidence and facts that he had discovered and was privy to during the course of his investigation.\u201d Furthermore, the judge found \u201cthat there was no intent on the part of this officer to mislead the grand jury\u201d and concluded that \u201cas a result of [the officer\u2019s] testifying . . . and also by presentation . . . made by . . . the Assistant District Attorney, the integrity of the grand jury was not in any material way . . . impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Nothing in the record indicates that the witness had perjured himself on a fact material to the indictment, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Basurto, </em>497 F.2d 781, 785 (9th Cir. 1974), or that the assistant district attorney had \u201cplayed an ignoble part\u201d by knowingly relying on false testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 579 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salman, </em>387 Mass. 160, 166-167 (1982). Nor is this a case where the grand jury was deceived into believing that hearsay evidence was direct testimony, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Estepa, </em>471 F.2d 1132, 1137 (2d Cir. 1972), or where the decision whether to indict would likely have been different had first-hand testimony been presented. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salman, supra. United States </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>478 F.2d 408, 410-411 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Aleman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>414 U.S. 910 (1973). Rather, a single answer was ambiguous in an otherwise unremarkable presentation of the evidence. Given Leahy\u2019s candid response that the victim Sassi had not made the link between Smith and Francil, it is unlikely the jurors understood Leahy\u2019s testimony as indicating more than that during the course of the theft Sassi had identified a taxi driver known to him as John Smith. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>368 Mass. 281, 283-284 (1975), where a similar ambiguous statement concerning identification was not found to undermine the integrity of the grand jury process. Neither was it considered negligent when the prosecutor failed \u201cinstantly to perceive and correct the possible mistake or ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284. We are of opinion that the integrity of the grand jury process was not impaired and that there was no basis for defendant\u2019s request that the indictment be dismissed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>368 Mass. at 525. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McJunkin, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 609, 612-614 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">3. <em>Deprivation of Counsel of Choice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">After the indictment was returned, defendant\u2019s first attorney of record filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, alleging that the testimony set out in note 4, <em>supra, </em>\u201cwas false, [that] the said witness knew [it] was false and [that] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the Commonwealth knew or should have known [it] was false.\u201d That motion was denied. The motion judge, however, was troubled by the assertions of official misconduct and ordered a transcript of the hearing on the motion. Upon examination of that transcript and the grand jury minutes, the judge heard counsel further and concluded that the allegations of perjury and subornation of perjury were \u201ctotally unwarranted, unjustified, reckless, vicious and totally uncalled for.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such was his displeasure that he determined to send a transcript of the second hearing to the Board of Bar Overseers, \u201cand let the transcript speak for itself.\u201d Cognizant of his strong reaction, the judge vacated his ruling on the motion to dismiss and disqualified himself so that another judge could rule on it. Six weeks later, counsel of record withdrew from the case without objection or explanation and defendant\u2019s second counsel, Mr. Kane, entered his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Defendant does not claim that Mr. Kane\u2019s representation was in any way defective;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the essence of his complaint is that the motion judge\u2019s actions created a conflict of interest which deprived him of the counsel he had retained. Although a court may not arbitrarily dismiss defendant\u2019s counsel of choice, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Laura, </em>607 F.2d 52, 55-57 (3d Cir. 1979), trying a case is not a \u201cparlor game,\u201d and counsel must be prepared to support their actions in the face of a strong reaction by the trial court. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>635 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 910 (1981). The motion judge took appropriate action to protect the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial decision on his mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tian by vacating his judgment and disqualifying himself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court left for counsel the choice of how to proceed on the motion to dismiss. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>379 Mass. 564, 574-575 (1980). See also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 14. In the absence of any impropriety by the court and the absence of objection by the defendant to his attorney\u2019s withdrawal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his complaint that he was deprived of his counsel of choice smacks of afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-16\">G.
