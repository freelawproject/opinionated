After the allowance of his motion for a required finding of not guilty as to so much of the indictment as charged murder in the first degree, he was convicted of murder in the second degree. On appeal, the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>principal argument centers on the failure of the judge to give to the jury requested instructions relating to the defendant\u2019s claim of accident. The defendant also claims that certain excesses in the closing argument of the prosecutor were such as to require a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">After reviewing the entire charge, we conclude that the judge\u2019s refusal, in the circumstances of this case, to give the proffered instructions requires that the defendant be given a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We recite only those facts which are necessary to our discussion of the judge\u2019s instructions. The defendant and the victim had been, at one time, boyfriend and girlfriend, but there was testimony that the relationship had changed and that although they still were friendly they were not as close at the time of the incident as they had been.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The victim died as a result of a single gunshot wound to the chest. She was intoxicated at the time of her death. A large amount of burnt gunpowder residue was found on her left hand. There was no eyewitness to the shooting, and the defendant did not take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The Commonwealth called the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, and she testified on direct examination that the defendant told her on the day of the incident that \u201cthere was an accident.\u201d The Commonwealth pressed her on that response, asking, \u201cAnd that is the way you want to leave it now with the jury, that that is all he said to you, that something happened.\u201d The witness replied: \u201cHe had said that he was out and that he had run into this girl [later identified as the victim] and there was an accident.\u201d On cross-examination the defendant explored further the question of accident. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Commonwealth objected to this line of cross-examination. The judge overruled the objections, noting that \u201c[s]he has already mentioned the word accident in direct examination.\u201d Earlier in the trial, the defendant, through cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses, adduced evidence from which it could have been inferred that the gun had been discharged by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">1. The defendant requested that the judge give two instructions pertaining to accident. We set out the requested instructions in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786, 790 (1980), when a claim of accident is fairly raised by the evidence, the defendant is entitled as a matter of due process, if he so requests, to an instruction that the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting was not accidental.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zezima, </em>387 Mass. 748, 756 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dilone, </em>385 Mass. 281, 287 (1982). As <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 207-208 (1981), had been decided eighteen months and six months, respectively, prior to the case at bar, \u201c[tjhere has been ample time since those cases were decided for trial judges to modify their charges on . . . evidence [of accident].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>378 Mass. 242, 245 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 421, 425 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In deciding whether an accident instruction is supported by the evidence, all reasonable inferences must be resolved in favor of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 398 (1967) (incredibility of testimony does not authorize refusal of an instruction based thereon). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Hearsay statements of the defendant, if properly admitted, have probative value and are entitled to consideration by the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>332 Mass. 687, 691 (1955). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 377 (1978) (\u201cOnce sufficient evidence is presented to warrant submission of the charges to the jury, it is for the jury alone to determine what weight will be accorded to the evidence\u201d) . An instruction may not be denied merely because the evidence comes as part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass. 123, 127 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The judge refused the defendant\u2019s requests, saying that \u201cI am under an obligation to state what. . . the positive of the government\u2019s proof must be. I am under no obligation to state what the negative is.\u201d The judge had a \u201cduty to state the applicable law to the jury clearly and correctly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcione, </em>364 Mass. 611, 618 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Godin, </em>374 Mass. 120, 130-131 (1977). Had the defendant here specifically requested a <em>LannonRobinson </em>instruction on accident, he would have been entitled to such an instruction. Having requested less \u2014 an instruction calling the jury\u2019s attention to accident \u2014 he was at least entitled to that. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 488 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The defendant made a proper objection to the judge\u2019s refusal to give his requested instructions. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), 378 Mass. 895-896 (1979). Counsel also made a proper objection after the judge had concluded his charge. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zaccagnini, </em>383 Mass. 6, 15 (1981) (counsel \u201cmade no request for an instruction on accident . . . and did not object to the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury specifically on . . . [the] subject\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The present circumstances are controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>369 Mass. 640, 644 (1976). The issue of accident was fairly and adequately raised on the evidence. Although both counsel focused on accident in their respective closing arguments, the judge did not mention the term in his charge. Viewing the instructions in their entirety, we conclude that the error here arises because of what was left unsaid. The judge\u2019s instructions on manslaughter did not fill the gap. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-233 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">2. The defendant alleges that it was error for the judge to deny his motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument. \u201c[C]ounsel may argue inferences from the evidence which are most favorable to his or her theory of the case, as long as the inferences drawn are reasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaikie, </em>375 Mass. 601, 612 (1978). We think that the prosecutor\u2019s injection of sympathy was a violation of basic fairness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>371 Mass. 13, 18-19 (1976). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 909-910 (1983). However, the judge\u2019s instructions that the jury \u201cmust find your facts from the evidence and the evidence alone\u201d and that \u201cthe jury must view the evidence objectively and dispassionately\u201d removed \u201cany taint . . . from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. We also note that the defendant, at the close of the judge\u2019s instructions, did not renew his objections, which indicates to us that his complaints had been corrected to his satisfaction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 104, 108 (1981). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 911 (\u201cIt is hardly fitting for a prosecutor to rely on curative instructions to present his case properly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The defendant also claims that the prosecutor\u2019s use of certain rhetorical questions in his closing argument \u201cwas reasonably susceptible of being interpreted as a comment on [the defendant\u2019s] failure to take the stand.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 69 (1954). It cannot be gainsaid that reference to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify at trial is improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 315 (1980). \u201cCounsel may attempt to assist the jury in analyzing evidence by presenting a comprehensive picture but may not draw any inference from the exercise of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. at 909. We stress again that closing argument requires careful preparation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 557 &amp; n.ll (1977). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 941 (1979). Prosecutors should not sail \u201cunnecessarily close to the wind.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>370 Mass. 591, 597 (1976). Here the prosecutor sought to undercut the defendant\u2019s theory of accident by questioning why the defendant failed to seek medical attention for the victim, why the defendant fled the scene, and why the defendant removed the weapon. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 323-324 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891 (1980). \u201c[U]nless a prosecutor\u2019s comments are of such a nature that a jury would naturally and necessarily construe them to be directed to the failure of the defendant to testify, they are not prejudicially unfair.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, supra </em>at 892, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armedo-Sarmiento, </em>545 F.2d 785, 793 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 917 (1977). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 355-356 (1981), and cases cited. Here the commentary on the evidence was permissible. In addition, the judge instructed the jury regarding the general principle that the defendant is not required to present evidence of his innocence. For future guidance in such circumstances, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 571-572 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>We need not address the other challenges to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, as a recurrence at retrial is unlikely. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, 387 </em>Mass. at 906-910. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 416-424 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">3. As it is likely that the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge committed error in admitting hearsay testimony that he was a pimp will arise at retrial, we address that issue briefly. \u201cEvidence of a defendant\u2019s criminal or bad conduct is ordinarily not admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, 378 </em>Mass. 116, 125 (1979). Relevant evidence, however, is not necessarily rendered inadmissible merely because it indicates that a defendant may have committed an offense other than that for which he is being tried. Yet there is ground for excluding such evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of prejudice not correctable by the good sense of the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 816 (1973). Although we think that the judge in these circumstances could properly have excluded this evidence, we cannot say that he erred in admitting the testimony. The judge reasonably could have concluded that the jury should have a view of the entire relationship between the defendant and the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981). Furthermore, the judge properly instructed the jury on the limited purpose for which they might consider this evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Germain, </em>381 Mass. 256, 270 n.25 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> We summarily reject the defendant\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of malice. See and compare, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 815 (1980), and cases cited. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion based on that contention was properly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> In an unrelated context there was testimony that at about 6:30 a.m. on the morning of the incident two Quincy police officers had observed the defendant and the victim kissing while riding in the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> \u201cAn act is \u2018knowingly\u2019 done if done voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u201cWhen a person commits an act through misfortune or by accident under circumstances that show no evil design, intention or culpable negligence, he does not thereby commit a crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b288-9\"> We have no occasion to discuss the circumstances in which a defendant might be entitled to such instruction in the absence of a request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> Generally, in self-defense and accident cases either the defendant testifies to the facts supporting the claim <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacasse, </em>365 Mass. 271 [1974]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>369 Mass. 640 [1976]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684 [1976]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583 [1978]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>374 Mass. 597 [1978] ; <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527 [1979]; <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786 [1980]; <em>Commonwealth v.
