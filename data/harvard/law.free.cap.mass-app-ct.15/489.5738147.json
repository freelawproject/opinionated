A judge of the Boston Housing Court found that the tenant had permitted her apartment to be used for the possession and the sale of illegal drugs in violation of certain clauses of her lease and that the BHA had \u201cgood cause\u201d to evict her under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32, as amended through St. 1979, c. 669, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge also concluded that even though the lease described the tenancy as \u201cfrom month to month,\u201d O\u2019Brien was not a tenant at will and the BHA was not required to terminate her tenancy on a rent day. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The tenant appeals, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">1. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The BHA owns and manages the federally-aided \u201clow income housing project,\u201d see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437(a)(b)(1), as amended by Act of August 13, 1981, Pub. L. No. 97-35, Title III, \u00a7 322(a), in which the tenant and her three children reside, specifically, apartment 52 at 15 Beechland Street. The tenancy is subject to the provisions of 24 C.F.R \u00a7 866.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>et seq., and \u00a7 866.5 et seq. (1982). Both 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 866.4(Z)(1) (1982), <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32, require cause for termination of the tenancy by the BHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">O\u2019Brien began her tenancy with the BHA at the development by a written lease dated September 1, 1976. In September of 1980, one James Harris moved into the tenant\u2019s apartment, bringing his clothing, stereo, and a three-beam metric scale. O\u2019Brien knew that Harris brought the scale and that he stored it on the top shelf of her bedroom closet. Harris had his own key to O\u2019Brien\u2019s car and apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Harris lived with the tenant from September through November, and intermittently in December, 1980. On November 21, 1980, the Boston police entered and searched O\u2019Brien\u2019s apartment under a search warrant issued by the Roxbury District Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the apartment the police found and seized 9 small bags, each containing one-half ounce of marijuana, 1 box of plastic bags, 1 roll of Scotch tape, 50 manila envelopes, a three-beam scale, and, on the grounds outside the premises, they recovered a bag containing about 128 grams of marijuana. The police arrested Harris, who was in the apartment at the time of the search; O\u2019Brien was not home.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On December 26, 1980, the BHA gave written notice to O\u2019Brien of a private conference with the manager of the development and the attorney for the BHA, on January 7, 1981, to discuss her possible lease violations, in particular: \u201c[rjent owed\u201d and \u201c[sjearch of your apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>by Boston Police Department on 11/21/80 and seizure of controlled substances and paraphernalia.\u201d The notice further informed O\u2019Brien that after the conference, the manager would decide whether to proceed with an eviction and that she could request a hearing concerning that decision \u201cunder the grievance procedure\u201d which was also explained in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">O\u2019Brien attended the January 7 conference, and she thereafter received an undated notice advising her that the BHA \u201chas decided to terminate your lease ... for the reasons set forth in the private conference notice\u201d of December 26, 1980. The grievance procedure was again described and O\u2019Brien requested a hearing. By notice dated February 10, 1981, O\u2019Brien was advised that the grievance hearing panel would hear her appeal on March 4, 1981, and determine if she had violated clauses 10(2), (5), (9), and (10) of her lease on the basis of the following facts: \u201cPossession, sale, or possession with intent to sell illegal drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hearing was held as scheduled, and the grievance hearing panel voted that same day, as appears from its decision dated March 4, 1981, to proceed with an eviction for the reason that the \u201c[t]enant admitted to drugs being sold out of her apartment.\u201d This decision was attached to a notice to quit, dated March 9, 1981, advising O\u2019Brien \u201cto quit and deliver up thirty (30) days from receipt of this notice the premises.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">At the trial in the Boston Housing Court on the BHA\u2019s summary process complaint, Boston police Detective Joseph Driscoll related that the tenant\u2019s apartment had been under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>police surveillance for a one-week period in November, 1980, and that during that period he had observed people come to the premises and leave, smoking what appeared to him as marijuana cigarettes. He also testified to the search of the tenant\u2019s apartment, the seizure of the previously described items, and the arrest of Harris.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">O\u2019Brien testified that she found Harris\u2019 marijuana in her apartment in August, before he had moved in with her, that although she never saw him sell marijuana from the apartment, she knew that he was deriving his livelihood from sales of marijuana, and that she told Harris that he had to get the marijuana out of the apartment or leave. O\u2019Brien stated that Harris had promised to do so within a week but the police arrived before he had the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\n<em>2. Cause to Evict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The tenant claims that her eviction cannot be upheld because the BHA failed to show: (1) that her actions had any particular adverse impact on other tenants; (2) that Harris was a member of her household; (3) that she had participated in or knew of drug sales in the apartment; and (4) that the BHA had a legitimate interest to further by her eviction, since her relationship with Harris ended in December, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Even assuming that the tenant is correct in her assertion that a violation of a criminal statute is not per se cause to evict, we think it obvious that use of the premises for illegal drug sales constitutes a breach of those terms of the lease cited by the BHA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See note 6, <em>supra. </em>Whether there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>cause to evict, however, depends upon Harris\u2019 status within the apartment and upon O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cawareness of and ability to prevent\u201d his activities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 265 (1982). See also <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 421 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">O\u2019Brien characterizes Harris as a \u201cshort-term co-accupant\u201d whereas the BHA describes him as a member of her household. The evidence of the circumstances and the duration of Harris\u2019 stay at O\u2019Brien\u2019s apartment was sufficient to impose upon her liability for his activities while there, if she had knowledge of and the ability to prevent them. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 266-273.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony that she knew there were drugs and drug paraphernalia in her apartment, that she knew Harris earned his money from drug sales, and that she was at home \u201cmost of the time,\u201d taken with Detective Driscoll\u2019s testimony concerning his observations during the surveillance period, could reasonably lead one to conclude that shortly after Harris moved in she knew her apartment was being used for the possession and sales of drugs by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">We do not regard O\u2019Brien\u2019s requests and demands, no matter how frequent, that Harris remove the drugs from her apartment nor her acceptance of his word that he would do so as sufficient attempts to prevent that activity which led to her eviction. Cf. <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 266 (\u201cA tenant\u2019s ability to avert violent conduct by a household member on housing authority premises, however, extends beyond the power actually to control his conduct by force or persuasion\u201d). While a tenant may be reluctant to take effective preventive action against a friend or relative, a failure to do so cannot be ignored at the expense of other tenants\u2019 rights. We see no error in the trial judge\u2019s finding that the tenant \u201cpermitted her apartment to be used for the possession and sale of illegal drugs in violation ... of her lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>O\u2019Brien argues that where, as here, the proscribed activity was committed by a person who no longer resides with the tenant, the public landlord has no interest to further by an eviction of the tenant, and good cause cannot be found to exist. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 272 (\u201cIf the wrongdoer were dead, or confined for an extended period of time, eviction would serve no purpose. If the unwanted visitor were not a household member, the likelihood that the tenant\u2019s presence would attract him to the project might be too slight to sustain the eviction. Cf. <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>New York City Hous. Auth., </em>369 F. Supp. 513, 518-519 [S.D.N.Y. 1974]\u201d). It must be remembered, however, that O\u2019Brien is in breach of the terms and conditions of her lease by reason of her knowledge and tolerance of Harris\u2019 conduct over a prolonged period of time. \u201c The element of personal responsibility encompassed by \u00a7 32 also adds to the connection between eviction and legitimate government purposes. As construed, \u00a7 32 serves to encourage tenants to attempt to guide the conduct of household members, and to seek help when they are unable to.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. at 273.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">O\u2019Brien\u2019s eviction is founded upon \u201cgood cause reasonably related to the protection of some legitimate interest of the public landlord.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">3. <em>Notice to Quit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Because the term of the lease was \u201cfrom month to month,\u201d O\u2019Brien contends that she was a tenant at will entitled to notice to quit in accordance with G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 12, which, as earlier noted, has been construed to require that termination of a tenancy at will coincide with a rent day. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s rent day is the first day of each month, she received a notice to quit on March 12, 1981, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>notice provided that she was \u201cto quit and deliver up\u201d the premises within thirty days of the receipt of the notice, i.e., by April 12, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Notwithstanding the \u201cfrom month to month\u201d language in the lease, that instrument cannot be construed as creating a tenancy at will, the distinguishing characteristic of which is that it is terminable by either the tenant <em>or </em>the landlord. See Stanisky, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 93 (1977); Schoskinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 2:16 (1980). Under the terms of the BHA lease here in dispute, the tenant may terminate the tenancy \u201cat any time by giving (15) days written notice,\u201d whereas the BHA may terminate only for cause. G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32. See <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. at 420-421. See also <em>Bogan </em>v. <em>New London Housing Authy., </em>366 F. Supp. 861, 866-868 (D. Conn. 1973). We agree with those courts and commentators who point out that the \u201cgood cause\u201d restriction on a public landlord\u2019s right to evict is inconsistent with a true tenancy at will. See e.g., <em>McQueen </em>v. <em>Druker, </em>317 F. Supp. 1122, 1129-1130 (D. Mass. 1970), aff\u2019d, 438 F.2d 781 (1st Cir. 1971). There it is said: \u201c[I]f the government must give good cause for terminating a tenancy, then, in effect, there are no longer monthly or annual leases. A tenant may remain, if not forever, at least until he misbehaves, or he becomes rich, or the government adopts general rules under which he no longer qualifies.\u201d See also Schoskinski, American Law of Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 13.4 (1980); Note, Public Landlords and Private Tenants: The Eviction of \u201cUndesirables\u201d from Public Housing Projects, 77 Yale L.J. 988, 997 n.48 (1968). Federal and State housing policy, as expressed in statutes, regulations, and recent cases interpreting them, reveals that in creating and providing for public housing, the government intended to depart from traditional concepts of the landlord-tenant relationship. If a traditional description is nonetheless necessary, we think the relationship can be aptly described as a tenancy by regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The pertinent Federal regulation, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 866.58 (1982), requires that a notice to quit \u201cbe in writing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>specify that if the tenant fails to quit the premises within the applicable statutory period, or on the termination date stated in the notice of termination, whichever is later, appropriate action will be brought against him.\u201d By the language of the present notice to quit, O\u2019Brien was to vacate the premises within thirty days of March 12, 1981, the undisputed date of receipt of the notice. There is, however, no State statute or regulation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that sets out the notice period for evictions from federally-aided public housing and which, therefore, might have entitled O\u2019Brien to vacate the premises on a date later than that provided for her in her notice. In this circumstance, we think it appropriate to apply the most analogous State law which is also consistent with the policy underlying the Federal regulation. Cf. <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 484-485 (1980); <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 60-63 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Notices to quit State-aided public housing projects are regulated by 760 Code Mass. Reg. 2.03(6) (f) (1981),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which requires that a tenant receive a \u201cwritten \u2018Notice to Vacate,\u2019 in accordance with applicable law, specifying a date of termination at least thirty (30) days after the notice is given to\u201d the tenant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If O\u2019Brien had been evicted from a State-aided housing project, she would have been entitled to a notice period of \u201cat least thirty (30) days,\u201d that which she here received. We think it sensible and consistent to hold that \u201cthe applicable statutory period\u201d under \u00a7 866.58, is the same as that provided in the analogous \u00a7 2.03(6) (f). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Thus, the trial judge correctly concluded that O\u2019Brien\u2019s tenancy did not have to end on a rent day and that she received a proper notice to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">4. <em>Adequacy of Pre-Termination Notices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">O\u2019Brien argues that she was inadequately apprised by the BHA\u2019s notices under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 866.54 and \u00a7 866.55 (1982) of what conduct it intended to review to determine whether it should commence eviction proceedings against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Assuming without deciding that each of the notices was facially deficient in some respect, we are satisfied that O\u2019Brien knew \u201cwith reasonable particularity of the proposed action so that [she could] reasonably prepare h[cr] arguments.\u201d <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>356 Mass. 467, 471 (1969). The notices, O\u2019Brien\u2019s stipulation of facts, and the whole sequence of events show that she had actual notice that the BHA wished to pursue the fact that her apartment had been searched by the police and drugs found. The facts distinguish O\u2019Brien\u2019s situation from that found in the authorities upon which she relies. See e.g., <em>Escalera </em>v. <em>New York City Housing Authy., </em>425 F.2d 853, 862-863 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Saylors, </em>19 Wash. App. 871, 874 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In a separate but somewhat related claim, O\u2019Brien alleges that at trial the BHA pressed for her eviction on the basis of her responsibility for Harris\u2019 conduct; whereas the grievance hearing panel decision suggests that the BHA\u2019s position at that hearing was that O\u2019Brien was in possession of and selling the marijuana.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She argues that had the notice not been so vague and lacking in detail, the BHA could not have introduced a new theory of good cause at the trial. O\u2019Brien concludes that dismissal of the action is required because there has been no \u201cthoughtful and careful \u2018in-house\u2019 exploration of the competing interests and concerns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The BHA objects to the assertion of this issue, and we think rightfully so. It argues that the claim involves a factual determination which could have been resolved at trial in the BHA\u2019s favor by its use of the tape recording of the hearing before the grievance hearing panel. That tape was not put in evidence, and is not part of the record, because O\u2019Brien raised this claim for the first time in her trial memorandum which was submitted well after the close of the evidence. We agree with the BHA that in these circumstances we must invoke the rule \u201cthat an issue not raised in the trial court cannot be argued for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>M. H. Gordon </em>&amp; <em>Son </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>386 Mass. 64, 67 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The record before us reveals that all the procedural requirements set out in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 866.54 through and including \u00a7 866.58 (1982) were followed. O\u2019Brien\u2019s remaining contentions concerning whether the panel\u2019s decision constituted good cause have been answered in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">5. <em>Defenses Under G. L. c. 239, </em>\u00a7 8A.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">O\u2019Brien argues that the trial judge was in error in refusing to allow her to raise the defense of uninhabitable conditions under G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A. She concedes that these defenses cannot be raised where an eviction is based upon wrongdoing, or fault, by the tenant. She argues, however, that her eviction was based upon cause and not fault and that she can, therefore, assert uninhabitable conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">While cause may not always involve fault by a tenant, cause \u201cis a general term, and must take on much of its meaning from the context in which it is used.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, 387 </em>Mass. at 263. As we stated earlier, O\u2019Brien was not without fault in that she knew of and tolerated Harris\u2019 misconduct. The judge was not in error in concluding that the defenses were not available to O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\">That statute provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe tenancy of a tenant of a housing authority shall not be terminated without cause and without reasons therefor given to said tenant in writing ....

We, therefore, read the phrase \u201cin accordance with applicable law\u201d as appearing in \u00a7 2.03(6) (f) to refer to the form and substance of the notice and not the length of the notice period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\"> The grievance hearing panel decision recites the cause for O\u2019Brien\u2019s eviction as being that \u201c[tjenant admitted to drugs being sold out of her apartment.\u201d This statement does not unequivocally support O\u2019Brien\u2019s present assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
