See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 12-17 (1980). A companion conviction of larceny is not before us, as the relevant indictment was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 437-438 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">1. There was evidence introduced by the Commonwealth in the course of its direct case from which the jury could have found the following facts. The victim was a dealer in drums and gave instruction in their use. The defendant became upset and borrowed his wife\u2019s car upon learning that his wife had sold his drums to the victim. The car was observed parked close by the entrance to the victim\u2019s driveway during the time span within which the pathologist fixed the time of death. The defendant\u2019s finger prints were found on a snare drum which lay near the body and which had not been acquired by the victim until some time after the date on which the defendant told the police he had last been in the victim\u2019s house. The police searched the house for, but could not find, a wallet in which the victim had habitually carried his credit cards. The defendant gave the police two conflicting stories as to his whereabouts during the evening in question, both of which the jury could have found to be false. Eight days after the death, the defendant used one of the victim\u2019s credit cards to purchase gasoline after persuading an acquaintance to sign the victim\u2019s name on the sales slip. When told by the investigating officer that he was under arrest, the defendant said, \u201cWhat for, the Stoneham murder? Did you get some more evidence?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We have no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a rational jury in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the defendant who had done the killing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, 373 </em>Mass. 700, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>702-703 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>378 Mass. 392, 403-404 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>388 Mass. 626, 629 (1983). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 589-594 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">2. The element of malice was made out by the pathologist\u2019s testimony concerning the multiple stab wounds, at least five of which could have been fatal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>377 Mass. 64, 66 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 875 (1980). Compare <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 417, 422 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">3. Both counsel, during their respective closing arguments, intruded on the judge\u2019s function of explicating the law, to the point where the judge interrupted with the following: \u201cI don\u2019t mind you people talking about presumption of innocence, and reasonable doubt, and a few other things, but for heaven\u2019s sake leave the definition of the crimes to me, will you.\u201d On one occasion during her closing the prosecutor defined \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as \u201ca doubt to which you can assign a reason.\u201d On two other occasions, she employed the phrase \u201ca doubt based on [or upon] a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The second paragraph of the charge reads: \u201cI think before I say anything else I will make several references to the arguments of counsel. Each counsel spoke to you and sometimes they referred to the law. What the lawyers say about the law, as apt as it might be, is not the final statement on the law, that\u2019s up to the judge. And I will say to you that my definition of \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019, which I will give you in a few minutes, controls.\u201d The ensuing charge on that subject was unabashedly and correctly cribbed from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">We are not persuaded that the presumptuous errors of the prosecutor require a new trial. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bjorkman, </em>364 Mass. 297, 307-309 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 596, 599-601 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 198-199 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>4. In the course of his voir dire questioning of each individual juror the judge, acting at the request of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, explained to the juror the meaning of the presumption of innocence and satisfied himself of the juror\u2019s understanding and acceptance of the proposition that the defendant \u201chas no burden to establish his innocence.\u201d Defense counsel reminded the jurors of those colloquies on two separate occasions in the course of his closing argument. The prosecutor, in her closing argument, referred to \u201csix points all of which have to be gotten around ... by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Taken in context, it is doubtful whether that remark was intended as anything more than a comment on what the prosecutor regarded as the strengths of her case and the weaknesses in the defendant\u2019s closing argument. The judge, immediately after the curative instructions referred to in part 3 hereof, said: \u201cThe attorney for the Commonwealth during her argument said, as I remember it, that there were at least six points upon which the government relied which the defendant had to get around. Now you know a defendant who is charged with a crime doesn\u2019t have to get around anything, he can just sit still. And if she may have meant, and I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t, to imply that he had the obligation to get around her six points, that just isn\u2019t so. You understand that.\u201d Later instructions to the same effect were impeccable.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In all the circumstances, we are of opinion that the prosecutor\u2019s remark does not require a new trial (compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 570-572 [1976]; \" <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891-893 [1980]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 838, 839 [1977]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, ante </em>331, 336 [1983]; contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>380 Mass. 70, 85-86 [1980]), whether considered by itself or in conjunction with the remarks discussed in part 3 hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The judgment on indictment No. 80-2944 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
