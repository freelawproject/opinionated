L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15, for the review of a judgment of the Superior Court affirming a decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB). The plaintiff, Eugene Donnelly, originally applied for a survivor allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 <em>12(2)(d), </em>when his wife died. She had been a member in service of the Pittsfield retirement system. The Pittsfield retirement board granted Mr. Donnelly\u2019s application for a survivor allowance and subsequently affirmed its decision after a hearing which was requested by Mrs. Donnelly\u2019s children. The decision was appealed to CRAB by the children pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). After a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ing, CRAB determined that Mr. Donnelly did not qualify for a survivor allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 <em>12(2)(d), </em>and instead awarded benefits to Mrs. Donnelly\u2019s children, the named beneficiaries under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 11(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The issues on appeal involve the statutory construction of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12(2)(d), as appearing in St. 1972, c. 793, \u00a7 1, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">\u201cIf a member dies before being retired without an eligible beneficiary other than the spouse of such member nominated under this option, or, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of subdivision (2) of section thirteen, if a member in service as described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of section three who has not less than two years of creditable service dies and leaves a spouse to whom such member had been married for not less than one year, or if a member dies within thirty days following the date the retirement of such member became effective without an eligible beneficiary nominated under Option (c) of this section, an election may be made by such spouse to receive the member-survivor allowance under this option; <em>provided that said spouse and the deceased member were living together at the time of death of such member, or that the board finds that they had been living apart for justifiable cause other than desertion or moral turpitude on the part of the spouse </em>[emphasis supplied].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The plaintiff cites as error of law the construction given by CRAB to the words \u201cliving together.\u201d He also alleges that the decision of GRAB is unsupported by substantial evidence since it denies survivor benefits to him in the absence of evidence that he had deserted his late wife or had been living apart from her due to his moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The evidence surrounding Mrs. Donnelly\u2019s death as presented before the hearing at CRAB was as follows. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>plaintiff and Mrs. Donnelly had been having problems with their marriage. The plaintiff was planning a trip to visit his sister shortly before Mrs. Donnelly\u2019s death, and he was not going to take his wife with him. She told him that, if he left on his trip without her, she would leave him. The plaintiff refused to change his plans, and Mrs. Donnelly began to move her clothes and possessions out of the house before he was scheduled to leave on his trip. Despite her actions, the plaintiff left, planning to return four days later, on January 29, 1979. Based on the testimony presented, CRAB found that Mrs. Donnelly would have moved completely out of the house before the plaintiff\u2019s return but that she was prevented by a storm from doing so. On January 29, 1979, before the plaintiff returned from his trip, Mrs. Donnelly committed suicide in the garage of the marital home. She left behind several notes which stated her reasons for committing the act and placed the blame upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">This court must determine whether the decision of CRAB was supported by substantial evidence and free from error of law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>377 Mass. 897, 903 (1979). This determination turns upon the interpretation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12(2) (d). There is no legislative history which sheds light upon the legislative intent in adding the language at issue, which has remained substantially unchanged since its insertion by St. 1950, c. 670, \u00a7 2. Further, there appear to be no published cases construing that language. Therefore, we must turn to the language itself. <em>Nantucket Conservation Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 212, 214 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The plaintiff contends that CRAB erred as matter of law in construing the words \u201cliving together\u201d to exclude the situation of a wife who intended to leave the marital abode but had not yet done so. In construing the words \u201cliving together\u201d it is an established principle that the \u201cwords are to be given their usual and ordinary meaning considered in light of the aim to be accomplished by the Legislature.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546 (1976), quoted in <em>Nantucket Conservation Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, Inc., </em>380 Mass. at 214. In this case, the usual meaning of the words \u201cliving together\u201d is somewhat ambiguous when applied to the facts. The Donnellys were not together for the four days preceding her death. However, she was still sleeping in the marital home until the time of her death, and it was in the garage of that home that she committed suicide. The plaintiff had not moved out of the home either but was temporarily absent on a trip to visit his sister. Therefore, while they were not physically together, and, according to the evidence presented at the hearing, they did not intend to live together upon the plaintiff\u2019s return, neither had established a residence separate and apart from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Since the question whether a husband and wife must have moved into separate residences in order for CRAB to be authorized to find that they were not \u201cliving together\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12(2) <em>(d) </em>is not disposed of by the \u201cusual and ordinary meaning\u201d of the words \u201cliving together,\u201d we turn to analogous statutes for guidance. See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.03 (4th ed. 1973). In the context of \u00a7 12(2) <em>(d), </em>the words \u201cliving together\u201d are used in contradistinction to the words \u201cliving apart.\u201d It is reasonable to assume that in inserting that sub-paragraph, the Legislature was aware of the construction of \u201cliving apart\u201d in the statutes in the Commonwealth dealing with divorce and separate support. It is also reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended that reference be made to that area of the law because the language at issue in \u00a7 12(2) <em>(d) </em>contains such phrases as \u201cliving apart for justifiable cause\u201d and \u201cdesertion,\u201d which are terms of art in domestic relations law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 6B, cited by the plaintiff, a divorce action cannot be commenced unless the parties have been \u201cliving apart\u201d for at least thirty days, or the court waives the requirement. We can find no published cases decided under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 6B, which discuss the interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the words \u201cliving apart,\u201d and none was cited by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">There are, however, some cases construing the words \u201cliving apart\u201d within the meaning of statutory predecessors of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 32, dealing with separate support. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>154 Mass. 262 (1891), the court upheld a finding of a Probate Court that a wife was \u201cliving apart\u201d from her husband for purposes of maintaining an action for separate support. For a period of time before filing her petition, the wife had slept at her father-in-law\u2019s house, which was on the same plot of land as her husband\u2019s house. She had gone each day to her husband\u2019s house and performed her household duties. On the day she filed her petition, however, she did not go to her husband\u2019s house, and the court stated that \u201c[w]hen she filed her petition she was in fact not only sleeping, but taking her meals, away from her husband\u2019s home, and she has not lived with him since.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. In <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>329 Mass. 205 (1952), decided under a prior version of G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 32, which required a wife to be \u201cactually living apart\u201d from her husband before filing for separate support, the court held that a wife was not \u201cactually living apart\u201d from her husband in a situation in which she had been sleeping in a different room in the same house with her husband for five years before filing her suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Both the <em>Smith </em>case and the <em>Brewer </em>case appear to place emphasis upon the existence or not of a common marital home. In the instant case, neither the plaintiff nor Mrs. Donnelly had abandoned the marital home. While Mrs. Donnelly may have formed an intention to leave the home before her death, she did not accomplish her goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">We may also turn to cases decided under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for guidance. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 32 &amp; 35A. In <em>Nelson's Case, </em>217 Mass. 467 (1914), the court construed the language in the workmen\u2019s compensation statute which states that a wife seeking compensation based upon the conclusive presumption of dependency must be living with her husband. The court stated that the phrase \u201c[w]ith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>whom she lives\u201d contemplates a husband and wife who are \u201cmaintaining a home and living together in the same household, or actually cohabiting under conditions which would be regarded as constituting a family relation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. While there may be \u201ctemporary absences\u201d due to \u201ctravel for business or pleasure,\u201d the court emphasized that \u201cthere must be a home and a life in it.\u201d <em>Ibid. Harrington\u2019s Case, </em>297 Mass. 125, 126 (1937). <em>Legg\u2019s Case, </em>358 Mass. 615, 616-617 (1971). The court in <em>Nelson\u2019s Case </em>also stated that the words in the statute were \u201cused in antithesis to living apart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Since Mrs. Donnelly did not move out of the marital home before her death and since the plaintiff was only temporarily absent from the home we cannot justify as a matter of law the finding by CRAB that Mr. and Mrs. Donnelly were not \u201cliving together\u201d at the time of Mrs. Donnelly\u2019s death. We need not reach the interpretation of the clause \u201cor that the board finds that they had been living apart for justifiable cause other than desertion or moral turpitude on the part of the spouse\u201d which is also contained in \u00a7 12(2) (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court affirming the decision of CRAB is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered ordering CRAB to order an award of survivor benefits to the plaintiff pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12(2) <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
