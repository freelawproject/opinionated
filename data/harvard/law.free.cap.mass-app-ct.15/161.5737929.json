Gilberto was born on July 4, 1978. The mother herself was born December 5, 1962. The natural father was born in 1943 or 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The probate judge held several hearings on the petition and on June 16, 1981, made extensive findings (in addition to the facts outlined above). In the findings, he stated in detail the facts on which he based his conclusion that the Department\u2019s petition should be granted. These findings, which have support in the evidence, are summarized in Appendix A. In general they show the inadequacy of a well-intentioned, immature mother during a considerable period when she was less than or about sixteen years old (and thereafter) to deal with the needs of her son Gilberto.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The judge, on March 20, 1981, appointed Miss Justine Honeyman, a member of the so called CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) project of the National Council of Jewish Women, as guardian ad litem. She filed a thorough report, admitted in evidence, which reveals careful investigation. She also testified and was subjected to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The judge concluded that the mother \u201chas not [been], is not, and will not be able [properly] to . . . care for her children.\u201d This conclusion obviously was based on all the evidence before him, including the guardian ad litem\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The judge also found that the Department has selected (as temporary foster parents and as possible adoptive parents) a couple, Mr. and Mrs. K, respectively thirty-two and twenty-eight years old, who have one child. They live in a suburban neighborhood. The husband is a high-school graduate, soon to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree, and is employed by a well-known company as a computer specialist. The judge concluded that it is for the best interest of Gilberto that he be placed for adoption with Mr. and Mrs. K.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>A decree was entered on June 16, 1981, that the consent of Gilberto\u2019s natural parents need not be obtained for any subsequent adoption approved by the Department. The mother has appealed. A single justice of this court, on June 28, 1982, granted leave to enter the appeal late but \u201csuggested that the Department\u201d seek from the trial judge \u201ca supplemental finding concerning the effect, if any, on his findings, if it should be determined that the applicable standard of proof is \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019\u201d See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745 (1982). See also <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1088 (1982); <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), 14 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1013, 1014-1015 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The same probate judge conferred with counsel on July 21, 1982. He then received from new counsel for the mother a copy of a decision of a judge, sitting in the Worcester Division of the Juvenile Court Department, granting the mother\u2019s request that she be awarded the custody and care of Angel, Jr., Gilberto\u2019s younger brother. The Juvenile Court judge had concluded that the Department had \u201cnot persuasively shown the necessity of removing . . . [Angel, Jr.] from his mother\u201d or \u201can ongoing pattern of parental neglect or misconduct\u201d by the mother, but \u201crather [that the mother had] an immature and dependent personality.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">A motion by the mother for a new trial in the present case was \u201cdismissed\u201d on July 26, 1982. On July 26, the probate judge made rulings, among others, that on the evidence at trial it was \u201cclear and convincing\u201d (1) that the mother was \u201ccurrently unfit to assume parental responsibility\u201d for Gilberto; (2) that his best interests would be \u201cserved by termination of parental rights\u201d; (3) that the Department\u2019s plan for Gilberto\u2019s adoption will serve his best interests; and (4) that under the \u201cstandard of clear and convincing evidence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>mentioned in the <em>Santosky </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the decision of this case (based on the facts found by the judge after the earlier 1980 and 1981 hearings) \u201cwould not be changed.\u201d The supplemental findings of fact were expressed in essentially similar terms. Four matters are argued to us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">1. General Laws c. 210, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6, are not unconstitutional although these sections do not in terms require the Department to support its allegations of parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. The <em>Santosky </em>case itself, at 749 n.3, recognizes that the standard of proof in many States has been established by judicial decision. Massachusetts, prior to the <em>Santosky </em>case, had not adopted in such cases the standard of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d proof but, nevertheless, had recognized that what the proper standard was, in effect was a matter for judicial determination. See e.g., <em>Petition of the Dept. of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 592-593 (1981). Now that the <em>Santosky </em>case shows that a higher standard of proof is a matter of constitutional necessity, it is open to this court to treat the trial judge\u2019s reappraisal of the evidence (on which he first acted in 1981) as satisfying the new requirements of \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d See <em>Petition of the Department of Social Services to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, post </em>916 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">2. A court must find that natural parents are unfit before cutting off their parental rights. See <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>386 Mass. 741, 747 (1982), and case cited. It is not necessary to show that a parent is guilty of physical abuse or great neglect in order to prove unfitness. Unfitness is not based solely on a parent\u2019s affirmative conduct but partakes of an assessment of the parent\u2019s \u201ccharacter, temperament, capacity, and conduct, and . . . the welfare of the child in connection with its age, environment and affections.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dept. of Pub. Welfare, </em>383 Mass. at 589, quoting <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 554 (1932). <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>383 Mass. 595, 600-602 (1981). See <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers, </em>367 Mass. 631, 636 (1975); <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. 563, 574-576 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(1980). On this basis the probate judge\u2019s conclusion is well supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">This different conclusion reached by the judge of the Juvenile Court is not before us. We have not seen the whole record upon which he acted and have no occasion to consider whether it had support in the evidence presented to him. In any event, the case before us relates to Gilberto and not to Angel, Jr. \u201cIt is conceivable that . . . parents might be fit to bring up one child and unfit to bring up another.\u201d See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, 278 </em>Mass. at 553-554; <em>Petition of the Dept. of Pub. Welfare, </em>383 Mass. at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">3. The evidence at the 1981 hearings appears to us to provide clear and convincing proof that the mother was unfit to provide Gilberto with the care, affection, nurture, and understanding guidance which he requires and to protect him from normal hazards. Evidence of her serious inadequacy, despite her good intentions, came from competent observers and from the guardian ad litem\u2019s report. It was open to the trial judge, after reconsideration of that evidence, to restate his conclusion in terms of \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d There is no reason to doubt that he honestly and reasonably was of opinion that the evidence met that standard at all times and that he had been satisfied with the evidence in accordance with that standard. At the conference on supplemental findings on July 21, 1982, no offer of proof by counsel was made, nor was there any affidavit, that the circumstances had changed since the original 1981 decision in any manner which would require further taking of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">4. We perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s denial of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The decree of June 16, 1981, as supplemented and explained by the trial judge\u2019s rulings and findings of July 26, 1982, is affirmed. The order denying the motion for a new trial also is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>APPENDIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\n<em>Summary of the Trial Judge\u2019s Original Findings of June 16, 1981.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(Material within quotation marks is quoted from the judge\u2019s findings and does not purport to be quoted from the evidence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">1. The relationship between Gilberto\u2019s mother and his father \u201chas been . . . volatile . . . over the years.\u201d The mother fears the father who has physically assaulted her, but \u201chas been unable to terminate this relationship.\u201d The couple have refused counseling, and the mother has refused or failed to follow diligently certain other references to social institutions and counsellors designed to assist her to become a suitable parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">2. Gilberto was injured about the head when he was seven weeks old. Although there is no evidence that the mother ever struck Gilberto, she has given \u201cseveral explanations as to what caused the injury\u201d including one that the father \u201chit the baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">3. The mother, who \u201cbecame angry when the baby became fussy or cried,\u201d voluntarily took Gilberto to a health center on August 21, 1978. Since then he has been under the Department\u2019s care and has lived in foster homes. He was committed to the Department\u2019s permanent care on August 29,1979. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. The mother had a second child, Angel, Jr., born May 20, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">4. The mother has been seen by a child psychologist who indicated that the mother \u201csuffered from a character disorder with a limited potential for mothering [sic] Gilberto\u201d and the psychologist \u201cdid not feel that . . . [the mother] could really be a potential mother for her children.\u201d A case worker, formerly assigned to the mother\u2019s case, observed the mother with Gilberto having \u201cdifficulty feeding the baby, putting the baby to sleep, dressing the baby, and taking his temperature,\u201d and as \u201cof January 28,1980 . . . [the mother] did not have basic ability to care for Gilberto.\u201d Her present social worker made efforts to obtain various forms of counselling help for the mother (and in at least one instance for the father), but the arrangements were not used in any satisfactory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">5. A child psychiatrist saw the mother on at least three occasions, once with Gilberto. With his mother, Gilberto \u201cwas constricted and controlled\u201d and \u201cwanted to leave the room.\u201d He also \u201ccried and yelled\u201d although, when the psychiatrist saw Gilberto apart from his mother, he \u201cwas usually outgoing and vivacious.\u201d The psychiatrist \u201cfound that. . . [the mother] functions like a five year old child herself\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t think of her children first, although her intentions are good.\u201d The mother \u201cnever really grew up,\u201d and her \u201cpotential for taking responsibility for her child\u2019s safety is minimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">6. In April, 1981, the mother was referred [by her then attorney] to Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a psychiatrist. Prior to June, 1981, she had seen him for eight fifty-minute sessions. He found she had an \u201cimmature personal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ity\u201d and said she needed at least one year of psychotherapy and perhaps as much as five years, with no certainty that the situation would improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">7. Obviously taking into account the guardian ad litem\u2019s report, the judge found that the mother \u201cdoes not provide minimal physical or emotional care necessary for the well being of the children\u201d; that she is \u201cemotionally immature,\u201d lacks the \u201ccapacity to judge the needs of her children,\u201d \u201chas little empathy for them,\u201d and needs \u201cconstant reminding to change . . . diapers and offer her children food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">[In the trial judge\u2019s findings, he refers on a number of occasions to the mother\u2019s \u201cchildren.\u201d This is wholly understandable as there was substantial evidence before him concerning Angel, Jr., although only Gilberto was involved in this proceeding.]</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">8. With the prospective adopting parents, now serving as foster parents, Gilberto\u2019s speech has become clearer, he is well behaved, and \u201cis a happy normal child. If he has to visit his mother, he becomes hysterical and nearly uncontrollable. He experiences depression, has nightmares for several days, and diarrhea after visiting his mother.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\">This decision has been included in the present record although the transcript of the July 21 hearing does not show clearly that it was received in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
