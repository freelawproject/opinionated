Baronoff (James R. DeGiacomo </em>with her) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b707-13\"><em>Edward J.

See <em>Buteau </em>v. <em>Norfolk County Retirement Bd., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 391 (1979) (a prior action dismissed on procedural grounds). Following the suggestion in that case the plaintiff reconsidered its decision and entered a new decision, again denying Buteau\u2019s widow the benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100 (a pension of the full amount of the maximum salary set for Buteau\u2019s position), and granting the lesser benefits provided under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>ant reversed this decision and ordered the plaintiff to grant the widow\u2019s application for \u00a7 100 benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the Superior Court the parties stipulated that the case could be decided on the findings of the defendant\u2019s hearings officer. The widow\u2019s motion for summary judgment (Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 [1974]) was allowed, and a judgment entered affirming the defendant\u2019s decision and directing the plaintiff to grant the application for \u00a7 100 benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Section 100, as amended by St. 1974, c. 564, provides for a widow\u2019s pension of the full amount of the salary of a fire fighter who \u201cwhile in the performance of his duties and [1] as the result of an accident while responding to or returning from an alarm of fire or any emergency, or [2] as the result of an accident involving a fire department vehicle, which the firefighter is operating or in which he is riding, or [3] while at the scene of a fire or any emergency is killed or sustains injuries which result in his death . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The only issue presented by the plaintiff on appeal is whether the hearings officer, and, therefore, the defendant, which adopted her findings and recommended decision as its own, committed an error of law in construing clause [3] of \u00a7 100 as not requiring that the death or injuries which led to death be the result of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The plaintiff argues that clause [3], under which the defendant concluded that the widow was entitled to benefits, must be read along with the \u201cearlier requirement\u201d that an accident occurred which caused the death. Such a construction is contrary to the plain meaning of the language of the statute, and we reject it. See <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>324 Mass. 309, 312-313 (1949); <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 960 (1978). It would require, at least, that we ignore or treat as surplusage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the words \u201cas the result of an accident\u201d in clause [2] in contravention of well-established principles of statutory construction (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 [1967]) and that we either ignore or give other than its ordinary disjunctive meaning to the word \u201cor\u201d which separates the clauses, where the context and the apparent purpose of all the language of the statute do not so dictate. See <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">It is unnecessary to look beyond the pertinent language of \u00a7 100, quoted above, to determine its meaning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974); <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>553, 561-562 (1983). The legislature has defined three situations in which the circumstances of the death of a fire fighter give rise to the widow\u2019s eligibility for a pension equal to the full amount of the salary of the fire fighter. Under clauses [1] and [2] the death or injuries leading to death must be as a result of an accident while the fire fighter is engaged is specific activities, but under clause [3] it is sufficient if the fire fighter dies or suffers injuries resulting in death \u201cwhile at the scene of a fire or any emergency.\u201d On the undisputed facts of this case it is clear that the widow was entitled to benefits under clause [3], There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> The defendant in its decision inadvertently referred to the conditions for allowance of benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9; but its direction, when viewed in light of its hearings officer\u2019s findings and recommended decision, is clearly for the allowance of \u00a7 100 benefits, and all parties have treated it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> The bracketed numbers are inserted for ease of reference to clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
