L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90A, 90C, and 102 (as from time to time in force), the Massachusetts Retired Police and Firefighters Association, Inc. (the Association), a nonprofit corporation, seeks declaratory relief (G. L. c. 231A and G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 24) in behalf of at least all of its members who are retired police officers or retired firefighters of the town of Belmont. The defendant (BRB) exists as a board under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20(4). The case was heard in the Superior Court upon a statement of agreed facts and appears to involve only questions of statutory interpretation concerning the application of c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90A, 90C, and 102, to the agreed facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 90A and 90C, cities and towns, which (as Belmont has done) accept those sections, are permitted in their discretion (by methods described in those sections) to increase the retirement allowances of specified retired town employees. Such increases hereafter usually are referred to as \u201c90A/90C increases.\u201d Section 102 was first inserted by St. 1966, c. 661, \u00a7 3. In recent years the section has been revised frequently. It has required towns to increase the retirement allowances of specified employees by various percentage increases in the cost of living (hereafter usually referred to as \u201c\u00a7 102 increases\u201d), determined generally in relation to the percentage change in the United States Consumer Price Index for each year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In recent years (since St. 1976, c. 126, \u00a7 1), the amount of the increase has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>made \u201cby such percentum as the [Gjeneral [Cjourt shall determine.\u201d The complaint (apart from issues of standing, jurisdiction, completion of administrative \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> remedies, and existence of a justiciable controversy) presents questions (see part 2 of this opinion, <em>infra) </em>with respect to the relationship between the sometimes overlapping 90A/90C increases and the \u00a7 102 increases. This overlapping has been affected substantially over the years by the changing terms of successive versions of \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The trial judge determined (a) that the Association had \u201cstanding\u201d as a representative of those of its members affected by BRB\u2019s somewhat restrictive interpretation of c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90A, 90G, and 102, as in effect from time to time; (b) that the Association was not required to resort to and complete all the administrative remedies afforded to its affected members before BRB and the State\u2019s Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB, existing under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 [4J); and (c) that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. He then made a declaration of the rights of affected Association members under the relevant statutory sections, in general following the Association\u2019s contentions. BRB has appealed from the judgment granting declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">1. We first consider procedural problems dealt with by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">A. <em>The Association\u2019s Standing and Jurisdiction of the Superior Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">BRB contends that the Association has no interest in this litigation sufficient to permit it to represent its members affected by adverse and restrictive interpretations by BRB under \u00a7\u00a7 90A, 90C, and 102, of the rights of retired Association members. The trial judge, in recognizing the Association\u2019s standing, relies largely upon general language in <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Independent Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 297-298 (1977, hereafter referred to as the <em>MAIIAB </em>case) that to recognize a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>corporation like the Association under Mass.R.Civ.P. 17(a), 365 Mass. 763 (1974), \u201cas the real party in interest . . . not only avoids a multiplicity of actions by the individual members of the association, but also assures that the interests of the members as a collective group can be fully presented . . . due to the pooling of financial resources which is possible. Not only are there no valid reasons for refusing to recognize the status of MAIIAB as the real party in interest, but a failure to do so will, in all probability, disserve the explicit purpose of rule 17(a).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The trial judge also ruled in this proceeding, by virtue of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 24(1), when read with G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20(5)(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief upon petition of the Association, which he treated as an \u201cinterested party.\u201d See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. It should be noted that \u00a7\u00a7 90A, 90C, and 102 each provide for supple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>merits to the basic retirement allowances of former employees payable under the provisions of c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 28, especially \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7. These supplements are not readily susceptible of being dealt with apart from the basic allowances. The grant of jurisdiction in \u00a7 24(1) to enforce the basic allowances thus reasonably can be interpreted as extending also to the supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The practical advantages, as a matter of judicial administration, of treating (a) the Association as having standing to represent its members, and (b) the Superior Court as having jurisdiction to grant relief under \u00a7 24, are significant in a case such as this. The problems of statutory interpretation appear likely to recur<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> frequently or to result in a multiplicity of proceedings, and the only issues are questions of law, i.e., general questions of statutory interpretation. Compare the discussion in <em>General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>388 Mass. 24, 27-29 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">B. <em>Completion of Possible Administrative Remedies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">BRB contends that the Association (or its affected members) must be required to have resort to the administrative remedy available to its affected members, that is, before BRB in the first instance and thereafter before CRAB. This contention in effect treats CRAB as an administrative agency having primary jurisdiction. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979). Under earlier forms of c. 32, \u00a7 102, individual retirees from the Belmont town service did have resort to the procedure under c. 32, \u00a7 16(4), and CRAB rendered decisions expressed in general terms, upon the relationship between 90A/90C increases and \u00a7 102 increases. In 1971, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>CRAB decision was based on the 1967 form of what is now \u00a7 102. In 1975, a CRAB decision was based on the amendments of \u00a7 102 by St. 1972, c. 793, \u00a7 7. See note 11, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Various considerations affect the problem whether, in the present controversy, the Association must cause to be completed the same administrative procedures before BRB and CRAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">(1) There are here no facts to be found by CRAB in view of the statement of agreed facts. In this, the present case differs from <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 448-453 (1973), where important facts pertinent to agency policy remained to be decided by that commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">(2) CRAB is not given, by G. L. c. 32, significant regulatory functions<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but seems to be principally a body set up to adjudicate disputes. See <em>Masiello </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>360 Mass. 856 (1971). Although a substantial volume of cases relating to the same retirement statutes may give CRAB some familiarity with retirement problems, where no questions of fact are to be decided, pure issues of statutory interpretation are probably as readily decided by a court as by CRAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">(3) General Laws, c. 231A, \u00a7 3, was amended by St. 1974, c. 630, \u00a7 2, which added the provision set out in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>An affidavit, expressed in general terms, of the type set out in the 1974 amendment, was attached to the Association\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">(4) Completion of primary jurisdiction remedies frequently has not been required in the tax field (see <em>Sydney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps, &amp; Taxn., </em>371 Mass. 289, 293-295 [1976]), although as is said in the <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>case, 364 Mass. at 449-451, the Supreme Judicial Court only rarely has permitted declaratory relief (without resort to usual channels of administrative relief) in other types of cases. See, however, <em>Metropolitan Dist. Police Relief Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>347 Mass. 686, 689 (1964), where declaratory relief was granted as \u201ca sensible and proper method of obtaining judicial interpretation of the applicability of somewhat confusing statutes.\u201d We think that the present case meets the criteria mentioned in the <em>Sydney </em>case, at 294-295, as \u201c[fjavorable to maintenance of a declaratory action,\u201d namely \u201cthat the issue is important or novel or recurrent; that the decision will have public significance, affecting . . . many besides the immediate litigants; or that the case reduces to an issue of law without dispute as to the facts.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">All the considerations just listed bear upon the question whether and to what extent a trial judge has discretion to grant declaratory relief where to do so means apparent disregard of usual administrative channels of relief. We are of opinion that, in the circumstances, the trial judge here acted within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>We entertain no doubt that there is here a justiciable controversy between the Belmont retiree members of the Association and BRB. We also think that declaratory relief will terminate that controversy, which is considerably more than a \u201cmere difference of opinion or uncertainty over the meaning to be ascribed [to] a statute.\u201d See <em>Department of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts State College Bldg. Authy., </em>378 Mass. 418, 422-424 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">2. We move to the question of statutory interpretation presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">(A) It is agreed (1) that in 1970 Belmont accepted G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90A and 90C, and made appropriations for all increases adopted by the town pursuant to those sections until 1975, and (2) that funds have not been authorized for further increases since July 1, 1975. Nothing in either \u00a7 90A or \u00a7 90C requires a town, if it accepts either or both of these sections, to grant any increase under either section. As we read these sections, however, once an increase is granted, the retirement allowance of the affected retiree is permanently increased and must be paid in the year of the increase and in subsequent years, unless an increase under \u00a7 102 for any particular year is larger than a 90A/90C increase granted in that year, in which case the \u00a7 102 increase is paid instead. See \u00a7 102(a), last sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Nothing in either \u00a7 90A or \u00a7 90C contains anything contrary to our conclusion that an increase in a retirement allowance, once granted by a town under either of those sections, becomes thereafter a part of that allowance. A condition providing for a different result (or other conditional provisions) could have been specifically provided in the legislation. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>364 Mass. 847, 866 n.22 (1973). There is no provision for repeal or revocation of any such 90A/90C increase. We regard the absence of such conditions or provisions as indication of a legislative intention that the increased allowances should become vested, once granted, in the year when granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">(B) We turn now to the interrelation between (1) c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 90A and 90C, and (2) \u00a7 102(a), as amended by St. 1974, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>c. 724, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 102(a) plainly contemplates an <em>annual </em>recomputation of the \u00a7 102 increases based, at least roughly, on changes in the consumer price index. In 1974, \u00a7 102(a) was completely rewritten, and that circumstance makes now irrelevant earlier decisions by CRAB, based on earlier versions of \u00a7 102(a). See Appendix, part 2, pars. (B) through (D).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Belmont has continued, since the 1974 amendment became effective, to perform an annual comparison between (a) the cumulative aggregate of the \u00a7 102 increases granted since 1970 (defined in the statement of agreed facts as \u201cthe \u00a7 102 calculation\u201d) with (b) the cumulative aggregate of the 90A/90C increases granted since 1970. Belmont has withheld from each retiree, who (at any time since 1970) has received a 90A/90C increase, any \u00a7 102 increases on the ground that the aggregate 90A/90C increases (past and current) were greater than the cumulative \u00a7 102 increases (i.e., the \u00a7 102 calculation). We think that this practice runs counter to the plain language of the current 1974 form of \u00a7 102(a). See the words following the bracketed [X] in that subsection as it appears in Appendix, part 2, par. (A). As we read that language in the 1974 revision, it requires that the annual \u00a7 102 increase of each year be added to the basic retirement allowance (as it then exists) to \u201cbecome the fixed retirement allowance . . . for all future purposes,\u201d except that, when a 90A/90C increase in that year is greater than the \u00a7 102 increase in that year, the 90A/90C increase (by substitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>for the \u00a7 102 increase) is added to the basic retirement allowance (as it then exists) to become a newly determined fixed retirement allowance. This result, we hold, is compelled by the <em>annual </em>time frame of the 1974 version of \u00a7 102(a). The percentage change of the next subsequent annual \u00a7 102 increase must be applied to this new fixed retirement allowance (if that increase is larger than the 90A/90C increase of that subsequent year) without comparison with any <em>prior </em>90A/90C increase. Implicit in the language of the later part of the 1974 revision of \u00a7 102(a) is that a 90A/90C increase becomes a permanent part of the fixed retirement allowance \u201cfor all future purposes.\u201d Thus, it is to be so regarded for purposes of the application to it of the \u00a7 102 percentage increase (or the 90A/90C substitute increase) of the next subsequent year.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We reach this conclusion in part because, in the 1972 version of \u00a7 102(a), see Appendix, part 2, par. (B), a comparison of \u00a7 102 increases with 90A/90C increases was required whenever the basic retirement allowance <em>\u201chas been </em>... or is increased\u201d under \u00a7 90A or \u00a7 90C (emphasis supplied). After the 1974 revision of \u00a7 102, a comparison was to be made whenever the retirement allowance <em>\u201cis </em>increased\u201d under \u00a7 90A or \u00a7 90C (emphasis supplied). We view this change as emphasizing the <em>annual </em>time frame of the adjustments caused by the 1974 revision as contrasted with the comparison under the 1972 revision of \u00a7 102 of (a) the cumulative aggregates of the \u00a7 102 increases and (b) the cumulative 90A/90C increases. Even minor changes in language may have significance in the interpretation of such statutory revisions. See the discussion in <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946). See also <em>Marshfield </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>337 Mass. 633, 637-638 (1958). The trial judge reached substantially the result which we reach. The declaration ordered by him appears to be consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>APPENDIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">CERTAIN RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF GENERAL LAWS, CHAPTER 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">PART 1.

Although not enough appears in this record to permit any precise determination of the extent of the direct interest of Association members in the issues involved in this case, nothing suggests that the Association represents any interest adverse to that of any members. Several members of the Association by affidavit have joined in support of the Association\u2019s position in this proceeding. The Association\u2019s contentions seem to be consistent with the probable general interests of all its members. The \u201cpooling of financial resources\u201d mentioned in the <em>MAIIAB </em>case, at 298, is of importance where, as here, each affected member\u2019s claim is so small as to make individual litigation about it disproportionately expensive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> Relevant portions of these two sections, inserted by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, are quoted below (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>Section 24(1). </em>\u201cThe superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity upon petition of the commissioner of insurance <em>or any interested party </em>to <em>compel the observance </em>and to restrain the violation of any provision of sections one to twenty-eight inclusive . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\"><em>Section 20(5)(b) </em>states that any board of a retirement system shall \u201cprovide <em>for the payment of retirement allowances </em>and other benefits and for all other necessary expenditures under\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 28, inclusive, and \u201cshall have such other powers and shah perform such other duties and functions as are necessary to comply with such provisions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> General Laws c. 231A, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1974, c. 630, \u00a7 1, permits declaratory relief to obtain a determination of the legality of \u201cadministrative practices and procedures of any municipal . . . agency . . . which practices or procedures are alleged to be in violation of . . . laws of the commonwealth. \u201d These \u201cpractices or procedures\u201d are defined in \u00a7 2 as \u201cthe customary and usual method of conducting municipal. . . business.\u201d In the present case, there was strong indication that BRB, unless prevented, would persist in the somewhat restrictive interpretation of the relevant statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 20(5)(\u00a3&gt;), inserted by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, gives to local retirement boards power to \u201cmake . . . regulations consistent with law, which shall be subject to approval\u201d by the Commissioner of Insurance who, by c. 32, \u00a7 21(4), has power to promulgate regulations to carry out \u00a7\u00a7 1-28, inclusive, and to approve regulations promulgated by retirement boards. Thus BRB, the initial agency designated for review of problems of overlap between the 90A/90C increases and the \u00a7 102 increases has power to prescribe regulations only with the approval of the Commissioner of Insurance as policy maker. CRAB appears to have no such power to prescribe regulations. Thus neither BRB nor CRAB would seem to be the type of agency normally given \u201cconsiderable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d See <em>Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> The additional provision reads: \u201cThe failure to exhaust administrative relief prior to bringing an action . . . [for declaratory relief] shall not bar the bringing of such action if the petition for declaratory relief is accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ponied by an affidavit stating that the practice or procedure set forth pursuant to the provisions of section two [see note 6, supra] is known to exist by the agency or official therein described and that reliance on administrative relief would be futile. For the purposes of this section practice or procedure means the customary and usual method of conducting agency or official business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b242-12\"> It should be remembered that c. 231 A, \u00a7 \u00a7 1 and 2, state that the procedures of the chapter \u201cmay\u201d be employed. The word \u201cmay\u201d implies some discretion. Section 3 gives a court discretionary power to refuse relief \u201cfor . . . sufficient reasons,\u201d a provision which may indicate some range of discretion to grant declaratory relief. Such relief is described in \u00a7 9, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1, as \u201cremedial\u201d and as \u201cto be liberally construed and administered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\"> Subsequent amendments of \u00a7 102(a) do not appear to affect the method of computation discussed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\"> In 1971, CRAB had ruled, in a case brought by five retirees from Belmont under St. 1967, c. 408, \u00a7 2 (see Appendix, part 2, par. [C]), that both the \u00a7 102 increase and the 90A/90C increases must be paid without any offset of one type of increase against the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In 1975, CRAB ruled, on the basis of the provision of St. 1972, c. 793, \u00a7 7 (see Appendix A, part 2, par. [B]), in effect that only the greater of the 90A/90C increases then and theretofore granted and the \u00a7 102 increases need be granted. The 1975 CRAB decision was operative until January 1, 1975, the effective date of the 1974 revision of \u00a7 102. See St. 1974, c. 724, \u00a7 2. It should be noted that the Association\u2019s complaint seeks only relief from and after the effective date of the 1974 rewriting of \u00a7 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
