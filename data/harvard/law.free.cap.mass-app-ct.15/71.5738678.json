L. c. 266, \u00a7 49, possession of a sawed-off shotgun, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(c), and carrying a shotgun in a motor vehicle, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals from his convictions on those indictments and from an order denying his motion for a new trial, arguing: (1) that his trial counsel gave him ineffective assistance in putting forth the defense of a lack of criminal responsibility; (2) that the trial judge erroneously excluded lay testimony on the question of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility; (3) that during his summation to the jury, the prosecutor improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to produce expert witnesses concerning his lack of criminal responsibility; and (4) that the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions on the defense of insanity and on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof were erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">1. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">The facts which gave rise to the <em>indictments </em>and which are pertinent to the issues on appeal are as follows. About 3:00 a.m., on April 30, 1977, the defendant and his brother, Bruce Bannister, were driving along Route 20, in Brimfield, when they were stopped by State Trooper Robert Corry for driving with a broken headlight. The defendant, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>driving, identified himself as William Budlong and produced various items of identification, but no driver\u2019s license, bearing that name. Because of a discrepancy on the face of one item of identification, Corry became suspicious and asked the passenger to stand outside and to the back of the car. The passenger told Corry that his name was Bruce Budlong. When Corry asked the defendant the name of his passenger, the defendant identified him as Bruce Bannister.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Corry then called into his barracks to get information on these names. He received no response as to William Bud-long but he was told that Bruce Bannister had a history of violent crimes and had been treated for drug addiction. Corry requested assistance and Trooper Stephen Bennett arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Bennett found in the car a cocked, sawed-off shotgun and five shells, one of which was in the chamber of the gun. The defendant was given Miranda warnings but stated that he waived them and accused the troopers of placing the shotgun in the car. He insisted that his name was Budlong, but at the police barracks he was identified by a local police officer who knew him. Confronted with the inevitable, the defendant muttered words to the effect that \u201c[y]ou got me.\u201d The car was impounded. A set of lock-picks was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The defendant was examined pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15, for purposes of determining his competency to stand trial and his criminal responsibility. Dr. Harry M. Michelson reported that the defendant suffered from a mental illness and was not competent to stand trial. Dr. Michelson offered no opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility, and he recommended that the defendant undergo further observation and testing. Approximately three months later, Dr. John Purtzer, Assistant Medical Director at Bridgewater State Hospital, concluded that the defendant suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia but that he was criminally responsible for his actions and competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">2. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">After his convictions in 1978, and while his appeal lay dormant (apparently due to preparation of the transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of evidence at trial), the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was heard and decided under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. We consider the defendant\u2019s claims and the motion judge\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> findings of fact concerning them, first to determine whether \u201cthe conduct of his lawyer was \u2018measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408, 412 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), and, if so, whether the defendant has demonstrated \u201cprejudice resulting therefrom,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. at 412. It is not our function to \u201csecond-guess\u201d defense counsel, and we look to see only whether his professional judgment was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable,\u201d i.e., whether it resulted in the defendant\u2019s loss of \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. In conducting our review, we \u201caccord[ ] considerable deference\u201d to the motion judge\u2019s findings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 165, 177 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The defendant claims that in light of Dr. Michelson\u2019s and Dr. Purtzer\u2019s reports, defense counsel should have filed a motion requesting that the defendant be examined by an independent psychiatrist. He asserts that the necessity for an additional examination should have been \u201cobvious\u201d from the fact that, while both doctors had concluded that the defendant was mentally ill, Dr. Purtzer\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was criminally responsible was tainted by the erroneous belief that psychotic behavior was required for a finding of a lack of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">At the hearing on his motion, the defendant testified that his trial attorney had informed him that the Commonwealth would not pay \u201cfor private psychiatrists\u201d and since he was indigent, an additional examination was not possible. The defendant further testified that his trial attorney also advised him that \u201cany report from an outside psychiatrist would only balance out the report because there were one or two contradictory reports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cTo the extent that the defendant\u2019s motion was based on facts which were neither agreed upon nor apparent on the face of the record, he had the burden of proving such facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>359 Mass. 13, 15 (1971). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>378 Mass. 165, 171 (1979). The defendant did not call his prior attorney to testify at the hearing, and when the prosecutor indicated that he would do so, the defendant invoked the attorney \u2014 client privilege. Neither the motion judge nor the prosecutor forced the issue. See S.J.G. Rule 3:07, DR4-101 (C) (4), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981), allowing a lawyer to disclose \u201c [confidences or secrets necessary ... to defend himself . . . against an accusation of wrongful conduct,\u201d and Proposed' Mass.R.Evid. 502[d][3], providing that \u201c[tjhere is no privilege under this rule . . . [a]s to a communication relevant to an issue of breach of duty by the lawyer to his client or by the client to his lawyer.\u201d The motion judge was not required to believe and obviously did not accept the defendant\u2019s version of his communications with his prior attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">There is no support in the record for the defendant\u2019s claim that Dr. Purtzer\u2019s conclusion, concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility, was untenable because of a reliance upon the absence of psychotic behavior by the defendant. Dr. Purtzer\u2019s conclusion was based upon his stated reasons: (1) the defendant\u2019s behavior was \u201cgoal oriented and rational, given his explanation that he did not want to be caught in a parole violation and thought it proper to give a false name in order to avoid detection\u201d; (2) the defendant\u2019s \u201cown account of the events leading to his arrest formed a picture of very rational goal oriented behavior\u201d; (3) Corry\u2019s report \u201cdoes not give any indication of any sort of bizarre or erratic behavior\u201d; and (4) the facts that the shotgun was under the front seat next to the driver\u2019s side and that a false driver\u2019s license was found in the car, suggest \u201cthat Mr. Bannister\u2019s thoughts and actions were directed toward criminal activity in a rather organized fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The record amply supports the motion judge\u2019s finding that, in consideration \u201cof the case the defense counsel had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>work with and the fact that two doctors had failed to declare the defendant not criminally responsible, defense - counsel\u2019s decision not to seek an independent examination cannot be said to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The defendant also alleges that his previous attorney was ineffective because he failed to object to certain testimony (concerning numerous other incidents of the defendant\u2019s misconduct as well as allegations of crimes never proved) and to file motions to suppress evidence (the physical evidence found in the car and the defendant\u2019s statements at the time of his arrest). He contends that these failures cannot be attributed to tactical decisions. The motion judge, however, found that \u201cin light of the overwhelming evidence against him, the defendant and his counsel made a determination prior to trial that the defendant would testify, that he would disclose his past history of arrest, incarceration, treatment at Bridgewater State Hospital, and past erratic behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We see no error in the motion judge\u2019s finding that defense counsel\u2019s decision, to make full disclosure of the defendant\u2019s past, provided an explanation for those actions now characterized by the defendant as \u201cfailures.\u201d The finding is supported by the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial (the trial transcripts were before the motion judge as exhibits), see part 3 of this opinion, <em>infra, </em>as well as at the hearing on the motion. Defense counsel\u2019s actions were consistent with the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>to raise the defense of a lack of criminal responsibility through lay witnesses, including the defendant. Whether that decision was wise is not the question, and even if it were, it is not easily answered. All that can be said with certainty is that the strategy was unsuccessful, but that is not to say that the conduct of the attorney was \u201cmeasurably below that\u201d set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">One further claim does require us to consider whether the defendant was harmed. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence defense counsel made an opening statement to the jury in which he stated that it was the defendant\u2019s burden to prove his lack of criminal responsibility and to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The error remained uncorrected until the trial judge gave his final instructions to the jury,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at which time he squarely placed the burden of proof as to all elements of the crimes, including criminal responsibility, upon the Commonwealth. Further, the misstatement of the law reflects that defense counsel had assumed a burden that was not his, rather than an instance of a failure to take required action. In view of the trial judge\u2019s instructions and the fact that defense counsel\u2019s misconception would have led him to greater and not lesser effort, we are satisfied that the misstatement of the law did not result in prejudice to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">3. <em>Evidentiary Rulings by the Trial Judge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial judge erroneously excluded testimony from lay witnesses, including the defendant, on the issue of his psychiatric condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The defendant began his testimony by explaining that he had possession of the sawed-off shotgun to protect himself from \u201cpolice departments and things that affected the course of my life that I thought other people were mishandling.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Upon the prosecutor\u2019s objection, the trial judge advised defense counsel, at side-bar, that the defendant\u2019s testimony that he lacked criminal responsibility due to his belief that he had been imprisoned falsely was \u201cnot the way to show a lack of responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The defendant was allowed, however, to give a rambling account of a series of arrests and imprisonments, all claimed to be unjustified, and a history of alleged police surveillance. He also testified that he had purchased the shotgun at the request of a woman with whom he was living, that she had tried to shoot him and instead destroyed one of the walls in their apartment, and that he was taking the gun to sell it when he was arrested by the troopers, who he be-, lieved had been waiting specifically for him. Although he believed that there was \u201ca good possibility\u201d that he was .mentally ill, he nonetheless was convinced that the police were \u201cframing\u201d him. The defendant stated that he was somewhat clairvoyant but his powers were \u201chindered\u201d by the harassment that he was experiencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Defense counsel next called Anthony Pappas, who stated that he had known the defendant for about four or five years and that he had heard him testify that morning. Defense counsel then put the following two questions to the witness: (1) \u201c[I]s any of what he testified to here this morning similar or the same as things you heard from him before?\u201d; and, (2) \u201c[Djirecting your attention to a particular occasion, did you have a discussion with him concerning the letter [not in evidence] he wrote?\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s objections to the questions were sustained for numerous reasons, including that the questions called for \u201ctestimony from a friend as to mental competency.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We regard the judge\u2019s refusal to allow these questions as rulings primarily based on the form and obscurity of the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The defendant claims that the sustaining of the prosecutor\u2019s objections was a rejection by the trial judge of the defendant\u2019s right to present an insanity defense through lay witnesses. See <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 764-765 (1977) (\u201cA defendant seeking to assert the defense of insanity may do so in a number of ways .... A defendant may have a prior history of mental disorders and treatment and may offer evidence of the same through medical records with or without expert witnesses; ... he might argue that the very facts of the alleged crime create an inference of mental disease or defect; lay witnesses may testify as to their observations of the defendant prior to, during or subsequent to the time of the alleged crime . . . .\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laliberty, </em>373 Mass. 238, 245 (1977), and cases therein discussed. We see nothing in the trial judge\u2019s rulings indicative of a refusal to allow the defendant to raise his defense without expert testimony. Rather, the judge correctly ruled that lay witnesses could not offer their opinions as to the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Even if these rulings could be viewed as erroneous, the defendant has shown no harm. He argues in his brief that the rulings prevented him from eliciting testimony \u201cto corroborate that Mr. Bannister had been talking to television sets, receiving messages directed to him from advertisers on the radio, prognosticating the future accurately, living in a movie, and had been involved in paranoid episodes with the FBI and the CIA for many years.\u201d Trial counsel made no offer of proof as to these facts, and nothing on the record shows that the testimony would have been given but for the trial judge\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">During his closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor stated: \u201cIf they had a psychiatrist they would have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>him here, you can be sure, or they would have a battery of psychiatrists and given you expert testimony as to his mental condition as to criminal responsibility, but there were none before you. And this is to be weighed, I ask you, very seriously.\u201d This remark should not have been made. Cf. <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>United States, </em>332 F.2d 23, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1964), where the prosecutor\u2019s comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to produce a fingerprint expert prompted an immediate instruction to the jury that the burden of proof was on the government and not the defendant. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niziolek, </em>380 Mass. 513, 522 (1980), quoting from <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>State, </em>36 Md. App. 196, 208 (1977), explaining the difference between an improper shifting of the burden of proof and the drawing of a permissible inference adverse to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Defense counsel did not object to the statement, and based upon our scrutiny of the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions (see part 5 of this opinion, infra), which contained adequate discussion of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof in respect of both the defendant\u2019s commission of the acts constituting the crimes charged and his criminal responsibility therefor, we are satisfied that there is no substantial risk that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">5. <em>The Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The defendant views the trial judge\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt as inadequate because it did not include all of the \u201ctime-tested language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 [1850].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>371 Mass. 203, 209 (1976). While adherence to that language has been urged repeatedly, see e g. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 130 n.12 (1977), insubstantial deviations do not amount to automatic error. The trial judge instructed the jury: (1) that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>doubt and to a moral certainty\u201d; (2) that a guilty verdict \u201ccannot be based upon mere probability or speculation or suspicion\u201d; (3) that \u201ccircumstances of suspicion, no matter how great or strong, are not evidence of guilt\u201d; and (4) that the defendant \u201cmust be acquitted unless the facts of his guilt are proved to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt to the exclusion of every reasonable theory consistent with innocence.\u201d His remark about \u201ca <em>subtle </em>and clear conviction of guilt\u201d (emphasis supplied) cannot be exaggerated and construed, as the defendant urges, as an instruction that \u201ca subtle feeling of guilt is enough to convict.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statement is, at best, a \u201clapse . . . [which] should not be held fatal . . . when the charge is read as a whole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 198 (1981), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Quoting the trial judge\u2019s instruction on criminal responsibility, the defendant notes that he used the term \u201cmental capacity\u201d eleven times without using the \u201cclearer and more understandable\u201d language employed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-555 (1967). We do not approve of appellate counsel\u2019s distortion, through the use of ellipses, of the trial judge\u2019s statement to the jury which was in words almost identical to those set out in the <em>McHoul </em>case. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Nor did the trial judge commit error in not giving an instruction as to the consequence of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, as no request for such an instruction was made. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mutina, </em>366 Mass. 810, 823 n.12 (1975) (\u201c[T]he defendant, on his timely request, is entitled to an instruction regarding the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">By leading into his instructions on criminal responsibility with the statement that \u201c[t]he defense in this case, as I un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>derstand it, is that he was not criminally responsible,\u201d the trial judge is claimed to have \u201cbelittled\u201d and \u201cdemeaned\u201d the defendant\u2019s defense as well as having engaged in \u201ca clear due process violation.\u201d Additionally, the trial judge is alleged to have demonstrated bias by charging that the Commonwealth\u2019s lay testimony was sufficient to convict but failing \u201cto charge the obverse.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both contentions lack merit. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 868 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-13\"> The defendant was also convicted on numerous other indictments arising out of this same incident. Those convictions were placed on file with the consent of the defendant and are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> The motion was not heard by the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\"> Our conclusion is equally applicable to the defendant\u2019s claim that his attorney\u2019s failure to call either Dr. Purtzer or Dr. Michelson to testify, especially the latter, constituted ineffective assistance, particularly in view of the decision not to seek an independent examination. On this point, the motion judge found that the failure to call either doctor, when Dr. Michelson had offered no opinion as to the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility and Dr. Purtzer\u2019s opinion was adverse to the defendant, was a \u201clogical\u201d decision rather than incompetent advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Moreover, defense counsel did not forgo raising the defense of a lack of criminal responsibility but instead, as discussed in part 3 of this opinion, <em>infra, </em>presented it through lay testimony. See <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 765-766 (1977); <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 104, 112 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> The time span was short. The defendant\u2019s case consists of approximately thirty-two pages of transcript.

The record of her testimony reveals no exclusion of any of the testimony sought to be elicited from her by defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> The defendant\u2019s present counsel makes no claim against prior counsel concerning any failure to elicit this testimony. In this respect, we note that at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the defendant offered neither affidavits nor testimony as to what the witness would have been prepared to relate at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> The defendant\u2019s present counsel does not ask that we consider prior counsel\u2019s failure to object as reflecting upon his competency, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 867, 868 (1980), and even were we to do so, we would conclude that there was no prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\"> We think that the trial judge used the word \u201csettled\u201d rather than \u201csubtle\u201d and that the error is in the transcript. However, as no motion was presented under Mass.R.A.P. 8 (e), 365 Mass. 851 (1974), we will take the transcript as we find it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> In commenting upon the fact that neither the Commonwealth nor the defendant called upon experts and stressing that neither was required to do so, the trial judge also stated: \u201cThe inquiry is not the quantity of evidence on this particular issue, as to any issue, but it is on the quality or believability of the evidence. Even if the defendant or the Commonwealth had produced psychiatrists on the one side or the other to testify . . . you would not be bound to accept the testimony of any of those experts. Experts are offered to assist the jury in reaching a verdict, and their testimony, you are not compelled to follow.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
