It was there decided (at 438) that personnel and medical files or information were \u201cabsolutely exempt from disclosure\u201d under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (providing for disclosure of public records), read together with G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, as amended by St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 1. Clause Twenty-sixth defines how the term \u201cpublic record\u201d shall be construed when it appears in the General Laws. The particular exempting provision (one of nine in clause Twenty-sixth) here applicable reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u201c(c) personnel and medical files or information; also any other materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The <em>Globe </em>opinion held that the language following the semicolon is an independent clause, so that the personal privacy test there provided for does not apply to \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information.\u201d This was a conclusion founded not only in punctuation, but in statutory context and legislative history as well. <em>Id. </em>at 432-434.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">It is sufficient to resolve the case now before us if we determine that the records to which the plaintiffs desire access are \u201cpersonnel files or information,\u201d and, as such, exempt from inspection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge decided that they were and allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974), Judgment entered for the defendants and the plaintiffs appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">When they initiated this action Connolly and Kropp were students at the University and members of the Student Senate Academic Affairs Committee, the publisher of a course and teacher evaluation guide. On the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>pleadings and extensive discovery, the motion judge was able to find it undisputed that the materials which the plaintiffs wished to examine consisted of evaluations of teachers and courses which faculty, as a matter of University policy, were required to solicit from students. These evaluations varied in form: narrative-style opinions of teacher and course; number ratings from one to five or one to ten as to various elements of the pedagogical process;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and questionnaires calling for responses which a computer could score.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Responses to the various evaluation inquiries were to guide the instructor toward self-improvement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to assist the University administrations in making personnel decisions such as reappointment, promotion, merit raises and tenure. The record contains various memoranda from the University\u2019s vice-chancellor for academic affairs to deans, directors, department heads, chairmen, and chairmen of departmental and school personnel committees which consider how the teaching evaluation data might be disseminated (e.g., in synopsis form). No procedure for publication of the information on a University-wide basis was ever implemented and any tentative policy so to do has been abandoned. Nine academic departments permitted faculty members to retain the evaluation data as their own property. Six departments, not named as defendants, voluntarily released the evaluation information.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">While considering a similar question under analogous provisions of Federal law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cevaluations of [a person\u2019s] work performance\u201d as matter which ordinarily would appear in personnel files, together with academic records, where the subject was born, the names of his parents and where he lived from time to time. <em>Department of the Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 377 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In other cases arising under the Freedom of Information Act courts have determined that evaluations were a component of personnel records and should be so regarded in judging whether they were subject to disclosure. <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>383 F. Supp. 1049, 1055 (D.D.C. 1974), aff'd, 523 F.2d 1136 (D.C. Cir. 1975). <em>Columbia Packing Co. </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Agriculture, </em>417 F. Supp. 651, 655 (D. Mass. 1976), aff'd, 563 F.2d 495 (1st Cir. 1977). <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Usery, </em>426 F. Supp. 150, 167 (D.D.C. 1976). <em>Associated Dry Goods Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>455 F. Supp. 802, 815 (S.D. N.Y. 1978) (material such as employment applications, educational attainments, disciplinary records, payroll records, work evaluations, absences and excuses for absences characterized as the essence of a personnel file). <em>Celmins </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of the Treasury, </em>457 F. Supp. 13, 15-17 (D.D.C. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Raw data appraising the job performance of individuals \u2014 which is what we are dealing with here \u2014 is particularly personal and volatile. In light of the cases discussed, we have no difficulty concluding that the student evaluations of teachers are personnel information and, as such, outside the category of a public record. Studies which digest raw data and which deal with departmental, rather than individual, performance might fall into a different category.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We are not persuaded to a different opinion because it was at one time contemplated by the University that results of the questionnaires be made available to students in <em>sum</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>mary form, </em>that some departments made no use of the questionnaires for evaluation purposes, and that some faculty members released evaluations made of them by their students. None of those circumstances changes the nature of the file fodder sought to be obtained. To the extent that there was partial (and not significant in percentage terms) disclosure by certain teachers, this does not vitiate the general policy which the University has chosen to apply to the personnel material. <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 63 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> The records in the <em>Globe </em>case were exempt because they were \u201cmedical files or information.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">E.g., knowledge of subject, effectiveness of teaching, responsiveness to students\u2019 particular interests, availability outside of classroom, enthusiasm, fairness of the examinations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> It is equally likely that the returns might induce profound depression or euphoria on the part of the subjects, depending on the degree of scorn or praise served up by the student critics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (1976). Significant differences between the punctuation of the Federal and State provisions were discussed in <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. at 432-434. In consequence, administrators and courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>considering requests under Federal law for disclosure of information from personnel tiles must engage in a balancing test between the public interest in disclosure and the right to privacy of the individual who is the subject of the personnel file. Under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), and <em>Globe, </em>no such balancing test is required in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
