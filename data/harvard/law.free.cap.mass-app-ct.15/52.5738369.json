Coletta, an undercover State trooper, and seven charging him with the unlawful distribution of Valium and Mellaril to Coletta and to one Herbert Harding, an undercover State trooper who had posed as Coletta\u2019s boyfriend. On appeal, the defendant argues: (1) that a physician cannot be convicted of distributing rather than dispensing controlled substances where the evidence shows, at best, that the prescriptions were not issued in accordance with acceptable medical practice; (2) that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H, is unconstitutionally vague in that it failed to give him notice that his touchings of Coletta were indecent and, therefore, criminal acts; and (3) that the verdicts of guilty are against the weight of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">1. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The evidence would warrant the jury in finding the following facts as to each of the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">a. <em>July 17, 1980: Indecent Assault and Battery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Coletta went to the defendant\u2019s medical office, gave a false name, address, and occupation, and made a request for medical attention for a pretended ailment. She told the defendant that four months earlier she had undergone orthopedic surgery on her toe and that she was experiencing discomfort when she wore high-heeled shoes. The defendant examined Coletta\u2019s foot and took her blood pressure. He placed a stethoscope on her left breast, asked her about her smoking, and moved the stethoscope to her back. As he did this, he fondled her right breast with his free hand, and Coletta pushed his arm away.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When he completed the examination, the defendant gave Coletta prescriptions for ampi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>cillin (for bronchitis), Fastin (to control her weight should she attempt to give up her smoking habit), and propoxphene (for her foot pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">b. <em>August 12, 1980: Indecent Assault and Battery, Valium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Coletta went to the defendant\u2019s office and told him that nothing was wrong but she would like a prescription for Valium. The defendant examined Coletta, again using his stethoscope and fondling her breast. He gave her a prescription for a one-month\u2019s supply of Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">c. <em>August 21, 1980: Valium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Coletta asked the defendant, at his office, for more Valium, explaining that she had given some from her earlier prescription to a girlfriend and had taken the rest herself. The defendant admonished her about giving away controlled drugs, conducted a brief physical examination, and gave Coletta another prescription for Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">d. <em>September 11, 1980: Valium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Coletta went to the defendant\u2019s office and told him that she was neither nervous nor in pain but that she wanted Percodan. The defendant examined her, fondling her breast and placing a stethoscope directly over it, and running his hands along her thighs as he spoke with her. At the end of the examination, the defendant gave Coletta a prescription. It was not until after she left the defendant\u2019s office that she realized the prescription was for Percogesic and not Percodan. Coletta returned to the defendant\u2019s office and renewed her demands for Percodan, but the defendant refused, telling her that he could lose his license. She then requested more Valium. The defendant wrote her a prescription for ninety Valium, \u201cmarked it off in two refills,\u201d according to Coletta, and told her that he did not want to see her \u201cfor a while.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">e. <em>September 16, 1980: Mellaril.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">Persisting in her efforts to secure a prescription for Percodan, Coletta returned to the defendant\u2019s office. Again, the defendant refused to give her Percodan unless she was in pain. When the defendant asked what she had done with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the Valium, Coletta replied that she had traded it for Percodan. She explained that Percodan had a street value two or three times that of Valium. Coletta told the defendant that she \u201cwould do anything\u201d for a Percodan prescription. Remaining steadfast, the defendant refused and, instead, gave her a prescription for Mellaril.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">f. <em>September 29, 1980: Indecent Assault and Battery, Valium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Coletta went to the defendant\u2019s office and told him that she wanted a prescription for either Valium or Mellaril. The defendant examined her, fondling her breasts, rubbing her spine, touching her buttocks, and reaching between her legs. She told him she \u201cwould do anything\u201d for Percodan, but he refused, and gave her a prescription for Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">g. <em>October 8, 1980: Indecent Assault and Battery, Valium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">When Coletta went to the defendant\u2019s office and asked for more Valium, she also told him that she again had traded her prescribed Valium for Percodan. Coletta told the defendant that her boyfriend was with her and that he, too, wanted Valium. The defendant examined her, fondling her breasts. When he tried to reach beneath her underpants, Coletta was able to stop him by tightening the waistband to her dungarees. The defendant gave her a prescription for Valium and then saw Harding, who had given a false name. Harding told the defendant that nothing was wrong, that \u201cI just like to do [Valium]. I only do one a day, and I wouldn\u2019t be back more than once a month.\u201d The defendant took Harding\u2019s blood pressure, conducted a brief physical examination, and gave him a prescription for sixty Valium.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">h. <em>Acceptable Medical Practices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">When Coletta left the defendant\u2019s office on July 17, she went to see Dr. Eugene Tyrell and asked that he examine her. Dr. Tyrell testified that on that date Coletta had a slight swelling on one toe. Her lungs were normal and her chest clear. She had no signs of bronchitis or any other respiratory disease. Dr. Tyrell stated that it would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>appropriate to check the torso of a twenty-five year old woman as part of an examination for the deformity of the toe he had seen in examining Coletta. Dr. Tyrell was asked about each of the above-described incidents, and we need not reiterate his replies. It is sufficient to relate only that he testified that none of the defendant\u2019s actions, in respect to both the touchings and the prescriptions, was consistent with acceptable medical practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Dr. Daniel Weiss testified that Valium is prescribed to tranquilize or relieve nervous distress and that it is not an acceptable medical practice to give a controlled substance to a patient who has no condition requiring medication. He also stated that it was not medically acceptable to substitute a tranquilizer for a pain killer (Percogesic) or to prescribe such amounts of Valium as the defendant had authorized within the time period here involved. Dr. Weiss further testified that it was unacceptable medical practice to ask patients what type of medication they wanted or to give medication upon request: \u201cMedicine should be prescribed for a specific reason and with specific intent and for a specific cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">2. \u201cDistribute\u201d <em>and \u201cDispense. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The defendant argues that he cannot be convicted of unlawful distribution because the only permissible charge against a physician who delivers controlled substances in a manner inconsistent with acceptable medical practices is unlawful dispensing. As support for this proposition, he relies upon the definitions of \u201cdispense\u201d and \u201cdistribute,\u201d as set out in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. 222, 225-228 (1976), holding that a phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>sician who unlawfully issues a prescription may be charged with dispensing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">As the defendant did not raise this issue in the trial court on either a motion to dismiss or a motion for a required finding of not guilty, brought under Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(c) and 25, 378 Mass. 872, 896 (1979), respectively, our consideration is confined to whether the indictments fail \u201cto charge an offense.\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 47A, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 39, or whether there is a substantial risk that a miscarriage of justice otherwise has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">There is no doubt that the indictments brought against the defendant under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(o), Valium, and \u00a7 32D(a), Mellaril, \u201ccharge an offense.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pentz, </em>247 Mass. 500, 506 (1924); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palladino, 358 </em>Mass. 28, 31 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 194, 195-196 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Nor do we see any possible risk of a miscarriage of justice arising out of the indictments alleging distribution rather than dispensing. The defendant did not move for a bill of particulars. Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(b), 378 Mass. 872 (1979). The theory of the Commonwealth\u2019s case \u2014 that the defendant delivered Valium and Mellaril in a manner not consistent with acceptable medical practices and which was, therefore, unlawful \u2014 was evident from the start. The defendant\u2019s position at trial, as demonstrated by the cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, the defendant\u2019s testimony, and the closing argument to the jury, was that the drugs were prescribed for valid medical reasons. The trial judge instructed the jury on unlawful dispensing, and the defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no objection to the charge. The defendant makes no showing or argument that he was prejudiced by the now alleged defect in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">3. <em>Evidence of Unlawful Dispensing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Without having filed a motion under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(a) or (b), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), the defendant argues that the Commonwealth failed to show that he did not write the prescriptions in accordance with acceptable medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>cal practice or with the intention of achieving a legitimate medical objective. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. at 232. He contends that the evidence equally sustains two contradictory inferences, that the defendant exercised his independent medical judgment or that he acted outside the scope of acceptable medical treatment, and, therefore, his convictions on the drug charges must be set aside. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eramo, </em>377 Mass. 912 (1979), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Looking to the previously recited evidence presented by the Commonwealth, we conclude that there is no substantial risk that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>371 Mass. at 232-233; <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 309 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lozano, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 872 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">4. <em>Entrapment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The defendant next argues that if the evidence was sufficient to show that his actions relative to the drug charges were criminal, his convictions nonetheless must be reversed because he was entrapped by Coletta and Harding.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The defendant did not argue to the trial judge pursuant to rule 25 that \u201c[t]he conduct of [Coletta and Harding] was ... so \u2018shocking or offensive\u2019 as to constitute entrapment as matter of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lozano, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 873. The trial judge instructed the jury on the issue and elements of entrapment, even though he had not been requested to do so by the defendant\u2019s then attorney, who also took no objection to the charge. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). Based upon the evidence presented by the Commonwealth, we conclude that there was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in putting the issue to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 650-653 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lozano, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">5. <em>Unconstitutional Application of G. L. c. 265, </em>\u00a7 <em>13H.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 13H, inserted by St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 5, provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]hoever com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>mits an indecent assault and battery on a person who has attained age fourteen\u201d shall be subject to criminal sanctions. The defendant contends that \u00a7 13H \u201cis unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case.\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument does not concern his status as a physician; rather, it is only that \u201che was given no fair warning that it is a criminal act in Massachusetts to touch the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area of a female.\u201d He focuses his argument on the word \u201cindecent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Simply put, considering the defendant\u2019s actions and the language of \u00a7 13H as \u201cmeasured by common understanding and practices,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 497 (1971), we conclude that \u201cthere would be little disagreement as to whether the defendant\u2019s conduct offended the common understanding and practices of\u201d indecent assault and battery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 590 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">6. <em>Indecent Assault and Battery Convictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Notwithstanding his failure to have raised these issues before the trial judge under rule 25, the defendant argues that his convictions on the indecent assault and battery indictments must be set aside because: (1) assuming that Coletta did not consent to the touchings, the Commonwealth failed to prove the necessary elements of force and violence; (2) the evidence shows that Coletta consented to the touchings; and (3) the evidence shows that the touchings were medically necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The defendant\u2019s claim that force and violence are necessary elements of a criminal assault and battery is wrong and requires no discussion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 305 (1980). As to the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence for the jury to consider whether Coletta consented to the touchings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and whether they were medically necessary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 717 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\"> Coletta was dressed in dungarees and a scoop-neck jersey, and she was not wearing a bra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\"> General Laws, c. 94C, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1972, c. 806, \u00a7 3, defines \u201cdispense\u201d as \u201cto deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject or to the agent of an ultimate user or research subject by a practitioner or pursuant to the order of a practitioner, including the prescribing and administering of a controlled substance and the packaging, labeling, or compounding necessary for such delivery.\u201d Section 1 defines \u201cdistribute\u201d as \u201cto deliver other than by administering or dispensing a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> The defendant makes special reference to the acts of August 12,1980, and argues that Coletta\u2019s testimony shows that she did not believe that she had been the victim of an indecent assault and battery on that date. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>have reviewed the transcript and regard the defendant\u2019s interpretation of Coletta\u2019s testimony as strained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
