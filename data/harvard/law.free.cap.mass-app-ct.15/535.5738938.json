L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He brought this action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>declaratory relief and sought payment of his salary and other benefits withheld during the period of his suspension. A judgment entered in the Superior Court awarding the plaintiff the amount of his withheld salary and declaring that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201c1. The plaintiff\u2019s indictment on April 10, 1981, by a Suffolk County Grand Jury on charges of possession of a controlled substance, Class B (cocaine) with intent to distribute did not amount to \u2018misconduct\u2019 in his public \u2018office or employment\u2019 as a schoolteacher in the Boston Public Schools because the alleged criminal conduct was unconnected to his school-related duties, activities or contacts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201c2. Consequently, the defendants had no authority under M. G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25 to suspend the plaintiff without pay during the pendency of the criminal proceedings against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The facts are undisputed. As recited by the judge, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s indictment for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute followed as a result of his late-evening arrest outside a Boston tavern and a subsequent search of his apartment, where 2.8 grams of cocaine were seized. There has never been an allegation, in the indictment or otherwise, that the plaintiff engaged in misconduct on school grounds, during work hours, or with school personnel or students.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The issue before us is whether the plaintiff was indicted for misconduct \u201cin . . . office or employment\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">An indictment for a crime arising from an employee\u2019s off-duty conduct is not generally considered misconduct in office under G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>377 Mass. 212, 213 &amp; n.3 (1979). There are, however, circumstances where the crime charged, no matter where or when performed, is so inimical to the duties inherent in the employment that an indictment for that crime is for misconduct in office. Cf. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 482 (1921) (removal of district attorney under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>308 Mass. 619, 627, 629 (1941) (\u201cmisconduct and mal-administration in their offices,\u201d Massachusetts Constitution, Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 2, art. 8); <em>Bunte </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>361 Mass. 71, 76 (1972) (\u201cmisconduct in office\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 6, could be shown by the \u201cintentional violation of a known and significant rule or duty inherent in the obligations of [the] office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">For example, where a police officer is indicted, suspension \u201cunder such a procedure as G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] is nearly automatic.\u201d <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Court of the Brighton Dist., </em>369 Mass. 166, 173, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Patuto </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv., </em>429 U.S. 845 (1976). As put, albeit in another context, in <em>Huntoon </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>349 Mass. 9, 14 (1965), \u201cWhen a police officer is formally charged with participation in criminal activities, his capability of performing his responsibilities to the public is gravely challenged. An entity of government cannot permit him to exercise his powers as a police officer until the doubt raised by the challenge is dispelled.\u201d Cf. <em>Mayor of Medford </em>v. <em>First Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>249 Mass. 465, 470 (1924) (off duty conduct may be of such a nature as to show policeman \u201cunfit to continue to act as a police officer\u201d); <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 42 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1048 (1976) (inquiry into private matters of police officers appropriate in areas where \u201cprivate conduct may be deemed to have spilled over into the realm of official concern\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Teachers, too, are in a position of special public trust. As role models for our children they have an \u201cextensive and peculiar opportunity to impress [their] attitude and views\u201d upon their pupils. <em>Faxon </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>331 Mass. 531, 534 (1954). More particularly, they also have special obligations to their pupils as to drugs. This is so not only because of the \u201cfrightening increase of drug use among the students,\u201d Tenth Interim Report of the Special Commission on Drug Abuse, 1974 House Doc. No. 5308, at 11, but because G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1974, c. 753, specifically requires that \u201cinstruction as to the effects of . . . narcotics on the human system ... be given to all pupils in all schools under public control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In view of this statutory duty and the legitimate concern over the use of drugs by students, we think it within the discretion of the school committee to consider the indictment for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute to be an \u201cindictment for misconduct ... in office.\u201d The school committee could reasonably have decided that the plaintiff\u2019s alleged conduct with respect to drugs violated a \u201cknown and significant. . . duty inherent in the obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>of his office,\u201d <em>Bunte </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>361 Mass. at 76, which severely impaired his value as a teacher and was in direct conflict \u201cwith the message his teaching should impart,\u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Machias Sch. Comm., </em>385 A.2d 53, 56 (Me. 1978). See <em>Tomerlin </em>v. <em>Dade County Sch. Bd., </em>318 So. 159, 160 (Fla. App. 1975); <em>Wishart v. McDonald, </em>500 F.2d 1110, 1115 (1st Cir. 1974). Cf. <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Haverhill, </em>352 Mass. 516, 518 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We recognize that <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>377 Mass. at 213 n.3, indicates that an indictment of a deputy sheriff, an officer of the court, \u201carising from the alleged bribery of the mayor of Revere,\u201d is not an indictment for misconduct in office under c. 268A, \u00a7 25. Although there is considerable force in the plaintiff\u2019s argument, adopted by the trial judge, that such an indictment is incongruous with the position of trust held by a deputy sheriff, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 54; see also <em>Massachusetts Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>351 Mass. 321, 323, 326 (1966), we think <em>Tobin </em>is to be distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In addition to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 1, which provides for instruction as to drugs, we note that statutes from colonial days forward recognize the unique position of teachers as examples to our youth and charge them to \u201cexert their best endeavors to impress on the minds of children and youth committed to their care and instruction\u201d the values basic to our society. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 30. See also G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, as amended through St. 1981, c. 96, requiring school committees to have \u201cfull and satisfactory evidence of [teachers\u2019] moral character,\u201d and G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38G.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">This special role of teachers on impressionable and not fully tutored minds distinguishes them from other public officials and, we think, also informs the term \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d as applied to teachers. For this reason, and because of the specific statutory duty of drug education imposed on schools in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 1, we view an indictment of a teacher for a drug felony to be sufficiently different from the circumstances in <em>Tobin </em>for that case not to govern here.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 25, as we have construed it, provides a sensible supplement by the Legislature to the provisions of G. L. c. 71. Judicial interpretation of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>indicates that the remedy in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D, does not preclude the application of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a725. In <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, </em>348 Mass. 605, 608 (1965), the argument that G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59, was applicable only to persons to whom the civil service procedures of c. 31 do not apply, was soundly rejected: \u201cChapter 30, \u00a7 59, is dominant in its purpose and its terms.\u201d See also <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Commerce &amp; Dev., </em>350 Mass. 193, 195, cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1001 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">If the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, were adopted (extending <em>Tobin </em>to this case), the only remedy available to remove a teacher indicted for a drug felony from the payroll, or perhaps even from the classroom, see <em>Setterlund </em>v. <em>Groton-Dunstable Regional Sch. Comm., </em>382 Mass. 328, 331 (1981) (assignment which excludes teacher \u201cfrom the job or category of teacher\u201d constitutes dismissal), would be dismissal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. As we indicated earlier, suspension under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D, may be effected for only one month. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>While dismissal has occurred upon indictment alone, <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Bourne, </em>170 Mass. 289, 294-295 (1898) (school superintendent dismissed because of indictment for adultery), in some cases that may be a draconian remedy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t will often make for sense and fair play to wait and see what happens under the indictment.\u201d <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Brighton Dist., </em>369 Mass. at 173. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>101 Ariz. 268, 273 (1966) (mere bringing of criminal charges not sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>cause to cancel contract). Cf. <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>160 N.J. Sup. 333, 341 (1978) (equitable considerations involved if disciplinary proceeding is to continue prior to trial). Moreover, as pointed out in <em>Bessette, </em>348 Mass. at 608, \u201cadministrative hearings\u201d and court review may be inappropriate \u201cfor suspension because of indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the matter remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a new judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-13\"> General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 25, inserted by St. 1972, c. 257, provides in relevant part: \u201cAn officer or employee of a county, city, town or district, howsoever formed, including, but not limited to, regional school districts and regional planning districts, or of any department, board, commission or agency thereof may, during any period such officer or employee is under indictment for misconduct in such office or employment or for misconduct in any elective or appointive public office, trust or employment at any time held by him, be suspended by the appointing authority, whether or not such appointment was subject to approval in any manner. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cAny person so suspended shall not receive any compensation or salary during the period of suspension ....</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">\u201cIf the criminal proceedings against the person suspended are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty on any of the charges on which he was indicted, his suspension shall be forthwith removed, and he shall receive all compensation or salary due him for the period of his suspension . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\"> We take notice of the fact that Dupree was convicted under the indictment, sentenced thereon, and that his appeal from the conviction is now pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The school committee proceeded under G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, as the statute providing for suspension of teachers, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42D, appears not to authorize a suspension for a period exceeding one month. As pointed out in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>346 Mass. 394, 396 (1963), prior to St. 1914, c. 714, \u00a7 4, \u201cthe right of the school committee to dismiss a teacher for any good cause appears to have been absolute.\u201d The power to dismiss included the power to suspend. <em>Ibid. </em>At the time of the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>case, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 (the dismissal statute), specifically permitted suspension, providing: \u201cNeither this nor the preceding section shall affect the right of a committee to suspend a teacher or superintendent for unbecoming conduct . . . .\u201d Shortly after the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>case, St. 1966, c. 185, \u00a7 1, amended \u00a7 42, \u201cby striidng out . . . the words \u2018to suspend a teacher or superintendent for unbecoming conduct\u2019 . . . .\u201d Section 3 of c. 185 inserted c. 71, \u00a7 42D, which limits the period of teacher suspension to one month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 59, is nearly identical to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, except that it applies to State employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We note that 603 Code Mass.
