L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, to construct sixty units of low or moderate income housing on a ten acre site on Homestead Avenue in Greenfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board voted unanimously to deny the permit. Daddario appealed to HAC. After hearing, HAC vacated the board\u2019s decision and ordered the board to issue Daddario a comprehensive permit. The board sought judicial review (pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14) of HAC\u2019s determination that a comprehensive permit should issue, and a declaration (pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A) that a development which would result in Greenfield\u2019s having more than ten percent of its total housing units devoted to low or moderate income housing cannot lawfully qualify for a comprehensive permit. On cross motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>judgment (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 56[a] &amp; [b], 365 Mass. 824 [1974]), a judge of the Superior Court filed a written memorandum which, in pertinent part, (a) upheld HAC\u2019s decision; (b) found no violation of the enabling legislation by HAC\u2019s issuance of a comprehensive permit for a project which would result in Greenfield\u2019s having more than the ten percent of low or moderate income housing specified in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20; and (c) determined that no valid planning objections were shown by the board sufficient to outweigh the regional need for low or moderate income housing. Although the judge\u2019s memorandum disposed of all the issues raised in the rule 56 motions, ordered HAC\u2019s decision affirmed, and directed the entry of judgment, a judgment was never entered, as called for by Mass.R.Civ.P. 58(a), 365 Mass. 826 (1974). Because of this, we must dismiss the appeal. Nevertheless, there are circumstances which warrant discussion of the merits of the appeal. These circumstances include the fact that the passage of more than three years since Daddario first sought a comprehensive permit may jeopardize the entire project\u2019s feasibility. Additionally, the board\u2019s consideration of other projects may be hampered by confusion over whether the town has sufficient low and moderate income housing to meet the \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d criteria of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. For these reasons, and to further the economical administration of justice, we will discuss the merits and leave it to the parties to arrange with the clerk of the Superior Court for the entry of a proper judgment. See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Bendetson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 560-562 (1978); <em>Rubel </em>v. <em>Hayden, Harding &amp; Buchanan, Inc., ante </em>252, 252-253 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">1. <em>The statutory and regulatory scheme. </em>To put in context the questions presented, we first discuss the purposes and operation of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23. That statute (popularly known as the anti-snob zoning act) was enacted to provide expeditious relief from exclusionary local zoning by-laws and practices which might inhibit the construction of low and moderate income housing in the Commonwealth\u2019s cities and towns. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 353-354 (1973) (the <em>Hanover </em>case). Under the statute, an eligible developer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> wishing to construct low or moderate income housing may seek from the local zoning board of appeals a comprehensive permit to develop the project instead of seeking separate approvals from each local board having jurisdiction over the project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 656 (1982) (the <em>Wellesley </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">If the board denies an application for a comprehensive permit, or authorizes a permit on conditions which would make the project uneconomical, the developer may appeal to HAG. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. On appeal, HAG must conduct a de nova review to determine whether the board\u2019s decision is \u201creasonable and consistent with local needs.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23 (inserted by St. 1969, c. 774, \u00a7 1). HAG cannot order the issuance of a comprehensive permit, however, where the locality has fulfilled its minimum low or moderate income housing obligation under one of the criteria set forth in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See the <em>Wellesley </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 657. The critical criterion in this case is the first one \u2014 whether, at the time of the initial application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>a comprehensive permit, low or moderate income housing existed in more than ten percent of the housing units in the latest decennial census of Greenfield.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Assuming the municipality has not met its minimum housing obligation, HAG may still uphold denial of the permit as \u201creasonable and consistent with local needs\u201d if the community\u2019s need for low or moderate income housing is outweighed by valid planning objections to the proposal based on considerations such as health, site, design, and the need to preserve open space. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23. See the <em>Hanover </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 364-367. However, a municipality\u2019s failure to meet its minimum housing obligation \u201cprovide[s] compelling evidence that the regional need for housing does in fact outweigh the objections to the proposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">2. <em>Computation of Greenfield\u2019s minimum housing obligation. </em>The board did not contend before HAG that Greenfield had satisfied its minimum housing obligation under the second and third criteria stated in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The board asserts, however, that at the time of Daddario\u2019s initial application for a permit (December 14, 1979) the town\u2019s stock of low and moderate income housing satisfied the ten percent criterion and that HAC\u2019s determination that the criterion was not met is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The board no longer disputes, as it did initially, HAC\u2019s calculation that on December 14,1979, the town had a total of 7,382 housing units. The parties agree that at least 689 of those units were for the benefit of low or moderate income families. To meet the ten percent criterion, Greenfield needed 738 units of low or moderate income housing. The board claims that HAG improperly failed to count a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>140 units which, it asserts, qualify for treatment as low or moderate income housing. These units consist of 105 units in the Weldon Hotel Project, twenty-seven units financed through the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) \u00a7 502 program,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981), and eight units financed through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \u00a7 235 program,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715Z (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981). The burden of proving that some or all of these units should have been counted towards satisfying the town\u2019s minimum housing obligation was on the board. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(3) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Weldon Hotel Project involves the conversion of a former hotel which has been vacant for a number of years into housing for the elderly. In order for the units in this project to be considered under the ten percent test, they must satisfy the requirements of a regulation of DCA contained in 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(1) (a) (1978), under the caption \u201cHousing Appeals Committee: Criteria for Decisions under . . . G. L. c. 40B, [\u00a7\u00a7] 20-23.\u201d This regulation expands upon the statutory test by providing that the number of low or moderate income housing units shall be \u201cthe number of units, as defined in 760 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 30.02 (i), most recently inventoried by the Department as <em>occupied or available for occupancy or under permit </em>in the city or town prior to the applicant\u2019s initial submission to the local [b]oard; provided that evidence that net additional units <em>have been occupied or have become available for occupancy </em>between the date of the most recent inventory and the date of initial application, shall be considered. The [departmental inventory <em>shall be conclusive </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the number of units up to the time of the most recent inventory prior to initial application.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As of December 14, 1979, the critical date in this case, all that the Weldon Hotel Project had obtained was a Federal rental assistance contract pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a special zoning permit from the board authorizing deviations from the town\u2019s zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">No attack has been made on the validity of regulation \u00a7 31.04(1)(a), which obviously has been promulgated in keeping with the principle \u201cthat the Legislature may delegate to a board or an individual officer the working out of the details of a policy adopted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>326 Mass. 525, 527 (1950). See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 774 (1980). By its plain terms the regulation limits consideration to those units in DCA\u2019s inventory which are \u201coccupied or available for occupancy or under permit\u201d as of the date of the developer\u2019s initial application to the board. It is undisputed that the DCA\u2019s latest inventory prior to December 14, 1979, did not list the Weldon Hotel Project as one which was \u201coccupied or available for occupancy or under permit.\u201d This inventory is conclusive of the status quo as of the date of its making. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(1) (a) (1978). The regulation further provides that \u201cevidence that net additional units have been occupied or have become available for occupancy between the date of the most recent inventory and the date of initial application, shall be considered.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is undisputed that none of the units in the Weldon Hotel Project met this requirement for supplementation of the DCA\u2019s inventory. A reasonable regulation of an administrative agency which is clear and unambiguous on its face must, like a comparable statute, be applied according to its terms. See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 782; <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 446 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The board argues, nevertheless, that the \u201cunder permit\u201d provision in the first clause of regulation \u00a7 31.04(1) (a) should be construed to cover the Weldon Hotel Project because the project\u2019s developer had a special zoning permit at the time of Daddario\u2019s application. We take this as an argument that, despite the language of the regulation, the units should have been included in the applicable inventory because of the existence of the zoning permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">It appears that HAC has consistently interpreted the phrase \u201cunder permit\u201d to mean that a building permit has issued. The interpretation an administrative body gives to its own rule is entitled to deference by a court. <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 302 (1978). HAC\u2019s interpretation of the words \u201cunder permit\u201d recognizes and accounts for the bureaucratic obstacles usually encountered by a developer of governmentally subsidized housing. The grant of a special zoning permit may be one of the first steps in a typically long series of approvals needed for such a project. On the other hand, the issuance of a building permit usually signifies that the project\u2019s construction is imminent. Between the two events a project could be (and many are) abandoned for any number of reasons. Abandonment is much less likely where the project has progressed to the building permit stage, an event which presupposes that detailed plans and specifications have been prepared. Thus, the issuance of a building permit could be deemed of significance in the sense of assuring that the accuracy of the DCA\u2019s inventory will not be distorted by the inclusion of units which may never become available for occupancy. HAC\u2019s interpretation of the words \u201cunder permit\u201d in its computational framework is reasonable and in furtherance of the object sought to be accomplished by the statute. Absence of a building permit for the Weldon Hotel Project on December 14, 1979, is fatal to the board\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>elude that HAC correctly determined that regulation \u00a7 31.04(1) (a) bars the inclusion of any of the 105 Weldon Hotel Project units in the calculation of Greenfield\u2019s minimum low and moderate income housing obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Since the 105 units were properly rejected by HAC, Greenfield could not meet the ten percent test at the applicable time even if the remaining thirty-five units of FmHA \u00a7 502 and HUD \u00a7 235 housing had been counted. As a result, we need not discuss the issues argued by the parties with respect to these units and need not decide whether either category of housing is properly includable in an inventory of low and moderate income housing for purposes of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">3. <em>Units in excess of ten percent. </em>We come to the question whether HAC could lawfully issue a comprehensive permit for a project which will result in Greenfield\u2019s having units in excess of the ten percent requirement. The board argues that HAC can order issuance of a comprehensive permit only for the number of units which would have brought Greenfield precisely to the ten percent. A permit which leads to a larger percentage, in the board\u2019s view, violates HAC\u2019s statutory authority and the Home Rule Amendment, art. 89, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The standard addresses whether \u201clow or moderate income housing exists which is in excess of ten percent of the housing units.\u201d These words manifest a legislative intent that local requirements and regulations are conclusively presumed to be \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d <em>only after </em>a municipality has achieved ten percent low or moderate income housing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are obliged to look to the statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>language as the primary source of its meaning and, when that language is unambiguous, to construe the statute on the basis of what the Legislature has written. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., 373 </em>Mass. 32, 37 (1977). <em>New England Medical Center Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>381 Mass. 748, 749-750 (1980). We do not think the Legislature intended to require piecemeal approval of a project so a municipality can hit the ten percent requirement on the button. An attempt to do so would likely be counterproductive and might adversely affect project planning and feasibility by raising the spectre of a forced scale-down of the number of units planned for particular developments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In our view, G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, authorizes HAC to issue a permit for a project where the completion of the contemplated units will cause the ten percent requirement to be exceeded by a reasonable number.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>We also see nothing in the board\u2019s argument that upholding this permit will violate the Home Rule Amendment which has not already been addressed by the Supreme Judicial Court in the <em>Hanover </em>case, 363 Mass. at 355-360. Lastly, it has not been made to appear that this project is otherwise unreasonable and inconsistent with regional needs because of site, design, open space or other considerations. We conclude that HAC\u2019s decision was proper and consistent with statutory and constitutional requirements. If a judgment had been entered in keeping with the judge\u2019s directions, it would be affirmed. For the reasons discussed earlier as to the defect in the record, however, the entry is</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\"> \u201cLow or moderate income housing\u201d is \u201cany housing subsidized by the federal or state government under any program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute, whether built or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit or limited dividend organization.\u201d G.

This case was decided by HAC under regulations differing substantially from current regulation \u00a7 31.04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\"> This conclusion is reinforced by comparing the third standard in \u00a7 20 (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>which is concerned with whether \u201cthe application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>before the board would result in the commencement of construction of [low or moderate income housing] on sites comprising, more than three tenths of one per cent of [a municipality\u2019s residentially, commercially, and industrially zoned land] area and or ten acres, whichever is larger, in any one calender year.\u201d Unlike the ten percent standard, this standard requires the board to factor in the land use effect of the project under construction and, if the project results in the annual construction land use maximum being surpassed, to reject the request for a permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> We note in passing that the tests in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, once met, do not restrict the municipality from thereafter granting comprehensive permits for further construction of low or moderate income housing. The standards are analogous to a test for determining HAC\u2019s jurisdiction. If any one of them is satisfied, HAC cannot order the issuance of a comprehensive permit over the municipality\u2019s objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> The board hypothesizes that this result would allow HAC to compel a municipality which is but a few units short of meeting its minimum housing obligation to issue a permit for a development of hundreds of units. Although this hypothetical is possible in the abstract, it would not likely develop under practical administration of this statutory scheme. Compliance with the ten percent test relieves a municipality of the necessity of proving that its restrictions are \u201cconsistent with local [low income housing] needs,\u201d but the statute does not require that a noncomplying city or town issue a permit in every case where the ten percent test has not been met. In such a case the statute imposes a general test of reasonableness predicated on the regional need for low and moderate income housing; the number of low income people in the affected municipality; health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and safety considerations; and the promotion of compatible site and building design and preservation of open spaces. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. We think the statute provides an adequate decisional framework for dealing with the problem of proposed developments which could cause a community to overshoot substantially the ten percent benchmark for low and moderate income housing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
