HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">Southern Stone Co., appellee, owns and operates a dolomite rock quarry in Auburn, Alabama. High transportation costs and the bulky product\u2019s low value combine to give appellee a natural monopoly over the supply of raw dolomite rock in the Auburn area. S &amp; M Materials Co., appellant, began life as a wholesaler of agricultural lime, which is derived from dolomite rock. In 1975, appellant decided to integrate backwards, and built a facility in Seale, Alabama for processing dolomite rock into agricultural lime. The decision to locate at Seale \u2014 within appellee\u2019s natural monopoly area \u2014 assumed that appellee would be a dependable supplier of dolomite rock, as it had theretofore been of agricultural lime. But when appellee learned that appellant was manufacturing agricultural lime and selling it as a horizontal competitor, appel-lee raised appellant\u2019s price \u2014 and appellant\u2019s price alone \u2014 for dolomite rock by slightly less than 50%. Appellant circumvented this action for a time by engaging one Bi-City Concrete Co. secretly to act as a broker, purchasing dolomite rock from appellee (at the normal price) and immediately reselling it to appellant. Appellee soon got wind of this scheme, however, and increased Bi-City\u2019s price too.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Claiming that appellee\u2019s selective price increases forced it out of business, appellant brought the instant suit under \u00a7 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following sixteen months of opportunity for discovery, during which time appellee cooperatively responded to appellant\u2019s discovery requests, the trial court entered summary judgment for appellee on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant had adduced no evidence of preferential sales \u201cin commerce.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Pat-man Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a) (1976), prohibits persons \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d from \u201cdiscriminatpng] in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce,\u201d and \u201cwhere the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.\u201d The jurisdictional reach of this statute is far less than the commerce clause would allow. In contrast with the Sherman Act, by which Congress exercised \u201cthe utmost extent of its Constitutional power in restraining trust and monopoly agreements,\u201d <em>United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, </em>322 U.S. 533, 558, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 1176, 88 L.Ed. 1440 (1944); <em>see Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, </em>425 U.S. 738, 743 &amp; n.2, 96 S.Ct. 1848, 48 L.Ed.2d 338 (1976), \u201cthe distinct \u2018in commerce\u2019 language of the Clayton and Robinson-Patman Act[s] . denote[s] only persons or activities within the flow of interstate commerce \u2014 the practical, economic continuity in the generation of goods and services for interstate markets . . . .\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., </em>419 U.S. 186, 195, 95 S.Ct. 392, 398, 42 L.Ed.2d 378 (1974). <em>Accord, United States v. American Building Maintenance Industries, </em>422 U.S. 271, 276, 95 S.Ct. 2150, 45 L.Ed.2d 177 (1975). The \u201cin commerce\u201d requirement, moreover, delimits both the universe of \u201cpersons\u201d who are subject to the Act and the type of transactions that can constitute a violation thereof. Not the alleged violator, merely, but the discrimination sought to be charged must also involve a transaction \u201cin commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In the instant case, appellee clearly is \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(a). Appellee regularly accepts orders for agricultural lime from Georgia customers, and loads it onto trucks bound for that state. It is of no moment that the terms of such shipments are free on board appellee\u2019s quarry, or that title to the goods may pass in Alabama. The obviously interstate character of appellee\u2019s Georgia lime sales cannot be so easily transformed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">But the foregoing conclusion does not end our inquiry, because appellant\u2019s antitrust claim does not relate to agricultural lime. The discrimination for which appellant sues involves the quite different product of dolomite rock, from which lime is made. Section 2(a) applies only to discrimination in price among \u201ccommodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce.\u201d Thus, notwithstanding that appellee is itself \u201cengaged in commerce,\u201d jurisdiction under the statute depends additionally on the existence of a sale \u201cin commerce\u201d of dolomite rock or a commercially fungible product, <em>cf. Fred Meyer, Inc. v. FTC, </em>359 F.2d 351, 359 (9th Cir. 1966), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>390 U.S. 341, 88 S.Ct. 904, 19 L.Ed.2d 1222 (1968), with which appellee\u2019s sales to appellant can be compared. And it is here that appellant\u2019s case falls down.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">At the time summary judgment was entered for appellee, appellant was unable, despite sixteen months of discovery, to point to a single interstate sale of dolomite rock by appellee. Although appellee has sold dolomite rock to foreign buyers \u2014 appellant itself is a Georgia corporation- \u2014 the domicile of the purchaser is not controlling. However anachronistic it may today seem, the cases establish that the state of being \u201cin commerce\u201d under \u00a7 2(a) requires physical movement of the relevant product across a state line. <em>See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., </em>419 U.S. 186, 200, 95 S.Ct. 392, 42 L.Ed.2d 378 (1974), quoting <em>Hiram Walker, Inc. v. A &amp; S Tropical, Inc., </em>407 F.2d 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 901, 90 S.Ct. 212, 24 L.Ed.2d 177 (1969); <em>Littlejohn v. Shell Oil Co., </em>483 F.2d 1140, 1144 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1116, 94 S.Ct. 849, 38 L.Ed.2d 743 (1973); <em>Cliff Food Stores, Inc. v. Kroger, Inc., </em>417 F.2d 203, 208-10 (5th Cir. 1969). So far as the record shows, appellee has never shipped a single dolomite rock, either directly or indirectly, out of the state of Alabama. We think that appellant had ample opportunity to discover the existence, if any, of preferential dolemite rock sales \u201cin commerce,\u201d and its failure to do so warranted the entry of summary judgment on appellant\u2019s Robinson-Patman claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-13\">. Appellant has seen fit to proceed solely under the Robinson-Patman Act, and does not assert a cause of action under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1976). The scope of our decision is, of course, similarly so limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
