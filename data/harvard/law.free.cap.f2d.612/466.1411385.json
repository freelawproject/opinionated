He urges that his conviction for robbery in the state court was invalid because state authorities destroyed or lost a tape recording of his preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Moore and a codefendant were charged in state court with second degree robbery. The charges were dismissed after a preliminary hearing. Although the proceedings were not transcribed, the hearing was tape recorded. A copy of the tape was given to the state and to Moore\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The state then obtained an indictment from a state grand jury. Moore\u2019s new counsel asked both the state and Moore\u2019s prior counsel for a copy of the tape of the preliminary hearing. He was informed by both that the tapes had either been lost or destroyed. Moore was later convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">We affirm the judgment of the district court denying Moore\u2019s habeas petition on the authority of <em>United States v. Loud Hawk, et al. </em>(CA9, August 7, 1979) (Slip Opinion 2857). The law in <em>Loud Hawk </em>is fundamentally sound and applies even though <em>Loud Hawk </em>involved a federal rather than a state proceeding. Furthermore, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, his claim does not rise to constitutional dimensions. The unfairness caused by loss or destruction of evidence rarely rises to the level of making the proceeding \u201ca spectacle or trial by ordeal.\u201d <em>Loud Hawk </em>Slip op. at 2874 (Kennedy, J., concurring}. This is not one of those instances.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
