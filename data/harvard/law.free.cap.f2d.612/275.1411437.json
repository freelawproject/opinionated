The District Judge to whom. this case was assigned dismissed the counts pertaining to Beebe\u2019s supervisory officers on the ground that the allegations against them did not state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970), and certified the questions presented here as controlling questions of law, while retaining jurisdiction over the \u00a7 1983 complaint against State Police Officer Beebe.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-25\">The complaint in this case did not allege as to the two State Police officials that they played any personal role in the shooting incident. It does allege that they failed in their supervisory and training functions to prepare Officer Beebe properly for the making of the arrest involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-26\">It appears that the United States Supreme Court has held that a \u00a7 1983 action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>will not lie against police supervisory officers for failure to prevent police misconduct, absent a showing of direct responsibility for the improper action. <em>Rizzo v.
