We conclude that \u00a7 23 of the Bankruptcy Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, precludes the exercise of federal jurisdiction over such a \u201cplenary\u201d suit in a SIPA proceeding, in the absence of any source of federal jurisdiction outside SIPA itself and those provisions of the Bankruptcy Act incorporated by SIPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979), reversed our decision <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to allow the Trustee to maintain a private right of action for violations of \u00a7 17 of the' Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and remanded the case to us for a decision on the Trustee\u2019s alternative bases for jurisdiction, which are grounded in various provisions of SIPA and the Bankruptcy Act. No non-Bankruptcy Act, non-SIPA source of jurisdiction is alleged. The parties have filed additional briefs; we proceed to determine the remaining jurisdictional questions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">As stated more fully in our prior opinion, reported at 592 F.2d 617 (1978), the SIPA Trustee of Weis Securities Inc., a New York brokerage firm, seeks to recover $65 million in damages from the firm\u2019s accountants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>alleging that their failure to discover fraudulent entries in the firm\u2019s books in the 1972 audit led to the firm\u2019s failure in 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On remand, the Trustee urges that the federal courts are invested with \u201cplenary\u201d jurisdiction to hear such a suit as part of the powers conferred on a federal court supervising a broker liquidation under SIPA. Section 5(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78eee(b)(2) of SIPA is undoubtedly a jurisdictional provision, and it provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Upon the filing of an application [for a SIPA liquidation], the court to which application is made shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor involved and its property wherever located <em>with the powers, to the extent consistent with the purposes of this chapter, of a court of bankruptcy and of a court in </em>a <em>proceeding under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">This sentence contains no fewer than three jurisdictional grants. First, the court is given the \u201csummary\u201d jurisdiction exercised by bankruptcy courts by the phrase \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of the debtor involved and its property wherever located.\u201d Second, the SIPA court is given the powers of a federal court supervising a \u201cstraight\u201d bankruptcy proceeding under chapters I-VII, and, third, the powers of a court supervising a reorganization under chapter X. Both these latter grants are circumscribed, significantly, by the proviso that limits the SIPA court\u2019s quasi-chapter I-VII powers and quasi-chapter X powers to those \u201cconsistent with the purposes\u201d of SIPA itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Although the line between \u201csummary\u201d and \u201cplenary\u201d jurisdiction is not always drawn with clarity in case law, it is clear that a suit of this kind requires \u201cplenary\u201d jurisdiction, absent consent of the parties. <em>Williams v. Austrian, </em>331 U.S. 642, 67 S.Ct. 1443, 91 L.Ed. 1718 (1947). Therefore the first grant of jurisdiction in \u00a7 5(b)(2) of the 1970 Act will not suffice. The second jurisdictional grant picks up all the provisions of chapters I-VII, including \u00a7 23 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, which withdraws jurisdiction from a \u201cstraight\u201d bankruptcy court in cases which could not have been brought in federal court without resort to bankruptcy jurisdiction and which are not subject to summary jurisdiction. The third jurisdictional grant incorporates the provisions of chapter X, including \u00a7 102 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502, which eliminates from reorganization proceedings the restriction contained in \u00a7 23. Thus the jurisdictional language of \u00a7 5(b)(2) of SIPA refers us to two inconsistent jurisdictional provisions. It is clear that our resolution must depend on our answer to the question of which jurisdictional outcome is more \u201cconsistent with the purposes\u201d of SIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Fortunately, Congress supplied an unequivocal, if somewhat involved, answer to this question in \u00a7 6(c)(1) of SIPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78fff(c)(l), which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">Except as inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter and except that in no event shall a plan of reorganization be formulated, a liquidation proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with, and <em>as though it were being conducted under, the provisions of chapter X and such of the provisions ... of chapters I to VII inclusive, of the Bankruptcy Act as section [502 of Title 11] would make applicable if an order of the court had been entered directing that bankruptcy be proceeded with </em>pursuant to <em>the </em>provisions <em>of </em>such chapters I to VII . . . (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">It is 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 that gives the chapter X court power to hear \u201cplenary\u201d suits that would be barred by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46 in \u201cstraight\u201d bankruptcies. But \u00a7 502 also provides that the restrictions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46 will come back into play once an order is entered directly that bankruptcy be proceeded with (in other words, that the attempt to reorganize the corporation be abandoned and a liquidation be accomplished).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">Congress\u2019 clear purpose in writing \u00a7 6(c)(1) of SIPA in the manner chosen was to structure SIPA liquidations, insofar as the SIPA court\u2019s powers with regard to jurisdiction and procedure are concerned, on the model of a chapter X court which has entered an order directing that bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>be proceeded with. Thus, \u00a7 6(c)(1) gives SIPA liquidation courts the procedural and jurisdictional powers conferred on a chapter X court with three significant variations:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">First, no reorganization plan may be formulated;</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Second, the provisions of chapters I through VII apply only insofar as they are consistent with the provisions of chapter X (because \u00a7 6(c)(1) picks up all of chapter X except those sections named in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502; and among the provisions of chapter X thus incorporated is the remainder of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 itself, which includes a clause incorporating into chapter X all those provisions of chapters I through VII not inconsistent with chapter X);</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Third, those sections named in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 apply in SIPA liquidations <em>even if </em>they are inconsistent with chapter X (these are 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 46, 93(h) and (n), 104 and 110(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">What sort of a portmanteau court did Congress intend to create by these interlocking layers of incorporation by reference? Apparently Congress intended to give a SIPA court the additional procedural flexibility and powers of estate administration enjoyed by a chapter X court- \u2014 its ability to \u201cbring its authority to bear on customers, other creditors and any persons involved in the proceeding, in various situations not permissible in ordinary bankruptcy under chapters I to VII.\u201d 3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>\u00a7 60.82 at 1236 (rev. 14th ed. 1977). Yet this had to be done in a context in which the raison d\u2019etre of chapter X, reorganization, was prohibited, and thus a context in which some features of the expanded jurisdiction of a chapter X court, such as its power to hear plenary suits, might not be desirable. One such element Congress apparently considered undesirable was the power of a chapter X court under \u00a7 502 to hear cases arising between trustees and third party \u201cstrangers to the bankruptcy\u201d who hold adversely property sought by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The Trustee makes two major objections to this reading of the statute. First, he argues that any inferred limitation on the quasi-chapter X court powers of a SIPA court found in \u00a7 6(c)(1) is inconsistent with \u00a7 5(b)(2), and thus rendered inoperative by the \u201c[ejxcept as inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter\u201d clause with which \u00a7 6(c)(1) begins. The answer to this point is simply that \u00a7 5(b)(2) also contains a clause limiting its application to those features consistent with the rest of the chapter, and in order to prevent an unending mirror-image sequence of references we must decide which section is to be given primacy. It seems to us that it was in \u00a7 6(c)(1) that Congress addressed the question of which, and to what extent, provisions of the Bankruptcy Act were to apply in SIPA liquidations, and that the Congressional vision is sketched in considerable detail. Section 6(c)(1) gives courts a well-defined guidepost by which they can decide what is and is not consistent with the Act. Section 5(bX2), by contrast, is too broad to be such a guidepost, since the characteristics of a court of bankruptcy and of a chapter X court are in some respects incompatible. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the content of another section to define the meaning of \u00a7 5(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The Trustee\u2019s second statutory construction argument is that \u00a7 6(c)(1) is applicable only in \u201cproceedings\u201d and should not b\u00e9 used to settle jurisdictional questions. This is another way of saying that \u00a7 5(b)(2), as the prime fount of jurisdiction in the Act, should take precedence over any provisions elsewhere in the Act with which it seems in conflict. This argument can be answered by pointing out that \u00a7 5(b)(2) clearly contemplates that other, non-jurisdictional sections will be used to define jurisdictional limits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Of course, the broader purposes of SIPA deserve consideration, over and above the intricacies of statutory construction. We can find no support for the contention that the policies behind SIPA require that this suit be heard only by the court supervising the SIPA liquidation, or by a federal as opposed to a state court. The factual issues in a negligence suit against the accountants do not necessarily bear any relation to the factual issues involved in a SIPA proceeding, and there is little likelihood that legal issues will overlap. Nor is there any risk of inconsistent determinations. Finally, the Supreme Court has indicated that the federal securities laws, of which SIPA is a part, should not be used to transform essentially state causes of action into federal causes of action, absent clear Congressional intent to effect such a transformation. <em>See Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 51 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The Trustee also argues that by filing proofs of claim for accounting services in the liquidation proceeding Touche Ross submitted to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, and that this submission constituted sufficient consent to restore the jurisdiction, taken away by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, to hear suits which could not have been brought in the first instance. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(b) does allow \u201cplenary\u201d jurisdiction to be conferred by consent of the parties. However, the act of filing a proof of claim is not the kind of submission that courts have accepted in the past as constituting voluntary submission under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(b), at least absent a closer nexus than is present here between the Trustee s claim and the claim filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The dismissal of the complaint by the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. Excerpts from and references to the provisions of SIPA throughout this opinion are to the text of the Act prior to the changes wrought by the SIPA Amendments of 1978 and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1979. In 1978, Congress amended SIPA, Section 7, Pub.L. 95-283, May 21, 1978, 92 Stat. 254, to \u201celiminate the wholesale incorporation of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,\u201d Sen.Rep. No. 95-763, 3 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News (1978) at 764, 774, \u201cin favor of a specific incorporation of certain Chapter X provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773. The Senate Report includes the somewhat confusing statement that \u201cthe elimination of the wholesale incorporation of Chapter X provisions is not in any way intended to limit the jurisdiction of a court under SIPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We need not decide, however, to what extent, if any, the 1978 amendments affected the jurisdiction of SIPA courts. This suit was commenced on April 30, 1976, more than two years before passage of the 1978 amendments, and the amendments do not purport to withdraw jurisdiction in pending suits. Thus in this decision we have interpreted the court\u2019s jurisdiction as it existed prior to the 1978 amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-13\">. This case was commenced before the effective date of the revised Bankruptcy Code, and thus remains governed by former Title 11, United States Code, whose provisions are quoted and referred to throughout the opinion.

Of course, our conclusion will not prejudice the Trustee\u2019s right to maintain suit in state court, where he has previously filed suit in order to preserve his rights in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-15\">. <em>Redington v. Touche Ross &amp; Co., </em>592 F.2d 617 (2nd Cir. 1978), with Mulligan, J., dissenting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-16\">. As the facts and arguments are adequately presented in the briefs, oral argument would not have significantly advanced the decisional process and did not seem necessary to the panel. See Rule 34(g)(l)(iii) of the rules of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">. We need not reach the question of whether \u00a7 115 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 515, is itself jurisdictional. Any jurisdiction provided by \u00a7 115 would come into SIPA via the same route as the other jurisdictional sections discussed above. Thus, the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 5(b)(2) and 6(c)(1) of SIPA, which we have held to exclude any suit that would be excluded by the operation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, would for the same reasons operate to negate any jurisdictional basis derived from \u00a7 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b153-5\">. Before concluding that a party has consented to the exercise of plenary jurisdiction, courts have required such indicia of consent as a general appearance and consent, <em>Schumacher v. Beeler, </em>293 U.S. 367, 55 S.Ct. 230, 79 L.Ed. 433 (1934); or explicit concession of jurisdiction, <em>Tilton v. Model Taxi Corp., </em>112 F.2d 86, 88 (2d Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Were the Trustee\u2019s claim against Touche Ross a compulsory counterclaim against Touche Ross\u2019 claim for accounting services in 1973, the more difficult issue of the limits of the jurisdiction provided by <em>Katchen v. Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 86 S.Ct. 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966), would be presented. <em>See 2 Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>1123.08 at 558 (rev. 14th ed. 1976). But the Trustee\u2019s claim here falls short of being compulsory under F.R.C.P. 13(a). Touche Ross\u2019 filed claim arose out of accounting services performed in connection with the 1973 audit. The alleged negligence that is the gravamen of the Trustee\u2019s suit occurred in relation to the 1972 audit. While it may be true that accountants have a continuing duty to correct any errors in prior financial statements, this continuing duty cannot operate to make every one of a firm\u2019s subsequent annual audits the same \u201ctransaction or occurrence\u201d referred to by F.R.C.P. 13(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
