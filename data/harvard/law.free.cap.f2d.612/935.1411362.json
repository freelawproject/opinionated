JOHNSON, Jr., Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1015-27\">This appeal from a grant of a motion for summary judgment involves the right of the Secretary of Labor to conduct a health and safety inspection at Texoline Company\u2019s gravel pit mine without a warrant. We affirm the order of the district court permitting the Secretary of Labor to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-28\">In August, 1977, a federal mine inspector attempted to inspect Texoline\u2019s facility but was denied entry. The Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>of the Interior sought an injunction, under the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act [Metal Act],<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to prohibit Texo-line from refusing the inspection. In October, 1978, the Secretary of Labor was substituted as plaintiff when the Metal Act was repealed and those industries formerly regulated by the Metal Act were brought under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act [Mine Safety Act],<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is administered by the Secretary of Labor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Warrantless searches are permitted under the Mine Safety Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If a Mine Safety Act inspection is attempted and entry to the facility is denied, the Secretary of Labor can seek an injunction under the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The district court found that the facility operated by Texoline was a \u201cmine\u201d within the scope of Section 102(b) of the Mine Safety Act, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 802(h)(1). It also held that Texoline\u2019s operation was an industry affecting interstate commerce, thereby falling within the Act\u2019s jurisdiction. Finally, it found that warrantless entry provisions of the statute are constitutional. The court therefore granted the Secretary\u2019s request for an injunction. The sole issue on appeal is the constitutional challenge to the warrantless search provisions of the Mine Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">Texoline relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), to support the contention that the Secretary of Labor is required to obtain a search warrant before he is entitled to enter and inspect Texoline\u2019s premises. It contends that the statutory section allowing warrantless searches violates the Fourth Amendment. We agree with the Third and Sixth Circuits in holding that <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>does not render unconstitutional the Mine Safety Act\u2019s inspection provision. <em>See Marshall v. Nolichuckey Sand Co., Inc., </em>606 F.2d 693 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>Marshall v. Stoudt\u2019s Ferry Preparation Co., </em>602 F.2d 589 (3d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">In <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>the Court invalidated Section 8(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 [OSHA],<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which authorizes the Secretary of Labor to search without a warrant the work area of an employment facility involved in interstate commerce. While requiring OSHA to seek war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>rants before inspecting the businesses under its jurisdiction, the Court expressly recognized that a statute may validly authorize the search of certain commercial properties without a warrant. <em>But, cf. Marshall v. Gibson\u2019s Products, Inc. of Plano, </em>584 F.2d 668 (5th Cir. 1978) (under OSHA a federal court has no jurisdiction in a suit by the Secretary of Labor to enjoin an employer to submit to an inspection of its premises). As exceptions to the warrant requirement, the Court cited enterprises where businessmen would have no reasonable expectation of privacy. These included certain pervasively regulated industries, typified by <em>United States v. Biswell, </em>406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972) (firearms), and those closely regulated businesses having a long history of governmental inspection and supervision, typified by <em>Colonnade Catering Corporation v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 72, 90 S.Ct. 774, 25 L.Ed.2d 60 (1972) (liquor). Proprietors in these types of businesses consent to these restrictions by choosing to accept the benefits of their trade. 436 U.S. at 313, 98 S.Ct. at 1820. Other than falling within these exceptions, the reasonableness of the warrantless search will depend on the specific enforcement needs and privacy guarantees of the particular statute under review. <em>Id. </em>at 321, 98 S.Ct. at 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Texoline argues that its business does not fall within an exception to the warrant requirement because the gravel industry has no long history of governmental regulation, it is not \u201cpervasively\u201d regulated, and no license is required. Texoline maintains that it was therefore unreasonable for Congress to provide for warrantless inspections of its operation, especially since there is no greater need to regulate mines under the Mine Safety Act than to regulate the industries under OSHA\u2019s jurisdiction. Furthermore, it contends that, even if coal mines have a history of governmental regulation, that history is not applicable to the gravel industry. We find nothing in <em>Barlow\u2019s, </em>however, that limits exceptions to the warrant requirement to licensed businesses such as dealers in liquor and guns. On the contrary, we should examine the specific enforcement needs and privacy guarantees of the Mine Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The Mine Safety Act requires frequent inspections of coal or other mines, with a minimum of four complete inspections of the mines each year. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra. </em>The purposes of these inspections are to determine whether an imminent danger exists and whether the company is complying with mandatory health or safety standards. The statute directs that no advance warning is to be given when such an inspection is made. There are \u00e1 number of significant differences between this inspection scheme and the one under OSHA. OSHA applies to nearly all businesses engaged in interstate commerce. It authorizes the Secretary to enter any establishment where work is being performed by an employee and to inspect all conditions, structures, equipment and materials. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1903.3 (1978). By contrast, the Mine Safety Act is aimed at a single industry with an acknowledged history of hazardous working conditions and serious accidents. Moreover, the inspection provisions of the Mine Safety Act are more limited than those of OSHA. They mandate periodic inspections and place limitations on the purposes for which searches may be made. They also limit the situations in which no notice is required. Thus, the provisions are more narrowly drawn than the comparable OSHA provision and there is less likelihood of the abuses of \u201cunbridled discretion upon executive and administrative officers\u201d that the Court in <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>found objectionable. 436 U.S. at 323, 98 S.Ct. at 1825-1826. <em>See Marshall v. Nolichuckey, supra, </em>at pp. 695\u2014696; <em>Marshall v. Stoudt\u2019s Ferry, </em>602 F.2d at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Another significant difference between the statutes is that the Mine Safety Act provides for immediate judicial review when entry is refused. The Secretary is authorized to seek an injunction in the district court if he is refused entry. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra. </em>This provision protects privacy guarantees because reasonable accommodation of any unusual privacy expectations may be fully explored in that proceeding. <em>See Marshall v. Stoudt\u2019s Ferry Preparation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>Co., </em>602 F.2d at 594 (court imposed a confidentiality requirement on the inspectors to protect the appellant\u2019s trade secrets). Indeed, <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>cited the Metal Act\u2019s provision for immediate judicial review (a provision that was later included in the Mine Safety Act) as an example of a regulatory statute that was distinguishable from OSHA and that may not be rendered constitutionally infirm by its holding. 436 U.S. at 321-22, n. 18, 98 S.Ct. at 1825, n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Finally, coal mining has a history of governmental regulation by both state governments and the federal government. <em>See Marshall v. Stoudt\u2019s Ferry, </em>602 F.2d at 593. In <em>Youghiogheny and Ohio Coal Co. v. Morton, </em>364 F.Supp. 45 (S.D.Ohio 1973), a three-judge panel concluded that the coal industry, like firearms and liquor, had been pervasively regulated and that warrantless searches, in the context of mine safety investigations, were reasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Senate Committee, in recommending the present Act, noted its approval of the <em>Youghioghe-ny </em>case. It indicated that the opinion reflected congressional intent concerning the constitutionality of warrantless inspections of coal mines. The Committee commented that advance notice of inspections would seriously undercut the Act\u2019s objectives because it would allow safety and health hazards to be concealed. S.Rep.No. 181, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 27, <em>reprinted in </em>[1977] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 3401, 3427. Although the sand and gravel industry does not have the long history of regulation found in the coal mining industry, Congress clearly found that sand and gravel excavations could be almost as dangerous as underground coal mines and consequently in need of similar supervision. U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2851 (1966). Because Congress found that all miners are exposed to unusually severe health and safety hazards, all mining is now pervasively regulated, at least with respect to health and safety measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">We conclude that the Mine Safety Act\u2019s enforcement scheme justifies war-rantless inspections and its restrictions on search discretion satisfy the reasonableness standard outlined in <em>Barlow\u2019s. </em>Congress had the power to conclude, and was reasonable in concluding, that safety concerns and enforcement needs justify limited warrant-less inspections of mines such as Texoline\u2019s. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 721, <em>et seq., </em>(1976 ed.)
