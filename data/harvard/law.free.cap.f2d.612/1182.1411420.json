Irwin has appealed his conviction of distributing cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-17\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-18\">In December, 1977, the Denver Police Department arrested Irwin for possession of cocaine. In exchange for a dismissal of the criminal charge against him, Irwin agreed to become an informant for the Police Department. To \u201cwork off\u201d the charge, Irwin first gave information that led to the arrest and conviction of his source and later attempted to set up some large scale drug transactions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-19\">In February, 1978, Irwin met Darrell Wisdom, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent who was posing as a large scale drug dealer. Irwin did not know Wisdom was an undercover agent, although Wisdom knew that Irwin was working as a confidential informant for the Denver Police Department. Based upon Irwin\u2019s negotiations with Wisdom, two DEA agents later informed the Denver Police that they thought Irwin was \u201cdouble dealing\u201d, i. e., acting as an informant and selling drugs on the side.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>In March, 1978, Irwin learned through a friend of Sharon Baker, his girl friend, that Frank McLister, who lived in the San Francisco area, might have a pound or two of cocaine to sell. Irwin arranged by telephone to have the cocaine available for a sale to Wisdom. On March 6 Irwin and Baker flew to San Francisco, and Wisdom flew there the following day. After making final arrangements for the sale, Wisdom met Irwin, McLister, Baker, and Thane Rucker, an associate of McLister, in a camper parked outside the San Francisco Hilton. After Wisdom had seen the cocaine, agents arrested Irwin, Baker, McLister, and Ruck-er.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">Irwin and Baker were released on bail and returned to Denver. Between March 17 and April 13, 1978, Wisdom and Irwin engaged in several telephone conversations. Each claims the other initiated the calls. While there is some dispute regarding what was said in most of the telephone conversations, it is apparent that the calls were made without the consent of Irwin\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is conceded that following the telephone conversations, Irwin arranged a meeting in Denver between Wisdom and a potential seller of cocaine from New York. Before any sale was consummated, Wisdom advised Floy E. Dawson, Assistant United States Attorney in San Francisco, what had transpired and was requested by Dawson to have no further contact with Irwin or Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">\n<em>District Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">Irwin, Baker, McLister, and Rucker were each charged with conspiracy to distribute and distribution of cocaine. Irwin and Baker filed .motions to dismiss the indictment on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and violation of a plea agreement. On the basis of ' affidavits introduced by both the Government and the defendants, the tape of the April 4 telephone conversations, legal memoranda and oral argument, the district court denied both motions, without an evi-dentiary hearing. The court stated, however, that any inculpatory statements made by Irwin to Government agents subsequent to his arrest and appointment of counsel would be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">At trial it was the Government\u2019s theory that Irwin, although working as an informant for the Denver Police Department, was also trafficking in drugs. Irwin\u2019s defense was that he was working as an informant at all times and was setting up the San Francisco sale to \u201cwork off\u201d his arrangements with the Denver Police Department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury returned a guilty verdict against Irwin on both the conspiracy and distribution charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGFE\">Appellant contends that (1) the indictment should have been dismissed because (a) a Government agent\u2019s \u201cgross intrusion into the attorney-client relationship\u201d deprived him of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and (b) he had entered into a disposi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>tional agreement with Government agents and performed his part of the agreement; and (2) the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could find appellant not guilty if he had substantially complied with his agreement to serve as a confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">\n<em>Violation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Irwin first contends that Wisdom\u2019s post-arrest \u201capproaches constituted a gross subversion of Irwin\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel and his Fifth Amendment rights to due process and protection from self-incrimination\u201d. He argues that Wisdom importuned Irwin to ignore the advise of his counsel that he not talk to or actively work with police or government agents, and further urged Irwin to resume his activities as a government informant. This conduct, appellant contends, requires that the indictment be dismissed, citing <em>O\u2019Brien v. United States, </em>386 U.S. 345, 87 S.Ct. 1158, 18 L.Ed.2d 94 (1967); <em>Black </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 190, 17 L.Ed.2d 26 (1966); <em>Caldwell v. United States, </em>92 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 205 F.2d 879 (D.C.Cir. 1953), and <em>Coplon v. United States, </em>89 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 191 F.2d 749 (D.C.Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">It is clear that government interference with a defendant\u2019s relationship with his attorney <em>may </em>render counsel\u2019s assistance so ineffective as to violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law. It is equally clear, however, that not all police action which arguably could be called an interference with the attorney-client relationship is violative of those rights. The Supreme Court in <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977), and this court in <em>United States v. Glover, </em>596 F.2d 857 (9th Cir. 1979), recognize that the Sixth Amendment does not establish any <em>per se </em>rule and suggest guidelines for determining whether an accused\u2019s constitutional rights are violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">In <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>Weatherford, an undercover agent, was charged with Bursey with vandalizing a. county selective service office. In order to retain his undercover status, Weatherford continued a masquerade that he was being prosecuted for the incident and on two occasions met with Bursey and his counsel to discuss strategy for the approaching trial. Bursey discovered Weatherford\u2019s true status at the trial. After serving an eighteen month sentence, Bursey filed an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that Weatherford\u2019s presence at the pretrial conferences deprived him of effective assistance of counsel and due process of law. The district court found for the defendants in all respects, but the Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that \u201cwhenever the prosecution knowingly arranges or permits intrusion into the attorney-client relationship the right to counsel is sufficiently endangered to require reversal and a new trial.\u201d 429 U.S. at 549, 97 S.Ct. at 840, 841 (quoting appeal court\u2019s opinion, 528 F.2d 483, 486 (1975)). Reviewing <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>and <em>Black, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court disagreed with the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that these decisions required a <em>per se </em>rule. The Court stated that \u201c[i]f anything is to be inferred from these two cases with respect to the right to counsel, it is that when conversations with counsel have been overheard, the constitutionality of the conviction depends on whether the overheard conversations have produced, directly or indirectly, any of the evidence offered at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>429 U.S. at 552, 97 S.Ct. at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">On the other hand, the Court did not agree with petitioners that whenever a defendant converses with his counsel in the presence of a third party, the defendant assumes the risk and cannot complain if the third party turns out to be a government informer. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-13\">Had Weatherford testified at Bursey\u2019s trial as to the conversation between Bur-sey and Wise [Bursey\u2019s counsel]; had any of the State\u2019s evidence originated in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>conversations; had those overheard conversations been used in any other way to the substantial detriment of Bursey; or even had the prosecution learned from Weatherford, an undercover agent, the details of the Bursey-Wise conversations about trial preparations, Bursey would have a much stronger case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">429 U.S. at 554, 97 S.Ct. at 843 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">The Court also indicated that the purpose of the intrusion was an important factor to consider. Weatherford had not attended the meetings for the purpose of discovering defense secrets. Rather, Bursey had invited him to attend, and legitimate law enforcement objectives required that he continue to conceal his identity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">This court recently considered the effect of <em>Weatherford </em>and other cases bearing on the Sixth Amendment issue in <em>United States v. Glover, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The police arrested Glover when he attempted to sell stolen gems to an undercover agent. Prior to trial, FBI agents talked to Glover in the absence of counsel. \u201cThey told him he would be released if he would reveal the location of the gems and testify against his co-defendants. When he asked if his attorney should not be present, the agents responded she had given her consent to the questioning,\u201d but it later became apparent that she had not. 596 F.2d at 859. Although the meeting in the absence of counsel produced no evidence against the defendant at the trial, the defendant moved for dismissal of the indictment because of the FBI\u2019s attempted interference with the attorney-client relationship. He argued that prejudice is irrelevant in determining whether a defendant has been denied the right to counsel. Citing <em>Weatherford, </em>we stated that \u201c[n]ot all police action that arguably could be called an interference with the attorney-client relationship is violative of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863. We recognized that <em>Weather-ford </em>was \u201cfactually distinguishable from the situation\u201d in Glover<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but did not believe \u201cthat the factual distinction overshadow[ed] an important principle to be read from the case: that the existence or nonexistence of prejudicial evidence derived from an alleged interference with the attorney-client relationship is relevant in determining if the defendant has been denied the right of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863\u2014864. Since the defendant had not been prejudiced, we found no Sixth Amendment violation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-16\">From <em>Weatherford </em>and <em>Glover </em>and the cases they interpret,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is apparent that mere government intrusion into the attorney-client relationship, although not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>condoned by the court,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is not of itself violative of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Rather, the right is only violated when the intrusion substantially prejudices the defendant. Prejudice can manifest itself in several ways. It results when evidence gained through the interference is used against the defendant at trial. It also can result from the prosecution\u2019s use of confidential information pertaining to the defense plans and strategy, from government influence which destroys the defendant\u2019s confidence in his attorney,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and from other actions designed to give the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A0H\">Appellant argues that the governmental misconduct had a three pronged prejudicial effect: (1) \u201cit elicited incriminating evidence from the defendant\u201d; (2) it \u201csubstantially destroyed the defendant Irwin\u2019s attorney-client relationship\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe officer\u2019s questioning of Irwin sought to discover the strategy which Irwin and his counsel were planning for their defense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">As stated earlier the district court denied the motions to dismiss the indictment without an evidentiary hearing. If, in fact, a material issue of fact were raised \u201cwhich if resolved in accordance with [appellant\u2019s] contentions would entitle him to relief\u201d, an evidentiary hearing would be required. <em>Wright v. Dickson, </em>336 F.2d 878, 881 (9 Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1012, 87 S.Ct. 1360, 18 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967); see also <em>United States v. Carrion, </em>463 F.2d 704, 706 (9 Cir. 1972). On the other hand, if the affidavits show as a matter of law that appellant was or was not entitled to relief, no hearing was required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> All of the affidavits were considered by the district court, and the court concluded that an evidentiary hearing was not required. In determining whether this conclusion was justified and whether appellant was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct, we must assume that the factual allegations in appellant\u2019s affidavits are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">(1) Incriminating Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-14\">As the Government concedes, incriminating statements were made. In the conversation between Irwin and Wisdom on April 4 Irwin admitted that both he and Wisdom knew that Irwin was not in San Francisco at the direction of the Denver police. Irwin said also that he had told his attorney that he \u201cwent out there unauthorized\u201d, th\u00e1t he was \u201cpurely on [his] own\u201d. In denying the motion to dismiss the indictment, the district judge made it clear that any incriminating statements would be suppressed under the doctrine announced in <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The tape recording of the April 4 conversation, which contradicted Irwin\u2019s testimony at tri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>al, was not referred to in cross-examination or offered for impeachment purposes. Nor is there any evidence that the incriminating statements in any way altered or affected Irwin\u2019s defense. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that he was prejudiced by his incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">(2) Destruction of Attorney-Client Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Appellant next contends that the agent\u2019s misconduct substantially destroyed his attorney-client relationship. This contention was first asserted in a memorandum filed in support of Irwin\u2019s motion to dismiss because of prosecutorial misconduct. We find nothing, however, in the supporting affidavits submitted by Irwin and his court appointed counsel to suggest that Irwin lacked confidence in his counsel or was dissatisfied with counsel\u2019s representation. Clearly Irwin did not at any time request new counsel, although his motion to dismiss was denied over two months before his trial commenced.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The record indicates a competent and vigorous defense on the part of appellant\u2019s counsel both at trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">The cases of <em>Commonwealth v. Manning, supra, </em>and <em>People v. Moore, supra, </em>are distinguishable. As this court noted in <em>Glover, </em>in <em>Manning </em>in an apparent \u201ceffort to convince the defendant to cooperate, the agent made disparaging remarks about counsel and warned that the tactics chosen by counsel would not ensure that the defendant would stay out of jail\u201d. 596 F.2d at 861. In <em>Moore </em>the defendant was told \u201cnot to inform his attorney about his dealings with the district attorney\u2019s office\u201d and one investigator \u201cdisparaged the competence of his attorney and falsely said he had been disbarred\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 862, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">There is no evidence here that Wisdom disparaged the competence of Irwin\u2019s counsel; nor is there any evidence that Irwin was told not to inform his counsel of his dealing with Wisdom. It is true that Wisdom suggested to Irwin, and Irwin readily agreed, that Irwin suggest to his counsel that an attempt should be made to reach an agreement with the United States Attorney that Irwin should continue to act as an informant. In the tape recorded conversation of April 4, Wisdom said at one point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abi0\">And the thing about it is \u2014 if you go in and present this- to the U. S. Attorney, okay, this way, out there, then that guy can probably tell you. You can probably have an agreement between your Public Defender and the U. S. Attorney that if, in fact, you did materialize these cases and they went down, then whatever he told you would happen, would happen. You know, it wouldn\u2019t be one of these things where \u2014 ah\u2014you\u2019d be going doing something and then we wouldn\u2019t do anything for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">Later in the conversation, after Irwin had told Wisdom what he was trying to \u201cput together\u201d, Wisdom replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-11\">Okay, well that\u2019s, hey, that sounds super but like I say, you know, I just want to make sure that we get that other problem resolved \u2014 ah\u2014before, you know, we start really working. Once that\u2019s resolved, hey, I\u2019ll work anything you want to work anywhere you want to work however you want to work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">Wisdom stated he would call the United States Attorney and tell him that Irwin would like \u201cto talk to him or whatever\u201d and concluded \u2014 \u201cwhat I would do is talk to my own attorney first and tell him, hey, this is the way you think it\u2019s \u2014 your best interest to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-13\">While Wisdom\u2019s conduct was highly improper, we find no evidence to support the conclusion that it destroyed the attorney-client relationship.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>Appellant argues \u201cthat the Government did not deny that Agent Wisdom\u2019s misconduct did serious damage to defendant Irwin\u2019s relationship with his attorney.\u201d \u201cRather\u201d, appellant claims, \u201cthe [Assistant U. S. Attorney] suggested, \u2018If the subjective interpersonal relationship between attorney and client has been unalterably damaged in these cases, the proper remedy may be the appointment of other counsel . . .\u201d. Appellant suggests that this indicates \u201cthe seriousness of the prejudice toward Irwin herein\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">This is hardly an accurate statement regarding the Government\u2019s position. Appellant was seeking dismissal of the indictment. The Government first contended that even in \u201cfairly flagrant factual situations\u201d, dismissal is not the remedy, noting that under <em>Massiah, supra, </em>the remedy was exclusion of the statements rather than dismissal. Arguing that Irwin had not been harmed and noting that nothing he said would be used against him, the Government continued with the statement quoted by appellant and urged that \u201cthe drastic remedy of dismissal of the indictment is unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">We need not decide what remedy may be appropriate when the relationship between a defendant and his court-appointed counsel is in fact substantially destroyed by Government interference. We have determined that there is no evidence here that. any action of the Government destroyed the attorney-client relationship and that the record indicates a competent and vigorous defense by Irwin\u2019s court appointed counsel. We find nothing in the record to justify dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">(3) Discovery of Defense Strategies</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">While it is true that Irwin\u2019s counsel and the Assistant United States Attorney discussed the nature of Irwin\u2019s defense, it does not appear that Wisdom was seeking to discover defense strategy or that anything was disclosed in the conversations which affected either the prosecution or defense of the case. Defense counsel had revealed the nature of the defense in his initial conference with the prosecutor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">\n<em>Dispositional Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">Appellant contends that he had entered into a postarrest dispositional agreement with agent Wisdom to act as an undercover informant in another investigation in the Denver area in exchange for a dismissal of the charges in this case. He claims that he performed his part of the agreement and that the charges, therefore, should have been dismissed. The Government recognizes the enforceability of bargains of this nature,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but contends that no bargain was reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-15\">As discussed above, the district court denied the motions to dismiss without an evi-dentiary hearing. Following an extended colloquy with counsel for the defendants, in which the court referred specifically to the affidavits of Irwin and his counsel, the court concluded that they failed to show that an agreement was reached. He found accordingly that no evidentiary hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>required. It is necessary to examine in some detail the affidavits of appellant and his attorney to determine whether they raised factual issues requiring a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Irwin, in his affidavit, states agent Wisdom told him that \u201cif [Irwin] would agree to help \u2018turn a deal\u2019 he would talk to the Assistant U. S. Attorney in San Francisco and make a favorable recommendation in the case pending there.\u201d A few days later Wisdom called Irwin and told him that \u201che had talked to the Assistant U. S. Attorney in San Francisco, and while he could not guarantee for sure since the final say-so was up to the Assistant U. S. Attorney, it would be favorable to [Irwin] and [his] interests if [he] would help turn a deal . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">Within a day or two thereafter Irwin talked with Weiss, his attorney, who told him of \u201cthe three possible dispositions of my case he had discussed with the Assistant U. S. Attorney. One of the possible dispositions he mentioned to me was that if the DEA made a favorable recommendation of its using me, that the charge against me in San Francisco could be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">A few days later Irwin told Wisdom of the person seeking a buyer for several pounds of cocaine and asked Wisdom whether he was interested \u201cand whether he could help [Irwin] get a favorable recommendation\u201d. Wisdom replied that he was \u201cvery interested\u201d. At Wisdom\u2019s request Irwin and Baker made arrangements for Wisdom to meet the owner of the cocaine. Finally, Irwin picked up and drove the prospective seller to a Denver bank where Wisdom showed the seller the money for the transaction. Irwin\u2019s affidavit concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-7\">I have not been asked to do anything further at this point regarding this or any other \u201cdeal.\u201d However, it was my understanding that both my and SHARON BAKER\u2019s involvement in this transaction was pursuant to an agreement or understanding I had with agent Wisdom that he would make a favorable recommendation to the Assistant U. S. Attorney in San Francisco regarding the pending charges there, which would then result in the charges there being dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">Appellant\u2019s attorney, Michael Weiss, in his affidavit stated that Floy E. Dawson, Assistant United States Attorney, told Weiss of three \u201cpossible dispositions\u201d, one of which was dismissal of the charges in return for Irwin\u2019s services as a confidential informant. Weiss relayed the possible dispositions to Irwin. Later Irwin informed Weiss that he and Baker had become confidential informants for Wisdom. Weiss reported this information to Dawson, and that \u201cIrwin and Baker were in the process of setting up a transaction for Wisdom in Denver as part of the agreement or understanding that Wisdom would make a favorable recommendation to Dawson to dismiss the charge. . . .\u201d Dawson told Weiss that \u201che was not \u2018committed\u2019 or bound by any agreement of Wisdom\u2019s\u201d and \u201chad not made up his mind yet what disposition he was going to offer Irwin and Baker.\u201d In a subsequent conversation, Weiss was informed by Irwin that Irwin \u201chad continued at agent Wisdom\u2019s request to set up a cocaine transaction as a confidential informant\u201d. Weiss gave Dawson this information and said that they had become involved in the transaction \u201cpursuant to an understanding that they thought they had with Wisdom\u201d. Weiss asked Dawson whether he was going to dismiss the charges. Dawson replied that \u201che would not agree to dismiss the charges against Irwin, but that the Government \u201cwould recommend leniency to the court\u201d, and that \u201che [Dawson] was telling Wisdom to stop all communications with Irwin and Baker immediately and stop using them as confidential informants.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that these affidavits represent the true facts, they do not show that the Government ever promised to dismiss the charges against appellant. The responses of both Wisdom and the Assistant United States Attorney were qualified. Wisdom never promised that the Government would drop the charges, but only that he would \u201cmake a favorable recommendation\u201d and that the ultimate decision rested with the United States Attorney. The Assistant United States Attorney discussed the bargain as a \u201cpossible disposition\u201d, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>never agreed to it. Moreover, after undercover work had begun, appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s inquiries as to whether the Government intended to dismiss the charges indicate that he was aware that no bargain had been struck. The parties reached no binding agreement requiring dismissal of the charges. At most, appellant, on his own initiative, decided to act as a confidential informant in return for promises that Wisdom would make favorable recommendations to the prosecutor.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There are no allegations that Wisdom failed to honor this promise. We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss without an evidentiary hearing. The moving papers failed to allege facts sufficient to enable the trial court to conclude that relief must be granted if the facts alleged were proved. See <em>United States v. Carrion, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">At the trial, Irwin claimed he lacked criminal intent in the San Francisco drug transaction because he was acting as an undercover police informant. He otherwise admitted his participation. He now argues that the court improperly rejected two jury instructions on criminal intent and gave other instructions which misstated the law and placed an impermissibly high burden of proof on him. We disagree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">The trial court rejected the following instructions offered by the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-8\">\n<em>Defendant Irwin\u2019s Instruction No. 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-9\">One who, under the direction of an officer of the law or upon his own initiative, and without criminal intent, feigns complicity in the commission of a crime merely for the purpose of detecting the perpetrator thereof, with a view to prosecution of the perpetrator, is not an accomplice, aider and abettor, or conspirator, and you should find not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-13\">\n<em>Defendant Irwin\u2019s Instruction No. 3</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS_\">If you find the evidence in this case is that (1) defendant IRWIN entered into an agreement with the Denver Police Department through its agents to cooperate with it by providing information and to act as a confidential informant, and (2) defendant IRWIN has substantially complied with his part of the agreement, then you must acquit IRWIN on all counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agi-dedup-1\">\u201cSubstantially complied with\u201d means defendant <em>IRWIN </em>has provided the basic information and performed as a confidential informant in a manner required of him and that the information provided and conduct performed are in satisfactory compliance with the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-15\">Appellant argues that when the sufficiency of his cooperation in a plea agreement is an issue, the defendant/informant is entitled to be found free of criminal intent if he \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with his part of the agreement and therefore, that his offered instruction number 3 on \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d should have been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-16\">We cannot agree with appellant that substantial compliance with an agreement to act as an informant necessarily absolves him of criminal intent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Palermo v. Warden, Green Haven State Prison, </em>545 F.2d 286 (2 Cir. 1976) <em>cert. dismissed </em>431 U.S. 911, 97 S.Ct. 2166, 53 L.Ed.2d 221 (1977), <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>454 F.2d 426 (4 Cir. en banc, 1972) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number><em>cert. denied </em>417 U.S. 933, 94 S.Ct. 2646, 41 L.Ed.2d 237 (1974), and <em>United States v. Paiva, </em>294 F.Supp. 742 (D.D.C.1969) is misplaced. In each of those cases the defendants were attempting to enforce a plea agreement by claiming compliance with their side of the bargain; they were not raising substantial compliance as a defense for committing additional criminal acts subsequent to the agreement, as the defendant does in this case. Where the defendant acts with the intent to profit illegally from the transaction, incidental gain that might be derived on a plea agreement has no relevance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Here the trial court instructed the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe government must prove not only the act . . . but that the acts were done with a criminal purpose.\u201d The court also stated that if \u201cthe sole purpose was to assist in the apprehension of others who were violators and there\u2019s no criminal purpose on the part of the participant, then there would be no criminal responsibility . . .\u201d and that \u201c[t]he basic concern ... is whether the sole purpose was a lawful one. . .\u201d We believe these instructions properly informed the jury of the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Nor do we find any error in the court\u2019s failure to give defendant\u2019s instruction number 1. The instructions that were given reflected the substance of the rejected instruction. The essence of the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction is that one who \u201cfeigns complicity in the commission of a crime merely for the purpose of detecting the perpetrator\u201d and assisting in the perpetrator\u2019s prosecution is not guilty of a crime. The essence of the instruction<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> by the court similarly is that one who feigns complicity for the \u201csole purpose\u201d of detecting the perpetrator and assisting in his prosecution is not guilty of a crime. We see no difference in the essential meaning of these instructions. The language \u201cmerely for the purpose\u201d in defendant\u2019s proposed instructions may be interchanged with the language \u201csole purpose\u201d in the given instructions with no significant change in meaning. We conclude the given instructions neither misstated the law nor could confuse the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-16\">Finally, we fail to see how the given instruction or the rejection of the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d instruction placed an impermissible high burden of proof on the defendant. The jury was told that \u201cthe United States must prove as to each defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, each of the elements of the offense charged including that the defendant charged in each count acted knowingly and willfully and with the purpose to violate the law.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Taken in conjunction with other instructions on criminal intent, this instruction accurately apprised the jury of the requisite burden of proof on all elements of the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>including the necessity for criminal intent. See <em>United States v. Elksnis, </em>528 F.2d 236 (9 Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1263-20\">. Irwin was allowed considerable freedom in working on the drug transactions and was not required to inform the Police Department of his negotiations until a seizure was imminent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">. At trial, Irwin claimed that he was acting in his capacity as an informant when he set up this transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">. A conversation on April 4 between Irwin and Wisdom was taped, and the audio tape was produced and considered by the court on motions to dismiss. In this conversation Irwin stated that his attorney had no knowledge that he was making the call and that his attorney had told him \u201cnot to talk to anybody\u201d. There was some discussion of possible sale to a New York contact, but Wisdom stated that they would first have to work out something with the United States Attorney and Irwin\u2019s attorney in this case. Wisdom suggested that Irwin might tell his counsel that he thought \u201cthis was the way\u201d it was in his \u201cbest interest to go\u201d. In this conversation Irwin also said that he had told his attorney that he went to California \u201cpurely on his own\u201d and was not sent by any representative of the Denver Police Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1264-14\">. Codefendant McLister\u2019s defense was that Irwin was actually the source of the cocaine and had framed McLister.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1264-15\">. Baker was also convicted on both counts. She failed to appear for sentencing and is now a fugitive. McLister was acquitted on the conspiracy charge but found guilty of distribution. Conviction was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. Rucker was acquitted on both charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">. In both <em>O\u2019Brien </em>and <em>Black </em>convictions were reversed per curiam because the Government, through illegal electronic eavesdropping, had overheard conversations between the defendant and his counsel prior to trial. The court ordered new trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">. Bursey\u2019s situation presented none of the elements that would require a finding that his constitutional rights had been violated.

It could not be argued that the prosecutor was unfairly advantaged through disclosure of the defense\u2019s plans and strategies since the district court had found that Weatherford communicated nothing at all to his superiors or to the prosecution about Bursey\u2019s trial plans. \u201cThere being no tainted evidence in this case, no communication of defense strategy to the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion by Weatherford, there was no violation of the Sixth Amendment . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 97 S.Ct. at 845.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">. <em>Glover </em>was decided subsequent to the filing of briefs and shortly before oral argument in the case now before the court. It was not discussed by counsel in oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1266-17\">. In particular, we noted that in <em>Weatherford </em>\u201cthe government agent was invited to attend the strategy sessions between Bursey and his attorney\u201d, whereas in <em>Glover </em>\u201cthe FBI agents had initiated the contact with Glover\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1266-18\">. We noted also that even \u201cif Glover could establish that a Sixth Amendment violation occurred, he has cited no federal case that has remedied the violation by dismissal.\u201d See also <em>United States v. Owen, </em>580 F.2d 365, 367 (9 Cir. 1978), where this court recognized that dismissal for governmental misconduct \u201cis an extreme sanction which should be infrequently utilized\u201d and requires a showing of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1266-19\">. In addition to <em>Black, supra, </em>and <em>O\u2019Brien, supra, </em>the Court in <em>Weatherford </em>discussed <em>Caldwell v. United States, supra, Coplon v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">. In <em>Glover </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-8\">We do not condone the behavior of Agent Robinson.

We discuss these cases later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">. As this court said in <em>Carrion, supra, </em>463 F.2d at 706, \u201cEvidentiary hearings need be held only when the moving papers allege facts with suffi-dent definiteness, clarity, and specificity to enable the trial court to conclude that relief must be granted if the facts alleged are proved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1267-15\">.

As this court noted in <em>Glover, Massiah </em>establishes \u201can <em>Exclusionary rule </em>for statements obtained as a result of an interrogation conducted after indictment and without the presence of defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d 596 F.2d at 864, n. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">. The memorandum was filed on April 27 and was heard on May 4. The trial did not commence until July 17. Irwin was present at the hearing on May 4. Nothing was presented at the hearing to show any destruction of the attorney-client relationship. Rather, there was an extensive colloquy between court and counsel on the motion to dismiss on the ground of violation of a plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1268-15\">. It may be noted also that Irwin reported to his counsel, and Wisdom reported to the Assistant United States Attorney on their various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>conversations, although it is not clear whether Irwin told his counsel all that transpired in the telephone conversations, including the April 4 conversation which was taped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">The affidavit of Irwin\u2019s counsel states, with respect to the initial conversation: \u201cOn Friday morning, March 17, 1978, I received a phone call from Mr. Dawson [Assistant U. S. Attorney]. He advised me that he had received a phone call from either S.F. DEA agent Richard Camps or Denver agent Darrell Wisdom (I\u2019m not sure which) telling Dawson that my client, JOHN IRWIN, had been in to see Wisdom and was voluntarily offering his services as an informant as consideration for dropping the charges against him and SHARON BAKER here. I told Mr. Dawson that I did not authorize Wisdom to speak to my client or vice versa and did not want Wisdom to have any further contact with Irwin. Mr. Dawson stated he had or would so advise Wisdom but that he intended to use anything IRWIN had said to Wisdom in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1269-17\">. <em>United States v. </em>Orman, 417 F.Supp. 1126 (D.Colo., 1976), upon which appellant relies, is distinguishable. <em>Orman </em>involved surreptitious eavesdropping by DEA agents of the defendant\u2019s consultations with her court appointed lawyer. The court held that \u201cwhere there is surveillance of attorney-client conferences, prejudice must be presumed . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1269-19\">. See, e. <em>g., Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); <em>United States v.

It is apparent that both appellant and his counsel recognized that agent Wisdom had no authority to make any binding commitment and could simply make a \u201cfavorable recommendation\u201d to the United States Attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">. A major difficulty with defendant\u2019s proposed instruction is that it would grant the defendant blanket immunity on all future criminal acts so long as he substantially complied with the provisions of his plea agreement. The rejected instruction requires two findings for acquittal: (1) that a plea agreement existed, and (2) that the defendant substantially complied with his part of the agreement. According to this instruction, the defendant could commit criminal acts, such as the transaction in San Francisco, solely for his own benefit, and he would still be absolved of guilt so long as he substantially complied with his plea agreement with the Denver Police Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">. We do not hold, however, that a person would be guilty of an offense where he participates in criminal activity solely to protect or maintain his undercover status. In such a situation the action might be necessary to continue to fulfill his part of the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">. The court instructed the jury that \u201cone is not guilty of an offense if . there was no purpose to violate the law\u201d and that there would be no criminal responsibility \u201cif . the sole purpose was to assist in the apprehension of others . . . and there\u2019s no criminal purpose on the part of the [defendant].\u201d The jury was also told that \u201c[t]he basic concern . is whether the sole purpose was a lawful one, that is to help in the apprehension of one or more criminals.\u201d The court further clarified the concept of criminal purpose through the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-14\">Now, if there is, as to any defendant, an intention to gain financial profit from a criminal venture or help someone else to do that, then the intent would not be innocent. And that would be so even though there might be the intention or prospect at some later time to inform the authorities of the activities of one or more of the other participants.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1272-18\">. In another instruction the court emphasized the burden of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-19\">As I say, there are two essential elements. There must be the act forbidden by law and the intent to do the act. Before any defendant can be found guilty of a crime, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was forbidden to do the act; that the act was done and that it was done intentionally and purposefully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVuQ\">As noted earlier, the court also stated that one does not have a \u201cpurpose to violate the law\u201d where his \u201csole purpose was to assist in the apprehension of others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1273-16\">. In <em>Elksnis, </em>under circumstances similar to those before us we said that \u201c[i]n reviewing jury instructions, we must judge them in context and as part of the whole trial. Isolated individual statements do not by themselves establish error. The question is whether the complete package was misleading or represented a statement inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>United States v.
