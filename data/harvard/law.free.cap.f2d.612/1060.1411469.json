We vacate the order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">Associated General Contractors of Minnesota (AGC) employed members of the defendant Unions for a construction project in Minnesota. A separate contractor, was picketed by members of a union not here involved. Members of the defendant Unions conducted a work stoppage. When AGC initiated this action under \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 303(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 185 and 187, the district court issued an injunction and directed the parties to arbitrate their dispute. That order was affirmed. <em>Associated General Contractors of Minnesota v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Twin City Local No. 49, </em>519 F.2d 269 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">When the arbitrator\u2019s award found the work stoppages authorized by collective bargaining agreements, the Unions allegedly resumed them. AGC filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). ' The NLRB\u2019s decision finding Union violations of \u00a7 8(e) of the NLRA was affirmed and enforced on appeal. <em>Bricklayers and Stone Masons Union, Local No. 2 </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 562 F.2d 775 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-17\">When the district court scheduled this action for trial, AGC filed a supplemental complaint seeking attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in halting the strikes and achieving resumption of work as its measure of damages from the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-18\">The district court granted the Unions\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Alyes-ka Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) <em>(Alyeska), </em>precludes \u201crecovery [under \u00a7 303] of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by an employer to remedy a union\u2019s unfair labor practice, absent bad faith on the part of the union. <em>See F.F. Instrument Corp. v. Union de Tronquista, </em>558 F.2d 607 (1st Cir. 1977). <em>See also Mead v. Retail Clerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>523 F.2d 1371 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Noran-da Aluminum, Inc. v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, </em>528 F.2d 1304 (8th Cir. 1976) [, <em>aff\u2019g </em>382 F.Supp. 1258 (E.D.Mo.1973)]; <em>Food Handlers Local 425 v. Valmac Industries, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 217 (8th Cir. 1975).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-20\">The issue is whether summary judgment was here required in light of <em>Alyeska.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-21\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-22\">Some of the opinion language in <em>Alyeska, </em>particularly that concerning the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d could lead to a view that attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>fees may never be recovered, absent equitable grounds or a statute specifically authorizing their recovery. Whether that view may be applicable to an \u201caward\u201d of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by a victorious litigant as a fruit of its victory need not be decided here, where we deal with compensatory damages in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred elsewhere in achieving a resumption of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Before and after <em>Alyeska, </em>this and other federal courts consistently held that damages recoverable under \u00a7 303(b) included attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by an employer in effecting a resumption of work, but did not include costs or attorneys\u2019 fees involved in bringing the \u00a7 303 action itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case, AGC seeks only the attorneys\u2019 fees it incurred in effecting a resumption of work and does not seek costs or attorneys\u2019 fees involved in bringing the \u00a7 303 action itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">In <em>Alyeska, </em>which involved the statutory limitation of right-of-way widths, 421 U.S. at 264, 95 S.Ct. at 1625, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff acting as a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d was not properly awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in light of the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that \u201cthe prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee from the loser,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 247, 95 S.Ct. at 1616, explaining, <em>id. </em>at 263-64, 95 S.Ct. at 1624-25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-9\">It is true that under some, if not most, of the statutes providing for the allowance of reasonable fees, Congress has opted to rely heavily on private enforcement to implement public policy and to allow counsel fees so as to encourage private litigation. . . . But congressional utilization of the private-attorney-general concept can in no sense be construed as a grant of authority to the Judiciary to jettison the traditional rule against non-statutory allowances to the prevailing party and to award attorneys\u2019 fees whenever the courts deem the public policy furthered by a particular statute important enough to warrant the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">Congress itself presumably has the power and judgment to pick and choose among its statutes and to allow attorneys\u2019 fees under some, but not others. But it would be difficult, indeed, for the courts, without legislative guidance, to consider some statutes important and others \u2022 unimportant and to allow attorneys\u2019 fees only in connection with the former.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">That the courts, as explained in <em>Alyeska, </em>cannot delve into statutes to select those \u201cimportant\u201d enough to warrant attorneys\u2019 fees based on a private attorney general theory is thus clear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>tion does not, however, exhaust the present inquiry as to whether a statute specifically authorizing recovery of damages by a party injured in violation of the labor law authorizes as an element of those damages the attorneys\u2019 fees it incurred in terminating the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><em>Alyeska </em>did not involve labor law and did not discuss \u00a7 303.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The case involved only the propriety of the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d exception there in issue. The attorneys\u2019 fee demand here is predicated on the recovery of compensatory damages from an earlier, terminated violation, as provided by \u00a7 303(b), not on a theory of recovery for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in a suit brought as a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d or otherwise. We cannot agree that <em>Alyeska, </em>a Supreme Court opinion in a case so different on its facts, can of itself warrant summary judgment and dismissal of a complaint seeking attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 303(b) as damages incurred in effecting resumption of work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 462, 98 S.Ct. 2441, 57 L.Ed.2d 337 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">Section 303(b) provides for compensation of injuries directly resulting from unlawful secondary activities. <em>Sheet Metal Workers International Association, </em>384 F.2d at 109. Courts have held compensable damages to include loss of profits, costs of subcontracting and overtime, overhead expense allocable to lost income, and wages of unproductive employees, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in achieving resumption of work. <em>Mead, </em>523 F.2d at 1376-79; <em>Mason-Rust, </em>435 F.2d at 945-46; <em>Sheet Metal Workers International Association, </em>384 F.2d at 109-10. What is sought here is not an \u201caward\u201d of attorneys\u2019 fees in the case at hand, but that part of AGC\u2019s compensatory damages consisting of the attorneys\u2019 fees it incurred in achieving resumption of work. <em>Scott v. Local Union 377, </em>548 F.2d 1244, 1246 (6th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>Reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in effecting resumption of work in effect take the place of other compensable damages which would continue to be suffered if work were not resumed. Aimed at mitigating the losses resulting from a work stoppage, and at preserving the enterprise, they are analogous to costs of subcontracting and overtime. They are within the purview of \u00a7 303(b), as other courts have held. <em>Texas Distributors, Inc., </em>598 F.2d at 401; <em>Sheet Metal Workers International Association, </em>384 F.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Our decision here is limited: principles enunciated in <em>Alyeska </em>will not serve to bar proper recovery of attorney\u2019s fees as damages to \u201cbusiness or property\u201d under section 303, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187. We intimate no opinion on the merits but observe that the trial court may be called upon to consider and decide whether all, part, or none of appellant\u2019s expenses for counsel fees directly related to a Union violation under . section 8(b)(4) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">Accordingly, the order of the district court granting the Unions\u2019 motion for summary judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">. Section 303 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-15\">(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason or [sic, of] any violation of subsection (a) of this section may sue therefor in any district court of the United States subject to the limitations and provisions of section 185 of this title without respect to the amount in controversy, or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties, and shall recover the damages by him sustained and the cost of the suit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">.

Reasons for the absence of discussion of <em>Alyeska </em>from these later cases are unknown, but that it went unmentioned would tend to weaken it as a sole basis for the grant of summary judgment here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1142-14\">. The thrust of <em>Alyeska, i. e., </em>that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees based on public policy is a matter for the Congress, not the courts, is clear and unquestioned, as is the continued viability of a court\u2019s inherent power to award attorneys\u2019 fees on equitable grounds, some of which are listed in <em>Alyeska. See National Association of Letter Carriers v. United States Postal Service, </em>192 U.S.App.D.C. 55, 590 F.2d 1171 (D.C.Cir.1978) (measurement of \u00a7 303(b) authorized compensatory damages by the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in terminating a work stoppage neither discussed nor involved).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">. That \u00a7 303 was not among the statutes listed in <em>Alyeska </em>as providing for attorneys\u2019 fees is not significant. There was no indication that the Court intended its list to be exhaustive. 421 U.S. at 260 n.33, 261 n.34 &amp; 35, 262 n.36, 95 S.Ct. at 1623. Among numerous others then in force but not listed were: \u00a7\u00a7 14(d), 14(f), and 14(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18(d), 18(f), and 18(g) (1974); \u00a7 8(d) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607(d) (1974); \u00a7 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 (1975); \u00a7 3 of the Hobby Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102 (1973); and \u00a7 110 of the Magnuson-Moss \u2014 Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d) (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">. The cases listed in the appealed order are not persuasive of its correctness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-7\">In F.F. <em>Instrument Corp., supra, </em>the court denied attorneys\u2019 fees because the Board proceeding, \u201caimed chiefly at securing redress and future protection,\u201d 558 F.2d at 611, was too remote from the union\u2019s violation. Though the court cited <em>Mead, </em>it recognized as the rule in \u00a7 303 cases that \u201ccosts of reasonable legal action taken ... to effect a resumption of work may be recovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610, 611 n.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-8\">The court in <em>Mead, supra, </em>noted the NLRB\u2019s adherence to the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d stated that the NLRB\u2019s limitation of attorneys\u2019 fees to cases of frivolous or bad faith defenses is not inconsistent with <em>Alyeska, </em>523 F.2d at 1381, and that recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees in every case by subsequent section 303 action would circumvent the Board\u2019s rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1381. Those considerations are not controlling. The award of damages including attorneys\u2019 fees by a federal court in a proper case under \u00a7 303(b) is not dictated by an administrative agency\u2019s rules. <em>Mead, </em>the sole appellate opinion refusing attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 303(b) in view of <em>Alyeska, </em>was not mentioned by a subsequent panel of the same court in affirming attorney\u2019s fees as damages under \u00a7 303(b). <em>Sillman, </em>535 F.2d at 1174, 1175.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-13\">In <em>Noranda, supra, </em>attorneys\u2019 fees were sought as expenses incurred in stopping a strike and picketing, 382 F.Supp. at 1263, and in bringing the \u00a7 303 suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1264. This court <em>affirmed </em>the district court\u2019s award of compensatory damages in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees, 528 F.2d at 1309-10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-14\"><em>Valmac Industries, Inc., supra, </em>involved a suit for reformation of a labor contract, 528 F.2d at 218-19, not for damages under \u00a7 303.
