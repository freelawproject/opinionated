They were sued by the owners of the renewal copyright in the George Bernard Shaw play upon which the film was based. Defendants appeal the resulting judgment for damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-27\">Plaintiffs cross appeal, claiming that the court erred in not awarding them statutory \u201cin lieu\u201d damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-28\">In 1913 Shaw registered a copyright on his stage play \u201cPygmalion\u201d. The renewal copyright on the play, obtained in 1941 and originally scheduled to expire in 1969, was extended by Congressional action to the year 1988. Shaw died in 1950 and the plaintiffs, except for Janus Films, are current proprietors of the copyright. Janus Films is a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-29\">In 1938 a derivative version of the play, a motion picture also entitled \u201cPygmalion\u201d, was produced under a license from Shaw; neither the terms nor the licensee\u2019s identity appear in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The film was produced by Gabriel Pascal, copyrighted by Loew\u2019s, and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (\u201cMGM\u201d). For undisclosed reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>the film\u2019s copyright was allowed to expire in 1966. When and if the original film rights agreement expired is also not disclosed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">In 1971 the play\u2019s copyright proprietors licensed Janus Films to be the exclusive distributor of the film \u201cPygmalion\u201d. Shortly after discovering in 1972 that Budget Films was renting out copies of the 1938 film,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Janus brought action against Budget in a California state court, alleging state causes of action \u2014 in particular, unfair competition. That case ended in Budget\u2019s favor upon a determination that the action was essentially one for copyright infringement over which the state court lacked jurisdiction. The English copyright proprietors then executed a power of attorney in favor of their licensee Janus, and Janus<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> promptly brought this action in federal district court in May 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">I. LACHES</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The defendants contend that the doctrine of laches barred the infringement action. The question of laches is addressed primarily to the discretion of the district court. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Panama Railroad Co., </em>342 U.S. 29, 30, 72 S.Ct. 12, 96 L.Ed. 31 (1951); <em>International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp. v. General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp., </em>518 F.2d 913, 926 (9th Cir. 1975). Rejection of the laches defense in this case was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-13\">Although proceeding on a different theory at the time, Janus instituted state court proceedings shortly after it learned that Budget was renting out the film \u201cPygmalion\u201d. Thus, defendants had early notice that their activities were objected to on legal grounds. But they claim that Janus misled them and the state court for two and a half years by steadfastly refusing to acknowledge the copyright nature of the action so as to keep it in state court, and that the other plaintiffs sat back on their copyright claim all that while, choosing instead to see how Janus would fare in the California courts. Only when the state court action was dismissed on the ground that the action was in fact one for infringement of copyright rather than for unfair competition did the plaintiffs file the present copyright action. Meanwhile, the defendants complain that they had incurred unnecessary expenses in the state litigation and had been falsely reinforced in their belief that no valid copyright protected the playwri-ter\u2019s rights in the film \u201cPygmalion\u201d on which the film copyright had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">Even if the plaintiffs had followed the strategy alleged, and if it somehow offends equity,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as defendants insist, the detriment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>Budget claims to have suffered as a result of plaintiffs\u2019 delay in bringing this action does not constitute prejudice within the meaning of the laches doctrine. Defendants at no time changed their film distribution activities in reliance on Janus\u2019 conduct. Defendants cite no case in which a false sense of security alone has been enough to bar an otherwise proper claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor were the expenses and difficulties of the earlier litigation incurred in reliance on plaintiffs\u2019 inaction. If plaintiffs had proceeded in both state and federal courts simultaneously, defendants would have been in no better position. This is not a case where copyright holders speculated on the probable success of a costly but unauthorized exploitation of a work before asserting their rights in it. <em>See Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp., </em>279 F.2d 100, 105 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 882, 81 S.Ct. 170, 5 L.Ed.2d 103(1960)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d 354, 372 (9th Cir. 1947). In fact, the copyright proprietors here knew the value of their property and were themselves exploiting it through the licensing arrangement with Janus. The laches defense was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">II. INFRINGEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"Azqv\">Defendants\u2019 main contention on the primary issue in this litigation is simply stated: Because the film copyright on \u201cPygmalion\u201d has expired, that film is in the public domain, and, consequently, prints of that film <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> may be used freely by anyone. Thus, they argue that their renting out of the film does not infringe the statutory copyright on Shaw\u2019s play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-12\">Defendants rely almost entirely on the recent opinion of Judge Friendly in <em>Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., </em>551 F.2d 484 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 949, 97 S.Ct. 2666, 53 L.Ed.2d 266 (1977). However, in so relying, they ignore or fail to appreciate the significant differences between that case and this one.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-13\">In <em>Rohauer </em>the author of a novel which was statutorily copyrighted in 1925 assigned exclusive movie rights to one Mos-kowitz, specifically promising in the contract to reassign to him or his successor in interest all film rights for the novel\u2019s copyright renewal term. A successful silent film was made under that assignment and separately copyrighted in 1926 by an assign-ee of Moskowitz. Unfortunately, the novel\u2019s author died prior to the end of the novel\u2019s first copyright term. The author\u2019s daughter, as statutory beneficiary of the right to renew, inherited the renewal term free from the film license granted by her mother.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The daughter then granted ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>elusive movie and television rights for the renewal term to Rohauer. Killiam Shows, Inc., successor in interest to the 1926 film\u2019s renewal copyright, allowed the film to be shown on educational television without Ro-hauer\u2019s or the daughter\u2019s authorization, whereupon the latter two brought a copyright infringement action against Killiam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">The Second Circuit held on those facts that the derivative film\u2019s independent copyright entitled the defendant to continue showing the film without infringing rights under the renewal copyright in the underlying novel. Defendants here understand by this that a derivative copyright covers more than the new matter which the producer of the derivative work added to the underlying work. Thus, they say that when the derivative copyright expires the whole product enters the public domain free of the monopoly protection of any subsisting copyright in the underlying work. The court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rohauer, </em>however, makes it clear that this is simply not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">First, the <em>Rohauer </em>court placed heavy emphasis on the nongratuitous intent of the nonsurviving author to convey film rights in the novel\u2019s renewal term, a promise which had been bargained for in the initial assignment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants here have never bargained with Shaw or his successors for anything, nor do they enjoy any relationship with anyone who had so bargained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-12\">A second important difference between the favored party in <em>Rohauer </em>and the defendants here is that the defendant Killiam there was the proprietor of the still valid copyright in the film. By virtue of that copyright, Killiam was held to have sufficient rights in the matter derived from the novel to continue showing it-as part of the film.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A prominent rationale in that case for awarding those limited rights in favor of the owner of the derivative copyright is the protection and encouragement of the \u201clarge and independently copyrightable\u201d \u201cliterary, musical and economic\u201d contributions of the \u201cperson who with the consent of the author has created an opera or a motion picture film\u201d from a copyrighted novel. 551 F.2d at 493. However, whatever place sympathy for the position of creators of derivative works might properly have under the 1909 Copyright Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>defendants here can take advantage of none, having contributed nothing to the production of the film \u201cPygmalion\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Nor is it apparent under <em>Rohauer </em>that such sympathy should have any place at all when the independent copyright on the derivative work has been allowed to expire. For then there is no longer a conflict between two copyrights, each apparently granting \u201ctheir proprietors overlapping \u2018exclusive\u2019 rights to use whatever underlying material * * * had been incorporated into the derivative film.\u201d Comment, <em>Derivative Copyright and the 1909 Act </em>\u2014 New <em>Clarity or Confusion?, </em>44 Brooklyn L.Rev. 905, 912 (1978) (footnote omitted). Thus, the persons who might have had standing to raise the <em>Rohauer </em>claim here could, consistently with that case, be held to have forfeited it by their failure to renew the derivative copyright. Defendants here could never have laid claim to the right recognized in <em>Rohauer, </em>and we perceive no reason to award it to them at the expense of the holders of the renewal copyright which still covers the Shaw play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Thus, we reaffirm, without finding it necessary to repeat the rationale, the well-established doctrine that a derivative copyright protects <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> only the new material contained in the derivative work, not the matter derived from the underlying work. 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 3.04 (1979). Thus, although the derivative work may enter the public domain, the matter contained therein which derives from a work still covered by statutory copyright is not dedicated to the public. <em>G. Ricordi &amp; Co. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., </em>189 F.2d 469 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 849, 72 S.Ct. 77, 96 L.Ed. 641 (1951); <em>Filmvideo Releasing Corp. v. Hastings, </em>426 F.Supp. 690 (S.D.N.Y.1976); <em>Grove Press, Inc. v. Greenleaf Publishing Co., </em>247 F.Supp. 518 (E.D.N.Y. 1965); 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 3.07[C] at 334 (1979). The established doctrine prevents unauthorized copying or other infringing <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> use of the underlying work or any part of that work contained in the derivative product so long as the underlying work itself remains copyrighted. Therefore, since exhibition of the film \u201cPygmalion\u201d necessarily involves exhibition of parts of Shaw\u2019s play, which is still copyrighted, plaintiffs here may prevent defendants from renting the film for exhibition without their authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">Defendants seek finally to avoid this result by citing <em>Classic Film Museum, Inc. v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>597 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1979), <em>aff\u2019g </em>453 F.Supp. 852 (D.Me.1978). That decision concerned \u201cthe legal effect of an expired statutory copyright on work derived from an underlying work in which there exists a common-law copyright\u201d. 597 F.2d at 13. Although defendants would have us ignore the major difference be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>tween an underlying common-law copyright and an underlying statutory copyright (the former extending in perpetuity,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the latter restricted in length) that difference is the linchpin of the court\u2019s holding in <em>Classic Film </em>that a person could exhibit the motion picture \u201cA Star is Born\u201d, on which the film copyright had expired, without infringing the common-law copyright in the unpublished screenplay and musical score from which the film was derived. The court found the <em>Ricordi </em>doctrine inapplicable for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1209-5\"><em>\u201c * </em>* * [A]ny protection offered by the <em>Ricordi </em>doctrine was limited to the fixed life of the underlying copyright (28 years plus the renewal period). The <em>Ri-cordi </em>doctrine is not equally applicable where there is an underlying common-law copyright which might extend indefinitely. Such unending protection of the derivative work would allow the <em>Ricordi </em>exception to swallow the rule of limited monopoly found in the constitution and copyright statutes.\u201d 597 F.2d at 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">The underlying statutory copyright in the instant case will expire in 1988. After that time Budget may freely distribute its copies of the 1938 film. The result we reach here does not conflict with the limited monopoly policy rooted in the Copyrights Clause of the constitution and advanced in the congressional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that defendants\u2019 activities here infringed the subsisting copyright in Shaw\u2019s play and were properly enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-12\">III. DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-13\">On cross-appeal plaintiffs contest on two grounds the award of $3,700 in damages, which was the calculated estimate of Budget\u2019s gross receipts from its rental of \u201cPygmalion\u201d from May 1972 to December 1977. Plaintiffs argue, first, that statutory \u201cin lieu\u201d damages<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are mandatory in this situation; and, second, that if statutory damages are not mandatory then the district court abused its discretion in limiting damages to the infringer\u2019s gross profits in this case. We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-14\">It is true that when injury is proved but neither the infringer\u2019s.profits nor the copyright holder\u2019s actual damages can be proved, statutory damages are mandatory. <em>See Pye v. Mitchell, </em>574 F.2d 476, 481 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Robert Stigwood Group LTD v. O\u2019Reilly, </em>530 F.2d 1096, 1101 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 848, 97 S.Ct. 135, 50 L.Ed.2d 121 (1976); 4 <em>Nimmer on Copyright, </em>App. 16-4 (1979). In addition, some of the dicta in <em>Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. 4636 S. Vermont Ave., Inc., </em>367 F.2d 236 (9th Cir. 1966),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> might lead one to conclude that \u201cin lieu\u201d damages are also mandatory when either profits or damages but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>both are proved. This circuit recently examined at length the meaning of the <em>Shapiro </em>dicta in light of <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 228, 73 S.Ct. 222, 97 L.Ed. 276 (1952).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We concluded that, contrary to initial appearances, <em>Shapiro </em>in fact means that \u201cin lieu\u201d damages are mandatory \u201conly when <em>both </em>profits and damages have not been established.\u201d <em>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>562 F.2d 1157, 1178 (9th Cir. 1977). It is not necessary to repeat that analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">In <em>Krofft, </em>the jury had assessed plaintiffs\u2019 actual damages at $50,000, an amount not reflecting consideration of the infringer\u2019s profits. The district judge subsequently denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an accounting of defendant\u2019s profits and awarded the compensatory damages only. Our court\u2019s remand order \u00f3n the issue is instructive of the law in this circuit regarding infringement damages and in particular court discretion in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1210-5\">\u201cOn remand the trial court\u2019s first task is to determine, if possible, the profits of the infringers. If these profits are ascertainable, then plaintiffs are entitled to the larger of either the profits or damages, unless the district court, in its discretion, awards the statutory \u2018in lieu\u2019 damages. If the profits are not ascertainable, then plaintiffs are entitled to the compensatory damages as found by the jury, unless the district court awards the discretionary \u2018in lieu\u2019 damages.\u201d 562 F.2d at 1179.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">While it was unnecessary in <em>Krofft </em>to instruct for the situation where damages are unascertainable while profits are ascertained, the situation facing us, we see no reason for holding, asymmetrically, that in lieu damages would be mandatory in that situation rather than discretionary. <em>Accord, F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-10\">Plaintiffs in the instant action seek to bring their situation under the mandatory statutory damage rule by showing that the district court found that neither actual damages nor infringer\u2019s profits were ascertainable. It is undisputed that plaintiffs\u2019 actual damages are unascertainable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Plaintiffs then point to the court\u2019s finding of fact that Budget\u2019s \u201cactual profits on the use of PYGMALION are not ascertainable\u201d as compelling an award of in lieu damages in accord with the preceding rule of law. But they take the judge\u2019s words too literally and out of context. Finding (4) continues: \u201cdefendants\u2019 gross receipts are ascertainable with reasonable certainty,\u201d and finding (7) adopts those receipts as \u201cthe actual amount of the defendants\u2019 profits.\u201d These latter findings comport with the district court\u2019s earlier memorandum opinion on the damages issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 confusion stems in part from the meaning of the term \u201cactual profits\u201d. It is clear from a reading of the statute<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that the infringer\u2019s profits to which the copyright proprietor may be entitled consist of the gross receipts or sale profits from the infringing use of the plaintiff\u2019s work, which is the plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish, less any direct costs incurred by the defendant in connection with the unauthorized use, on which the latter party bears the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>proof. If an infringer does not assume this burden or if its attempt to do so is found unacceptable by the court, as was the case here, then \u201cthe gross figure is left to stand as the profit factor\u201d under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b). <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., </em>344 U.S. at 230, 73 S.Ct. 222. Plaintiffs in such a situation gain the advantage of a higher profit figure than would otherwise occur, although they may also discover that they would have fared better in the long run if the court had deemed the profits unascertainable. To achieve the results plaintiffs here desire, they assail the method the district court used to calculate the gross receipts figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">In order to avoid laborious search of defendants\u2019 records, plaintiffs stipulated to estimates of the number of unauthorized bookings made by Budget of the film \u201cPygmalion\u201d. The figures totalled 136 bookings. In the stipulation, which was filed with the court on January 18, 1978, plaintiffs agreed that the booking figures \u201cmay be used by the Court * * * on the remaining issues,\u201d primary of which was the issue of damages. Contained within the document but not stipulated to by the plaintiffs was a representation by defendants of their rental charges for the film per booking: $25 from May 1972 to October 1976, and $35 thereafter. The court eventually <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> used these rental figures to calculate defendants\u2019 gross receipts for the stipulated bookings, each of which was found to constitute a separate infringement, to arrive at a total of $3,700. Plaintiffs contend that, since they had not agreed to the rental amounts, as opposed to the bookings figures, the court erred in basing the gross receipts upon them. We cannot agree. The rental figures were identical to those that were advertised in Budget\u2019s catalogs for \u201cPygmalion\u201d. Plaintiffs have presented no reason to doubt their accuracy, and no contradictory evidence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We think the district court\u2019s utilization of those figures was reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, we find that the profits figure yielded by the court\u2019s calculation was sufficiently certain to preclude applicability of the mandatory in lieu damages rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">Plaintiffs next argue that the district court abused its discretion by awarding them the infringers\u2019 profits of $3,700 rather than statutory damages which at a minimum would amount to $34,000. They rely in part on <em>Sid and Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., supra, </em>as supporting the proposition that the court must weigh statutory damages against infringers\u2019 profits and award the higher sum. However, what was said in <em>Krofft </em>was not that in lieu damages must be given if they benefit, but that they must not be given if they hurt plaintiffs. 562 F.2d at 1178-79 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">The cases cited by plaintiffs as affirming a discretionary award of statutory damages involved rejections by. district courts of <em>de minimis </em>profits of the infring-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>ers as an alternative basis of recovery. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>v. <em>Contemporary Arts, Inc., supra </em>(gross profits under $900); <em>Key West Hand Print Fabrics, Inc. v. Servin, Inc., </em>269 F.Supp. 605, 615 (S.D.Fla.1966) (in-fringer made no profit), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>381 F.2d 735 (5th Cir. 1967). The courts there had every reason to award higher compensation for the plaintiffs\u2019 substantial but unprovable damage than what the defendants had realized from their infringing activity. We are not faced with a similar situation in this case. The gross profits figure here can hardly be described as <em>de minimis. </em>We think the amount sufficient \u201cto discourage wrongful conduct\u201d without necessitating resort to in lieu damages to effectuate that purpose of copyright policy. <em>Woolworth, </em>344 U.S. at 233, 73 S.Ct. 222.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We find no abuse of discretion and consequently affirm the damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">IV. ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">The copyright statute authorizes the district court in the exercise of its discretion to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 116. This court could reverse an order allowing such fees only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Monogram Models, Inc. v. Industo Motive Corp., </em>492 F.2d 1281, 1288 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 843, 95 S.Ct. 76, 42 L.Ed.2d 71 (1974). While the $10,000 awarded plaintiffs in fees might be considered generous when compared with the amount recovered in damages, the fees do not appear unreasonable considering the amount of work necessitated and performed and the skill employed. <em>See also Key West Hand Print Fabrics, </em>269 F.Supp. at 615-16. There was no abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">However, we deny plaintiffs\u2019 application for allowance of additional attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal. We assume counsel was familiar with the law, having made similar arguments in district court on all the issues raised on appeal. <em>See Monogram Models, </em>492 F.2d at 1288. The appeal was not frivolous. Plaintiffs did not prevail on their cross appeal. Equity considerations lead us to permit the parties to pay their own attorneys\u2019 fees in this court. The plaintiffs are entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1204-19\">. Defendants had also challenged in their notice of appeal the damages portion of the judgment. They argued that the district court should have assessed as damages their self-calculated and unverified net profits rather than the gross receipts they had initially estimated. This theory did not survive oral argument when counsel conceded that the court\u2019s choice of the measure of damages was well within its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1204-31\">. In their initial brief on appeal, plaintiffs cite <em>Speelman v. Pascal, </em>10 N.Y.2d 313, 222 N.Y.S.2d 324, 326, 178 N.E.2d 723, 724 (1961), to support their statement that it was Gabriel Pascal who obtained the movie rights under an agreement with Shaw.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">. Defendants make much of the failure to bring the original license terms before the trial court, questioning the right of the play\u2019s copyright holders in 1971 to license anyone as the exclusive distributor of the film. However, we fail to see how a question about the enforceability of Janus\u2019 distribution contract \u2014 which is not an issue in this case \u2014 enhances defendants\u2019 position here. Defendants neither stand in the shoes of, nor are in privity with, anyone else, such as Pascal\u2019s legatees, MGM, or Loew\u2019s, who might arguably still enjoy some right of distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">.

We are not aware of enough of the facts surrounding the earlier litigation to criticize what plaintiffs have done. However, Janus cannot be said to have lacked diligence in seeking a remedy or to have acquiesced in any way in the alleged wrong. <em>Gilliam v.

In <em>Southern </em>Pacific, minority shareholders finally hit upon a successful remedy twenty-two years after the majority\u2019s reorganization agreement which cut the minority out of its share of the profits. Laches was held not to bar the action to impose a constructive trust even though plaintiffs\u2019 earlier position in its many unsuccessful court attempts might have been justifiably viewed as incompatible with the later assertion of a trust relationship. (See McReynolds, J., dissenting, 250 U.S. at 500, 39 S.Ct. 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-16\">Janus filed the instant copyright action promptly after dismissal of its state suit and its receipt of power of attorney from the copyright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>proprietors. The two actions are not inconsistent. As the holder of an exclusive license from the copyright proprietors, who are joined in this action solely for standing purposes, Janus has been and remains the only interested person from the time it first discovered Budget\u2019s distribution of the film. And it has \u201cever since * * * persisted in the diligent pursuit of a remedy * * <em>*Southern Pacific Co. v.

We note that the so-called \u201cnew property rights\u201d theory which <em>Rohauer v.

This case arose under the Copyright Act of Mar. 4, 1909, codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-216 (1976). Thus, all references are to that version of the copyright statute unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-15\">In 1976 the 1909 Act was revised in its entirety, superseded by the Copyright Act of Oct. 19, 1976, now codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-810 (Supp.1977), which became wholly effective as of Jan. 1, 1978. In contrast to the earlier act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>the 1976 Copyright Act expressly allows use of derivative works \u201cunder the terms of the grant\u201d upon termination of the license under which they were produced. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(b)(1) (Supp.1977). Although inapplicable to the case before him, Judge Friendly took this to be \u201cevidence for a belief on the part of Congress of the need for special protection for derivative works.\u201d <em>Rohauer v.

Killiam Shows, Inc., </em>to extend the limited monopoly permitted by the underlying copyright despite the fear expressed in the student comment, <em>supra </em>note 10, at 921. The protection advanced in that case was no doubt limited to the derivative copyright owner\u2019s continued use of the derivative work, and not the right to prevent others from using the underlying work once that work falls into the public domain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1208-11\">. A copyright proprietor has an exclusive monopoly over <em>all </em>uses of the protected work, including the right to copy, print, vend, publish, make other versions of, perform or exhibit the work. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. Thus, we find Judge Friendly\u2019s attempt to limit <em>G. Ricordi &amp; Co. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., supra </em>note 11, to its specific facts unconvincing. <em>Rohauer v.

The 1909 Act made no distinction between a copyright owner\u2019s right to authorize copying or exhibition of the work as it appears in an existing derivative work and the right to authorize creation of a new derivative work. Nor did the court in a case involving essentially the same question as that which confronts us. <em>Filmvideo Releasing Corp. v.

Janus\u2019 actual damages are apparently unas-certainable for several reasons. There is no way of knowing whether Budget\u2019s customers could afford to rent the film from Janus at the latter\u2019s higher price. There is harm to the authorized distributor\u2019s reputation inasmuch as its right to exclusive distribution becomes challenged by its own customers in the face of Budget\u2019s catalog. In addition, it is alleged that Budget\u2019s advertising of \u201cPygmalion\u201d has led to the unauthorized use of the film by cable and small television stations. We offer no opinion as to the propriety of including all these factors in calculating compensable damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1210-13\">. <em>See supra </em>note 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">. After the filing of the stipulation, the court ordered the parties to conduct any discovery necessary to assist the court in calculating the infringers\u2019 profits according to the following formula: the product of the number of bookings and the average rental fees per booking, less defendants\u2019 deductible costs. Defendants maintain that in compliance they conducted an exhaustive inspection of their records, which plaintiffs were welcome to, but did not, verify independently. This inspection apparently yielded a minimal profits figure, less costs, of $153.96. Armed with the information that the stipulated bookings figure was overestimated, defendants sought to withdraw the stipulation unilaterally. This attempt was unsuccessful. The court rejected their figures, including their cost calculations, and, looking anew at the stipulation, found that it had provided the information needed to measure defendants\u2019 gross receipts. Defendants no longer challenge the court\u2019s calculation of damages. This was probably a wise concession. Were we to agree with defendants\u2019 earlier argument, we would have to remand and the district court might then properly and understandably exercise its discretion to award in lieu damages rather than to limit plaintiffs\u2019 recovery to the claimed <em>de minimis </em>profits. <em>See F.
