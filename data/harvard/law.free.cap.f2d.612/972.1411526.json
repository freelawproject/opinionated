R. 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1053-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Manuel Contreras Palacios was convicted of distribution of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The principal witnesses against him at trial were Neri Garcia and Anselmo Gomez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">Defendant\u2019s first contention on appeal is that the agreements of Garcia and Gomez to testify in return for the dismissal of charges against them rendered their testimony invalid as a matter of law. As a result, he argues, there was insufficient evidence to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">The thesis of defendant\u2019s argument was considered and rejected by this Court in <em>United States v. Garner, </em>581 F.2d 481, 485 (5th Cir. 1978). In <em>Garner, </em>as here, it was contended that the testimony of admitted drug users who were testifying pursuant to plea bargain agreements was \u201cincredible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court observed that the jury is the arbiter of the credibility of witnesses, and that for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agm-dedup-0\">testimony to be considered incredible [as a matter of law] \u201cit must be unbelievable on its face\u201d, /. e., testimony as to \u201cfacts that [the witness] physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cravero, </em>530 F.2d 666, 670 (5th Cir. 1976)). Since the testimony of Garcia and Gomez fell far short of this rigorous standard of \u201clegal\u201d incredibility, the jury was the final arbiter of their credibility and its decision to credit the testimony of Garcia and Gomez, as evidenced by the verdict, cannot be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">During his closing summary, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-14\">Ladies and gentlemen, two essential elements: Manuel Contreras Palacios on or about August 30, distributed three grams of heroin to Neri Flores Garcia. Uncontroverted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">Defendant\u2019s objection to the characterization of evidence as \u201cuncontroverted\u201d was overruled. The trial judge nevertheless delivered a lengthy instruction informing the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-16\">[t]he failure of the defendant . to take the stand in his defense . ... will not be considered by you as any evidence at all of his guilt,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az9\">and that they were not to consider the prosecutor\u2019s remark \u201cas imposing any obligation upon the defendant to controvert any matter in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-18\">To reverse for improper commentary on the failure of the accused to take the stand, there must be either a manifest intent of the prosecutor to comment upon the failure of the accused to testify or a remark of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be such a comment. <em>United States v. Corral-Martinez, </em>592 F.2d 263, 269 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-19\">A remark similar to that challenged here was addressed by this Court in <em>United States v. Rochan, </em>563 F.2d 1246, 1249 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1977), and held not to be improper commentary under the circumstances of that case. In view of the isolated nature of the remark and the extensive corrective instruction given by the court at defendant\u2019s request, it is highly unlikely that the prosecutor manifestly intended to comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify or that the jury necessarily understood the remark to be of such a character. <em>See also United States v. Jennings, </em>527 F.2d 862, 871 (5th Cir. 1976). There was no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
