Plaintiff Ambook Enterprises a/k/a American Book Club (Ambook) is a Pennsylvania partnership which was organized to engage in the retail and wholesale selling of books and records in interstate commerce. The partners were two corporations, L-Club Corporation and American Book Club. L-Club Corporation is owned by eight persons connected with a highly regarded New York investment firm; an affidavit filed on its behalf states that this action has not been authorized by it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> American Book Club is owned by three individuals, one of them Cletus P. Lyman, a Philadelphia attorney, whose firm, Lyman &amp; Ash, was counsel of record when the action was brought and has participated in its prosecution, although New York counsel has now been substituted. Ambook, which began operations in January, 1968 and conducted them as a partnership since December, 1969, discontinued these in mid-1972, shortly after this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"AvV\">The defendants are Time Incorporated (Time), publisher of the well-known weekly magazine of that name; the New York Times Co. (N.Y. Times), publisher of the nation\u2019s foremost newspaper; four of the country\u2019s largest advertising agencies, J. Walter Thompson Co. (JWT); Young &amp; Ru-bicam International, Inc. (Y &amp; R); Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn, Inc. (BBD&amp;O); and Ted Bates &amp; Company, Inc. (Bates); <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As), a trade association engaged in formulating policies for and promoting its members including the above-named agency defendants. Ambook placed advertisements with Time and N.Y. Times, and 43 other non-defendant publications, but had no dealings with JWT, Y&amp;R, BBD&amp;O or Bates. It placed its ads at various times through three interrelated agencies, New-mark, Posner &amp; Mitchell, Inc., Victor Schiff &amp; Co. (a \u201cdivision\u201d of the Kaplan Agency), and Schiff/Brown &amp; Co. (hereafter collectively referred to as Schiff-Brown),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> none of which was named as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">Ambook sought in an amended complaint to bring the action \u201cindividually and in a representative capacity on behalf of the class of all similarly situated advertisers, namely, producers, wholesalers and retailers of goods and services in interstate commerce in the United States who advertise in publications.\u201d The gravamen of the complaint was that by agreement between the two named publishers and countless others, the 4As, the named agencies and countless others, plaintiff and the class it wished to represent had been forced to utilize the services of advertising agencies, since the publishers granted the agencies a uniform discount of 15%, whereas any advertiser who wished to place an advertisement directly with the publisher was forced to pay the charges set in rate cards, which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>17.6%<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> above the rates charged the agencies and, in addition, pay the costs of various services many of which were furnished by the agencies and paid for by them out of the 15% discount. The complaint alleged that as a result of this conspiracy Ambook had paid the two publisher defendants $4,000 and other \u201cconspirator publications\u201d $20,000 more than if it had been able to receive the 15% discount and pay its own expenses for doing what Schiff/Brown did. The corresponding figures for the class were estimated as at least $30 million for Time and the N.Y. Times and $300 million for unnamed \u201cconspirator publications\u201d. Damages were sought against all defendants in an amount in excess of $500,000 for Ambook and in excess of $1 billion for members of the class. Injunctive relief was also requested. The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania transferred the action, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404, to the District Court for the Southern District of New York where it was assigned to Judge Griesa.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In February, 1973, Time moved for a determination that the action could not be maintained as a class action. Ambook cross-moved for an order which, <em>inter alia, </em>would allow the filing of a second amended complaint and would determine that the action should proceed as a class action. One count in the proposed second amended complaint was based on the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13. As a result of a hearing, Ambook submitted a revised definition of classes. This narrowed the field to three damage subclasses and one injunctive class. The damage subclasses were all advertisers in Time from January 1, 1968, all advertisers in the N.Y. Times excluding classified and retail advertisers from the same date, and all motion picture advertisers in the N.Y. Times from the same date;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the injunctive class consisted of \u201c[a]ll persons and entities who have advertised or who are likely to advertise in the future in the publications\u201d of Time and the N.Y. Times.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">In a considered opinion, 60 F.R.D. 476 (S.D.N.Y.1973), Judge Griesa held that the action could not be maintained as a class action. Agreeing with that determination, we see no need to discuss all the reasons the judge gave for it. It suffices that Ambook was out of business and that there was no assurance that it was \u201cin a position to carry on class litigation in this Court in a responsible and vigorous manner\u201d, 60 F.R.D. at 487; that Ambook had no dealings with the four agency defendants whom it had named and thus might stand differently from advertisers who had; and that, as subsequent discussion will reveal, much may hang on the ability of a particular advertiser to have established an \u201cin house\u201d advertising organization which the publishing defendants might have recognized or to perform equivalent services. The judge denied the motion to file the proposed second amended complaint without prejudice to a motion to file a further pleading devoid of class action allegations. An appeal to this court was dismissed for want of appellate jurisdiction, even under the \u201cdeath-knell\u201d doctrine then prevailing in this circuit but subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Plaintiff thereupon moved for leave to file a second amended complaint without class action allegations. The court granted this, with two exceptions. It struck a claim of discrimination under the Robinson-Pat-man Act on the ground that that statute deals only with the sale of commodities, and prayers for injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 25, since \u00a7 25 refers only to suits by the United States, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26, authorizing injunctive relief for private parties \u201cagainst threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws\u201d, since Am-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>book had been out of business since mid-1972 and was in the process of liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Although the quondam action for a billion dollars in damages and a sweeping injunction had thus dwindled to a relatively small damage suit on its own behalf, Am-book continued to pursue it with considerable vigor. After extensive pretrial proceedings, defendants moved for summary judgment in June, 1976, which was denied a year later, primarily on the ground of lack of sufficient evidence concerning the relationship between Ambook and Schiff-Brown, 464 F.Supp. at 1129-30. After further discussion of the issues, Ambook designated the witnesses it would call on that issue at a trial of the action. These were Victor Schiff and Stephen Brown, the principals of the three advertising agencies Am-book had used; K. Elia Georgiades, a former Vice President of Ambook; and Milton Pierce, a person in the advertising business who had introduced Ambook to Schiff. Their depositions were taken and plaintiff accepted their testimony as true except as noted in a letter of plaintiff\u2019s attorney dated March 24,1978, which also indicated that Ambook might call an economist to testify what fees might be paid to advertising agencies in a free market environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On May 1, 1978, defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment. The court granted this on January 11, 1979, in a lengthy and reasoned opinion, 464 F.Supp. 1127. Plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> It will be convenient to deal at the outset with Ambook\u2019s contention that the court erred in striking its claim under the Robinson-Patman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The Robinson-Patman Act, so far as here pertinent, makes it unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">The question whether this applies to the sale of newspaper advertisements has not been determined by the Supreme Court, <em>Times Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, </em>345 U.S. 594, 609-10 n. 27, 73 S.Ct. 872, 97 L.Ed. 1277 (1953) (dealing with similar language in \u00a7 3 of the Clayton Act), or by this court, <em>Syracuse Broadcasting Corp. v. Newhouse, </em>236 F.2d 522, 527 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\"><em>National Tire Wholesale, Inc. v. Washington Post </em>Co., 441 F.Supp. 81, 84-86 (D.D.C.1977), <em>aff\u2019d </em>194 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 595 F.2d 888 (D.C.Cir.1979), squarely held as the district court had done here, that newspaper advertising was not a \u201ccommodity\u201d under the Robinson-Patman Act. The same result was reached in interpreting the term \u201ccommodity\u201d under \u00a7 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14, in <em>ALW, Inc. v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 52 (9 Cir. 1975). Many other relevant cases, although less directly in point, have taken a strict view of the meaning of the term \u201ccommodities\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>As against all this Ambook relies on a recent opinion of the Federal Trade Commission, CCH FTC Complaints and Orders 121,448 in <em>The Times-Mirror Co., </em>(July 27, 1978), that the Robinson-Patman Act applies to the sale of retail newspaper advertising, to which a district court deferred in <em>Sun Communications, Inc. v. Waters Publications, Inc., </em>466 F.Supp. 387, 390-91 (W.D.Mo.1979). We decline to accord similar deference. The FTC opinion runs directly contrary to a statement by one of the bill\u2019s sponsors during the debate on the floor of the Senate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">Mr. Gore. I should like to ask the Senator from Kentucky what application the provision now under discussion would have to newspapers which merely act as advertising mediums or agencies. Would it prevent a differential charge on their part respecting advertisers, based on or measured by the amount of advertising carried?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">Mr. Logan. <em>No. </em>(80 Cong.Rec. 3115, 3119 (March 3, 1936)) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>79 Cong.Rec. 9078-79 (June 11, 1935); H.R. 8277, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957), discussed in <em>Kennedy Theater Ticket Service v. Ticketron, supra, </em>342 F.Supp. at 926.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">It also runs counter to a statement by Representative Patman in a book written only two years after passage of the Act, The Robinson-Patman Act, p. 75 (1938). We recognize that \u201cpost-passage remarks by legislators, however explicit, cannot serve to change the legislative intent of Congress expressed before the Act\u2019s passage.\u201d Regional <em>Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 132, 95 S.Ct. 335, 353, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974). But here the term \u201ccommodities\u201d, in the ordinary use of language, would not be taken to include newspaper advertising. To regard advertisements as commodities would involve almost insolvable problems in determining whether these were of \u201clike grade and quality\u201d. See <em>Baum v. Investors Diversified Services, Inc., supra, </em>409 F.2d at 875. The page of the newspaper, the month, the day of the week, and many other factors would have to be weighed in answering this question, as well as in determining defenses allowed by the Act. Whatever the rule as to the deference to be accorded an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it has the duty to administer, see <em>Federal Trade Comm\u2019n v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>380 U.S. 374, 385, 85 S.Ct. 1035, 13 L.Ed.2d 904 (1965), \u201cthis is a case where understanding of the statute depends in no small measure on prior judicial decisions and legislative history \u2014 subjects on which a court has a greater competence than the agency.\u201d <em>Pittston Stevedoring Corp. v. </em>Dellaventura, 544 F.2d 35, 50 (2 Cir. 1976), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977). The FTC\u2019s purported discovery, forty-two years after the event, of a meaning in the RobinsonPatman Act contrary to the ordinary reading of the language, disavowed on the floor of the Senate, disclaimed by the statute\u2019s principal author two years after its passage, raising grave problems of administration, and contrary to the consistent course of judicial decision on this and related matters, is a discovery of something that is not there. See <em>Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., </em>358 U.S. 354, 370-71, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Turning to the claim under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, we find no occasion for recapitulating at length the learning on the use of summary judgment in antitrust cases expressed in such leading decisions as <em>Poller v. C.B.S., </em>368 U.S. 464, 467-73, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962), on the one hand, and <em>First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 289-90, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968), on the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Still a few preliminary observations may be in order. The defendants stress that this is not a case where summary judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>granted on affidavits alone. The parties engaged in extensive discovery including a number of depositions, although, as will appear, there was at least one question of credibility on a point of some importance. However, there is still the point that the body having the ultimate power to draw inferences, in this instance a jury, did not see and hear the witnesses. Summary judgment for the defendants can be sustained in such a case if but only if the reviewing court is satisfied that a properly instructed jury, giving full weight to plaintiff\u2019s evidence, drawing every reasonable inference in its favor,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and subjecting defendants\u2019 evidence to a critical eye,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> could not rationally have found that plaintiff was entitled to any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Since defendants submitted evidence contradicting Ambook\u2019s allegations, it was incumbent upon Ambook to provide some evi-dentiary support for its complaint, Fed.R. Civ.Pro. 56(e); <em>First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., supra, </em>391 U.S. at 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, although this evidence did not have to be such as would require resolution of the substantive issues in Am-book\u2019s favor. Recognizing this, Ambook has not merely relied on its allegations but has submitted evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The question is of its quality. As put in <em>Cities Service, </em>did plaintiff\u2019s case remain devoid \u201cof <em>any </em>significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint\u201d? 391 U.S. at 290, 88 S.Ct. at 1593 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Defendants\u2019 primary contention is that Ambook\u2019s evidence would not permit the finding of a \u201ccontract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade\u201d during the period from June 1, 1968 to June 1, 1972. There was an abundant showing that one had existed earlier. The record is replete with evidence that a prime objective of the 4As, organized in 1917, with JWT and a predecessor of BBD&amp;O as members, was to perpetuate a dual price system. Advertisers dealing directly with the media would be charged a full card rate, whereas in the case of those employing recognized agencies, the latter would receive a 15% deduction \u2014 no more, no less \u2014 none of which was rebated to the advertiser.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Advertisers were thus economically forced to utilize agencies, who would receive and retain 15% of the card rate as reimbursement for the services they performed; to the extent that the advertiser could have performed these services for less, the conspiracy increased his cost of advertising by the difference.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The only exception was that a few large advertisers apparently had sufficient muscle that they were allowed to have \u201cin house\u201d agencies, who were treated in the same way as the independents.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>This system was threatened when, on May 12,1955, the United States filed a civil antitrust action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The defendants were the 4As and five media associations. The complaint alleged a number of conspiracies which we set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In May 1956 the Government entered into a series of consent decrees with each of the defendants. These recited that no testimony had been taken and that defendants were consenting to the entry of judgment \u201cwithout trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law herein and without any findings of fact.\u201d The decree was to apply not only to each defendant and its officers, servants, employees, etc. but also \u201cto any committee or groups of consenting defendant\u2019s membership when organized and functioning as committees or groups of consenting defendant, and to all other persons in active concert or participation with it who receive actual notice of the Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise.\u201d By paragraph IV A each defendant was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH-\">enjoined and restrained from entering into, adhering to, promoting or following any course of conduct, practice or policy, or any agreement or understanding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">(1) Establishing or stabilizing agency commissions, or attempting so to do;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">(2) Requiring, urging or requesting any advertising agency to refrain from rebating or splitting agency commissions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">(3) Requiring, urging or requesting any media to deny or limit credit or agency commission due or available to any advertising agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">(4) Establishing or formulating, or attempting to establish or formulate, any standards of conduct or other qualifications to be used by any media or any association of media to determine whether media should or should not do business with or recognize any advertising agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">(5) Requiring, urging or requesting any media not to do business with or not to recognize any advertising agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">(6) Establishing or stabilizing advertising rates to be charged advertisers not employing an advertising agency, or attempting so to do;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">(7) Requiring, urging or requesting any media to adhere to publisher advertising rates or rate cards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">By paragraph IV B each defendant was likewise enjoined and restrained from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-A\">requiring, urging or requesting any of its members to engage in any activities covered by Paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (A) of this Section IV.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">The record leaves no doubt that many of the practices alleged by the Government in 1955 to have violated \u00a7 1 have since been eliminated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Taking item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>IV A (2) in particular, the evidence demonstrates that there is no longer any policy of urging or requesting any advertising agency \u201cto refrain from rebating or splitting agency commissions.\u201d At least eight types of compensation arrangements between advertisers and agencies are now in effect,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> although the record does not show their relative frequency or much else about them. Quite clearly there is no agreement among agencies not to solicit business from customers of their rivals, as was alleged in paragraph (B). There was, however, evidence from which a jury could conclude that a number of the practices alleged in the 1955 complaint still exist. Agency \u201ccommissions\u201d remain a uniform 15%. Some standards are still being prescribed to determine which agencies will qualify for recognition as house agencies. And advertisers not employing a recognized agency, outside or house, are still being charged at card rates with no variance or discount available for performing the services provided by agencies. A jury could rationally conclude from the evidence here adduced that during the damage period substantially all advertising agencies and the publishing media pursued a plan whereby if a national advertiser approached a newspaper or magazine, he would typically be told that if he were willing to deal through a recognized agency, the agent would receive a 15% deduction but that otherwise he would be charged the full card rate. While the 15% deduction could play a part in negotiations between the advertiser and the agent as to the compensation the latter would receive, the record is silent how far most advertisers were aware of this. The only exception to this, if in fact it be one, was that some members of the media, including the two media defendants here, to a limited extent hereafter described, would allow the advertiser to establish a \u201chouse agency\u201d which would be treated as an independent would have been. The critical question is whether a rational trier of facts could find that this plan was the result of an agreement among and between the media and the advertising agencies rather than representing independent identical decisions by hundreds of newspapers and magazines. See 2 Areeda and Turner, Antitrust Law \u00a7 317(e), at 82 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">The leading case for the proposition that an agreement can be inferred from commonality of the conduct is <em>Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, </em>306 U.S. 208, 59 S.Ct. 467, 83 L.Ed. 610 (1939). In that case, Interstate and Consolidated, two affiliated large chains of motion picture exhibitors, who heavily dominated a portion of the Texas motion picture market, sought an agreement from a group of motion picture distributors that was designed to weaken competition the exhibitors faced from non-affiliated motion picture houses in the area. Specifically, Interstate and Consolidated advised distributors that they would not purchase films for exhibition in their theaters unless the distributors accepted two constraints. These were that in selling the distributor\u2019s product for subsequent runs the minimum admission price to adults in the evening should be 25 cents and that its pictures exhibited at a night admission of 40 cents or more should never be exhibited as double features. As a result of conferences between Interstate and Consolidat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ed and eight distributors, the latter accepted these conditions with respect to four of the six Texas cities served by Interstate. The obvious result of such a joint action by the distributors was to weaken the ability of the nonaffiliated exhibitors to draw audiences away from Interstate and Consolidated by offering substantially lower prices or double features.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Despite a lack of any express evidence that the various distributors actually agreed among themselves to abide by the demands of Interstate and Consolidated, the Court upheld the district court\u2019s finding of a conspiracy among the distributors, noting that \u201cwithout substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory there was a risk [to any distributor] of a substantial loss of the business and good will of the subsequent-run and independent exhibitors, but that with it there was the prospect of increased profits,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 222, 59 S.Ct. at 472. In the instant case, a conspiracy among the media could be similarly inferred. In the absence of agreement, a magazine or newspaper refusing the lower rate to advertisers willing to perform the services rendered by agencies ran the risk of losing such advertising to any medium that did; indeed, one could conclude it was the threat of this that led a number of the media to grant the 15% discount to a few house agencies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, as is more fully developed below, a magazine or newspaper refusing to adhere to the dual rate system faced serious risks of reprisal from powerful agencies influencing a large section of the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In <em>Interstate Circuit </em>the Court also stressed the failure of the distributors \u201cto tender the testimony, at their command, of any officer or agent of a distributor who knew, or was in a position to know, whether in fact an agreement had been reached among them for concerted action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 225, 59 S.Ct. at 474. Noting that only local managers had been called, rather than those who had authority to act, the Court thought this \u201cpersuasive that their testimony, if given, would have, been unfavorable . .\u201d Here the media offered no evidence to show what legitimate business advantage, save continuity and fear of reprisal, ' inhered in the dual rate system. No independent reason was offered for one of the media\u2019s not doing what could be thought to be in its own self-interest \u2014 offering the lower rate to direct advertisers who performed the same service for which agencies received discounts as a means of increasing the offeror\u2019s share of the direct advertising market.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">In <em>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., </em>334 U.S. 131, 142, 147, 68 S.Ct. 915, 922, 92 L.Ed. 1260 (1948), the Court found the point of drawing an inference of agreement from conscious parallelism scarcely deserving of elaboration. It contented itself with such remarks as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">It is not necessary to find an express agreement in order to find a conspiracy. It is enough that a concert of action is contemplated and that the defendants conformed to this arrangement,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">and \u201cthe defendants either participated in evolving this uniform system of clearances or acquiesced in it and so furthered its existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">The authority of these cases was not weakened by <em>Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., </em>346 U.S. 537, 74 S.Ct. 257, 98 L.Ed. 273 (1954). There a suburban theatre in a small shopping district near Baltimore complained of the judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict in its favor because a number of motion picture distributors and exhibitors had declined to grant it first run privileges, sought original<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ly on an exclusive and later on a non-exclusive so-called \u201cday and date\u201d basis. The defendants advanced a multitude of substantial business reasons why the grant of first run privileges to the petitioner was counter to their individual business interests. It was in this context of upholding refusal to direct a plaintiff\u2019s verdict that Mr. Justice Clark observed, 346 U.S. at 541, 74 S.Ct. at 259:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">this Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense. Circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy; but \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d has not yet read conspiracy out of the Sherman Act entirely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">This explanation of how the inference from parallel conduct can be explained away by proof of legitimate business considerations <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was repeated in <em>First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Services Co., supra, </em>391 U.S. at 286-88, 88 S.Ct. 1575 (1968). In line with this analysis is our own decision in <em>Modern Home Institute, Inc. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>513 F.2d 102, 111 (2 Cir. 1975), holding that summary judgment for defendants had been properly granted in a case where any inference from \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d had been overwhelmed by defendants\u2019 evidence of independent interest in refusing to deal with the plaintiff. As good a recent statement on the subject of conscious parallelism as any is Chief Judge Seitz\u2019 in <em>Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>561 F.2d 434, 446 (3 Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1280, 55 L.Ed.2d 791 (1978), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANA\">proof of consciously parallel business behavior is circumstantial evidence from which an agreement, tacit or express, can be inferred but that such evidence, with out more, is insufficient unless the cii^ cumstances under which it occurred make the inference of a rational, independent * choice less attractive than that of con- \" eerted action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Here defendants have offered no explanation why over a period of decades none of the media has engaged in the slightest experimentation in its rate structure in the respects here material. No explanation has been offered why uniform discounts were given to agencies but no discount (except by the house agency device) was given to advertisers willing to perform some or all of the agency services. There is no room for the argument against the significance of conscious parallelism which has been made in the case of an oligopolistic market with an inelastic demand, namely, that any downward price move would immediately become known to and put in effect by competitors, so that the result would be disadvantageous to all.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The very number of competitors, among both the media and the agencies, argues against the claim that any price movement, however limited, would be immediately followed by everyone, so that its originator would derive no benefit. It is true that after the 1956 consent decrees there was opportunity for bargaining on price, not between the advertisers and the media but between the advertisers and the agencies. However, while the record demonstrates that a variety of arrangements were developed, see note 15 <em>supra, </em>it conveys no idea how extensively these were used, see <em>National Lead Co. </em>v. <em>F. T. C., </em>227 F.2d 825, 833 (7 Cir. 1955), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 352 U.S. 419, 77 S.Ct. 502, 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957), and particularly how available they were to advertisers like Am-book as distinguished from great national concerns. In any event, we have been cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>r,o no authority that would support the proposition that a \u00a7 1 conspiracy to prevent advertisers from placing ads directly or at least greatly to impair their ability to do so can be cured by the possibility that some might obtain similar financial results by subsequent bargaining with the agencies. The advertiser\u2019s bargaining position with the agency was weakened by the conspiracy in his not being able to bargain with the publishers themselves for reductions based on provision of similar services and by the agency\u2019s approaching the bargaining table with him with the 15% reduction already in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">In the <em>Cities Service </em>case, the Court indicated that one factor to consider in determining if agreement should be inferred from parallel conduct was whether agreement benefited the alleged conspirators as the practice in <em>Interstate Circuit </em>clearly had, 391 U.S. at 286-87, 88 S.Ct. 1575, cf. also <em>Overseas Motors, Inc. v. Import Motors Limited, Inc., </em>375 F.Supp. 499, 534 (E.D.Mich., 1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>519 F.2d 119 (6 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 987, 96 S.Ct. 395, 46 L.Ed.2d 304. (1975). Here there can be no question that the agencies were benefited. The effect of the parallel conduct was to give advertisers a powerful incentive to use agencies when they might otherwise have preferred to perform some or all of the agency services themselves. The 15% system also benefited the agencies by the peace and quiet of a uniform pricing policy on the part of the media, with competition among the agencies for the business of advertisers being on the basis of quality, salesmanship, or contacts, rather than of their ability to obtain a lower price from the media. These advantages depended, as in <em>Interstate Circuit, </em>upon substantially uniform acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Admittedly the advantages to the media are more problematic. The dual rate agreement did benefit the media in the higher rate paid by the occasional transient direct advertiser, but the effect of the system was to reduce such advertising as much as possible. However, while <em>Cities Service </em>teaches that parallel conduct is less probative of an agreement if there is no benefit to the alleged conspirators therefrom, the Court specifically declined to consider the question of <em>coerced </em>parallelism.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here the evidence of conscious parallelism can be joined with evidence of coercion in further support of an inference of agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In 1970, Henry Luce III, publisher of Time, asked a committee to examine and report on how to eliminate the agency commission.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The committee\u2019s study included interviews with advertisers, advertising agencies (including Y&amp;R and BBD&amp;O), and magazine competitors. The committee\u2019s report concluded there were several options\u2014 eliminating, reducing, or increasing the commission or leaving it as it was. The committee recommended the latter. Increasing the commission would cost more in revenues than it would gain in increased business from agencies; elimination or reduction by a particular magazine, even such a leader as Time, would cause a risk that agencies would channel business away.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Although there is nothing particularly damaging in these recommendations, if considered alone, the report is significant in two other contexts. The first is its candid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>picture of- conditions in the advertising world. Some large advertisers reported there was' no longer any real need for the agencies. One advertising executive, although speaking mainly of television, said his firm worked directly with a production firm to make the ads, creative work being done either in house or by competing \u201cboutiques\u201d. His company was fighting its \u201cbiggest agency to get on a fee system so they don\u2019t get richer than they already are. Trouble is the president of our firm and of the agency are close friends and the latter so far has fought a successful rear guard action.\u201d The same executive \u201ccouldn\u2019t care \u2022 less whether TIME eliminates the agency commission except that perhaps it might hasten the demise of the system.\u201d Another function of the agency \u2014 procuring space\u2014 was being taken over by independent media buying services (IMBOs). The report recited numerous \u201cindications that some big clients would like to see the agency commission system eliminated.\u201d The reason was that in many cases the client was getting ahead of the agency both in ability to create advertising and in knowledge of available media. As against this, the commission system kept costs in line with sales volume, and' was convenient and easy to administer. A symposium in a media publication, attended by many elements of the trade, reported a host of different views about the 15% commission. Several clients of Time were interviewed. One thought abolition of commissions was right in concept, wrong until the details of a new system were worked out. Another favored abolition but did not have much at stake since he already had his agencies on fees. Two airlines thought the time for abolition was not ripe since they already had so many problems on their hands. There was mixed reaction from the automobile industry. Expectably the agencies exhibited greater enthusiasm for maintenance of the present system. Competing magazines were equivocal; they were concerned about their position with the agencies although one conceded that \u201cif a major, major client like Ford or General Motors said he wanted to order direct pay his agencies in its own manner, publication would probably go along.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The second way in which Time\u2019s invest\u00ed gation was significant was that certain agencies did not content themselves answering the questions they were asked but made it evident that the fears of reprisal by the agencies were real. While Time management was considering the report, Edward L. Bond, Jr., Chairman of Y&amp;R wrote Bernard M. Auer, Executive Vice President of Time, on September 24, 1970, expressing concern over Time\u2019s considering a discontinuation of the 15% agency commission. Although he recognized that \u201cthere are some advertisers who would like to see this policy changed\u201d, he thought any such move by Time \u201cwould appear to gradually erode the full-service agency concept.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">It seems to us that a policy decision made by the leader in the industry can only increase the likelihood of putting magazines in a bid and ask situation. This will give everyone great concern as to the stability of magazines and the real determination of value received</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMXc\">\u2014language which a jury could take to be a veiled threat that cessation of the 15% commission by magazines would accelerate the trend toward advertising on television at the expense of the printed word. Finally</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5p\">I hope you will review this subject once more in light of the effects on the full-service agency; in light of the effects on your sales in terms of both cost and morale; and in light of greater fluctuations of revenues that are likely to result from the apparent uncertainty of your rate structure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">In a memorandum to top management of Time dated October 2,1970, Auer recounted a talk with Bond in which he had explained why Time felt it must \u201caccept business from a company direct on a net basis\u201d and \u201ctotally rejected the concept that the agencies were working for us and media departments were doing our selling for us.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>iond \u201cwanted to express his feelings that ]is could deteriorate into a very serious problem for him and other agencies.\u201d Auer laid that Time would not make a public Statement and hoped Y&amp;R would not start fa controversy in the trade press. Auer\u2019s memorandum also noted that Dan Seymour of JWT had called Andrew Heiskell of Time to ask if Time was going to announce that it would accept business on a direct basis; Heiskell denied any such intention. Despite the polite tone a reasonable juror could find that two of the country\u2019s largest agencies had joined in an effort to put pressure on Time to adhere to existing policies which had the effect of denying advertisers the right to deal directly with the media, pay their own costs, and receive an appropriate discount. <em>Klor\u2019s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., </em>359 U.S. 207, 79 S.Ct. 705, 3 L.Ed.2d 741 (1959), suggests that this would be actionable not only against the maker of the threat but against a complying recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In sum, a jury could have concluded from all that we have recited \u2014 not to speak of the inferences it might have drawn from oral testimony by persons interviewed by Time or by officials of Time or the N.Y. Times<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u2014 that the conscious pan. !alism of the dual rate system was not the ,\u2019esult of hundreds of unanimous individual decisions but rather was an agreement including many publishers who believed the system made it unduly expensive to advertise and who went along with it, insofar as they did, only because of sloth or fear of reprisal. We do not say, of course, that a jury would have so found \u2014 only that it might rationally have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">What has been established up to this point is that a jury could have found there was a contract or conspiracy in restraint of trade by some agencies and some members of the media with respect to pricing policies in the period 1968-1972.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellees say this still leaves Ambook a long way from home.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The keystone of appellees\u2019 argument here is that Ambook did not deal with the 4A\u2019s or with any of the agency defendants but solely with Schiff-Brown. As indicated above, Schiff-Brown\u2019s relation to the 4A\u2019s was tangential at most; it surely was not a policy forming member.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Schiff testified unequivocally that \u2014 agreement or no agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ment \u2014 he would not have serviced the Am-book account for less than 15% of the card rates. Any injury to Ambook\u2019s property and business must therefore come not from the dealings it had with Schiff-Brown but from the fact that except for the alleged illegal agreements, it would have been able to deal directly with Time, the N.Y. Times and other media, and have achieved substantial savings if given the same discount as the agencies or even a lesser discount if this would produce a smaller cost to the advertiser than the present system.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Appellees mount several lines of defense. They say in the first place that Ambook never sought recognition for a house agency that would have handled its advertising. For the N.Y. Times the answer is unavailing. A jury could have found that for the period up to February 18, 1970, such an offer would have been useless since until then the N.Y. Times would not recognize a house agency with less than three accounts. The standards laid down when that policy was abandoned were rather severe and there was no public announcement of the abandonment. The record does show that by April 9, 1973, the N.Y. Times recognized 35 house agencies but does not inform us how many such recognitions occurred during the period ended June 1, 1972.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Time stands better in one respect, worse in another. It stands better in that it never had any such explicit \u201cthree-account\u201d policy for qualification as a house agency as did the N.Y. Times. The record shows that by February 8, 1973, it had recognized 19 house agencies.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It stands worse in that Ambook did make a request of Time for recognition as a house agency. This did not occur until March 1972, by which date Time may well have had ample reasons for refusing to accept Ambook\u2019s advertising at all. However, Time\u2019s stated reason for declining Ambook\u2019s request was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">Direct advertisers cannot qualify f agency discount but.must pay the ca rates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The media defendants contend also tha Ambook was in no position to deliver advertising in a form that would enable it to realize economies if given the agency discount. They stress peculiar difficulties allegedly associated with advertising which seeks a response, often accompanied by money, as in the case of a book club, and claim that even many established agencies are unequipped or unwilling to undertake such work. Against this Mr. Lyman averred that, but for the 15% requirement, Am-book \u201cwould have been able to hire more employees and more highly qualified employees if advertising services were performed within the company\u201d, or that he might also have hired an advertising consultant for a year. The Time report shows that many companies, although presumably larger than Ambook, are currently using a combination of in-house talent, outside agencies deemed particularly suitable for special promotions, and space buying services, as a substitute for the full-service agency. Indeed several such companies figure on the \u201chouse agency\u201d lists of Time and the N.Y. Times to which we have referred above. So far as we can see, the district judge made no determination that Lyman\u2019s assertions were so outlandish as to be unworthy of belief by a jury, and, whatever our personal views may be as to Ambook\u2019s ability to handle its advertising functions for less than the 15% commission, we perceive no fair basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">It therefore appears to us to have been error to grant summary judgment in favor of Time and the N.Y. Times with respect to Ambook\u2019s claims against them for alleged losses in being forced to deal with them through an agent on the 15% commission basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>A separate question is whether it ras nevertheless .proper to enter summary adgment in favor of the 4A\u2019s and the three smaining agency defendants, see note 2 <em>supra, </em>for damages allegedly suffered by Ambook in its dealing with Time and the N.Y. Times. Appellees argue that since Ambook did not deal with the 4A\u2019s or any of the agency defendants it cannot recover from them even if they were parties to an illegal conspiracy. Relying on Judge Adams\u2019 characteristically able opinion for a divided panel in <em>Mid-West Paper Products Company v. Continental Group, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 573 (3 Cir. 1979), appellees assert that Ambook has no standing to sue the agency defendants, since Schiff-Brown was not a member of the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">This case differs from <em>Mid-West Paper </em>in material respects. In that case plaintiff sought to recover damages for injuries sustained in dealing with nonconspiring manufacturers who were allegedly able to charge higher prices under the anticompetitive \u201cumbrella\u201d erected by defendant conspiring manufacturers. Recovery was sought from conspirators despite the lack of contact with any of them. Here Ambook has indisputably dealt with Time and the N.Y. Times. Plaintiff having dealt with these members of the alleged illegal conspiracy, all other members are jointly and severally liable for the damages Ambook sustained. See <em>State of Washington v. American Pipe &amp; Construction Co., </em>280 F.Supp. 802, 804-05 (W.D.Wash.1968); <em>Wall Products Co. v. National Gypsum Co., </em>357 F.Supp. 832, 840 (N.D.Cal. 1973); <em>Tondas v. Amateur Hockey Ass\u2019n, </em>438 F.Supp. 310, 315 (W.D.N.Y.1977). A jury could have found that, pursuant to the conspiracy, Time and the N.Y. Times denied Ambook the opportunity of placing ads directly with appropriate discounts. The Time report is evidence that the agencies rather than the media were the prime movers behind maintenance of this dual rate system. As Judge Weinfeld has said, \u201cthe law is clear that one who participates in and furthers wrongful conduct may also be held liable with the other alleged wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Data Digests, Inc. v. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Corp., </em>43 F.R.D. 386, 389 (S.D.N.Y.1967).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">On the other hand, we think summary judgment was properly granted in favor of all defendants in respect of Am-book\u2019s dealings with media not named as defendants. Ambook conceded that it never sought in-house agency treatment from them (as it did of Time), and there is no evidence of record that such an effort would have been futile. One can guess that Ambook would not have received a warm welcome, but speculation of this sort does not suffice, particularly in light of the judge\u2019s repeated directions that Ambook must adduce evidence on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We regret having been obliged to pass on issues of possibly great consequence to the advertising industry in an action by a single advertiser, now out of business, and which comes before us on appeal from the grant of summary judgment to the defendants. However, it was the defendants (including the industry\u2019s trade association) who chose to pursue this procedural course, they have been ably represented by experienced counsel, and we cannot refuse to decichs^ issues properly tendered to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The order denying class action status is affirmed. The grant of summary judgment is affirmed with respect to the Robinson-Patman Act claims, and with respect to any damages arising from Ambook\u2019s dealings with unnamed members of the media, but is reversed with respect to the other damage claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\">. Defendants have not claimed the action to be dismissible on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-12\">.

In each instance Ambook dealt with Victor Schiff, who specialized in the direct response advertising in which Ambook was interested. Mr. Schiff was associated with Newmark, Pos-ner &amp; Mitchell, Inc., in an office and credit sharing arrangement, and Victor Schiff &amp; Company had a similar arrangement with Kaplan. Newmark, Posner &amp; Mitchell, Inc. and the Ka-plan Agency were apparently members of the 4As; Schiff/Brown &amp; Company was not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b688-5\">.

The Time report, referred to below, indicates that the system may have gone back as far as 1864. Although it has become customary to speak of the 15% as a \u201ccommission\u201d, it is not such in the ordinary sense. The advertising agency is not the seller\u2019s agent but the buyer\u2019s. The system is thus better characterized as a dual price system \u2014 the card rate for the direct advertiser and 15% less when the advertising is done through an agency \u2014 with the agency receiving the difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b691-12\">. For example, if an advertiser could perform the services rendered by the agency at 8% of the card rate, his costs would be 7% less if he could deal directly with the medium at the rate accorded the agency. One item of potential saving would be any excess of the agency\u2019s profit over what would be a fair return on whatever assets the advertiser devoted to providing the services; plaintiff adduced evidence that the return on investment for five publicly traded advertising agencies during the period 1968 through 1972 averaged over 19%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">. (A) A conspiracy among all the defendants whereby the media associations adopt substantially uniform standards for recognition of advertising agencies, only agencies meeting such standards may be extended credit and allowed agency commissions, agencies which rebate any part of their commissions to advertisers will be cut off; recognition will be denied to house agencies; and gross rates would be charged to direct advertisers. Also that members of the media associations adhere to their published rates, and that agency commissions be fixed and maintained at 15% of the gross rate for advertising. (B) A conspiracy between the 4As and its members whereby members would retain all commissions and not rebate any part of them to advertisers; commissions would be retained at 15%; and that members refrain from competing with each other by submitting advertising copy etc. in solicitation of new business. (C), (D), (E), (F) and (G) Conspiracies between the media associations and their members to substantially the same effect as (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b692-16\">. We are, of course, fully aware that under \u00a7 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), a plaintiff cannot make use of a consent decree against a defendant in an action where no testimony was taken, and also that private plaintiffs cannot enforce government consent decrees, see <em>United States v. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, </em>341 F.2d 1003, 1007-08 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 877, 86 S.Ct. 160, 15 L.Ed.2d 119 (1965); <em>Dahl, Inc. v.

However, we read the district court\u2019s opinion and appellees\u2019 argument as taking the consent decrees as a watershed, see 464 F.Supp. at 1137.

The fact that apparently there was little direct advertising does not undermine the possibility of this inference. A jury could find that, without substantially unanimous action by the media to prevent it, a market for such advertising could be expected to develop, a market which those adhering to the dual rate system would lose to the renegades. Nor does the fact that the effect of unanimous action would be essentially to eliminate direct advertising as a mode of doing business (except for those advertisers able to create house agencies) invalidate the analysis: non-unanimous action would have the far more deleterious effect on those adhering to the system of channeling direct advertisers to non-adhering competitors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">.

Appellant seemingly assumes that if an agreement for a dual pricing system existed, this would be a per se violation of \u00a7 1. Appel-lees, concentrating on the alleged absence of sufficient evidence of an agreement and the other points discussed in this section, did not argue whether such an agreement would constitute a <em>per se </em>violation or would be subject to the rule of reason. Plaintiff made no claim that members of the media agreed among themselves to fix their card rates. The case seems more analogous to concerted refusal to deal. We note that recently there has been considerable questioning of the applicability of <em>per s'e </em>rules to certain types of such refusals. The thrust of the Supreme Court decision in <em>Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 36, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977), has not gone unnoticed. See <em>Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>579 F.2d 126 (2 Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 946, 99 S.Ct. 340, 58 L.Ed.2d 338 (1978); <em>Gough v.

Much seems to turn on characterization of the alleged agreement as vertical or horizontal, no easy task in the present case, and one which we decline to undertake without the benefit of argument and prior decision below. A further turning away from <em>per se </em>rules was recently evinced in <em>Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 1551, 60 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979).

Walter Thompson] was a party to a combination or conspiracy injuring the business or property of Ambook during the period 1968-72\u201d. 464 F.Supp. at 1145. The same finding was made with respect to The New York Times and Time. Based on the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201c[T]here is no evidence that the 4A\u2019s did anything during the damage period, or for many years prior to the damage period, to promote or maintain any phase of the alleged conspiracy. . . . \u201d 464 F.Supp. at 1136, it granted summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Since I believe that cases should be decided upon the facts presented to the trial court, I take issue with the decision of the majority which by its own declarations has, in my opinion, created hypothetical and speculative situations and then, based upon inferences from these hypotheses, prophesied a possible jury conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">An illustration will suffice. \u201cA jury could rationally conclude from the evidence here adduced that during the damage period substantially all advertising agencies and the publishing media pursued a plan whereby <em>if </em>a national advertiser approached a newspaper or magazine, he <em>would </em>typically be told that <em>if </em>he were willing to deal through a recognized agency, the agent <em>would </em>receive a 15% deduction but that otherwise he would be charged the full card rate.\u201d (emphasis added). This despite the previous statement that \u201cAt least eight types of compensation between advertisers and agencies are now in- effect, although the record does not show their relative frequency or much else about them.\u201d To me, although eight types of financial arrangements are conceded to exist [post-1956], the majority\u2019s assumption as to a jury\u2019s rational conclusion is pregnant with the belief that a contrary conclusion would be irrational. In contrast to the majority\u2019s assumptions, the trial court found \u2014 not on the basis of assumptions \u2014 but on the proof actually before it that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">\u201cNeither the documents nor any other evidence proposed by Ambook suggest that, following the consent decrees of 1956, there was any step taken by the 4A\u2019s or anyone else to prevent advertising agencies from making whatever compensation arrangements they wished with their clients. The use of fees and cost-plus arrangements was growing, and there is no evidence that the 4A\u2019s or anyone else was engaging in any kind of conspiratorial activity to put a stop to the growth of these different compensation methods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-13\">* * * There is no evidence that the 4A\u2019s did anything during the damage period, or for many years prior to the damage period, to promote or maintain any phase of the alleged conspiracy. This finding is crucial to the present case, since it means that the alleged promoter and leader of the conspiracy was not performing these functions during the period relevant to this lawsuit.\u201d 464 F.Supp. at 1136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">As to burden of proof, the burden was on the plaintiff to prove a conspiracy. There was no duty on the part of any defendant to justify its business policy or practices in choosing as a matter of business judgment to pay a 15% commission instead of resorting to any of the other methods of compensation previously mentioned. Yet the majority, in effect, places the burden on the defendants of justifying their business deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>sion by saying: \u201chere the media offered no evidence to show what legitimate business advantage, save continuity and fear of reprisal, inhered in the dual rate system\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">To its reliance upon \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d the majority adds its theory of coercion despite the fact that the trial judge found to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The formation in 1970 of a committee to examine into the possible elimination of the agency commission instead of proving a conspiracy, in my opinion, proves the opposite. Using the majority\u2019s statement thereof: \u201cA symposium in a media publication, attended by many elements of the trade, reported a host of different views about the 15% commission\u201d. Clients of Time thought abolition right in concept; wrong until details of a new system were worked out. The reaction of the airlines and the automobile industry were mixed. Again, despite the fact that there was a wide divergence of views \u2014 the antithesis of a conspiratorial agreement \u2014 the majority not having attended the committee meetings nor having heard the discussions, chose to substitute their conclusion that a rational jury could have found that the committee acted \u201conly because of sloth or fear of reprisal\u201d. After hearing Ambook and analyzing all the material Ambook was able to offer, the trial court found that: \u201cThe undisputed facts are that Time was making an independent re-examination of the 15% commission\u201d; that Time \u201cconsulted with representative advertising agencies with whom Time did business in normal course and advertisers who advertised in Time, to determine what their views would be on the possible discontinuance of the 15% commission\u201d. 464 F.Supp. at 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In the field of injury to property, a hypothetical and highly speculative situation is all that Ambook has presented. It says \u201cAmbook would have been able to hire more employees and more highly qualified employees if advertising services were performed within the company\u201d or that he might also have hired an advertising consultant for a year. Again, no proof, merely speculative hypotheses.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">A brief word concerning the majority\u2019s apologia. Some explanation was, of course, necessary to explain why a court of appeals should \u201cpass on issues of possible great consequence to the advertising industry, in an action by a single advertiser, now out of business . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Any \u201cregret\u201d at \u201chaving been obliged\u201d to pass on the issues is mollified by an apparent desire to have the federal courts and/or a jury of laymen dictate to the advertising and media businesses how in the courts\u2019 or juries\u2019 opinion they should conduct their business operations, despite the previous decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">In my opinion, summary judgment was the correct procedure for the defendants to follow. Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is applicable to antitrust cases. The facts material to a decision are undisputed and have been set forth at length by the trial court. On appeal they should be sustained unless clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a) F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Recent cases have been informative as to the role of summary judgment in antitrust cases. In <em>Lupia v. Stella D\u2019Oro Biscuit Co., Inc., </em>586 F.2d 1163 (7th Cir. 1978) the motions for summary judgment were, as here, based on a substantial record assembled by discovery and affidavits, establishing beyond the mere allegations of the pleadings, what the plaintiff was and was not able to prove. Noting that \u201cthere is no requirement that judges exercise greater caution in granting summary judgment in these [antitrust] cases than in any other\u201d, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the defendants with the following comment equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">\u201cIndeed, the very nature of antitrust litigation would encourage summary disposition of such cases when permissible. Not only do antitrust trials often encompass a great deal of expensive and time consuming discovery and trial work, but also, (without intending any slur on plaintiff here), the statutory private antitrust remedy of treble damages affords a special temptation for the institution of vexatious litigation, see <em>Poller, supra, </em>368 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>U.S. at 474, 82 S.Ct. 486 (Harlan, J. dissenting). <em>[Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1961).] The ultimate determination, after trial, that an antitrust claim is unfounded, may come too late to guard against the evils that occur along the way. Judge (now Chief Judge) Skelly Wright, in a libel case, <em>Washington Post Co. v. Keogh, </em>125 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 365 F.2d 965 (1966), noted that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u2018 * * * Summary judgment serves important functions which would be left undone if courts too restrictively viewed their power. Chief among these are avoidance of long and expensive litigation productive of nothing, and curbing the danger that the threat of such litigation will be used to harass or to coerce a settlement. * * * <em>[Id. </em>125 U.S.App.D.C. at 35, 365 F.2d at 968.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\"><em>Lupia v. Stella D\u2019Oro Biscuit Co., Inc., </em>586 F.2d at 1167.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">In <em>First Nat. Bank v. Cities Service, </em>391 U.S. 253, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968), the Supreme Court, mindful of the four cases cited by the majority here and upon which they and petitioners in <em>Cities Service </em>relied, affirmed in an antitrust case summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The cardinal fallacy which I find permeates the opinion of the majority and leads to its conclusion is that it treats this case as if it were an appeal from the government\u2019s 1955 civil antitrust ease which involved virtually the same issues as here presented. The 1956 consent decree dealt with the same problems now before us. The pre-1956 practices complained of were enjoined and the slate for all practical purposes was wiped clean.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The trial court found that \u201cAmbook has specifically conceded that it has no evidence of conspiratorial activity by the 4A\u2019s during the period 1968-72, or at any time after 1960. There is no evidence that the 4A\u2019s did anything during the damage period, or for many years prior to the damage period, to promote or maintain any phase of the alleged conspiracy.\u201d 464 F.Supp. at 1136. It was incumbent upon Ambook to come forward with proof of post-1956 violations. Many witnesses were deposed; scores of exhibits were introduced. A full-scale trial could not have been more exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Having given Ambook every opportunity to submit any proof it desired in aid of its claim, the trial court concluded: \u201cThere is no evidence sufficient to permit a finding that any of the agency defendants was a party to a combination or conspiracy injuring the business or property of Ambook during the period 1968-72.\u201d 464 F.Supp. at 1145. The same finding was made as to The New York Times and Time.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">In this case I would subscribe to the words of the late Mr. Justice Harlan, joined by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Whittaker and Mr. Justice Stewart in his dissent in the five to four decision in <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting, </em>368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-15\">\u201cAs I see it, this is one of those cases, not unfamiliar in treble-damage litigation, where injury resulting from normal business hazards is sought to be made re-dressable by casting the affair in antitrust terms. I think that the antitrust laws do not fit this case, and that the courts below were quite correct in holding that the respondents were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d 368 U.S. at 474, 82 S.Ct. at 491.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-16\">As in this case, the trial court had before it affidavits and depositions. The trial court in <em>Poller </em>had granted summary judgment in an antitrust case in favor of the defendants. I would also adopt Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s apologia when he said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-17\">\u201cI have gone into this matter at some length because in my opinion the Court\u2019s encouragement of this sort of antitrust \u2018enforcement\u2019 does disservice to the healthy observance of these laws. I would affirm.\u201d 368 U.S. at 486, 82 S.Ct. at 498.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">I would find it difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a charge to a jury which would not be based upon groundless speculation \u2014 hence I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">.
