He was arrested on January 29, 1979, and was arraigned on April 6, 1979. Trial was scheduled to begin on May 29; however, on that date Barboza, who was represented by the Federal Public Defender, indicated that he wished to procure retained counsel, and the trial court determined that the jury panel had only eleven members. Because Barboza wished \u201cTo get that time to see if [he] could get [retained counsel],\u201d the court dismissed the jury and reset the case for a later jury selection. A second jury was chosen on June 21, 1979. Eleven days later, Barboza moved that the indictment be dismissed because he had not been tried within the time limits of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-3174. During the July 3, 1979, hearing on his motion, Barboza argued, as he does before this court, that the eighty-seven day delay between his arraignment and his trial required dismissal of his indictment. The court rejected Barboza\u2019s claim, and, on the same day, Barboza. was tried and found guilty by the jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The provisions of the Speedy Trial Act applicable when Barboza was indicted required that he be tried within 80 days of his arraignment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161(c), 3161(f), 3163(b)(1). Barboza\u2019s trial was thus delayed seven days longer than the period prescribed in the Act. This delay does not, however, necessitate the dismissal of his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">The Act\u2019s sanctions, contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162, \u201crequire dismissal for unjustified violations of the statute\u2019s time limits.\u201d <em>United States v. Noll, </em>600 F.2d 1123, 1126 (5th Cir. 1979). When Barboza was indicted and tried, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3163 provided that the \u00a7 3162 sanctions became effective on July 1, 1979. Speedy Trial Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-619, 88 Stat. 2081 (1975). <em>See, e. g., United States v. Noll, </em>600 F.2d at 1126; <em>United States v. Wentland, </em>582 F.2d 1022, 1024 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1133, 99 S.Ct. 1056, 59 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979). The Act\u2019s dismissal sanction only applies to cases involving indictments or informations filed after July 1, 1979. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3163(c). Other cases are governed by local transitional plans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Barboza was indicted and arraigned before July 1, 1979, but was tried two days after that date. The \u00a7 3162 sanctions therefore do not apply in Barboza\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">A second issue is whether the transitional plan of the Southern District of Texas, which was \u201cdesigned to implement the speedy trial goals of the Act over the three year period ending June 30, 1979,\u201d requires the dismissal of Barboza\u2019s case for pretrial delay. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>569 F.2d 1315, 1316 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>See United States v. Noll, </em>600 F.2d at 1127; <em>United States v. Bullock, </em>551 F.2d 1377, 1381 (5th Cir. 1977). The Southern District of Texas\u2019 interim plan provides that a defendant arraigned between July 1, 1978, and July 1, 1979, must be tried within 80 days of his or her arraignment; however, it also specifies that a trial in a jury case begins at voir dire. Under this definition, Barboza\u2019s trial began either on May 22, when the first jury was selected, or on June 21, 1979, when the second jury was chosen; both dates were within 80 days of Barboza\u2019s arraignment. Barboza concedes in his brief that the transitional plan for the Southern District of Texas does not require the sanction of dismissal for failure to comply with its time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>limits in most instances. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>569 F.2d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Barboza also contends that the court should have dismissed his indictment under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b) because the delay in bringing him to trial was unnecessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-7\">To decide whether a delay is either \u201cunnecessary\u201d and thus warrants dismissal of the indictment under Rule 48(b), or constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, we must apply the \u201cbalancing test\u201d announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>focusing on four factors: \u201cLength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right [to a speedy trial], and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\"><em>United States v. Noll, </em>600 F.2d at 1127 (brackets in original). We need not inquire into the other factors unless \u201cthere is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial.\u201d <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). An eighty-seven day delay between arraignment and trial is not long enough to be presumptively prejudicial. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Rankin, </em>572 F.2d 503, 505 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 979, 99 S.Ct. 564, 58 L.Ed.2d 650 (1978); <em>United States v. Maizumi, </em>526 F.2d 848, 851 (5th Cir. 1976). Barboza does not claim that the delay actually harmed him in any way. We therefore find that the trial court did not err in deciding that the eighty-seven day delay between Barboza\u2019s arraignment and his trial did not warrant the dismissal of his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">. One month after Barboza\u2019s trial, \u00a7 3163 was amended to provide that \u201csection 3162 of this chapter shall become effective and apply to all cases commenced by arrest or summons, and all informations or indictments filed, on or after July 1, 1980.\u201d Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-43, 93 Stat. 329 (1979). Because we find that, under the prior version of \u00a7 3163, the \u00a7 3162 sanctions were not applicable to Barboza\u2019s case, we need not determine the effect these amendments will have for individuals indicted after July 1, 1979, but before the 1979 amendments were signed into law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">. The language of the recent amendments to \u00a7 3163(c) supports our determination that this case is governed by those provisions of the Act in effect at the time the indictment is filed. <em>See </em>Speedy Trial Act Amendments of 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-43, 93 Stat. 328-29 (1979). <em>See also, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3163(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
