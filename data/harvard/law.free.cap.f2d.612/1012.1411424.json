The first robbery was on August 18, 1977, at the Madison National Bank in Madison Heights, Michigan. A month later, on September 19, 1977, the Warren Bank in Warren, Michigan, was robbed of $114,000. The defendants were tried jointly to a jury and both were convicted on both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">This is the appeal of LeBlanc from that conviction. The first issue in that appeal involves a procedural question which arose on the first day of trial, in the following manner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-7\">\u201c(Defense Counsel): Your Honor, if the court please, I have a similar motion, (the co-defendant had already made a motion) and I won\u2019t make any extensive argument with respect to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-8\">\u201cI think the court knows the law and the applicable rules. I would only indicate to the court that I have been provided with a rap sheet from Mr. Richards which indicates that my client, Tyrone LeBlanc, has a 1976 charge of larceny from a building, that there is an entry for a conviction of 9/29/76.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-9\">\u201cI would further indicate to the court that the defendant was placed on one-year\u2019s probation and was given Y.T.A. status, the standard youthful trainee status. And as I understand it, your Honor, it\u2019s a situation where a defendant is placed on probation for one year, and at the end of the year, the conviction is set aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-10\">\u201cAs I understand it also, the disposition can occur in one of two ways. Some judges don\u2019t require a guilty plea, and I have heard that on occasion, a judge may require a guilty plea and just set it aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-11\">\u201cIn this particular case, I am not \u2014 I don\u2019t think Mr. LeBlanc really recalls exactly what happened, whether he actually went in court and tendered a guilty plea or whether he was just placed on probation. The Y.T.A. status is clearly indicated on the rap sheet, and I would submit to the court that as a result of that, the conviction would not be admissible. I don\u2019t think from this rap sheet the government can say that a guilty plea was tendered to the court that accepted this Y.T.A. status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-13\">\u201cFor that reason, I would ask the court not to permit the government to use that larceny conviction of 1976.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">There was argument from the Prosecuting Attorney and the Judge ruled, \u201cVery Well. The ruling of the court is that the \u201976 larceny conviction may be used for impeachment purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-15\">It is claimed on behalf of the appellant that this was error and required him to face a dilemma whether or not he should testify in his own behalf because of the likelihood that cross examination of a prior conviction would cast doubt about the credibility of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-16\">The government now concedes that the trial judge\u2019s ruling was in error. The appellant\u2019s assignment to \u201cyouthful trainee\u201d status was made pursuant to the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act, Mich.Comp. L.Ann., Section 762.11, <em>et seq. </em>Such an assignment does not constitute conviction of a crime within the meaning of Rule 609, Federal Rules of Evidence. Accordingly, under Rule 609, appellant\u2019s assignment to youthful trainee status under Michigan law would not be admissible for impeachment purposes as a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-17\">The question before us is whether, under the state of the record, counsel for defendant has preserved his right to predicate error on the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-18\">Rule 103, Federal Rules of Evidence, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-19\">\u201c(a) Effect of erroneous ruling. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the pa\u2019rty is affected, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-20\">\u201c(1) Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>ord, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar3\">\u201c(2) Offer of proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">In addition to the above Rule of Evidence, Rule 51, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, requires a defendant to make \u201cknown to the (trial) court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court and the grounds therefor.\u201d In addition, case authority supports the proposition that a defendant must \u201cobject with that reasonable degree of specificity which would have adequately apprised the trial court of the true basis for his objection * * * \u201d <em>United States v. Fendley, </em>522 F.2d 181, 186 (5th Cir. 1975). See also <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>480 F.2d 785, 792 (2nd Cir. 1973). Likewise, courts have held that error is not preserved for appellate review when appellant\u2019s objection was \u201c \u2018too loosely formulated and imprecise\u2019 to apprise the trial court of the legal grounds for his complaint.\u201d <em>United States v. Arteaga Limones, </em>529 F.2d 1183, 1199 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den., </em>429 U.S. 920, 97 S.Ct. 315, 50 L.Ed.2d 286 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">With these considerations in mind, it is seen that while possibly the trial judge should have been able to interpret from the statements counsel made in support of his motion that under Michigan law the larceny in which the appellant was involved did not constitute a conviction, counsel did not clearly indicate the point of his motion that the disposition was an adjudication not resulting in a conviction. In addition, he used the word \u201cconviction\u201d four times and there is a question whether he, himself, understood the significance of the Michigan statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">It is noted .that, when the trial reached the stage of case in chief for appellant LeBlanc, counsel did not renew his motion to deny the right of the prosecutor to cross-examine on the larceny offense under Michigan state law. Neither did he advise the trial judge that his client would not testify on his own behalf because of his ruling on the motion of appellant at the opening of the trial. Nor did he offer the substance of the appellant\u2019s testimony in the event that he had testified. See Rule 103(a)(2), Fed.R. Evid. Instead, he stated only that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">\u201cYour Honor, if the court please, on behalf of (defendant), I think we have decided not to present any evidence and would also rest at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">Under these circumstances, this Court cannot assume that it was the judge\u2019s ruling in question which prevented the appellant from testifying in his own behalf,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or that, absent at least a proffer of appellant\u2019s proposed testimony, prejudicial error ensued. This is true, especially since the record indicates other tactical reasons why a decision not to testify might have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">For example, Jerome Belton, who is alleged to have entered the robbed banks with Clinscales, appellant\u2019s co-defendant, testified in the government\u2019s case that the appellant was the get-away driver in the two robberies charged in the indictment. He also involved the appellant as being in on the planning of the robberies with him and Clinscales. Belton\u2019s testimony was the only direct testimony connecting the appellant in the robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">Belton had been separately indicted. He bargained for a plea prior to the time of the trial in this case. Accordingly, he was permitted to plead to one robbery, and was assured that his sentence would not exceed six years and that the charge on one robbery would be dismissed. This was all brought out in the government\u2019s case and would naturally subject the witness\u2019s testimony to a credibility test. If the jury did not believe his testimony, LeBlanc probably could not have been convicted. It seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>rather obvious that LeBlanc would not want to subject himself to a cross examination of Belton\u2019s testimony. In addition, he may have feared the effect of cross examination on the source of the $10,000 in cash which the record indicates he paid for a new automobile, shortly after the second robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">We conclude that counsel for appellant did not preserve his right to predicate error upon the trial judge\u2019s ruling and that, under a strict application of Rule 103, no substantial right of the appellant was shown to be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Another claim of error on behalf of appellant LeBlanc is predicated on Rule 801(d)(1)(B), Federal Rules of Evidence, and the interpretation of that rule in <em>United States v. Quinto, </em>582 F.2d 224 (2nd Cir. 1978). With regard to this issue, appellant argues that the trial judge erred in permitting the government to use prior consistent statements of the witness Belton on re-direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">The record indicates that, on the day of his arrest, November 7, 1977, Belton was questioned for several hours on the two bank robberies involved in the indictment herein and particularly in an effort to get him to implicate LeBlanc. The two signed statements at issue were made on the day of arrest and before Belton had entered into bargaining for a plea of guilty. The text of these two statements is reproduced and attached as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Counsel for the appellant cross examined Belton at great length. He brought out testimony from Belton that the officers threatened to prosecute his brother and made promises to him that, if he would implicate LeBlanc, they would release the brother. The following is an excerpt from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-8\">Q. \u201cAnd is that when you implicated Tyrone as the driver in the case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-9\">A. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t implicate Tyrone until they said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll release your brother for bringing charges to Tyrone.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-10\">Q. \u201cI see. Okay. And then after they told you that, you decided to implicate Tyrone, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-11\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">This occurred before the statements in question were written and signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">Counsel for appellant also cross examined Belton at great length concerning his plea bargaining agreement. The majority of the evidence to which Belton testified on cross examination dealt with events occurring after the statements in question were made. The record is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-14\">Q. \u201cNow, let\u2019s kind of summarize for just a minute some of the things that you received as a result of your agreeing to testify. Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-15\">A. \u201cAll right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-16\">Q. \u201cNow, you indicated that you initially agreed that you would receive no more than a six year sentence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-17\">A. \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-18\">Q. \u201cOkay. And you also indicated that at some point in time, somebody also agreed that you would have no more than an 18 month sentence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-19\">A. \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-20\">Q. \u201cDo you recall that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-21\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-22\">* * * # # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-23\">Q. \u201cNow, it was also agreed that the government would not oppose any civil action to get your car?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-24\">A. \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-25\">Q. \u201cYour bond was continued on a personal bond as a result of your cooperation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-26\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-27\">Q. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-28\">A. \u201cRight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-29\">Q. \u201cAnd at some point in time, your bond was also reduced from a $3,000 \u2014excuse me \u2014 from a $30,000 10% bond to a personal bond, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-30\">A. \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-31\">Appellant\u2019s counsel, himself, however, referred the witness Belton to his statements at issue and based the following questions of his examination on them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>Q. \u201cLet me ask you to go over them. (The statements) And I am going to ask you again if the statements in there are true or untrue, particularly the statements that refer to Tyrone LeBlanc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-4\">A. \u201cSome of it is true and some of it isn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-5\">Q. \u201cThe part that relates to Tyrone Le-Blanc, is that true or untrue?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-6\">A. \u201cTalking about the part I said I didn\u2019t know how he got to the lumber yard?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-7\">Q. \u201cI\u2019m talking about all you say about Tyrone LeBlanc, is that true or untrue?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-8\">A. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-9\">Q. \u201cYou are saying it\u2019s true?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-10\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-11\">Q. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Tyrone LeBlanc participated in that robbery with you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-12\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-13\">On re-direct examination, counsel for the government requested the witness to read the statement marked as government\u2019s proposed exhibit 62, marked for identification only. This was the statement of the witness Belton on the robbery of the Madison National Bank in Madison Heights, Michigan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-14\">Counsel for appellant. \u201cI object to his reading from the statement. It\u2019s not an exhibit that has been introduced in evidence yet, and I think for that reason it shouldn\u2019t be read by this witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">Counsel for the government argued that: \u201c * * * the reason for not introducing it as an exhibit * * * is that that would put, if received * * * the exhibit in the jury room and would perhaps give undue emphasis to that portion of the testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-15\">The government argues that Belton could properly read the statement as substantive evidence pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 801 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-16\">\u201cStatements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-17\">(1) Prior statement by witness. The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) * * * (B) consistent with his testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against him of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-18\">In response to the government\u2019s specific argument to the trial court that Belton could properly read the statement pursuant to this rule, counsel for appellant again stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-19\">\u201cThat rule doesn\u2019t relate to documents or exhibits, and that is a proposed exhibit. It is a written statement, and it\u2019s not just the verbal expression of a witness. And for that reason, I don\u2019t think that 801 actually covers that situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-20\">The trial judge ruled that it might be read as a prior consistent statement. Subsequently, the witness read his statement concerning the robbery of the Warren bank. No further objection was made to the reading of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-21\">Counsel for appellant argues to this Court that Rule 801(d)(1)(B) was not applicable to the facts of this case. He claims that Belton\u2019s testimony with reference to the promise to release his brother for testimony implicating LeBlanc was given before the statements were made. Therefore, the statements were given after Belton had been given a motive to fabricate. As the record indicates, this argument now made to our Court was not advanced to the trial court at the time the statements were read.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-22\">We conclude that counsel, on behalf of the appellant, did not preserve any right to predicate error on the trial court\u2019s ruling for the reason that he did not object to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>use of the statements on the ground he now relies upon in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Even considering the merits of the argument, it is seen that the facts of this case distinguish it from <em>United States v. Quinto, supra, </em>upon which defendant relies. First the statements were only read by the witness Belton, not allowed to go to the <em>t </em>jury room during its deliberations. Secondly, defendant himself elicited the use of the statement on re-direct examination by his reference to them of the witness on cross-examination. Further, throughout the trial, counsel argued, by inference, that Belton should not be believed because of the favorable consideration he received from the government in his plea bargaining agreement. In his opening argument, counsel stated that Belton had never provided favorable information to the government until he had been charged and negotiated the plea bargaining agreement in return for his testimony. In view of this, Belton\u2019s statements would be admissible as prior consistent statements which predated the plea bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">Further, as we have heretofore quoted from the record, counsel, himself, on cross examination, elicited the most incriminating portion of Belton\u2019s statements \u2014 those dealing with appellant\u2019s participation in the robberies \u2014 even before the government sought to use the statements as prior consistent statements. Thus, if there were any error in admitting the reading of the statements, it would be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">We conclude that the trial judge was not in error in permitting the reading of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">The first statement Belton signed on the date of his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-11\">\u201cRegarding the bank robbery of the Madison National Bank, Madison Heights, Michigan, on Thursday, August 18,1977, Tyrone LeBlanc and I have been good friends for years. I have known A1 Clinscales for two or three years. A1 lives at 16661 Fitzgerald in Ferndale. A1 set up this bank robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-16\">\u201cIn the late morning of August 18, 1977, Al and Tyrone came to my house and picked me up. Al and I drove to the vicinity of the bank in a 1973 gold Chevrolet 4-door hard top, brown moulding on the sides. Tyrone followed us to the bank in a solid blue 2-door Chevrolet, white leather interior. We switched cars at the shopping center. Neither Tyrone nor myself had a gun. A1 had a rifle which he concealed under his coat. A1 and I drove around the bank several times looking it over and then drove the blue Chevrolet into the restaurant parking lot in the back of the bank. I entered the bank first and A1 followed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-17\">\u201cI vaulted the counter and was the one next to the girl in the drive-in window. I took all the money out of the drive-in window drawer and took all of the money from another drawer which another teller took out. A1 did not vault the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-18\">\u201cWe then departed in the blue Chevrolet and A1 dropped me off at the shopping center and I got in on the floor of the gold Chevrolet. The reason Tyrone was there because of his short hair and they would not be looking for someone as presentable looking as Tyrone. According to Al\u2019s instructions, we went to Tyrone\u2019s house where A1 called about one hour later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-19\">\u201cI had all the money in the bag. After the phone call, we all met at a motel at Warren and Livernois or Michigan and Livernois in an upstairs room. We split the money three ways about $1,300 a piece (sic). The total loot was about $3,900. A1 told me later he threw the gun away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-20\">\u201cIn the bank, A1 was the person who did the talking and had the gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-21\">(T.T. 535-537; App. 110-112)</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-22\">The second statement Belton signed on the date of his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>\u201cRegarding the September 19, 1977 bank robbery of the Warren bank, Ten Mile and Schoenherr in Warren, Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-5\">\u201cAbout a week before the bank robbery, Alan Clinscales described the bank to myself and Tyrone LeBlanc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-6\">\u201cAll three of us drove to the bank the Saturday before the bank robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-7\">\u201cA1 instructed me to put a Temporarily Closed sign on the drive-in window after we entered the bank. He said he was going to get full control of the bank. Tyrone was going to stay in a lumberyard on Schoenherr toward Eight Mile on the left side of the street driving from the bank. Tyrone was to drive me away from the bank after the bank robbery.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-8\">\u201cAt about 11:00 a. m. on the date of the bank robbery, Tyrone and A1 picked me up at 11:00 a. m. at my house. They dropped me off at the Burger King at Groesbeck and Eight Mile and left me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-9\">\u201cThey had a 1977 Chrysler 4-door navy blue. A1 came back for me in the Chrysler and we drove for about one-half hour for traffic to clear. Tyrone was to be sitting in a solid green Ford or Mercury 1975-1976 in the lumberyard. I don\u2019t know how he got there. I don\u2019t know how the green car was obtained for Tyrone. A1 got all of the cars. After A1 picked me up, we drove around the vicinity of the bank and waited for traffic to clear before we went inside the bank. After parking at a side road near the bank, A1 went in the bank first and he had a rifle under his coat. I put a closed sign in the drive-in window. A1 stayed in the center of the bank and covered the employees with the rifle. I cleaned our (sic) four drawers and A1 the rest of the bank. A1 put all the bank employees in the room before we left the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-10\">\u201cWe walked to our car on the side street and drove to the lumberyard where I got in the car Tyrone was driving, the green car. A1 had all the money in a bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-11\">\u201cA1 met us about one hour later in the Crystal House Motel at Eight Mile and Greenfield on the second floor. We had split the money three ways. A1 kept the remaining $100,000. A1 gave me another $3,000 which I purchased a cashier\u2019s check from Manufacturer\u2019s National Bank at Eight Mile and Schaefer. A1 gave me another $3,000 cashier\u2019s check plus some cash $1,000 or slightly more.
