John F. Dooling, Jr., Senior Judge of the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b786-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">On October 19, 1971, an employee of the United States Postal Service, driving his automobile on government business, negligently collided with another vehicle. Thereafter, judgment was entered against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674, for property damage to the vehicle that was struck. The United States sought indemnification from Government Employees Insurance Company, Inc., which was the insurance carrier for the negligent employee. Upon that company\u2019s denial of the government\u2019s claim, suit followed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. The facts were uncontroverted, and both sides moved for summary judgment. Defendant\u2019s motion, based upon its contention that the government was excluded from coverage by the terms of its policy, was granted. The government\u2019s motion was denied. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">For many years, liability carriers insuring government employees attempted with little success to deny coverage to the government, claiming as an additional omnibus insured under the carriers\u2019 policies. <em>See Government Employees Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>349 F.2d 83, 86 (10th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 1026, 86 S.Ct. 646, 15 L.Ed.2d 539 (1966); <em>United States v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>409 F.Supp. 986, 989 &amp; n. 3 (E.D.Va.1976); <em>Harleysville Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>363 F.Supp. 176, 177-78 (E.D.Pa.1973). Because of this consistent record of failure, the carriers began to attach endorsements to their policies specifically excluding the government from coverage. <em>See Government Employees Insurance Co. v. United States, </em>400 F.2d 172 (10th Cir. 1968); <em>United States v. Government Employees Insurance Co., supra, </em>409 F.Supp. at 989. The question in the instant case is whether this exclusion, which is in appellee\u2019s policy, is permitted by the regulations of the New York State Insurance Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Regulation No. 35-A permits carriers to exclude from coverage (1) \u201c[ljiability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement\u201d and (2) \u201c[a]ny obligation for which the insured . . . may be held liable under any workman\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation or disability benefits law, or any similar law.\u201d See 11 NYCRR \u00a7 60.2(b) and (e). Appellee contends that denial of coverage to the government is proper under one or both of these provisions. It argues that the Federal Tort Claims Act is an agreement for assumption of liability and is also similar to statutes providing workman\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation, or disability benefits. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">The Tort Claims Act was designed to eliminate the government\u2019s sovereign immunity from suits in tort and, with certain exceptions, to render it liable as a private individual would be under like circumstances. <em>Lambertson v. United States, </em>528 F.2d 441, 444 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 921, 96 S.Ct. 2627, 49 L.Ed.2d 374 (1970). The Act is \u201cnot the creation of new causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>action but acceptance of liability under circumstances that would bring private liability into existence.\u201d <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 141, 71 S.Ct. 153, 157, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). The liability thus accepted is not assumed under a contract or agreement but results from operation of law through the elimination of immunity. As such, it does not fall within the contract exclusion. <em>See Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Town of Pound Ridge, </em>362 F.2d 430, 434 (2d Cir. 1966); <em>O\u2019Dowd v. American Surety Co., </em>3 N.Y.2d 347, 351-54, 165 N.Y.S.2d 458, 144 N.E.2d 359 (1957); 12 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 44:447 (2d ed. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">There is little if any similarity between the government\u2019s waiver of <em>respondeat superior </em>immunity in the Tort Claims Act and the creation of employee benefits under workmen\u2019s compensation, disability benefits and unemployment compensation statutes. Although the Federal Drivers Act, which added subdivisions (b) through (e) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, did confer a benefit upon government employees by immunizing them from individual liability, this benefit cannot be equated with the rights the employees would have under a workman\u2019s compensation, disability benefits, or unemployment compensation statute. <em>See, e. g., Feres v. United States, supra, </em>340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153; <em>Vantrease v. United States, </em>400 F.2d 853 (6th Cir. 1968). The government\u2019s obligations are, of course, totally unlike those for which an employer might be held liable under the excepted statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The order appealed from is reversed and the matter is remanded to the district eourt with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
