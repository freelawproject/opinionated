Defendant challenges his conviction on three grounds: First, that the evidence failed to conform to the indictment; second, that certain jury instructions were improper and materially altered the indictment; finally, that the Government\u2019s delay in bringing defendant to trial violated his fifth amendment due process rights. For the reasons stated below, we find no merit in defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm the denial of his motion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Defendant, John A. Cerrito, was president of Hallcraft, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the early 1970\u2019s. In that capacity, Cerrito entered into an agreement with People\u2019s Trust Company, a Rhode Island bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on February 1, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Under that agreement, Hallcraft would turn over its accounts receivable and People\u2019s Trust would credit Hallcraft\u2019s checking account with up to ninety percent of the receivable\u2019s face value. The receivables represented amounts owed to Hallcraft by its customers for the sale of merchandise. In the event that People\u2019s Trust could not negotiate a receivable or the receivable was invalid, the bank had full recourse against Hallcraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">In December of 1972 and January of 1973, Hallcraft submitted a number of receivables to People\u2019s Trust under the agreement. The receivables were supposedly for merchandise sold to either the Thomas Long Company or Longcraft, Inc., both of Boston, Massachusetts. People\u2019s Trust credited Hallcraft\u2019s checking account as per the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Upon attempting to collect from Thomas Long and Longcraft, however, the bank learned that the invoices were false. The matter was referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) on April 19, 1976. After investigating thousands of pages of bank and corporate records, and numerous people, the case was referred to the United States Attorney for presentation to the Grand Jury. An indictment was returned by the Grand Jury against the defendant on November 7, 1977. Originally, the indictment included 25 counts; one conspiracy charge based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1976); and, 24 counts alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (1976). The conspiracy count was dismissed. The remaining 24 counts charged defendant with making materially false statements to People\u2019s Trust for the purpose of influencing it to advance certain loans to Hallcraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">After trial, the jury found defendant guilty on all 24 substantive counts. Defendant moved under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 29(c) for a judgment of Acquittal or New Trial. His three arguments were that the prosecution\u2019s evidence failed to conform to the indictment, certain jury instructions were improper and materially altered the indictment and, finally, the Government\u2019s delay in bringing defendant to trial violated his fifth amendment due process rights. The district court denied the motion on every ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">The first issue defendant raises is whether the evidence presented at trial was in such material variance with the indictment as to require dismissal. Defendant argues that the prosecution failed to prove that defendant made false statements in regard to a loan. He contends that the material variance between the charge and proof prejudiced both his ability to present a proper defense and failed to protect him from possible double jeopardy. See, <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962); <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>L.Ed. 1314 (1935); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>540 F.2d 364, 371 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In addressing this issue of variance in proof from indictment, the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">The true inquiry, therefore, is not whether there has been a variance in proof, but whether there has been such <em>a </em>variance as to \u201caffect the substantial rights\u201d of the accused. <em>[Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 630, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Similarly, Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) requires the courts to disregard any variance which does not affect the substantial rights of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We do not consider there to have been any variation in proof and, even if variation occurred, it was not so substantially prejudicial as to warrant dismissal. <em>Cf., Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Defendant was charged in each count of the indictment with making a materially false statement in order to induce People\u2019s Trust, the bank, to make a loan. As defendant points out, the section under which he was charged is quite broad. He could have violated the statute and been indicted for making a false statement to a bank insured by FDIC upon 1) an application; 2) an advance; 3) a discount; 4) a purchase; 5) a purchase agreement; 6) a repurchasing agreement; 7) a commitment; or 8) a loan. The Grand Jury chose to charge defendant with making a false statement to influence the bank in making a loan despite its ability to charge alternatively. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">While we agree with defendant that the Government\u2019s proof must conform to the indictment, <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), the Government\u2019s proof in this case is sufficient for a jury to conclude that defendant made false statements in order to influence People\u2019s Trust in regard to a loan. <em>See, United States v. Brown, </em>540 F.2d 364 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Essentially, defendant complains that the Hallcraft-People\u2019s Trust agreement was a purchasing arrangement rather than a loan. Defendant, however, construes the word \u201cloan\u201d too narrowly. It has a relatively \u201celastic\u201d meaning, 54 C.J.S. Loan at 652, and, \u201c[a]ccording to the context the term may mean debt, deposit, discount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">In general, a loan requires a transfer of consideration with an absolute obligation of repayment. 6 <em>Michie on Banks and Banking, </em>ch. 11, \u00a7 1 at 238 (1975) (hereinafter <em>Michie). </em>Increasingly, the existence of interest is considered a significant factor in determining whether a transaction is a loan. <em>Michie, supra </em>at \u00a7 1, n.6 (Cumm.Supp.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Ultimately, however, the intent of the parties controls over the form of the transaction. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1, 238. <em>Fuqua National, Inc. v. United States, </em>334 F.Supp. 1116 (S.D. Georgia 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-16\">In the case at bar, although the agreement describes Hallcraft \u201cselling\u201d its receivables to People\u2019s Trust, read in context, the language indicates a loan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>bank paid Hallcraft 90% of a receivable\u2019s face value, it essentially lent the company money discounted by a 10% charge representing interest. <em>Michie, supra </em>at \u00a7 3, p. 242. Those receivables are held as security, <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10, p. 259; Mass. Law c. 172, \u00a7 48(3) (1977) and, as specified in the agreement here, the bank typically looks first to the security for payment of the debt; but, may look to the principal debtor, i. e., the corporation, if the security is insufficient or worthless. <em>Michie, supra </em>at \u00a7 16, p. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In short, given the interest charge through a discount, the payment of consideration to Hallcraft by the bank and the company\u2019s absolute obligation to repay the money paid, a reasonable conclusion is that the arrangement was, in form, a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Furthermore, the expressions of the parties\u2019 intent makes clear that they considered the arrangement a loan. The evidence shows that the bank officers classified the agreement as an \u201caccounts receivable financing loan.\u201d In effect, it gave Hallcraft a revolving line of credit for loans and the receivables were security for the loan. Moreover, at trial, defendant testified that he considered the agreement a loan. Even if the agreement were not in form a loan, since the parties\u2019 intent controls over the form of the agreement, <em>Michie, supra </em>at \u00a7 1, 238, the trial court could reasonably conclude on this basis that the parties arranged a loan. Thus, the jury could conclude that defendant made false statements to influence the bank to make a loan. The proof conformed to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Even assuming that the proof did not show a \u201cloan,\u201d but rather a \u201cpurchase\u201d agreement, defendant would have to show that the variance substantially affected his rights. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962); <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960); <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). As the Supreme Court has noted, the purpose of an indictment is to inform the accused of the charges so that he may prepare a defense, and \u201cin case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense,\u201d to show accurately the extent of his acquittal or conviction. <em>Russell v. United States, </em>369 U.S. at 763-64, 82 S.Ct. at 1047; <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. at 82, 55 S.Ct. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">As to preparing his defense, the indictment \u201cestablishes a time frame and identifies the victims, the property [and] the methods.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>540 F.2d 364 (8th Cir. 1976). If the proof and indictment were at variance here, it would not seem to present the reversible situation encountered in <em>Stirone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960). In that case, the indictment covered unlawful interference with the interstate movement of sand whereas the proof regarded the movement of steel. As stated above, however, we need not reach this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">As to protecting defendant from double jeopardy, the indictment clearly shows that he is being charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (1976) in reference to specific invoices (receivables) offered to Hallcraft under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Defendant might also have made the hy-pertechnical argument that the agreement was a \u201cdiscount\u201d rather than a \u201cloan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (1976). If so, it would be hard to find that such an error substantially affected his rights since loan and discount are synonymous. <em>Michie, supra </em>at \u00a7 1, p. 236; 54 C.J.S. Loan at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">On examination of the record, we can find no error in the conclusion that the evidence showed the agreement was a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">Defendant next argues that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury specifically that it must find that Cerrito made a materially false statement to obtain a loan for Hallcraft, was a prejudicial amendment of the indictment. <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">All 24 counts of the indictment read substantially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>[That (on date)], John A. Cerrito did make a materially false statement to the People\u2019s Trust Company, a bank whose deposits are insured by the [FDIC], for the purpose of influencing the action of said bank, in that John A. Cerrito, an officer of Hallcraft, Inc., . . ..assigned to People\u2019s Trust Company as collateral and security for a loan granted to Hallcraft . . ., Invoice Number [X] representing it to be an account receivable . . . duly owed . . ., when in truth and fact John A. Cerrito well knew that said invoice was false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Initially, the district judge instructed the jury, \u201cI am not going to read each count to you because you will have the indictment in your jury room, and you can do that for yourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">He also instructed the jury properly on the Government\u2019s burden of proving each count beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">The Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant made: (1) a false statement to the bank; (2) that he did so for the purpose of influencing the bank\u2019s action in approving a loan; (3) that the statement was false as to a material fact; (4) that he did so knowingly and (5) that the bank\u2019s de- \u25a0 posits were insured by the [FDIC].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Defendant complains that by not specifying in point (2) that defendant had influenced the bank\u2019s action in approving a loan <em>to Hallcraft, </em>the judge prejudicially amended the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">That is an unfair reading of the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">First, we note that the judge\u2019s alleged omission is not fatal if there is no actual prejudice. <em>United States v. Smolar, </em>557 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 966, 98 S.Ct. 508, 54 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977). The district judge, however, properly set forth the elements of a cause of action under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (1976). The district judge further directed the jurors\u2019 attention to the indictment, which they had in their possession. In each of its 24 counts, the indictment explicitly charged Cerrito with actions relating to \u201ca loan granted <em>to Hallcraft, </em>Inc.\u201d (emphasis added.) Under the circumstances, stating the point again would have been redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">The type of jury instruction which imper-missibly amends an indictment is the type found in <em>Smolar. </em>In that case, the judge instructed the jury to find defendant guilty if he breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation. The indictment, on the other hand, was based upon fraud, not a breach of fiduciary duty. <em>United States v. Smolar, </em>557 F.2d at 19. That sort of situation is clearly not presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">After reviewing the jury instructions, indictment and parties\u2019 arguments, we can find no prejudicial amendment of the indictment warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">Defendant\u2019s third argument is that his fifth amendment due process rights were violated by the Government\u2019s pre-indictment delay. Defendant\u2019s argument rests upon dicta in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). The Supreme Court stated that if defendant could prove actual prejudice based on pre-indictment delay, the charges might be dismissed due to the violation of defendant\u2019s due process rights. Defendant fails to note, however, the subsequent narrowing of this language by the Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\"><em>Lovasco </em>involved an 18-month delay prior to trial. Defendant alleged that the prosecution could have brought him to trial in one month after postal authorities finished their investigation. During the intervening 17 months, while the Government investigated further, two witnesses crucial to the defense died. Nonetheless, the Court found that the district court erred in finding a violation of defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>Id. at </em>797, 97 S.Ct. 2044.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">The Court stated that \u201cDue process clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 789, 97 S.Ct. at 2048, and reaffirmed its statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>in <em>Marion, supra, </em>that statutes of limitations provide \u201cthe primary guarantee, against bringing overly stale criminal charges.\u201d 431 U.S. at 789, 97 S.Ct. at 2048. Moreover, the Court noted that prosecutors have a right to investigate cases fully, and a duty not to bring charges until they have probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 791-95, 97 S.Ct. at 2049. All told, the Court limited our role to determining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">[Ojnly whether the action complained of \u2014 . . . \u2014 violated those \u201cfundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions\u201d [cites] and which define \u201cthe community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d [Cites.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In particular, the Court made an explicit differentiation between investigative delay and delay to gain a tactical advantage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Writing for the Court, Justice Marshall stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">In our view, investigative delay is fundamentally unlike delay undertaken by the Government solely \u201cto gain tactical advantage over the accused,\u201d <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 324, [92 S.Ct. 455] precisely because investigative delay is not so one-sided. Rather than deviating from elementary standards of \u201cfair play and decency,\u201d a prosecutor abides by them if he refuses to seek indictments until he is completely satisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Penalizing prosecutors who defer action for these reasons would subordinate the goal of \u201corderly expedition\u201d to that of \u201cmere speed.\u201d [Cites.] This the Due Process Clause does not require. We therefore hold that to prosecute a defendant following investigative delay does not deprive him of due process, even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time. <em>Id. </em>at 795-96, 97 S.Ct. at 2051-2052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The instant case is no more compelling than <em>Marion </em>or <em>Lovasco. </em>The Government brought suit against defendant within the relevant statute of limitations as enacted by Congress. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 (1976). Moreover, while defendant complains that over four years passed between the time he committed the acts and an indictment was brought the subject matter of the indictment was not even referred to the F.B.I. until April 1976. From that time, it only took the Government 19 months to complete its investigation and return a Grand Jury indictment. During this period, the F.B.I. investigated thousands of pages of documents and approximately 27 people. This appears to be the same sort of investigative delay which the Supreme Court recognized as presumptively valid in <em>Lovasco, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Defendant\u2019s only allegation of prejudice is that some documents were no longer available by trial and for many, only copies existed. Nowhere does defendant prove any actual prejudice, <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 325\u201426, 92 S.Ct. 455, nor, most importantly, does defendant even allege any reason for the Government\u2019s delay other than for investigative purposes. <em>Lovasco, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">In summary, we hold that the Government\u2019s proof conformed to the Grand Jury\u2019s indictment. The agreement could be found reasonably to constitute a loan. Moreover, the district judge\u2019s jury instructions did not materially alter the indictment. Finally, the Government\u2019s pre-indictment delay did not violate defendant\u2019s fifth amendment due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Accordingly, after oral argument and upon thorough consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-17\">. Hallcraft was doing business as Giovanni Jewelry and was a Rhode Island corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">.
