For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">Factual Background and Procedural Posture</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">{\u00b6 2} On October 25, 2004, Five Star and Merchants Bank entered into a credit and security agreement. As part of that agreement, Five Star executed a promissory note in favor of Merchants Bank for a $2,000,000 line of credit. Under the note, the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest owed by Five Star is determined by the \u201cledgers and records\u201d of Merchants Bank. In addition, Winter signed a guaranty agreement fully backing Five Star\u2019s obligations under the credit agreement and the note. Both the note and the guaranty contain Ohio choice-of-law and warrant-of-attorney provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">{\u00b6 8} On January 9, 2008, Merchants Bank filed suit against Five Star and Winter alleging default on the credit agreement, the note, and the guaranty. Pursuant to the warrant-of-attorney provisions, attorney Brian Ewald appeared on behalf of Five Star and Winter and confessed judgment against them for $1,458,279.95, plus interest, costs, late charges, and attorney fees. The trial court promptly entered a cognovit judgment with the same terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">{\u00b6 4} On May 19, 2008, Five Star and Winter moved to vacate that judgment. Over the next 18 months, Winter separately moved to vacate the judgment, and Five Star and Winter filed an \u201cAmended Motion to Dismiss and Declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Merchants Judgment Void Ab Initio.\u201d On December 21, 2009, the trial court denied these motions, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The \u201cLedgers and Records\u201d of Merchants Bank</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">{\u00b6 5} In their first assignment of error, Five Star and Winter argue that the cognovit judgment is invalid because the \u201cledgers and records\u201d of Merchants Bank were not submitted before the judgment was entered. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe cognovit is the ancient legal device by which the debtor consents in advance to the holder\u2019s obtaining a judgment without notice or hearing, and possibly even with the appearance, on the debtor\u2019s behalf, of an attorney designated by the holder.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he purpose of a cognovit note is to allow the holder of the note to quickly obtain judgment, without the possibility of trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">{\u00b6 7} In Ohio, R.C. 2823.12 and 2323.13 establish and govern the jurisdiction of the state\u2019s trial courts to enter cognovit judgments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The former allows for judgment by confession, and the latter provides for warrants of attorney, which may authorize an attorney to confess judgment against a defendant without prejudgment notice. All of their requirements \u201cmust be met in order for a valid judgment to be granted upon a cognovit note or for a court to have subject-matter jurisdiction over the same.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And because the statutes empower courts to enter judgments that they would otherwise be without authority to enter, warrants of attorney to confess judgment must be \u201cstrictly construed, and court proceedings based on such warrants must conform in every essential detail with the statutory law governing the subject.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">{\u00b6 8} Five Star and Winter contend that the note is \u201cfacially insufficient\u201d to support a cognovit judgment because it determines the amount owed by Five Star by referring to extrinsic documents. Specifically, the note provides that the \u201cunpaid principal balance of and interest accrued on this Note shall be determined by the ledgers and records of [Merchants Bank] as maintained in accordance with the respective ordinary practices to reflect Advances and payments.\u201d Thus, at any given time, the amount due on the note is not evident on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>{\u00b6 9} To support their proposition, Five Star and Winter cite <em>Onda, LaBuhn, Rankin &amp; Boggs Co., L.P.A. v. </em>Johnson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Onda, </em>a debtor signed a cognovit note to secure his payment for legal services. The debtor promised to pay \u201call amount(s) advanced by [the law firm] to [the debtor] for the purpose of securing legal fees, as evidenced by the books and records of [the law firm] and [the debtor].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The firm later obtained a cognovit judgment against the debtor, but the Fourth Appellate District reversed. The judge authoring the opinion wrote that because the note required extrinsic documents to calculate the amount owed, the note was \u201cfacially insufficient to support a cognovit judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judgment was held void and vacated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 10} In our analysis, we turn first to the Revised Code. Although we must strictly construe R.C. 2323.12 and 2323.13, we nevertheless have an \u201cobligation to give effect to the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If statutory language \u201cconveys a meaning that is clear and unequivocal, interpretation is at an end, and the statute must be applied accordingly.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">{\u00b6 11} Under R.C. 2323.13, \u201c[a]n attorney who confesses judgment in a case, at the time of making such confession, must produce the warrant of attorney for making it to the court before which he makes the confession.\u201d Neither statute, however, requires the instrument containing the warrant of attorney to demonstrate by itself the amount owed by the defendant. We therefore decline to adopt such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">{\u00b6 12} Moreover, to hold otherwise would severely undermine the clear legislative intent to allow warrants of attorney in nonconsumer transactions. \u2019 Such a holding would leave numerous proper lending arrangements unenforceable in cognovit actions, particularly when the amount owed may change from day to day, such as with open lines of credit and interest-bearing loans. Accordingly, we hold that the note was not facially insufficient to support a cognovit judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>merely because it determined the amount owed by Five Star by reference to extrinsic documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">{\u00b6 13} Five Star and Winter alternatively argue that by its own terms, the note required the submission of the \u201cledgers and records\u201d of Merchants Bank before the cognovit judgment was entered. We recognize that nothing in R.C. 2323.12 and 2323.13 prevents parties from creating contingent warrants of attorney that courts may enforce. For instance, in <em>Bank One, N.A. v. DeVillers, </em>the Tenth Appellate District held that where a warrant of attorney authorized the confession of judgment for an unpaid amount \u201cas evidenced by an affidavit signed by an officer of [the] Lender setting forth the amount then due,\u201d the lender was required to submit that affidavit before judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 14} But those are not the facts in this record. Here, the note authorizes \u201cany attorney at law to appear before any Court of Record, state or Federal, in the county or judicial district where this note was executed or where [Five Star] or [Merchants Bank] reside or may be found, after the unpaid principal balance of this note becomes due * * * and confess judgment against [Five Star] in favor of [Merchants Bank] or other holder of this Note for the amount then appearing due on this Note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 15} Similarly, the guaranty authorizes \u201cany attorney-at-law to appear in any court of record in Hamilton County, Ohio * * * after the indebtedness evidenced hereby becomes due * * * and confess judgment against the undersigned in favor of [Merchants Bank] for the amount then appearing due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 16} Even under a strict reading of these provisions, we see no requirement for the submission of the ledgers and records of Merchants Bank prior to the entry of judgment. Although the guaranty refers to \u201cindebtedness evidenced,\u201d the confession of judgment was adequate to show the amount owed by Five Star and Winter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 17} In their second assignment of error, Five Star and Winter contend that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction to enter the cognovit judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Five Star and Winter rely on Section 10.8 of the credit agreement, which provides that \u201c[Five Star] agrees that any action or proceeding to enforce or arising out of this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents [including the Note and Guaranty] may be commenced in the Court of Common Pleas for Montgomery County, Ohio or in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio, and [Five Star] waives personal service of process and agrees that a summons and complaint commencing an action or proceeding in any such court shall be properly served and shall confer personal jurisdiction over [Five Star] * *</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">{\u00b6 19} But in their initial motion to vacate the cognovit judgment, Five Star and Winter did not challenge the trial court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over them. Instead, they pointed to the same forum-selection clause and challenged the court\u2019s venue. Personal jurisdiction, which concerns the power of a court to exercise control over parties, is a distinct concept from venue, which primarily concerns the selection of a convenient forum among courts with jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because Five Star and Winter failed to raise the issue at their first appearance in this case, they implicitly consented to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 20} Moreover, in the note and guaranty, Five Star and Winter expressly waived the issuance and service of process and authorized any attorney to appear on their behalf to confess judgment against them. Winter\u2019s waiver applied to the courts of Hamilton County, and Five Star\u2019s extended to all Ohio courts. They, therefore, consented to the personal jurisdiction of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas to enter judgment against them without prior notice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 21} Five Star and Winter nevertheless contend that under Indiana law, these waivers were invalid and that because they never were served with process or entered an appearance, the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. But we see no reason to apply Indiana law here. Although the state\u2019s laws had governed an earlier lending arrangement among the parties, the note and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>guaranty expressly provide that Ohio law shall govern. The second assignment of error is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Civ.R. 60(B) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, in their third assignment of error, Five Star and Winter argue that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied their motions to vacate the cognovit judgment under Civ.R. 60(B). Again, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">{\u00b6 23} In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny relief from judgment, we look only for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore will reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">{\u00b624} \u201cGenerally, a party seeking relief under Civ.R. 60(B) must demonstrate that \u2018(1) the party has a meritorious defense or claim to pursue if relief is granted; (2) the party is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5); and (3) the motion is made within a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But when seeking relief from a cognovit judgment, the movant \u201cneed only establish that it has a meritorious defense and that the motion is timely raised.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although cognovit notes cut off many defenses for the maker, a \u201cmeritorious defense \u2018goes to the integrity and validity of the creation of the debt or note, the state of the underlying debt at the time of confession of judgment, or the procedure utilized in the confession of judgment on the note.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To allege a meritorious defense, the movant must provide \u201coperative facts in support thereof,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and these facts must be alleged \u201cwith enough specificity to allow the court to decide whether it has met that test.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">{\u00b6 25} Five Star and Winter first claim that they owe less money than was confessed to the trial court. They allege that although the cognovit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>judgment was for $1,458,279.95, a statement prepared by Merchants Bank on January 14, 2008, shows a balance of $1,338,879. Five Star and Winter, however, do not contest that they in fact owe the amount confessed at the time of judgment. Nor do they contest Merchants Bank\u2019s contention that the bank liquidated certificates of deposit with a face value of $100,000 it held as collateral pursuant to the credit agreement as partial satisfaction of the judgment. In fact, Winter has even assumed this was the case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We therefore cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying relief on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">{\u00b6 26} Next, Five Star and Winter allege that the credit agreement, the note, and the guaranty were unconscionable because the law firm that advised Winter to sign the documents failed to disclose that it was also representing Merchants Bank. They maintain that the firm failed to advise Winter of material differences between an earlier lending agreement among the parties that did not contain a cognovit provision and the note and the guaranty, which did. Allegedly relying on this advice, Winter signed the credit agreement and the note on behalf of Five Star, as well as the guaranty, without reading the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">{\u00b6 27} Before the trial court, however, Winter argued that he had relied on the representations of \u201cPlaintiff and counsel for the Plaintiff\u2019 and that he and Five Star \u201cwere not permitted to retain separate counsel to review\u201d the credit agreement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This account is inconsistent with their assertion before this court that Five Star and Winter believed that the law firm represented them. Five Star and Winter did not satisfy Civ.R. 60(B) in this instance either.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, Five Star and Winter contend that the warrant-of-attorney provisions were invalid because they were procured in violation of Indiana law. For the reasons set forth in our response to the second assignment of error, we reject this argument and overrule the third assignment of error. The trial court\u2019s judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-8\">Dinkelacker, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. <em>D.H.
