Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">{\u00b6 1} This appeal is before this court on remand from the Ohio Supreme Court, after it reversed our determination that the failure of a trial court to instruct a spouse on competency and make a finding on the record that the spouse voluntarily chose to testify constitutes reversible plain error. <em>State v. Davis, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 268, 2010-Ohio-5706, 939 N.E.2d 147, reversing <em>State v. Davis, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91324, 2009-Ohio-5217, 2009 WL 3154509.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 2} We based our determination in our previous opinion on <em>State v. Brown, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, which held the following: \u201cOnce it has been determined that a witness is married to the defendant, the trial court must instruct the witness on spousal competency and make a finding on the record that he or she voluntarily chose to testify. Failure to do so constitutes reversible plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">{\u00b6 3} In reversing our determination in the instant case, the Ohio Supreme Court stated, \u201cAdmittedly, our statement in <em>Brown </em>that a violation of Evid.R. 601(B) \u2018constitutes reversible plain error\u2019 may have been misunderstood to mean that the admission of incompetent spousal testimony is structural error requiring automatic reversal without consideration of whether the testimony prejudiced the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 268, 2010-Ohio-5706, 939 N.E.2d 147, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">{\u00b6 4} The court clarified its statement and held the following: \u201cAn appellate court may not reverse a conviction for plain error based on the admission of spousal testimony in violation of Evid.R. 601(B) unless it conducts a plain-error analysis * * * and determines that but for the error in admitting the spouse\u2019s testimony, the outcome of the trial would have been different and that reversal is necessary to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">{\u00b6 5} The Ohio Supreme Court instructed this court on remand to \u201cconduct a plain-error analysis and determine that but for the error in admitting spousal testimony, the outcome of the trial would have been different and that reversal is necessary to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">{\u00b6 6} In our previous opinion, we overruled defendant William Davis\u2019s first assignment of error, reversed his convictions, and remanded this case for a new trial based on the reasoning discussed above. <em>State v. Davis, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91324, 2009-Ohio-5217, 2009 WL 3154509. A brief procedural history of this case follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On September 17, 2007, defendant was charged with 31 counts of rape and gross sexual imposition, involving his two nieces, D.T.1 and D.T.2. According to D.T.1, defendant sexually molested her from 1999, when she was nine years old, until 2005, when she was 15 years old. According to D.T.2, defendant began to molest her in 2006, when she was eight or nine years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 8} In the fall of 2006, D.T.1 told her mother that defendant had sexually abused her for six years. A subsequent investigation of these allegations led to defendant\u2019s indictment. On March 7, 2008, a jury found defendant guilty of six counts of rape of a child under 13 years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), 13 counts of rape by force in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of gross sexual imposition by force in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), and three counts of gross sexual imposition of a child under 13 years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). On March 12, 2008, the court sentenced defendant to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 9} We begin by analyzing the spousal testimony for plain error, as directed by the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">{\u00b6 10} After reviewing the facts of this case, we find that the outcome of the trial would have been the same regardless of the error in admitting defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony. Reversal is not necessary to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice, because defendant\u2019s multiple rape and gross sexual imposition convictions are supported by the testimony of the two victims. See <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 624, 638, 591 N.E.2d 854 (\u201cThere is no requirement that a rape victim\u2019s testimony be corroborated as a condition precedent to conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 11} The two victims, D.T.l and D.T.2, who are defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s nieces, testified that defendant repeatedly molested them. Most of the abuse occurred at defendant\u2019s home when the girls were visiting and helping his wife on the weekends. Defendant\u2019s wife has trouble getting around, and defendant would take advantage of this by sexually abusing the girls when his wife was sleeping or occupied elsewhere in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 12} D.T.l testified that the abuse started in 1999, when she was nine years old. D.T.l detailed multiple incidents of sexual abuse that happened at four different houses that defendant and his wife lived in over a six-year span. The last time D.T.l recalled defendant raping her was late in 2005, when she was 15 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">{\u00b6 13} D.T.l recalled various details of the abuse. For example, after it first started, there was blood in her underwear. D.T.l showed her mom, who thought that D.T.l had begun to menstruate. Most of the abuse occurred at night, when D.T.l was sleeping in a makeshift bed on the dining-room floor. D.T.l testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that she told defendant several times that she \u201cdid not want to do this anymore\u201d but that he continued to rape her, saying that \u201cit will be over soon.\u201d D.T.l had trouble sleeping and frequently cried.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">{\u00b6 14} D.T.2 testified that defendant touched her inappropriately in 2006, when she was eight or nine years old. This happened on two occasions when D.T.2 was staying at her aunt and defendant\u2019s house for the weekend, while she was sleeping on blankets on the dining-room floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 15} In September 2006, D.T.l told her mother about the abuse, and her mother contacted the police. Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services conducted an investigation, and defendant was subsequently indicted for the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 16} In light of D.T.l\u2019s and D.T.2\u2019s specific and consistent testimony regarding defendant\u2019s molesting them, we cannot say that defendant would have been acquitted had his wife not testified. The court\u2019s failure to inform defendant\u2019s wife that she could choose not to testify against her husband and failure to find that she voluntarily elected to testify were not prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 17} Given this determination, we turn to defendant\u2019s assignments of error on appeal. In our previous opinion, we overruled defendant\u2019s first assignment of error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we hereby incorporate that analysis into this opinion. 2009-Ohio-5217, 2009 WL 3154509, \u00b6 13-27. Additionally, our previous opinion rendered defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error moot. Id., at \u00b6 31. However, our determination that defendant\u2019s convictions should not be reversed for plain error based on the admission of spousal testimony necessitates that we now review these remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 18} Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe appellant was denied a fair trial when evidence was admitted that appellant had a general propensity to molest young females when he was on trial for rape and GSI of two of his nieces.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">{\u00b6 20} Evid.R. 404(B) states, \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d See also R.C. 2945.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>{\u00b6 21} On January 18, 2008, the court denied the state\u2019s pretrial motion to allow Evid.R. 404(B) other-acts evidence into trial, specifically, the testimony of the victims\u2019 mother, who is also defendant\u2019s sister-in-law, regarding comments that defendant made to young female family members approximately 20 years ago. In ruling the evidence inadmissible, the court stated, \u201c[T]he testimony would go to the act itself rather than the plan to engage in the act. This is not needed as evidence of modus operandi to establish identity. It\u2019s impossible to defend against, as well as being highly prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 22} During trial, the victims\u2019 mother testified for the state, and the prosecutor asked her if she ever had a falling out with defendant. The victims\u2019 mother answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The state then asked, \u201cNow, has your relationship always been wonderful with this defendant?\u201d The victims\u2019 mother answered that it had. During cross-examination, defense counsel confirmed with the victims\u2019 mother that she never had any disagreements with defendant prior to this case, and that generally, \u201ceveryone in this family [was] getting along perfectly prior to these allegations coming to light.\u201d During redirect examination, the state probed the victims\u2019 mother\u2019s testimony of no family disagreements. Eventually, the victims\u2019 mother testified to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 23} Approximately 16 years ago, she walked in on defendant, who was standing \u201cright up on\u201d her sister, who did not have anything on but a towel; defendant \u201calways has been this type of person that if you \u2014 if you\u2019re at the sink washing dishes, he would come up behind you and act like he\u2019s getting something off the top, the cabinets up there, and he\u2019d be rubbing and grinding on you and you be like, \u2018Move\u2019 \u201d; when she was 14 years old, the victims\u2019 mother was walking from the store when defendant passed by in a car and said, \u201cLook at those big titties. I can suck them\u201d; and, at a family function around Christmas time, defendant inappropriately kissed her on the lips and she slapped him in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 24} Defendant did not object to this line of testimony. In fact, on recross-examination, defendant focused on the inconsistencies in the victims\u2019 mother\u2019s testimony, in that she initially said that she never had a disagreement with defendant but subsequently testified to improper incidents with defendant over the years. Defense counsel asked how many times she slapped defendant and she responded, \u201cMore than once.\u201d Defendant also elicited testimony from the victims\u2019 mother that he was drunk all the time and that she was one of the people that he had rubbed up against in the past. Finally, defense counsel asked her why she kept quiet about defendant\u2019s history of sexually inappropriate conduct. \u201cBecause [her sister; defendant\u2019s wife] would always say, \u2018[defendant is] drunk. [Defendant is] drunk,\u2019 when he do things out of the ordinary. So you try to just go on, he\u2019s drunk. But some things you can\u2019t just go with that he\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Since defendant failed to object to this testimony, he waived all but plain error on appeal. Evid.R. 103(A). Crim.R. 52(B) states, \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court identified \u201cthree limitations on a reviewing court\u2019s decision to correct an error despite the absence of a timely objection at trial. First, there must be an error, <em>ie., </em>a deviation from a legal rule. Second, the error must be plain. To be \u2018plain\u2019 within the meaning of Crim.R. 52(B), an error must be an \u2018obvious\u2019 defect in the trial proceedings. Third, the error must have affected \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 We have interpreted this aspect of the rule to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b626} While defendant cites Evid.R. 404(B) for the proposition that evidence of past wrongs or acts \u201cis not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\u201d we need not discuss this because we find that the testimony falls under the Evid.R. 404(A)(1) exception to the inadmissibility of character evidence in general. Evid.R. 404(A)(1) states that character evidence is admissible if \u201coffered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same.\u201d This court has held that error will not be found when the defense opens the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence. <em>State v. Clemence, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81845, 2003-Ohio-3660, 2003 WL 21545745, citing <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 530 N.E.2d 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">{\u00b6 27} Looking at the proffered testimony in light of the above evidentiary rules and case law, we cannot say that it was a plain and obvious error to allow it. Although the victims\u2019 mother testified for the state, she initially said that she had no problems with defendant. Defense counsel expanded on this, possibly because it may have been favorable to him. This opened the door for the state to present rebuttal testimony that the witness did, in fact, have problems with defendant. Defense counsel then expanded on this line of questioning, presumably to impeach the state\u2019s witness by pointing out her inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[A] criminal defendant may not make an affirmative, apparently strategic decision at trial and then complain on appeal that the result of that decision constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>State v. Doss, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84433, 2005-Ohio-775, 2005 WL 433531. Pursuant to the invited-error doctrine, \u201ca party is not entitled to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or induced the court to make.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kline v. Carroll, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 404, 2002-Ohio-4849, 775 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">{\u00b6 30} In defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, he argues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>{\u00b6 31} \u201cAppellant was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 32} To substantiate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the performance of defense counsel was seriously flawed and deficient and (2) the result of defendant\u2019s trial or legal proceeding would have been different had defense counsel provided proper representation. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 144, 25 OBR 190, 495 N.E.2d 407. In <em>State v. Bradley, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court truncated this standard, holding that reviewing courts need not examine counsel\u2019s performance if the defendant fails to prove the second prong of prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. \u201cThe object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id. at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 33} In the instant case, defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in the following ways: (1) failing to object to inadmissible other-acts testimony and (2) failing to object to the state\u2019s calling his wife as a witness and questioning her about a letter D.T.l wrote to her and calls between her and defendant when defendant was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 34} The other-acts testimony was thoroughly analyzed in defendant\u2019s second assignment of error. For the same reasons, we find that the admission of this evidence was defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy because it attacked the credibility of the state\u2019s witness. See Evid.R. 607 (allowing impeachment by prior inconsistent statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">{\u00b6 35} Defendant\u2019s second allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel concerns his wife\u2019s testimony. Defendant argues that she was incompetent to testify under Evid.R. 601(B), which states as follows: \u201cEvery person is competent to be a witness except * * * [a] spouse testifying against the other spouse charged with a crime except when * * * (2) the testifying spouse elects to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">{\u00b6 36} As stated earlier in this opinion, the court failed to find that defendant\u2019s wife elected to testify. Furthermore, defense counsel did not object to defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony. Defendant\u2019s wife was called to testify by the state, but she was declared a hostile witness on the stand under Evid.R. 611(C) and subjected to leading questions because her testimony was at times favorable to the state and at times favorable to defendant. However, assuming without deciding that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony, we turn to the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>whether the result of the proceeding would have been different had counsel objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">{\u00b6 37} Under direction from the Ohio Supreme Court, we determined earlier in this opinion that the outcome of the trial would have been the same regardless of the error in admitting defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony. Using the same reasoning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>we likewise determine that the outcome of defendant\u2019s trial would have been the same regardless of counsel\u2019s failure to object to defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony. See <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (\u201cThe failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. To prevail on such a claim, a defendant must first show that there was a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to his client and, second, that he was materially prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled, and his convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-7\">Stewart, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b165-8\">Boyle, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-12\">. Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error: \"The defendant was twice put in jeopardy for the same offenses contrary to the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution when after jeopardy having attached the court denied appellant's request to try his case to a jury of eleven, dismissed the sworn panel, and impanelled a second jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b165-9\">Boyle, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A0O\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 39} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s resolution of the first assignment of error because the record fails to demonstrate a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for sua sponte ordering a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 40} At the outset, I must emphasize that the constitutional protection afforded under the Double Jeopardy Clause also \u201cembraces the defendant\u2019s \u2018valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717, quoting <em>United States v. Jorn </em>(1971), 400 U.S. 470, 484, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, and <em>Wade v. Hunter </em>(1949), 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 41} And although a trial court has the power to sua sponte declare a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent, \u201cthe power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez </em>(1824), 22 U.S. 579, 580, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (the case wherein the United States Supreme Court initially used the phrase \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d); <em>United States v. Toribio-Lugo </em>(C.A.1, 2004), 376 F.3d 33, 38-39. Indeed, recognizing that a constitutionally protected interest is affected by a court\u2019s sua sponte declaration of a mistrial, the Supreme Court has cautioned trial courts to exercise its authority only after a \u201cscrupulous exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Jorn </em>at 485. As stated by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c[A] trial judge, therefore, \u2018must always temper the decision whether or not to abort the trial by considering the importance to the defendant of being able, once and for all, to conclude his confrontation \"with society through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>verdict of a tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed to his fate.\u201d\u2019 <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 514, quoting <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 486.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 43} With these considerations in mind, the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d standard is a heavy burden. <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717. And although there is no precise, mechanical formula to determine whether a mistrial is supported by manifest necessity, a reviewing court must be satisfied that the trial court exercised \u201csound discretion\u201d in declaring a mistrial. Id. at 506, 514; see also <em>Ross v. Petro </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 515 F.3d 653. To exercise \u201csound discretion\u201d in determining that a mistrial is necessary, \u201cthe trial judge should allow both parties to state their positions on the issue, consider their competing interests, and explore some reasonable alternatives before declaring a mistrial.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>8th Dist. No. 88913, 2007-Ohio-6302, 2007 WL 4200630, \u00b6 23, citing <em>Washington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 44} Based on the circumstances of this case, I do not believe that the trial judge exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial. Here, after the court properly excused Juror 6, there was a clear alternative to a mistrial: proceeding with 11 jurors. Indeed, <em>both </em>the state and defense agreed to have the case heard by 11 jurors and were ready to proceed. Thus, they shared the same position, i.e., proceed with the jury impaneled and sworn. And although the trial judge heard from both sides and discussed the possibility of proceeding with 11 jurors, she nevertheless opted to sua sponte declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 45} The judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial was based in part on the trial most likely carrying over to the next week, which the judge believed would have created a severe hardship for some members of the jury. The judge inquired of the members, and two indicated that they had a conflict if the case proceeded past Monday of the following week. (But, as noted by the trial judge, the jurors stated during voir dire that they would fulfill their duty and appear for service despite any hardship.) The judge further expressed concern that if a juror failed to appear on Monday, the defense would then move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 46} All of the trial judge\u2019s stated concerns, however, fail to demonstrate manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial. Notably, the judge\u2019s stated concerns were speculative. And if in fact any of them arose, the court could have addressed them at that time. As for the concern of the defense later moving for a mistrial if there were insufficient number of jurors, such a motion would not have implicated the double-jeopardy issues present in this case. Simply put, I do not find that the trial court adequately considered Davis\u2019s \u201c Valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 503, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717, quoting <em>Wade v. Hunter </em>(1949), 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>{\u00b6 47} Further, while I recognize that \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d does not mean that a mistrial was absolutely necessary or that there was no other alternative, it does require a trial court to give meaningful consideration to other alternatives before sua sponte ordering a mistrial. This court has repeatedly recognized that a trial court abuses its discretion in sua sponte declaring a mistrial when other less drastic alternatives are easily available. See <em>N. Olmsted v. Himes, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 84076 and 84078, 2004-Ohio-4241, 2004 WL 1796343 (finding an abuse of discretion in declaring a mistrial when a curative instruction would have sufficiently cured any prejudice); <em>State v. Coon </em>(Apr. 18, 2002), 8th Dist. No. 79641, 2002 WL 598321 (finding an abuse of discretion because the court failed to consider less drastic alternatives); <em>State v. Morgan </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 838, 719 N.E.2d 102 (finding an abuse of discretion because the trial court failed to cure or otherwise determine the effect of the purportedly tainted evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">{\u00b6 48} Here, the trial court could have proceeded with 11 jurors, as consented to by both the state and Davis, and its sua sponte ordering of a mistrial constitutes an abuse of discretion. Therefore, Davis\u2019s retrial was barred by double jeopardy, and his first assignment of error should be sustained. See <em>State v. Glover </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 517 N.E.2d 900.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
