In a hearing held on March 1, 2011, the following colloquies occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cTHE COURT: Ms. Gilroy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cMs. Gilroy, by agreement you\u2019re going to get community control sanctions also. You understand there\u2019s three conditions for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cNumber one, you need to go the pre-sentence folks and cooperate with that and be on time for that appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cNumber two, you need to be back in court on March 29th on time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAnd finally, you need to stay out of trouble between now and then, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-16\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE COURT: Anyone threaten or force you to plead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-17\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-18\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cTHE COURT: Any promises made to get you to plead, other than that you\u2019re going to get community control, subject to the Court\u2019s conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-19\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-20\">{\u00b6 14} \u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-21\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE COURT: Now, if you get revoked from community control sanctions, you would face a maximum time of prison for your felony, which is twelve months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-22\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cDo you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-23\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">{\u00b6 18} After the admissions and advice required by Crim.R. 11(C), the trial court accepted defendant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Defendant appeared for sentencing on March 29, 2011. The court noted that since her guilty plea on March 1, 2011, defendant had tested positive for cocaine and marijuana use. The court also noted that this was defendant\u2019s 11th theft-related offense, that she had been convicted of 29 misdemeanor offenses, and that her record contained \u201cnumerous pages\u201d reporting misdemeanor charges that had been dismissed. The court noted that \u201c[t]he last time you were on supervision from this Court you were an absconder.\u201d Id. After referring to the statutory purposes and principles of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors, instead of community control the court sentenced defendant to a 12-month prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 20} Defendant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment and conviction imposing her prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe court erred when it breached the term of the plea agreement and sentenced appellant to a maximum twelve month prison term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 22} A plea agreement is a contract between the prosecution and a criminal defendant, and is governed by principles of contract law. <em>State v. Adkins, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 114, 2005-Ohio-2577, 829 N.E.2d 729. If one side breaches the agreement, the other side is entitled to rescission or specific performance. <em>Santobello v. New York </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427; <em>State v. Layman, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22307, 2008-Ohio-759, 2008 WL 499280. When a trial court promises a certain sentence, the promise becomes an inducement to enter a plea, and unless that sentence is given, the plea is not voluntary. <em>Layman, </em>citing <em>State v. Triplett </em>(Feb. 13, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 69237, 1997 WL 64051; <em>State v. Bonnell, </em>Clermont App. No. CA200112-094, 2002-Ohio-5882, 2002 WL 31415406.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">{\u00b6 23} In support of her argument that the trial court breached the plea agreement by sentencing her to a prison term after promising her at the plea hearing that she would receive community control, defendant relies upon <em>Bonnell </em>and <em>Layman. </em>That reliance is misplaced, however, because those cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Bonnell, </em>the plea agreement stated that the defendant would not be sentenced to prison. The defendant failed to appear for sentencing. After the defendant was arrested in Tennessee and brought back before the court for sentencing, the trial court imposed a maximum 18-month prison term. The court of appeals concluded that reversible error occurred because the trial court had expressly promised the defendant that it would not sentence him to prison and then failed to perform on its promise without stating its intention to deviate from the terms of the plea agreement and without giving the defendant an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to withdraw his plea due to the change from the terms of the plea agreement. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Layman, </em>the plea agreement stated that any prison term imposed would not exceed seven months. The defendant failed to appear for sentencing. After the defendant was arrested and returned to court for sentencing, the trial court imposed a ten-month prison term. The trial court refused to be bound by the plea agreement limiting any prison term to no more than seven months because the defendant had failed to appear for sentencing. In <em>Layman, </em>quoting from <em>Bonnell, </em>this court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for either imposition of the originally promised sentence or to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 26} In the present case, unlike <em>Bonnell </em>or <em>Layman, </em>defendant was expressly told that she had to abide by three specific conditions in order to obtain the promised sentence of community-control sanctions. One of those three conditions was that defendant \u201cstay out of trouble between now (plea hearing) and then (sentencing).\u201d During the time period between her plea hearing and her sentencing, more specifically two weeks before sentencing, defendant tested positive for both marijuana and cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">{\u00b6 27} We reject defendant\u2019s claim that her illegal use of controlled substances between the plea hearing and her sentencing did not violate the trial court\u2019s condition that she \u201cstay out of trouble\u201d during that period. Clearly, the trial court\u2019s condition encompasses and prohibits breaking the law, including illegal drug use, regardless of whether charges are brought. This case is more analogous to <em>State v. Price, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030262, 2003-Ohio-7109, 2003 WL 23018596, wherein the court of appeals held that the defendant, as the party who breached the plea agreement, voided the terms of the plea agreement and was not entitled to the agreed-upon sentence where he had been warned of the consequences for failing to appear for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 28} The trial court\u2019s promise of community control was conditioned on defendant\u2019s agreement to comply with the three requirements that the court had attached to its promise. \u2019 It was defendant, not the trial court, who breached the plea agreement by failing to abide by the court\u2019s specific condition that she stay out of trouble between the plea hearing and her sentencing. Defendant\u2019s breach relieved the trial court of its duty to perform its promise to impose community-control sanctions. Under those circumstances, the trial court was free to impose any lawful sentence, which it did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 29} Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe court erred in denying Ms. Gilroy her right to due process of law as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions because her guilty plea was not entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 31} A guilty plea that is not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary does not comport with due process and violates the Ohio and United States Constitutions. <em>State v. Engle </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 525, 527, 660 N.E.2d 450, citing <em>Kercheval v. United States </em>(1927), 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009. Compliance with Crim.R. 11(C)(2) in accepting guilty or no-contest pleas in felony cases portrays those qualities. <em>State v. Bennett, </em>192 Ohio App.3d 608, 2011-Ohio-961, 949 N.E.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 32} Defendant argues that as a result of the trial court\u2019s breach of the plea agreement, her guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">{\u00b6 33} As we explained in overruling defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, the trial court did not breach its promise to sentence defendant to community-control sanctions, because defendant\u2019s failure to satisfy a condition on which the court\u2019s promise was made relieved the court of its duty to perform. That did not render defendant\u2019s guilty plea other than knowing and voluntary. Furthermore, it is abundantly clear from the record that defendant knew that the court\u2019s promise was conditional and entered her guilty plea on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">{\u00b6 34} Our review of defendant\u2019s plea reveals that defendant was afforded a thorough hearing prior to entering her plea, and at that hearing, the trial court meticulously complied with Crim.R. 11(C)(2) in accepting defendant\u2019s plea by advising her of all of the constitutional rights she was giving up by pleading guilty, as well as the nonconstitutional implications of her plea. Defendant\u2019s guilty plea was entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">{\u00b6 35} Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cMs. Gilroy was denied the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\"> {\u00b6 37} Counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. To show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must affirmatively demonstrate to a reasonable probability that were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>have been different. Id.; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">{\u00b6 38} Defendant argues that her trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to object when the trial court imposed a prison term rather than community-control sanctions promised at the plea hearing and by failing to move to withdraw defendant\u2019s guilty plea when the trial court breached the plea agreement by imposing a prison term rather than community-control sanctions as promised at the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">{\u00b6 39} Our analysis of the prior assignments of error compels a conclusion that defendant was not prejudiced by her counsel\u2019s alleged failure, because the court would have properly overruled as meritless the objection and/or motion defendant complains her attorney failed to file. Therefore, ineffective assistance of counsel is not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 40} Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-8\">Fain and Hall, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
