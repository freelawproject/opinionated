This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">{\u00b6 2} Mother and Father married in August 1996 and had a daughter together in February 2002. In February 2006, Mother filed for divorce, and Father filed a counterclaim for the same. The parties reached a resolution on matters pertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ing to the division of marital property and parenting terms for their daughter, all of which were set forth in a settlement agreement that was incorporated by reference into the terms of their divorce decree. Under those terms, the parties had agreed that Mother was the residential parent and legal custodian of their daughter and Father was responsible for the payment of child and spousal support. Father agreed to a companionship schedule that resulted in nearly equal parenting time,-as they established a \u201cweek-on, week-off\u2019 arrangement, with a mid-week visitation by the parent not in possession of their daughter. They further agreed at the time that \u201c[a]ll major decisions involving [their child would] be discussed and decided jointly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 3} Though the parties were divorced in April 2007 pursuant to the foregoing agreement, they continued to engage in what the court termed a pattern of \u201chigh conflict between themselves,\u201d focused largely around how the parents would share parental rights and responsibilities for their only daughter. Over time, both parties filed multiple motions challenging the initial terms of their divorce decree. These challenges ultimately culminated in a five-day trial in August 2009, centered on issues of child support, spousal support, parenting time, and the decision-making abilities of each parent with respect to their daughter\u2019s care and education. On November 23, 2009, the trial court entered judgment on the foregoing issues, thus resolving all ten of the parties\u2019 outstanding motions. In doing so, it noted that the parties had stipulated that the companionship schedule would remain essentially the same, but that they had agreed to specific and detailed terms surrounding decision-making responsibilities related to schooling and medical care; vacation and holiday arrangements; transportation terms; and the time and means of communication with their daughter, as well as with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 4} Just over two months later, on January 26, 2010, Mother filed a \u201cMotion to Terminate Shared Parenting Plan.\u201d In her motion, she alleged that recent email communications from Father had \u201cmade it impossible for [Mother] to co-parent with [Father].\u201d In September 2010, the trial court held a hearing on the matter at which Mother and the child\u2019s psychologist testified. .</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 5} On November 22, 2010, the trial court modified the terms of the parties\u2019 decree, specifically concluding that Mother was deemed \u201cthe sole residential and custodial parent\u201d of their child and awarding her \u201csole and complete authority in determining all matters pertaining to the child\u2019s health, education, religious training, extra-curricular activities, and all other matters in which a parent\u2019s decision or authority is required.\u201d The court further held that Father \u201cis enjoined from interfering in any manner whatsoever with [Mother\u2019s] authority herein\u201d and cautioned that \u201cfurther interference with the parenting of the parties\u2019 daughter may result in diminution of [Father\u2019s] parenting time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Father has timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, asserting three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Assignment of Error Number One</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The trial court abused it (sic) discretion by terminating a shared parenting decree when there was no showing of a \u201cchange of circumstances,\u201d no showing that the proposed change of custody was \u201cnecessary to serve the best interest of the child\u201d and no showing that the \u201charm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Father argues that the trial court abused its discretion because there was an absence of any evidence to support its decision. Specifically, he asserts that the trial court erred when it failed to make the requisite finding that there was a change in circumstances and, further, that there was no evidence demonstrating that a change in circumstances had occurred since the parties\u2019 decree was issued. He also asserts that there was a lack of evidence demonstrating that it was in their daughter\u2019s best interest to modify the existing shared-parenting plan or that the harm by any change to the parenting plan would be outweighed by the advantages that change would have on their daughter. Additionally, he asserts that the trial court relied on matters not even in evidence, in that it found that his testimony \u201clack[ed] credibility\u201d when, in fact, he had not testified. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">{\u00b6 8} Initially, we note that though Mother captioned her motion as a \u201cMotion to Terminate Shared Parenting Plan\u201d and Father, too, challenges the changes to their shared-parenting plan, the record reveals that the parties did not, in fact, ever enter into such a plan. Instead, the record reveals that Mother was named the custodial and residential parent in the parties\u2019 initial decree, while Father was awarded companionship time, though they agreed to allocate that time on a nearly equal basis. Though Mother and Father agreed between themselves to split -parenting time on a 50-50 basis, such an agreement does not translate into a shared-parenting plan under the law. See <em>Fisher v. Hasenjager, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 53, 2007-Ohio-5589, 876 N.E.2d 546, at \u00b6 22-25 (contrasting the situation where one parent is named the residential parent and legal custodian with circumstances where shared parenting is ordered and the decree either names both parents as the residential parent and legal custodian or is silent on that issue). See also id. at \u00b6 55 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting) (dissenting on other grounds, but noting that pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(A)(1), \u201c[t]he designation of one parent as the residential parent and legal custodian occurs only in cases where shared parenting is rejected\u201d). Rather, the parties\u2019 separation agreement set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>forth how they had agreed to allocate their parental rights and responsibilities, and notably, provided that \u201c[a]ll major decisions involving [their child would] be discussed and decided jointly.\u201d The designation of Mother as custodial parent remained intact following the parties\u2019 August 2009 trial on issues related to their parental rights and responsibilities, child support, and spousal support. Because the issue of schooling was one of the contested matters at the time, the trial court specifically reiterated that Mother was the residential parent for purposes of schooling in its November 2009 order as well. Thus, it is clear that when Mother filed her \u201cMotion to Terminate Shared Parenting Plan,\u201d there was not a shared-parenting plan in place. More importantly, it is clear that since the parties\u2019 divorce decree was entered, Mother has been the sole custodial and residential parent over the parties\u2019 daughter. It is further apparent from the content of Mother\u2019s motion that she sought only to modify the allocation of parental rights, namely the requirement that she consult with Father on parenting decisions related to their daughter, not her designation as the residential and custodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 9} In light of the foregoing clarifications, we next consider the trial court\u2019s decision in this matter. Trial courts have broad discretion in their allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. <em>Graves v. Graves, </em>9th Dist. No. 3242-M, 2002-Ohio-3740, 2002 WL 1626144, at \u00b6 31, citing <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846. Accordingly, this court will not overturn a trial court\u2019s decision in such matters unless we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion. An abuse of discretion implies that \u201c \u2018the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. A trial court abuses its discretion if its factual findings are not supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>Maxwell v. Maxwell, </em>9th Dist. No. 07CA0047, 2008-Ohio-1324, 2008 WL 754861, at \u00b6 6. A trial court errs as a matter of law, however, when it misapplies a statute. <em>Bentley v. Rojas, </em>9th Dist. No. 10CA009776, 2010-Ohio-6243, 2010 WL 5276998, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 10} Pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a), a trial court cannot modify an existing allocation of parenting rights and responsibilities \u201c[Ujnless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child, the child\u2019s residential parent, or either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.\u201d Also, \u201c \u2018before a modification can be made pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a), the trial court must make a threshold determination that a change in circumstances has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buttolph v. Buttolph, </em>9th Dist. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>09CA0003, 2009-Ohio-6909, 2009 WL 5150361, at \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Gunderman v. Gunderman, </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA0067-M, 2009-Ohio-3787, 2009 WL 2356811, \u00b6 9, and citing <em>Fisher, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 53, 2007-Ohio-5589, 876 N.E.2d 546, at syllabus. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the requisite change of circumstances \u201cmust be a change of substance, not a slight or inconsequential change.\u201d <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 11} As stated above, there is not a shared-parenting plan, and hence, no shared-parenting decree, involved in this case. Thus, the change in circumstance required by statute in order to modify the parties\u2019 allocation of parental rights must necessarily relate to a change in the circumstances of the child or of Mother, as she is the child\u2019s residential parent. See R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a). At the hearing, Mother and the child\u2019s treating psychologist testified. Additionally, Mother and Father both introduced e-mail communications exchanged between them at various points between the trial court\u2019s November 2009 journal entry and the filing of Mother\u2019s motion in January 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 12} Based on this evidence, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he parties have an extensive history of high conflict\u201d and that since the most recent hearing just two months prior to the filing of Mother\u2019s motion, they \u201chave continued their pattern of behavior resulting in nasty conflict.\u201d The court went on to note that the conflict between the parties \u201c[was] having a deleterious effect upon the child.\u201d The trial court pointed to e-mail communications admitted at the hearing in which Father was \u201cverbally abusive and cruel\u201d to Mother and concluded that \u201cco-parenting between the parties [is] untenable.\u201d The court further concluded, based on the testimony of the child\u2019s psychologist, that the child is \u201ctoo aware of the parents\u2019 continuing conflict and that the conflict is detrimental to the child.\u201d The trial court did not, however, ever conclude that any of the testimony or exhibits adduced at the hearing, demonstrating the continuing discord between the parties, constituted a change in the circumstances of the child or Mother, the child\u2019s residential parent. See id. See also <em>Buttolph, </em>2009-Ohio-6909, 2009 WL 5150361, at \u00b6 12 (reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to modify a shared-parenting plan where \u201cneither the magistrate nor the trial judge made the requisite finding in either entry that there was a change of circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 13} To the extent that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the parties\u2019 continued hostility toward one another was having a \u201cdeleterious effect\u201d on their child could be considered a finding that there had been a change in the circumstances of the child, the evidence adduced at the hearing does not support that conclusion. Instead, the child\u2019s treating psychologist agreed with Father that he has improved in his willingness to work with Mother on parenting issues and that his email communications with Mother are \u201c[generally * * * appropriate.\u201d She further noted that the messages from Father that were \u201c[o]ccasionally * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>more inflammatory\u201d have decreased over time and that \u201ceventually it appears that [Mother and Father] do get to a solution with each other.\u201d The psychologist testified that the child is \u201caware that there[ is] a level of tension between her parents, but * * * that she is, in general, less preoccupied with it.\u201d The psychologist concluded, \u201cIn general, there have not been any major conflicts between [the child\u2019s] parents that have had an impact on [the child\u2019s] emotional status\u201d and that her condition since November 2009 \u201chas improved.\u201d To the extent that the trial court relied upon the psychologist\u2019s testimony to conclude that the child was \u201ctoo aware of the parents\u2019 continuing conflict,\u201d the transcript reveals that the psychologist made such a statement, but when further questioned on that point, stated she was \u201c[n]ot particularly\u201d aware of who provides the child with such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 14} The record is devoid of any testimony that Mother has experienced a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant a modification to the parties\u2019 allocation of parental rights. The bulk of Mother\u2019s testimony surrounded her difficulties in working with Father around vacation times and medical appointments. Her testimony centered little on what, if any, change in circumstances, had occurred with either her or the child in the two months since the parties had last modified their allocation of parental rights. Instead, Mother\u2019s testimony supports a finding quite the opposite of the statutory requirement of R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a) \u2014 that the circumstances of the parties have remained disharmonious.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 15} While this court neither condones nor endorses the manner in which Father has conducted himself with Mother in the course of their e-mail communications, we cannot conclude based on the evidence contained in the record that there has been a substantial change in the circumstances of the child or Mother since the court last addressed this issue in November 2009. <em>Davis, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159. The framework of R.C. 3109.04 is designed to prevent precisely what Mother is attempting to accomplish through her motion, as the statute requires that a party demonstrate that there has been a significant change in circumstances in order to modify the allocation of parental rights set forth under the terms of a decree. <em>Fisher, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 53, 2007-Ohio-5589, 876 N.E.2d 546, at \u00b6 32-34. See also <em>Davis, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 16} To the extent that the trial court failed to make the requisite finding that there was a change in circumstances pursuant to R.C. 3109.04, it erred as a matter of law in proceeding to modify the parties\u2019 allocation of parental rights. To the extent that the trial court intended its finding related to the daughter to demonstrate a change in circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in doing so, as that finding is not supported by the evidence adduced at trial. Accordingly, Father\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Assignment of Error Number Two</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The trial court erred as a matter of law and violated father\u2019s fundamental constitutional parental right to educate the parties\u2019 child in father\u2019s religious values by granting mother \u201ccomplete authority\u201d to determine the child\u2019s \u201creligious training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Assignment of Error Number Three</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The trial court erred as a matter of law and violated father\u2019s fundamental constitutional parental right to visitation with the parties\u2019 child by entering its order that father may be subjected to a \u201cdiminution of his parenting time\u201d as a penalty for father\u2019s \u201cinterference with the parenting time of the parties\u2019 daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 17} In light of our disposition of Father\u2019s first assignment of error, we decline to address his second and third assignments of error, as they are moot. App.R. (12)(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 18} Father\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. His remaining assignments of error are moot. The judgment of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-12\">Carr, P.J., and Dickinson, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b376-13\">Dickinson, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AeM\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">{\u00b6 19} I concur in the majority\u2019s judgment and most of its opinion. I do not, however, concur in the statement in paragraph 16 that \u201c[t]o the extent that the trial court intended its finding related to the daughter to demonstrate a change in circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in doing so, as that finding is not supported by the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d This court reviews whether a finding is supported by sufficient evidence de novo. See, e.g., <em>State v. Mima, </em>9th Dist. No. 25540, 2011-Ohio-3798, 2011 WL 3300684, at \u00b6 11. If it is not supported by sufficient evidence, it must be reversed. A trial court does not have discretion to make a finding that is not supported by sufficient evidence, and to say that the trial court abused its discretion in doing so is to confuse two very different standards of review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
