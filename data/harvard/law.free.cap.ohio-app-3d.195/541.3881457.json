Heller, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, granting a divorce to him and plaintiff-appellee, Susan M. Heller, and awarding her spousal support in the amount of $18,000 per month, plus the cost of health-insurance coverage. Because the trial court either erred in awarding spousal support contrary to the prior appellate decisions in this case, or abused its discretion in the amount of spousal support awarded, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff and defendant were married on June 29, 1974. On September 27, 2004, plaintiff initiated this action for divorce; defendant responded with a counterclaim for divorce on October 28, 2004. Two children, born as issue of the marriage, were emancipated at the time the divorce proceedings were begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant holds a 39.5 percent interest in a Subchapter S corporation, H &amp; S Forest Products, Inc., works for the corporation, and draws a salary from it. <em>Heller v. Heller, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-871, 2008-Ohio-3296, 2008 WL 2588064, \u00b6 2 <em>(\u201cHeller I </em>\u201d). Among the issues presented in the divorce proceedings were the value of defendant\u2019s interest in H <em>&amp; </em>S, the manner of distributing defendant\u2019s interest, a marital asset, between the parties, and the amount of spousal support. <em>Heller I </em>at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 4} At trial, each party presented an expert to testify regarding the value of defendant\u2019s ownership interest in H &amp; S. Id. at \u00b6 10. According to the September 24, 2007 judgment entry/decree of divorce, \u201cBoth experts concurred that the capitalization of earnings model was the most appropriate method to determine the fair market value of this particular company.\u201d The capitalization-of-earnings method \u201c \u2018relies on the discounted cash flow (DCF) model\u2019 \u201d under which \u201c \u2018[e]arnings projections, extrapolated from the company\u2019s accounting statements, are discounted using a capitalization rate (or multiplier) that takes into account the buyer\u2019s required risk-based rate of return and a factor for future growth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heller I </em>at \u00b6 16, quoting 5 Law &amp; Valuation, Financial Valuation in Legal Contexts, section 5.2.1, found at http://www.wfu.edu/palmitar/Law&amp; Valuation/chapter% 205/5-2-l.htm (last visited June 25, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 5} Using that method to ascertain H &amp; S\u2019s current value, defendant\u2019s expert analyzed past earnings data to determine earnings projections. He then added the owners\u2019 return on investment, or dividends, to obtain the \u201c\u2018normalized income,\u2019 which is what a prospective buyer [could] expect as a return on his investment, but left out (or deducted) the amount paid to defendant and the other shareholders that is compensation related to their own day-to-day labor.\u201d Id., 2008-Ohio-3296, 2008 WL 2588064, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 6} The expert explained that shareholders\u2019 compensation must be deducted \u201cbecause a potential investor would have to pay these salaries, so they are not counted as part of the \u2018normalized income\u2019 or the return on the buyer\u2019s investment.\u201d Id. Defendant\u2019s expert thus reduced defendant\u2019s income to $300,000, with the remaining approximately $700,000 balance of the annual cash flow to defendant being characterized as ownership interest. See Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 35, page 17 (reflecting in defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s report that he deducted defendant\u2019s salary to determine the normalized earnings of the business and that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>deduction was based on the 2006/2007 Executive Compensation Report, published by Compdata Surveys\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">{\u00b6 7} In its September 24, 2007 judgment entry, the trial court adopted the conclusion <em>of </em>defendant\u2019s expert that as of December 31, 2005, defendant\u2019s interest in H &amp; S was valued at $700,018, and the court awarded all of defendant\u2019s shares in H &amp; S to defendant. To achieve an equal division of marital property, the court awarded plaintiff other marital assets valued at $350,000. <em>Heller I, </em>2008-Ohio-3296, 2008 WL 2588064, \u00b6 10. The trial court further noted that the only portion of defendant\u2019s income that was not the result of defendant\u2019s ownership interest in H &amp; S was the $300,000 that the expert had assigned as defendant\u2019s annual income. Based on that number, the court determined that an indefinite spousal-support award of $8,000 per month was reasonable and appropriate. As additional spousal support, the court ordered defendant to pay plaintiff the cost of plaintiffs monthly health-insurance coverage, as well as 20 percent of each payment of additional gross, or pre-tax, income H &amp; S paid to defendant, payments that the parties characterized in the trial as \u201cbonus\u201d income. The court retained jurisdiction to modify spousal support both as to term and amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 8} Defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s decree, asserting that the court had impermissibly \u201cdouble dipped\u201d when it twice distributed his interest in H &amp; S\u2019s future profits, once as a marital asset and again as part of an award of spousal support. In addressing the assigned error, <em>Heller I </em>stated, \u201c[T]he evidence clearly indicates that the value assigned to defendant\u2019s interest in H &amp; S did not include defendant\u2019s compensation for his daily labor, but did include his share of all of H &amp; S\u2019s future excess earnings.\u201d Id., 2008-Ohio-3296, 2008 WL 2588064, at \u00b6 22. Noting that R.C. 3105.171(C)(3) and 3105.18(A) required the trial court \u201cto keep marital property division and spousal support separate,\u201d <em>Heller I </em>stated that \u201c[t]rial courts may treat a spouse\u2019s future business profits either as a marital asset subject to division, or as a stream of income for spousal support purposes, but not both.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21, 23. <em>Heller I </em>accordingly determined that the trial court had improperly \u201cdouble dipped\u201d and abused its discretion when it both included defendant\u2019s interest in the future profits of H <em>&amp; </em>S as a marital asset and also awarded plaintiff 20 percent of those dividends as spousal support, thus \u201cdrawing twice from the same well.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15,19.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 9} Indeed, the trial court so read <em>Heller I, </em>as. on remand the trial court stated that its \u201cfirst blush\u201d interpretation upon reading <em>Heller I </em>was that <em>\u201cnone </em>of defendant\u2019s income from H &amp; S above the normalized earnings (i.e., above $300,000 in this case) [could] be considered in setting the award of spousal support.\u201d In reconsidering the matter, the trial court issued a judgment on March 9, 2010, in which it \u201cdeclinefd] the opportunity to revisit its property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>division in the initial decree.\u201d After reviewing articles and case law that discussed the \u201cdouble dip\u201d issue, the trial court determined that its original spousal-support award complied with the statutory mandates of both R.C. 3105.171 and 3105.18, so the property division and spousal-support award were fair, equitable, and consistent with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 10} Defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s March 9, 2010 judgment, asserting that the trial court erred in failing to implement this court\u2019s decision in <em>Heller I. Heller v. Heller, </em>10th Dist. No. 10AP-312, 2010-Ohio-6124, 2010 WL 5141713, \u00b6 7 <em>(\u201cHeller II </em>\u201d). <em>Heller II </em>notes that <em>Heller I </em>\u201cinstructed the trial court to revise the award so that it did not contain a \u2018double dip,\u2019 and it was incumbent upon the trial court to do so.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9. Because the trial court again awarded plaintiff spousal support by means of the \u201cdouble dip,\u201d <em>Heller II </em>sustained defendant\u2019s assignment of error, reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the matter to the trial court. Id. at \u00b6 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 11} On December 22, 2010, the court issued a judgment in response to <em>Heller II, </em>adopting the award of marital property from its prior decisions. The court, however, ordered that \u201c[c]ommeneing October 1, 2007, defendant shall pay spousal support to plaintiff in the amount of $18,000 per month as an indefinite award of spousal support.\u201d The court retained jurisdiction to modify the award and also stated that as additional spousal support, defendant would pay the cost of plaintiffs health-insurance coverage. At the time of trial, defendant estimated the monthly cost of plaintiffs health insurance to be $783.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 12} Defendant appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">The trial court erred and abused its discretion as a matter of law by failing to abide by the Tenth District Court of Appeal\u2019s decisions rendered June 30, 2008 and December 14, 2010 reversing and remanding the trial court\u2019s September 24, 2007 and March 9, 2010 decrees of divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-12\">The trial court abused its discretion by awarding the appellee $18,000 a month in spousal support as it is not reasonable or appropriate and is punitive in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">The trial court abused its discretion by making its spousal support award retroactive to September 24, 2007 creating arrearages in excess of $400,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>III. First and Second Assignments of Error \u2014 Spousal Support</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 13} Defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error assert that the trial court ignored <em>Heller I </em>and <em>Heller II </em>and, contrary to those opinions, again \u201cdouble dipped\u201d by dividing defendant\u2019s interest in H <em>&amp; </em>S as a marital asset and considering that same stream of income in awarding plaintiff $18,000 per month as spousal support. Defendant alternatively asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in establishing the amount of spousal support that defendant is to pay plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">A. <em>\u201cDouble Dip\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 14} Although the trial court\u2019s most recent decision of December 22, 2010, eliminated the portion of its prior spousal-support award that provided plaintiff with 20 percent of defendant\u2019s interest in H <em>&amp; </em>S\u2019s future profits, it increased the flat monthly amount of spousal support from $8,000 to $18,000. Defendant asserts not only that the \u201cmost recent Decree is merely form over substance\u201d but that the court necessarily considered defendant\u2019s ownership interest in H <em>&amp; </em>S in increasing spousal support to $18,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 15} Because the trial court\u2019s most recent decision again divided defendant\u2019s interest in H <em>&amp; </em>S as a marital asset, the trial court, in order to comply with <em>Heller I </em>and <em>II </em>and avoid the \u201cdouble dip,\u201d could consider only defendant\u2019s annual income of $300,000 in setting the amount of spousal support. Despite defendant\u2019s assertion, nothing in the court\u2019s December 22, 2010 decision states that the court considered defendant\u2019s bonus income in awarding plaintiff spousal support. To the contrary, by eliminating the portion of its prior award specifically tied to defendant\u2019s bonus income, the court appears to have attempted to comply with our decisions in <em>Heller I </em>and <em>II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 16} Defendant responds that the trial court necessarily considered defendant\u2019s interest in H &amp; S\u2019s future profits in awarding spousal support of $18,000 per month because the order to pay $216,000 per year in spousal support otherwise clearly constitutes an abuse of discretion. \u201cWhen we are presented with alternate interpretations of a tribunal\u2019s decision, only one of which delivers internal consistency, we are compelled to construe the decision in a manner that achieves consistency.\u201d <em>Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. v. Price, </em>10th Dist. No. 10AP-260, 2010-Ohio-5629, 2010 WL 4683571, \u00b6 17, citing <em>Macklin v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr., </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-293, 2002-Ohio-5069, 2002 WL 31122718, \u00b6 20 (stating \u201c \u2018[i]f the evidence is susceptible of more than one construction, the reviewing court is bound to give it that interpretation which is consistent with the verdict and judgment\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Estate of Barbieri v. Evans </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 711 N.E.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Although nothing in the trial court\u2019s decision indicates what it considered in awarding plaintiff $18,000 per month in spousal support, two alternate interpretations are possible. The first, urged by defendant, requires that we find that the trial court violated the law-of-the-case doctrine by again considering defendant\u2019s bonus income from his ownership interest in H &amp; S when it set the amount of spousal support. See <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410 (stating that the law-of-the-case doctrine \u201cprovides that the decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels\u201d). The second interpretation suggests that the trial court followed our prior decisions and did not consider defendant\u2019s bonus income. Because the trial court did not indicate what portion of defendant\u2019s income it relied upon in setting defendant\u2019s spousal-support obligation at $18,000 per month, the trial court\u2019s decision arguably is consistent with our decisions in <em>Heller I </em>and <em>II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 18} If the trial court\u2019s judgment reflects an attempt to comply with <em>Heller I </em>and <em>II, </em>then the issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding spousal support in the amount of $18,000 per month, plus the cost of plaintiffs health insurance, in view of defendant\u2019s $300,000 income.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">B. <em>Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018[S]pousal support\u2019 means any payment or payments to be made to a spouse or former spouse, or to a third party for the benefit of a spouse or a former spouse, that is both for sustenance and for support.\u201d R.C. 3105.18(A). A trial court may award \u201creasonable spousal support to either party\u201d in a divorce proceeding. R.C. 3105.18(B). A trial court has broad discretion to determine the proper amount of spousal support based on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Kunkle v. Kunkle </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 64, 67, 554 N.E.2d 83. A reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trial court absent an abuse of discretion. Id. See <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (defining \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 3105.18(C)(1) governs the trial court\u2019s discretion and requires the trial court to consider certain enumerated factors in determining not only whether spousal support is appropriate and reasonable, but also the nature, amount, terms of payment, and duration of such an award. The factors are many, but at issue here is the income of the parties, from all sources, including, but not limited to, income derived from property divided, disbursed, or distributed under R.C. 3105.171. R.C. 3105.18(C). The trial court is not required to comment on each statutory factor; rather, the record need show only that the court considered them in making its award. <em>McClung v. McClung, </em>10th Dist. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>03AP-156, 2004-Ohio-240, 2004 WL 98621, \u00b6 21. The trial court analyzed the R.C. 3105.18(C) factors in its original September 24, 2007 judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 21} Significant to the present appeal, the court determined that \u201cdefendant\u2019s earning capacity solely from employment is $300,000.00 annually, the \u2018normalized\u2019 income assigned by both accountants,\u201d meaning defendant\u2019s \u201cadditional income over and above this earning capacity [is] due to his ownership interest in the company, as reflected in his W-2 income.\u201d As important to this appeal is the principle that an award of spousal support must not exceed an amount that is reasonable. <em>Kunkle, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 64, 554 N.E.2d 83, at paragraph three of the syllabus. Although R.C. 3105.18 provides the trial court with broad discretion in establishing spousal support, \u201cthis statutory scheme does not allow a court to fine, penalize or reward either party at the time of the divorce decree.\u201d <em>Simoni v. Simoni </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 628, 637, 657 N.E.2d 800, appeal not allowed, 73 Ohio St.3d 1453, 654 N.E.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 22} Plaintiff contends that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the trial court was not restricted to considering only defendant\u2019s $300,000 annual income, but pursuant to R.C. 3105.18, was required to consider all sources of income when determining spousal support, so that defendant\u2019s income included his base salary from employment of $300,000 and any bonus or shareholder distributions as reflected in defendant\u2019s W-2 statements. Contrary to plaintiffs contentions, the trial court, pursuant to <em>Heller I </em>and <em>II, </em>could not both distribute defendant\u2019s ownership interest in H <em>&amp; </em>S as a marital asset and at the same time consider defendant\u2019s earnings \u201cbonus\u201d income in determining the amount of spousal support. <em>Heller I, </em>2008-Ohio-3296, 2008 WL 2588064, at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 23} The issue, then, reduces to whether defendant\u2019s $300,000 income reasonably supports the trial court\u2019s order. Under the trial court\u2019s most recent spousal-support order, defendant\u2019s yearly spousal-support obligation is $225,396, or a monthly obligation of $18,783 composed of the $18,000 award and the monthly healthcare cost of $783. The yearly obligation is 75 percent of defendant\u2019s annual income. R.C. 3105.18 does not require a court, in awarding spousal support, to provide the parties with an equal standard of living. <em>Kaechele v. Kaechele </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 518 N.E.2d 1197. Nor does any statute \u201cprevent[ ] a court from ordering a spousal support in an amount that is in excess of 50 percent of a person\u2019s earnings.\u201d <em>Zollar v. Zollar, </em>12th Dist. No. CA200803-065, 2009-Ohio-1008, 2009 WL 580798, \u00b6 40, citing <em>Cramblett v. Cramblett, </em>7th Dist. No. 05 HA 581, 2006-Ohio-4615, 2006 WL 2574561, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 24} Even so, in <em>Farnsworth v. Farnsworth, </em>9th Dist. No. 02CA0074-M, 2003-Ohio-2341, 2003 WL 21040707, where the wife was capable of developing meaningful employment outside the home, the court found troubling an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>spousal support, effective until either party died or the wife remarried, that represented 53 percent of the husband\u2019s yearly gross income \u201cand, therefore, an even higher percentage of his actual income after taxes.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8, 13. See also <em>Stone v. Stone, 2d </em>Dist. No. 2003-CA-34, 2004-Ohio-671, 2004 WL 260286, \u00b6 32-34 (determining that the trial court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of spousal support when the defendant\u2019s court-ordered obligations consumed 86 percent of the defendant\u2019s monthly gross income). Cf. <em>Hamilton v. Hamilton, </em>5th Dist. No. 2008 CA 00256, 2009-Ohio-4321, 2009 WL 2602212 (concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the wife spousal support that amounted to 68 percent of the husband\u2019s disposable income, when the wife earned $17,000 per year and lived in the marital home but paid $700 per month towards the mortgage).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 25} Here, plaintiff agreed with the vocational expert\u2019s finding that she was readily employable at a salary range of $20,000 to $22,000, noting specific employment possibilities ranging from $24,000 to $32,780. Assuming that plaintiff were employed making $20,000 per year, she would have income, including her spousal support, of $245,396 annually, while defendant, due to the spousal-support obligation, would have income of $74,604 annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 26} Given those facts, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding plaintiff indefinite spousal support of $18,000 per month plus the cost of health-insurance coverage, or 75 percent of defendant\u2019s yearly income. <em>Hesseling v. Hesseling, </em>4th Dist. No. 08CA3034, 2009-Ohio-3116, 2009 WL 1830787, \u00b6 25-26, 28 (concluding that spousal-support order was unreasonable when a husband\u2019s court-ordered payments, including child support, spousal support and mortgage obligation, consumed 76 percent of the husband\u2019s monthly gross, or pre-tax, income). Although the court awarded plaintiff the marital home and certain real estate in Florida, both with mortgages, the properties\u2019 values far outweighed the mortgage attached to each property. Moreover, the court awarded plaintiff income-producing assets, including the Florida rental property and 50 percent of the H &amp; S notes receivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 27} As a result, if the trial court\u2019s award did not violate <em>Heller I </em>and <em>Heller II, </em>then the award is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 28} Typically, under circumstances such as these, we would remand the case to the trial court to allow the court to amend its award and set forth the basis for its decision. See <em>Zeefe v. Zeefe </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 600, 607, 709 N.E.2d 208, quoting <em>Herman v. Herman </em>(Mar. 28, 1997), 11th Dist. No. 96-P-0194, 1997 WL 158106, quoting <em>Schneider v. Schneider </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 164, 168, 572 N.E.2d 221 (stating, \u201c[I]t would be improper for this court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>perform the intermediate analytical steps which the trial court neglected to recite[,] [since] \u2018 \u201c[t]he better approach is to remand this case in order that the trial court may comply with the mandates of the <em>Kaechele </em>case by setting forth the basis for its decision.\u201d \u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 29} This case, however, twice was remanded to the trial court solely on the issue of spousal support. \u201cWhen the court of appeals determines that the trial court committed error prejudicial to the appellant and that the appellant is entitled to have judgment or final order rendered in his favor as a matter of law,\u201d the court of appeals, rather than remanding the case to the trial court, may \u201creverse the judgment or final order of the trial court and render the judgment or final order that the trial court should have rendered.\u201d App.R. 12(B). See <em>Lewposky v. Lewposky, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 CO 10, 2010-Ohio-1544, 2010 WL 1328666, \u00b6 54-56 (invoking App.R. 12(B) to modify a spousal-support award when the court twice before remanded the case but the trial court did not follow the court\u2019s orders upon remand). Likewise, here, we enter judgment pursuant to App.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 30} In its March 9, 2010 judgment, the trial court stated that the purpose of the 20 percent award from defendant\u2019s future business income \u201cwas to account for the unpredictable nature of defendant\u2019s income from the company in excess of his salary,\u201d but the \u201cbase award of $8,000 monthly plus health insurance was set upon [defendant\u2019s] salaried base income, approximately $300,000.\u201d Because the basis for the spousal-support award cannot include the bonus income in excess of defendant\u2019s salary, we reverse the trial court\u2019s December 22, 2010 decision and judgment entry and enter judgment to reflect, consistent with the trial court\u2019s base award of March 9, 2010, a monthly spousal-support obligation of $8,000 plus the cost of plaintiffs health-insurance coverage. We remand the matter to the trial court to determine whether any arrearage exists and, if so, to establish a payment schedule to eliminate the arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 31} Having sustained defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, rendering moot his third assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, enter judgment of a monthly spousal-support obligation of $8,000 plus the cost of plaintiffs health-insurance coverage, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision concerning any arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Judgment reversed, judgment entered, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-8\">Klatt, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b584-9\">Tyack, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Tyack, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ATQ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 32} I do not believe that the trial court disregarded our earlier decisions in this case. As a result, I would overrule all the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 33} I would trust the trial court to follow our mandate again this time. A prior panel of this court decided that the trial court was incorrect to award both the $8,000 per month amount of spousal support and 20 percent of the extra funds John A. Heller has routinely drawn from the Subchapter S corporation. These extra funds have routinely resulted in cash flow that dwarfs his base salary of $300,000. As noted in the majority opinion, in the year of the divorce proceeding, these extra funds totaled approximately $700,000. For that year, as an example, spousal support would have been $96,000 plus $140,000, or $236,000. The $96,000 constituted between 40 and 41 percent of the total order of spousal support and the total award would have been 23.6 percent of the money John received.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 34} The panel of this appellate court in <em>Heller v. Heller, </em>10th Dist. No. 10AP-312, 2010-Ohio-6124, 2010 WL 5141713 <em>(\u201cHeller II </em>\u201d), gave little guidance to the trial court, saying little more than \u201cdo what we told you to do\u201d in <em>Heller v. Heller, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-871, 2008-Ohio-3296, 2008 WL 2588064 <em>(\u201cHeller I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 35} The trial judge, affected by the fact that John A. Heller was drawing a profit of approximately $1 million per year from the Subchapter S corporation, awarded 21.67 percent of that amount as spousal support, subject to modification upon a substantial change of circumstances, such as the Subchapter S corporation having a bad financial year. Given the rulings of <em>Heller I </em>and <em>Heller II, </em>I believe the judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 36} The order of the majority of this panel means that after a very long-term marriage, Susan Heller gets an award of spousal support of less than ten percent of the cash flow John A. Heller received from the corporation the year the divorce case was tried. I simply disagree with the majority decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 37} I personally do not see the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support as an abuse of discretion, given the limitations placed upon it by the earlier decisions of this court. I would overrule all three assignments of error. Even if I were to agree as to the third assignment of error, I would not enter judgment for a spousal support order of approximately ten percent of the cash flow received by the husband after a long-term marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 38} Again, I would overrule all assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
