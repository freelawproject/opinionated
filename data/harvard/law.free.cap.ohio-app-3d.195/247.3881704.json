McCune, appeals from the judgment of the Coshocton Municipal Court finding him guilty of gross overload in violation of R.C. 5577.04. Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant\u2019s tractor-trailer was stopped on August 31, 2009, by Trooper D.L. Mclnerney. Mclnerney indicated that the trailer on the truck appeared to be squatting as if the load was too heavy. Appellant was hauling wood chips. The trailer was weighed and it was discovered that the trailer was 1,200 pounds over limit of the maximum weight of 80,000 pounds for this particular trailer. Appellant was subsequently charged with a violation of R.C. 5577.04, gross overload.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant pleaded not guilty, and the matter was scheduled for trial on October 7, 2009. Evidence was presented. Appellant raised the defense found in R.C. 5577.042 permitting a weight variance of 7.5 percent above the maximum permissible weight for \u201ca log truck transporting timber.\u201d The parties requested leave to file briefs on the issues presented at trial. The court continued the matter until November 4, 2009, to allow time for briefs to be filed. On November 4, 2009, both appellant and appellee filed their briefs. On November 6, 2009, appellant filed a reply brief. On January 24, 2011, the trial court issued its decision, finding that wood chips were not timber. The court therefore found appellant guilty of gross overload in violation of R.C. 5577.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">{\u00b6 4} It is from the trial court\u2019s January 24, 2011 judgment entry finding appellant guilty of gross overload in violation of R.C. 5577.04 that appellant has timely appealed raising as his sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. The trial court erred as a matter of law to the prejudice of appellant by finding said appellant guilty of violating O.R.C. \u00a7 5577.04(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">{\u00b6 6} The parties stipulated that the maximum weight for the trailer was 80,000 pounds. The parties have also stipulated that the trailer weighed 81,200 pounds. Appellant was hauling wood chips. Appellant argued that the wood chips were produced in the forest and loaded onto his truck. He therefore contends that woodchips are considered timber for purposes of the weight variance of 7.5 percent above the maximum permissible weight for \u201ca log truck transporting timber.\u201d If this exception applies, appellant argues, the trial court erred in finding him guilty of gross overload. While we are not unsympathetic to appellant\u2019s plight, we must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 7} At issue is former R.C. 5577.042, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(4) \u201cLog truck\u201d means a truck used in the transportation of timber from the site of its cutting when the truck is operated in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 H} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(B) Notwithstanding sections 5577.02 and 5577.04 of the Revised Code, a coal truck transporting coal, a farm truck or farm machinery transporting farm commodities, <em>a log truck transporting timber, </em>or a solid waste haul vehicle hauling solid waste, <em>from the place of production to the first point of delivery where the commodities are weighed and title to the commodities, coal, or timber is transferred, </em>or, in the case of solid waste, from the place of production to the first point of delivery where the solid waste is disposed of or title to the solid waste is transferred, <em>may exceed by no more than seven and one-half per cent the weight provisions of sections 5577.01 to 5577.09 of the Revised Code and no penalty prescribed in section 5577.99 of the Revised Code shall be imposed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Sub.H.B. No. 230, 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4374, 4586.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, this court must decide whether wood chips are timber. The term \u201ctimber\u201d is not defined in the Ohio Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">{\u00b6 14} The primary goal of the judiciary in interpreting or constructing a statute is to give effect to the intention of the legislature through application of well-settled rules of construction or interpretation. <em>Henry v. Cent. Natl. Bank </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 16, 20, 45 O.O.2d 262, 242 N.E.2d 342. It is a cardinal rule that a court must first look to the language itself to determine the legislative intent. <em>Provident Bank v. Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 101, 105, 65 O.O.2d 296, 304 N.E.2d 378. If that inquiry reveals that the statute conveys a meaning that is clear, unequivocal, and definite, then the interpretive effort is at an end and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>statute must be applied accordingly. Id. at 105-106. In determining legislative intent, it is the duty of the court to give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used. <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 49 O.O.2d 445, 254 N.E.2d 8. See also <em>In re McClanahan, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2004AP010004, 2004-Ohio-4113, 2004 WL 1758408, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 1.42 states: \u201cWords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 16} Generally, the word \u201ctimber\u201d \u201cis used to designate wood suitable for building or trees that have been cut into lumber suitable for construction uses, or it may refer to trees generally; timber is usually distinguishable from saplings and undergrowth as well as trees not suitable as a building material such as trees suitable only for firewood or decoration.\u201d 66 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Logs and Timber, Section 1. See also http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 17} The terms \u201clog\u201d and \u201clogs\u201d refer to the section or sections of a tree that have been cut or sawed from the trunk after severance from the stump. Id. \u201cLumber\u201d is the product manufactured from logs. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 18} We note that other states have amended statutes to include the hauling of wood chips within the gross-weight exemptions afforded to the hauling of timber. See Ark.Code Ann. 27-14-601(a)(3)(H)(i)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; Ind.Code Ann. 9-20-4-2(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. Title 17, 3853-D(2)(A-2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; Tenn.Code Ann. 55-4-113(a)(3)(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, no such revision has been made to R.C. 5577.042.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The language of R.C. 5577.042 is clear and unambiguous on its face and needs no interpretation. Had the General Assembly intended to include wood chips within the exception to the gross-weight requirements applicable to log trucks hauling timber it could have easily done so by including the words in the statute. To find otherwise would require this court to rewrite R.C. 5577.042 to insert the words \u201cwood chips\u201d into subsection (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, the court concludes that the Ohio General Assembly did not intend to include a log truck transporting wood chips within the exception to the gross-weight requirements applicable to log trucks hauling timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 22} The judgment of the Coshocton Municipal Court, Coshocton County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-8\">Wise and Delaney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">. Ark.Code Ann. 27 \u2014 14\u2014601 (a)(3)(H)(i) states: \"Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision (a)(3)(H) or any other law to the contrary, persons in the timber harvesting or forestry industries who transport wood waste, wood chips, or wood dust from a mill or a temporary location may transport the wood waste, wood chips, or wood dust from the mill or the temporary location to a destination for further processing under this special classification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">.
