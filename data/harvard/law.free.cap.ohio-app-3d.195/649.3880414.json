Santiago appeals from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">{\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of December 6, 2009, Santiago was stopped in Troy after an officer saw him driving left of center. Based on his interaction with the police officer, Jeff Kunkleman, Santiago was asked to perform field sobriety tests, all of which he failed. He then submitted to a breath test, which showed a blood alcohol level of .147. He was arrested for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">{\u00b6 3} After placing Santiago in the cruiser, Kunkleman inventoried Santiago\u2019s car before having it towed. Kunkleman opened Santiago\u2019s glove box using keys that Santiago had thrown on the dash, and he found crack cocaine inside.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After he was informed of his rights, Santiago was interviewed by Kunkleman and stated that the crack was his and that he \u201chad gotten the crack * * * to try to make a little extra money for the holidays.\u201d Santiago denied that he used crack or regularly sold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">{\u00b6 4} Santiago was indicted for trafficking in drugs, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) and 2925.03(C)(4)(e), and he pleaded not guilty. He filed a motion to suppress all evidence against him on the grounds that his detention and arrest had been illegal. After conducting a hearing, the trial court overruled his motion to suppress. Santiago then changed his plea to no contest and was found guilty. One day after entering his plea, however, he contacted his attorney about withdrawing his plea. When this matter was raised with the court at the sentencing hearing several weeks later, the court refused to allow Santiago to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>withdraw his plea, concluding that he had \u201csimply had a change of heart and [was] attempting to delay the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">{\u00b6 5} Santiago was sentenced to three years in prison, his operator\u2019s license was suspended, and he was ordered to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 6} Santiago appeals from his conviction, raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 7} Santiago\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress when the officer lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct field sobriety testing and prolonged the stop beyond the time period necessary to investigate any suspicion of a minor traffic offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">{\u00b6 9} Santiago claims that Officer Kunkleman did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion of illegal activity justifying the length of his detention, although he seems to concede that his traffic violation justified the stop. In other words, he appears to argue that there was no reasonable, articulable suspicion justifying the field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[A] police officer in a marked cruiser may stop a vehicle for any traffic violation no matter how slight, for the purpose of issuing a citation for the violation.\u201d <em>State v. Spillers </em>(Mar. 24, 2000), Darke App. No. 1504, 2000 WL 299550. Santiago does not dispute that he committed a traffic violation; he was properly stopped for the purpose of issuing a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">{\u00b6 11} However, the traffic violation did not necessarily give the officer the right to subject Santiago to the further intrusion represented by the administration of field sobriety tests; the officer had to have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Santiago was driving the vehicle while under the influence in order to justify the administration of field sobriety tests. Id.; <em>State v. Hido, </em>Clark App. No. 10 CA 46, 2011-Ohio-2560, 2011 WL 2084160, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">{\u00b6 12} In the cases upon which Santiago relies, we have held that an odor of alcohol, coupled with a de minimis traffic violation, glassy or bloodshot eyes, and an admission to having consumed one or two beers, was insufficient to create a reasonable, articulable suspicion of driving under the influence and therefore to justify further detention in order to conduct field sobriety tests. <em>Spillers, </em>2000 WL 299550; <em>State v. Dixon </em>(Dec. 1, 2000), Greene App. No. 2000-CA-80, 2000 WL 1760664. See also <em>State v. Swartz, </em>Miami App. No. 2008CA31, 2009-Ohio-902, 2009 WL 498971. This court has held, however, that a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage, without other significant indicia of intoxication, may be sufficient to provide an officer with reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence. See <em>State v. Marshall </em>(Dec. 28, 2001), Clark App. No. 2001CA35, 2001 WL 1658096 (holding that a strong odor of alcohol, coupled with high speed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>red eyes, created a reasonable suspicion justifying field sobriety tests); <em>State v. Schott </em>(May 16, 1997), Darke App. No. 1415, 1997 WL 254141 (holding that a strong odor of alcohol alone can create a reasonable, articulable suspicion of intoxication adequate to require an individual to submit to field sobriety tests).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 13} Whether an officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to administer field sobriety tests is a \u201cvery fact-intensive\u201d determination. <em>State v. Wells, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20798, 2005-Ohio-5008, 2005 WL 2327125, \u00b6 9. We determine the existence of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity by evaluating the totality of the circumstances, considering those circumstances \u201cthrough the eyes of the reasonable and prudent police officer on the scene who must react to events as they unfold.\u201d <em>State v. Heard, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19323, 2003-Ohio-1047, 2003 WL 860692, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 87-88, 565 N.E.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 14} At the suppression hearing, Officer Kunkleman testified that he observed Santiago \u201cdriving left of center, driving down the middle of the roadway\u201d in the early morning hours of December 6, 2009; there were two passengers in the car. Kunkleman followed the car through several turns in a residential area, but did not observe any additional traffic violations. The car pulled over twice, but no one got out, a circumstance that Kunkleman found \u201csuspicious.\u201d When one person did get out of the car and walk between houses, Kunkleman decided to initiate contact with the driver (Santiago). Kunkleman testified that Santiago\u2019s eyes were \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cglassy\u201d and that an \u201codor of alcohol\u201d was coming from the vehicle. While Santiago was in the car, Kunkleman could not determine whether the odor was coming from Santiago or from his passenger. Santiago denied that he had been drinking, but Kunkleman observed a bottle of gin in the back seat; the bottle was half empty but capped, and the passenger claimed ownership of the bottle of gin. Santiago attempted to put his keys back in the ignition as if to start the car while talking with Kunkleman, and he argued with Kunkleman about getting out of the car, although he eventually did so. When Santiago stepped out of the vehicle at Kunkleman\u2019s request, Kunkleman determined that he (Kunkleman) could \u201csmell alcohol on, an alcoholic beverage on his breath now, or the odor of an alcoholic beverage\u201d on Santiago.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 15} The odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from Santiago\u2019s vehicle, the bottle of alcohol visible within the vehicle, Santiago\u2019s tired and glassy eyes, his traffic violation and suspicious behavior in pulling off the road two times, and his somewhat uncooperative attitude toward Officer Kunkleman justified further investigation. Moreover, when Santiago exited the vehicle, Kunkleman was able to determine that Santiago' \u2014 independent of the car or someone else in the car \u2014 smelled of an alcoholic beverage. Under the totality of the circumstances, Kunkleman had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Santiago was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>driving under the influence, which justified his further detention for field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">{\u00b6 16} Other courts have similarly held that certain traffic violations, coupled with glassy eyes, an odor of alcohol, and open or partially consumed alcohol inside a vehicle created a reasonable, articulable suspicion justifying further investigation. See <em>State v. Purtee, </em>Logan App. No. 8-04-10, 2006-Ohio-6337, 2006 WL 3477223; <em>Strongsville v. Minnillo, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80948, 2003-Ohio-162, 2003 WL 125128.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the results of the field sobriety tests or the breath test, the items found in the vehicle, or Santiago\u2019s subsequent statements to the police on the ground that his detention was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 18} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 19} Santiago\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress because the officer did not have probable cause to seize appellant after appellant initially refused to engage in field sobriety testing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 21} Santiago argues that he was seized by Officer Kunkleman before any field sobriety tests had been conducted, that Kunkleman did not yet have probable cause to arrest him at that point in their interaction, and thus that he was unlawfully detained for the field sobriety tests. Santiago\u2019s argument refers to the undisputed fact that Kunkleman \u201cwarned him\u201d and \u201ctold him [Santiago] to stop\u201d when Santiago attempted to place the key in the ignition of the car after being asked to exit from his ear for field sobriety tests. Santiago argues that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave after this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cAn arrest is a substantial intrusion upon the arrestee\u2019s protected liberty interests, and therefore requires the full measure of probable cause to satisfy the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A brief, investigative stop is far less intrusive, and requires a correspondingly smaller quantum of probable cause for its justification, described as reasonable and articulable suspicion. The administration of field sobriety tests is intermediate between these two in terms of the intrusion it represents upon the subject\u2019s protected liberty interest. See <em>State v. Smethurst </em>(Feb. 13, 1995), Clark App. No. 94-CA-24, 1995 WL 108956, and * * * <em>Spillers </em>[2000 WL 299550]. The imposition upon the subject\u2019s time is apt to be not much greater than the imposition represented by the typical investigative stop, but the indignity inflicted upon the subject\u2019s person, while far less than the indignity represented by an arrest, is greater than any indignity inflicted by the typical investigative stop.\u201d <em>State v. Kissinger, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23636, 2010-Ohio-2840, 2010 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>2499709, \u00b6 24. Nonetheless, an officer\u2019s decision to conduct field sobriety tests need only be justified by a reasonable, articulable suspicion. Id. at \u00b6 26. See also <em>Columbus v. Shepherd, </em>Franklin App. No. 10AP-483, 2011-Ohio-3302, 2011 WL 2586345, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Trevarthen, </em>Lake App. No. 2010-L-046, 2011-Ohio-1013, 2011 WL 776053, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 23} Santiago\u2019s argument that he was unlawfully detained because Officer Kunkleman seized him without probable cause before conducting the field sobriety tests is without merit. As we discussed under the first assignment of error, Kunkleman had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that justified further investigation, including the field sobriety tests; he did not need probable cause. The trial court did not err in overruling Santiago\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis that he had been \u201cseized\u201d without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 24} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 25} Santiago\u2019s third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error relate to his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b626} \u201cThe trial court erred in accepting appellant\u2019s change of plea when appellant indicated his dissatisfaction with the advice, counsel and competence of his appointed attorney and the trial court failed to make any inquiry into the reasons for appellant\u2019s dissatisfaction prior to accepting the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cAppellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his attorney refused to file a motion to withdraw appellant\u2019s plea prior to sentencing and his attorney failed to participate in the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">{\u00b6 29} Santiago contends that the trial court erred in accepting his plea of no contest without inquiring into his expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney. He also contends that the trial court erred in denying his presentence motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">{\u00b6 30} On September 20, 2010, the court held a hearing at which Santiago\u2019s attorney stated that Santiago wanted to enter a no-contest plea. After this representation was made, the court proceeded to question Santiago at some length, as required under Crim.R. 11. Santiago answered affirmatively when asked whether his no-contest plea was voluntary. After several more questions, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-13\">{\u00b6 31} The Court: \u201cHas your attorney or attorneys explained everything to you and answered all our [sic] questions for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-14\">{\u00b6 32} Santiago: \u201cYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The Court: \u201cSatisfied with their advice, counsel and competence in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 34} Santiago: \u201cNot, no, not really, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 35} The Court: \u201cNot really?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 36} Santiago: \u201cNo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 37} The Court: \u201cWell, you\u2019re making your plea voluntarily, though, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">{\u00b6 38} Santiago: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">{\u00b6 39} The court then moved on to discuss other issues without any further attempt to probe or understand Santiago\u2019s dissatisfaction with his representation. At the end of the hearing, the court accepted Santiago\u2019s no-contest plea and ordered a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">{\u00b6 40} When Santiago returned to court for sentencing several weeks later, his attorney, who was a different attorney from the same office, indicated to the court that Santiago had contacted his office on September 21 (the day after he pleaded no contest), indicating that he wanted to withdraw his plea. According to the attorney who was present at sentencing, the attorney who had represented Santiago in some of the earlier proceedings purportedly responded to Santiago\u2019s request to withdraw his plea by telling Santiago that \u201che [the attorney] thought that it was a good plea, it has been freely and voluntarily given, and it was * * * not his intention to file a Motion to Withdraw the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">{\u00b6 41} The court then inquired of Santiago why he wanted to withdraw his plea. In response, Santiago objected to the fact that he had been charged with trafficking \u201cwhen it was in one bag\u201d and he \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to sell it.\u201d The court responded that \u201cif you get up to a certain amount, it still comes under the trafficking section of the code.\u201d Santiago also pointed out that he had never signed the statement taken by the police officer, in which he purportedly admitted that he intended to sell the drugs. The court stated: \u201cAren\u2019t these matters you knew before you changed the plea? * * * [Hjow\u2019s this anything new, since the time you changed your plea?\u201d Santiago explained that he had been on the phone with someone before he came into court to enter his plea and had \u201cthought they told [him] to put in a no-contest plea,\u201d but he realized later in the day that he had misunderstood, and the person on the phone had intended for him to plead not guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">{\u00b6 42} The following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>{\u00b6 43} The Court: \u201cDon\u2019t you remember going, sitting here with me, and I asked you questions and asked if you understood what was going on, if you had any complaints about your attorneys, were satisfied with their advice, you were making your no contest plea voluntarily, explained the penalty to you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 44} Santiago: \u201cYeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 45} The Court: \u201cYeah. Well, why didn\u2019t you speak up then, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re claiming now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 46} Santiago: \u201cAll right. I didn\u2019t understand, really, like\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 47} The Court: \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of misunderstanding. I think it\u2019s a matter of change of heart. I think you changed your heart. So, you didn\u2019t want to go, change your plea, probably, just to try to delay matters. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 48} * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">{\u00b6 49} Santiago: \u201cI feel as though, I feel as though I\u2019m just taking it to trial, but, that\u2019s, that\u2019s what I want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">{\u00b6 50} The Court: \u201cAnd I\u2019m asking you that since the time you changed your plea, what factors have occurred which would, should result in my granting your request to withdraw your former plea? That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Since you changed your plea. Because I know what the change of plea form says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">{\u00b6 51} Santiago: \u201cAll right. I have not, I was doing a lot of reading and stuff too, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-13\">{\u00b6 52} The Court: \u201cDoing a lot of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">{\u00b6 53} Santiago: \u201cI was doing a lot of reading of the law and stuff like that, so you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">{\u00b6 54} The Court: \u201cReading. Yeah. Didn\u2019t you have a chance to do your reading, before you changed your plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-16\">{\u00b6 55} Santiago: \u201cYeah, I had, but I didn\u2019t then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-17\">{\u00b6 56} The Court: \u201cWell, that\u2019s your problem, not mine. There you go. * * * [0]n your oral request to withdraw your former plea of no contest, uh based on the factors that you have indicated to me here, Mr. Santiago, I will overrule those.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-18\">{\u00b6 57} A defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea, made before sentencing, should be freely and liberally granted, provided that the movant demonstrates a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal. <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 526, 584 N.E.2d 715. \u201cThere are numerous additional factors which should be weighed in considering a motion to set aside a plea * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>before sentencing, some of which are set out in <em>[State v.] Peterseim </em>[ (1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 211, 22 O.O.3d 341, 428 N.E.2d 863] as follows: (1) whether the accused is represented by highly competent counsel, (2) whether the accused was given a full Crim.R. 11 hearing before entering the plea, (3) whether a full hearing was held on the motion, and (4) whether the trial court gave full and fair consideration to the motion. We would also add: (5) whether the motion was made within a reasonable time, (6) whether the motion sets out specific reasons for the withdrawal, (7) whether the accused understood the nature of the charges and possible penalties, and (8) whether the accused was perhaps not guilty of or had a complete defense to the charge or charges. Obviously, the list is not exhaustive, and other factors will appear to trial and appellate courts depending upon the merits of each individual case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Fish </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 236, 240, 661 N.E.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 58} Although a motion to withdraw a plea should be freely and liberally granted, a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing. Id. A trial court must hold a hearing on the motion to determine whether a reasonable and legitimate basis exists for the withdrawal. Id. A trial court may satisfy the requirement for a full and fair hearing on a motion to withdraw a plea by allowing the defendant and his attorney to speak at a sentencing hearing and to explain the basis for the motion. <em>State v. Burnett, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20496, 2005-Ohio-1036, 2005 WL 567327, \u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 59} The decision whether to grant or deny a presentence request to withdraw a guilty plea is a matter resting within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Xie, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 526, 584 N.E.2d 715. Such decisions will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion by acting in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner. Id. A \u201cchange of heart\u201d is not sufficient justification to permit withdrawal of a guilty plea. Id., citing <em>State v. Lambros </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 102, 541 N.E.2d 632, and <em>State v. Flowers, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22751, 2009-Ohio-1945, 2009 WL 1114218, \u00b6 11-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 60} With these considerations in mind, we turn to Santiago\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. We are troubled in several respects by the handling of Santiago\u2019s plea and his request to withdraw that plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 61} First, during the hearing at which Santiago entered his no-contest plea, he expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney, yet the court did not explore the reason for or the nature of Santiago\u2019s dissatisfaction. The court simply responded by having Santiago affirm the voluntariness of his plea. Later, when Santiago sought to withdraw his plea, the trial court referred to the prior plea colloquy, asking Santiago whether he remembered how the judge had asked him whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>he \u201chad any complaints about [his] attorneys,\u201d and queried, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you speak up then?\u201d In fact, Santiago had spoken up to express dissatisfaction with his attorney; the court\u2019s conclusion that Santiago had an opportunity to fully address this issue mischaracterized what had transpired at the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 62} Second, when the trial court asked Santiago his reasons for wanting to withdraw his plea, Santiago stated: \u201c[T]hey charged me with trafficking. * * * I don\u2019t see how it was trafficking, when it was in one bag, it was not * * * individually \u2014 it was not, I was not trying to sell it.\u201d The judge responded: \u201c[I]t doesn\u2019t matter. * * * [I]f you get up to a certain amount, it still comes under the trafficking section of the code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 63} R.C. 2925.03 ties the degree of the offense to the amount of drugs possessed, but it does not define trafficking strictly in terms of possession of a bulk amount.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although we recognize that Santiago made a statement to the police that he had been trying to make extra money by selling the drugs, and his motion to suppress had been overruled, he also denied at the sentencing hearing that he had made such a statement and claimed that he had never signed the alleged statement. While there may have been other reasons to reject Santiago\u2019s challenge to the characterization of the offense as trafficking, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the amount of drugs required a charge of trafficking was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">{\u00b6 64} Third, we have some potential concerns as to the interaction between Santiago and his attorneys. \u2022 According to the attorney who appeared with Santiago at the sentencing hearing (at which the motion to withdraw his plea was discussed), Santiago contacted the attorney who had represented him when his plea was entered only one day after the plea and expressed his desire to withdraw the plea. The attorney apparently refused to file such a motion. In a letter to Santiago, the attorney indicated that \u201che [the attorney] thought that it was a good plea, it has been freely and voluntarily given, and it was * * * not his intention to file a Motion to Withdraw the plea.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">{\u00b6 65} We note that Santiago\u2019s attorney at the sentencing hearing did not actively participate or advocate on behalf of Santiago\u2019s request; Santiago spoke for himself, and neither Santiago nor his attorney (who was not the attorney at the plea) pointed out to the court that Santiago\u2019s concerns about his representation had not been fully addressed at the prior hearing, as the court assumed. Although an attorney is not required to file or advocate for a motion that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>she considers to be frivolous or meritless, the liberal standard for withdrawal of a presentence motion to withdraw a plea and the facts of these proceedings may have raised a colorable claim. However, we do not conclude that counsel was ineffective or that the outcome of Santiago\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea would have been different if counsel had filed the motion or argued it to the court. <em>State v. Drake, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93761, 2010-Ohio-1065, 2010 WL 972810, \u00b6 16; <em>State v. Carr, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-849, 2002-Ohio-1314, 2002 WL 433610; <em>State v. Jones </em>(Apr. 30, 1999), Clark App. No. 98-CA-42, 1999 WL 253207.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 66} In summary, considering the colloquy at the Crim.R. 11 hearing regarding Santiago\u2019s dissatisfaction with his attorney, the court\u2019s misstatement of the law at the sentencing hearing, Santiago\u2019s timely request to his attorney to file a motion to withdraw the plea, and counsel\u2019s failure to play an active role at the sentencing when the motion to withdraw the plea was addressed, we conclude that the discussion at the sentencing hearing did not constitute a \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d on the motion and that Santiago is entitled to such a hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea. At this hearing, the court can determine the nature of Santiago\u2019s dissatisfaction with his attorney and other matters; the voluntary, intelligent, and knowing nature of his plea; and whether Santiago has set forth a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 67} The third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are sustained in part and overruled in part. We conclude that Santiago is entitled to a hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea, but we do not conclude that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 68} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for consideration of Santiago\u2019s pre-sentence motion to withdraw his no contest plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b695-9\">Rice, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b695-10\">Hall, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b695-11\">Cynthia Westcott Rice, J., of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\">. \"White powder\u201d was also found in the glove box, but no further mention of this substance was made during the court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-14\">.

See former R.C. 2925.03(A)(4), (6), and (9), which defined trafficking in drugs as possession of a controlled substance in excess of the bulk amount or in various multiples thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. The attorney who represented Santiago at the sentencing hearing appeared to concede these basic facts, but the letter from the attorney to Santiago was not presented at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b695-12\">Hall, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AGi\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">{\u00b6 69} I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, with respect to the first two assignments of error, that the trial court correctly overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. However, I disagree with the conclusion that during sentencing the trial court failed to conduct an adequate hearing when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>defendant indicated that he wanted to withdraw his former plea. The majority-orders the case remanded for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea for three reasons, none of which in my opinion constitute reversible error. I would affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 70} The first of the majority\u2019s reasons for remand is that at the time of the defendant\u2019s no-contest plea, when asked by the court whether he was satisfied with the advice and competence of his counsel, the defendant said, \u201cNot really.\u201d In response, the court confirmed that the defendant was making his plea voluntarily. Thereafter, the court conducted a complete and thorough Crim.R. 11 colloquy, which consists of 14 pages of transcript. Moreover, when the court inquired whether the defendant had reviewed the plea form with his lawyer, the defendant asked, \u201cCan I go over it again?\u201d The court responded, \u201cSure you can. You certainly can.\u201d And the court then confirmed, \u201c[S]o, did you, uh have a chance to go over that with your attorney...... *?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Thus, the statement that the defendant was \u201cnot really\u201d satisfied with his attorney has been taken factually out of context from the entire plea colloquy. The plea form, which the court gave the defendant additional time to review with his lawyer, states: \u201cI am satisfied with my attorney\u2019s advice, counsel and competence.\u201d Therefore, the \u201cnot really\u201d remark by the defendant is also taken out of its legal context.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 71} There is no requirement that a criminal defendant must develop and share a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d with his attorney. <em>State v. Satterwhite, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23142, 2009-Ohio-6593, 2009 WL 4829829, \u00b6 41, citing <em>Morris v. Slappy </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 1, 13, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610. Although a court must inquire into, and make a record of, specific allegations of an appointed attorney\u2019s deficient performance, <em>State v. Deal </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St.2d 17, 18, 46 O.O.2d 154, 244 N.E.2d 742, vague or general objections do not trigger a duty to investigate further. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 419, 715 N.E.2d 223. A \u201cnot really\u201d comment does not even amount to a vague or general complaint. In <em>State v. Simons </em>(Nov. 22, 2000), Champaign App. No. 99CA5, 2000 WL 1726904, the defendant moved to dismiss his appointed counsel and identified the reason for the request as a conflict of interest. This court held that \u201cthe mere claim of a \u2018conflict of interest,\u2019 without more, is not a sufficiently specific allegation to trigger the duty to investigate further.\u201d Id at *3. Likewise, the defendant\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d comment here is not a reason to send this case back to the trial court to inquire into what the trial court was not required to inquire into in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">{\u00b6 72} The second reason the majority cites to require remand is that at sentencing, during the \u201chearing\u201d on the defendant\u2019s request to change his plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the trial court made a misstatement about what could constitute trafficking. The statement \u201cif you get up to a certain amount,, it still comes under the trafficking section of the code\u201d was undoubtedly incorrect. It harkens back to the statutory scheme before S.B. 2 became effective in 1996. At that time, possession of a drug in a quantity of more than \u201cbulk\u201d amount came under the trafficking section, R.C. 2925.03. The then-applicable statutory scheme effectively created a presumption that possession of a statutorily defined \u201cbulk\u201d amount constituted trafficking. See former R.C. 2925.03(A)(4) (defining trafficking as possession of \u201ca controlled substance in an amount equal to or exceeding the bulk amount * * * \u201d). The current trafficking section no longer includes that presumption. Nevertheless, the phrase \u201cbulk amount\u201d remains in the code at R.C. 2925.01(D). \u201cBulk amount\u201d is now used to stratify the level of drug offenses, except for those involving marijuana, cocaine, LSD, heroin, and hashish, which have their own separate quantity/level classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 73} But the court\u2019s misstatement, factually and legally, is of no consequence. Factually, the defendant was indicted for trafficking in that he did \u201cknowingly * * * transport, deliver, prepare for distribution * * * Crack Cocaine\u201d in an amount of ten or more grams but less than 25 grams, a felony of the second degree. He admitted that the 13 grams of crack found in the glove box of the car were his. He had gotten the crack to make a little extra money for the holidays. The drugs had been \u201cfronted\u201d to him. He knew two people in Dayton who would help him get rid of it. His only denial was that he was not going to sell the drugs in Troy, Ohio. These statements, which the trial court found to be admissible, and which we affirm, are sufficient to implicate the defendant in trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 74} The legal import of the trial court\u2019s misstatement is that it was made during the hearing on the request to withdraw the plea, not during the Crim R. 11 colloquy when the defendant might have relied on it before making a knowing and voluntary plea. The defendant had made that choice weeks earlier after a full, complete, and accurate plea. And the defendant knew that the state claimed that he was going to sell the drugs because that evidence was addressed at the motion to suppress. Factually and legally, the misstatement did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 75} This leads to the third reason for the majority\u2019s remand: that the hearing on the request to withdraw the plea was inadequate. A hearing on a request to withdraw a plea at the time of sentencing need be no more than giving the defendant or counsel the opportunity to explain the basis for the request. Time and again, this court and other courts of appeals have found a hearing on a motion to withdraw a plea to be adequate when it consisted of no more than a brief opportunity for the defense to state the reasons why the defendant wanted to withdraw his plea. <em>State v. Forest, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19649, 2003-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>1945, 2003 WL 1894588, citing <em>State v. Holloman </em>(June 22, 2001), Greene App. No. 2000CA82, 2001 WL 699533, and <em>State v. Mooty </em>(Aug. 31, 2001), Greene App. No. 2000 CA 72, 2001 WL 991976; see also <em>State v. Griffin, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82832, 2004-Ohio-1246, 2004 WL 529406; <em>State v. Hairston, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-160, 2007-Ohio-5928, 2007 WL 3257331; <em>State v. Eversole, </em>Erie App. No. E-05-073, 2006-Ohio-3988, 2006 WL 2218215. The upshot of these cases is that a hearing to withdraw a plea can be brief, consisting only of the defendant having an opportunity to state reasons for withdrawal and needing to be no more than necessary to address the merits of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">{\u00b6 76} Here, Santiago was given an opportunity to explain his reasons for wanting to withdraw his plea. He gave four reasons: (1) \u201cThey charged [him] with trafficking,\u201d the factual basis of which he had admitted to the police, (2) he never signed his police statement, although a signed statement is not required and the motion to suppress indicates that his statement was oral, (3) an unidentified \u201csomebody\u201d he talked to on the phone told him to plead not guilty, and (4) he had been doing a lot of reading. After hearing these reasons, the court concluded that the defendant had experienced no more than a change of heart: \u201c[0]n your oral request to withdraw your former plea of no contest, uh, based upon the factors that you have indicated to me here, Mr. Santiago, I will overrule those. Unless you have some more that you want to give me?\u201d Notably, dissatisfaction with counsel, one of the majority\u2019s reasons for remand, is not one of the reasons Santiago raised as a basis to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 77} Finally, the majority is critical of counsel for not playing a more active role in the withdrawal request. It was counsel who brought to the court\u2019s attention that the defendant had expressed a desire to withdraw his plea. But it was apparent that counsel believed that the plea was a \u201cgood plea, it was freely and voluntarily given.\u201d Taking a more active role would be tantamount to arguing what counsel had evaluated as a meritless or frivolous motion, which we routinely do not expect counsel to do in our <em>Anders </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 78} For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision overruling the defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea as nothing more than a change of heart.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
