Levy, appeals from a journal entry issued by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas on June 18, 2010, which he construes as a judgment dismissing his creditor\u2019s bill against appellee, Teresa L. Ivie. As explained below, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">{\u00b6 2} On May 11, 2007, appellant filed a creditor\u2019s bill in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. According to the complaint, appellant had obtained an $82,764.51 judgment against Ivie based on Ivie\u2019s default on a cognovit note that she executed to purchase appellant\u2019s company, Confidential Court Services, L.L.C., d.b.a. Confidential Interlock (\u201cConfidential\u201d). Claiming that Ivie did not have sufficient personal or real property subject to levy on execution to satisfy the judgment, appellant\u2019s complaint sought an order making Ivie\u2019s interest in Confidential subject to satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">{\u00b6 3} After Ivie answered the complaint, the trial court referred the case to a magistrate. On April 15, 2008, Ivie filed a notice announcing that she had recently petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The trial court, acknowledging the automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>stay imposed by the bankruptcy court, placed the case on inactive status until the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 4} On September 8, 2008, appellant notified the trial court that Ivie was discharged from bankruptcy on July 31, 2008. After the trial court reactivated the case, the magistrate held a hearing on November 18, 2008. At the conclusion of the hearing, the magistrate ordered the parties to file supplemental memoranda explaining whether appellant\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill could perfect a lien on Ivie\u2019s interest in Confidential. The parties submitted their memoranda on November 25, 2008. The magistrate then ordered Ivie to submit proof that her obligation to appellant had been discharged in bankruptcy. Ivie provided additional information on December 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 5} In a decision filed on December 10, 2008, the magistrate found that Ivie presented sufficient information to prove that her debt was discharged in bankruptcy and ordered that the case be dismissed with prejudice. The trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision on December 18, 2008; however, on that same day, appellant filed a motion asking the magistrate to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. Appellant did not pursue an appeal from the trial court\u2019s December 18, 2008 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 6} On October 28, 2009, after appellant personally inquired about the status of his December 18, 2008 request for findings of fact and conclusions of law, the magistrate filed a decision denying that request. The magistrate found appellant\u2019s request to be untimely under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii), as it was filed over seven days after the magistrate\u2019s decision dated December 10, 2008. Additionally, given that the trial court had already dismissed the case on December 18, 2008, the magistrate stated that appellant\u2019s only avenue to challenge that judgment would have been a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant filed an objection on November 9, 2009. At the outset, appellant purported to object to the magistrate\u2019s October 28, 2009 decision denying his request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. He argued that Civ.R. 6(E) afforded him an additional three days to file his December 18, 2008 request. However, after challenging the magistrate\u2019s ruling on the timeliness of his request, appellant went on to argue the merits of the magistrate\u2019s initial decision to dismiss the creditor\u2019s bill. Appellant\u2019s objection concluded by asking the trial court to \u201creject the Decision of the Magistrate recommending that the instant case be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 8} On June 18, 2010, the trial court filed a journal entry in response to appellant\u2019s objections. In its entry, the trial court declared appellant\u2019s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law to be a nullity, stating that \u201cnone were necessary, or even possible, and had no effect on the finality of the dismissal.\u201d Then, without expressly adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision or overruling appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>lant\u2019s objections, the trial court\u2019s entry concluded: \u201cAs all legal issues were decided long ago, this entry is the court\u2019s last word on the subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant now appeals from the June 18, 2010 entry, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">The trial court erroneously dismissed the plaintiffs creditor\u2019s bill on account of the defendant\u2019s bankruptcy even though the plaintiff was a secured creditor and could proceed against Teresa Ivie and Confidential Court Services in rem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant construes the trial court\u2019s June 18, 2010 journal entry as a final order dismissing his creditor\u2019s bill. Before we can address appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">{\u00b6 11} Pursuant to Civ.R,. 53(D)(3)(b)(i), a party may file objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision within 14 days of the filing of the decision, \u201cwhether or not the court has adopted the decision during that fourteen-day period.\u201d Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(e)\u00ae states that the timely filing of objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision operates as an automatic stay of execution of the judgment until the court disposes of those objections and vacates, modifies, or adheres to the judgment previously entered. If no objections are timely filed, App.R. 4(A) allows a party to file a notice of appeal within 30 days after the trial court enters its judgment adopting the magistrate^ decision. See also App.R. 4(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">{\u00b6 12} Here, the magistrate filed her decision to dismiss the case on December 10, 2008, and the trial court adopted that decision on December 18, 2008. Appellant did not object within 14 days after the filing of the magistrate\u2019s decision, as permitted by Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(i), nor did he pursue a timely appeal in accordance with App.R. 4(A). Although he requested findings of fact and conclusions of law from the magistrate on December 18, 2008, only \u201ca timely request for findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d tolls the 14-day time period for objecting to a magistrate\u2019s decision. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)\u00ae. Pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii) such requests \u201cshall be made before the entry of a magistrate\u2019s decision or within seven days after the filing of a magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d Thus, to toll the 14-day time period for objecting to the magistrate\u2019s December 10, 2008 decision, appellant was required to file his request for findings of fact and conclusions of law by December 17, 2008, seven days after the filing of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant argued below that the seven-day time period for requesting findings of fact and conclusions of law was extended by Civ.R. 6(E), which grants a party three additional days to perform an action that is required \u201cwithin a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The Supreme Court of Ohio has consistently recognized that Civ.R. 6(E) applies only to time periods that are triggered by the <em>service </em>of a notice or other paper. See <em>Duganitz v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 556, 557, 751 N.E.2d 1058 (Civ.R. 6(E) does not apply to Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(a), which permits a party to object within 14 days after the <em>filing </em>of a magistrate\u2019s decision); <em>Harvey v. Hwang, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 16, 2004-Ohio-4112, 812 N.E.2d 1275, syllabus. Under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii), however, the time period for requesting findings of fact and conclusions of law is triggered by the filing of a magistrate\u2019s decision and not service of the decision. Appellant filed his request for findings of fact and conclusions of law on December 18, 2008 \u2014 one day after the seven-day deadline had expired. Therefore, because no other rule-day extensions applied, appellant\u2019s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law was untimely, and it did not toll the time for objecting to the magistrate\u2019s December 10, 2008 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 15} Without a timely objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the trial court\u2019s December 18, 2008 final judgment remained in full effect. As a result, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on appellant\u2019s untimely November 9, 2009 objections in its journal entry filed on June 18, 2010. \u201c[U]ntimely objections filed after the entry of a final judgment are tantamount to a motion for reconsideration, which is a nullity.\u201d <em>Murray v. Goldfinger, </em>2d Dist. No. 19433, 2003-Ohio-459, 2003 WL 203587, \u00b6 5, citing <em>Pitts v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 379, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105. \u201cMoreover, \u2018[i]t follows that a judgment entered on a motion for reconsideration is also a nullity and a party cannot appeal from such a judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rutan v. Collins, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-36, 2003-Ohio-4826, 2003 WL 22100145, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Primmer v. Lipp, </em>5th Dist. No. 02-CA-94, 2003-Ohio-3577, 2003 WL 21525474, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, had the trial court purported to rule on the objection in its June 18, 2010 journal entry, any such ruling would have been a nullity and therefore unreviewable on appeal. See, e.g., <em>In re J.A.M., </em>12th Dist. No. CA2010-07-174, 2011-Ohio-668, 2011 WL 497200, \u00b6 15 (after a final judgment has already been entered, an appellate court has no jurisdiction to review a trial court\u2019s decision purporting to \u201c \u2018overrule\u2019 appellant\u2019s untimely objections and readopt the magistrate\u2019s decision\u201d); <em>Stamper v. Keatley, </em>4th Dist. No. 04CA14, 2004-Ohio-5430, 2004 WL 2283590, \u00b6 9 (because the trial court had already entered a final judgment terminating the case, no appellate jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s second order purporting to dismiss the appellant\u2019s untimely objections). Under App.R. 4(A), appellant could have appealed within 30 days after the trial court entered its judgment on December 18, 2008. Because he did not pursue an appeal within that time, we lack jurisdiction to address his assignment of error now. See <em>In re J.A.M. </em>at \u00b6 16; <em>Stamper </em>at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Based on the foregoing, we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-6\">Klatt and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
