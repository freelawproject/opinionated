Tite, guilty of wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle, a violation of R.C. 4511.203(A). The conviction is under a prior version of the statute that went into effect on September 30, 2008. Under former R.C. 4511.203(C), the offense is a first-degree misdemeanor. The conviction was pursuant to a jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant asserts one assignment of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cAssignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe state failed to provide sufficient evidence of the essential element of \u2018knowingly\u2019 allowing the individual operating the motor vehicle in this case, and the resultant jury verdict, finding the defendant guilty, was against the manifest weight of the evidence concerning that specific element of the charge. The trial court erred in failing to grant the defendant\u2019s Criminal Rule 29 motion based upon the insufficiency of the evidence presented on the element of \u2018knowingly.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 5} The incident on which appellant\u2019s prosecution was based occurred on July 11, 2010, when appellant was a passenger in his own Chevy Silverado pickup truck driven by his son, Anthony Tite. Officer Briana Keegan, a patrol officer of the Wakeman Police Department, testified at trial that she followed appellant\u2019s pickup truck after a citizen\u2019s complaint that the vehicle was being driven erratically. As she followed, the officer saw the pickup cross back and forth over the center line of the roadway a few times.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">{\u00b6 6} Keegan attempted to initiate a traffic stop, activating her emergency lights and siren while following immediately behind the vehicle. Anthony did not comply. He drove the vehicle for a couple of miles until he reached appellant\u2019s residence and stopped the vehicle behind appellant\u2019s house in a heavily wooded area, near the edge of a cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">{\u00b6 7} Once the vehicle stopped, Keegan ordered the occupants to exit the vehicle. Appellant promptly exited the vehicle from the passenger side. Anthony did not exit the vehicle, but backed the pickup into Keegan\u2019s patrol car and drove away through a cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">{\u00b6 8} Multiple charges were brought against the appellant arising from the incident and appellant\u2019s actions afterwards. At trial, the trial court granted a Crim.R. 29 motion and acquitted appellant of a menacing charge. The jury returned not-guilty verdicts on other charges of persistent disorderly conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>resisting arrest. This appeal concerns appellant\u2019s lone conviction for wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 9} The prosecution for wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle proceeded under a citation issued by Keegan to appellant for violation of R.C. 4511.203(A)(2). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c4511.203 Wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) No person shall permit a motor vehicle owned by the person or under the person\u2019s control to be driven by another if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) The offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person\u2019s driver\u2019s or commercial driver\u2019s license or permit or nonresident operating privileges have been suspended or canceled under Chapter 4510. or any other provision of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 14} In order to establish a violation of R.C. 4511.203(A)(2), the state must prove that (1) appellant owned or controlled the pickup, (2) appellant permitted his son to drive the vehicle, and (3) appellant had actual knowledge or reasonable cause to know that his son\u2019s license was suspended. <em>State v. Al Hanandeh, </em>2d Dist. No. 22976, 2009-Ohio-5613, 2009 WL 3402376, \u00b6 49; <em>Cleveland v. Elkins, </em>8th Dist. No. 91378, 2008-Ohio-6288, 2008 WL 5096927, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal at trial based upon the insufficiency of the evidence to establish that appellant had actual knowledge or reasonable cause to know that his son\u2019s license was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 16} A challenge to a conviction based upon a claim of insufficiency of the evidence presents a question of law on whether the evidence at trial is legally adequate to support a jury verdict on all elements of a crime. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. An appellate court does not weigh credibility when reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to support a verdict. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. A reviewing court considers whether the evidence at trial \u201cif believed, would convince the avex-age mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">{\u00b6 17} The only witness at trial was Officer Keegan. Keegan testified that once the pickup stopped, she saw that the driver was Anthony Tite. She knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>him. She determined that appellant was the owner of the vehicle through a computer check using the Ohio LEADS computerized information system.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 18} Keegan testified that she knew that Anthony\u2019s operator\u2019s license was under suspension at the time of the incident. The officer testified that she concluded that appellant had knowledge that Anthony\u2019s license was suspended because Anthony was appellant\u2019s son. Keegan admitted on cross-examination at trial that she had no personal knowledge of whether appellant knew that his son\u2019s license was under suspension. Later, Keegan also testified that Anthony and appellant worked closely together, but that Anthony did not live with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 19} Proof of a parent-child relationship alone is insufficient to create a presumption of a parent\u2019s knowledge that their child\u2019s driving privileges were under suspension for purposes of establishing a violation of R.C. 4511.203(A)(2). Under R.C. 4511.203(B)(1), to create a prima-facie case that a vehicle owner knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of his vehicle is operating the vehicle while the operator\u2019s driving privileges have been suspended requires a showing both that (1) the operator resided in the same household as the owner and (2) the operator is related to the owner by consanguinity or affinity. Here it is undisputed that Anthony did not live with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 20} Creation of a prima-facie showing of knowledge under R.C. 4511.201(B)(2) based upon the owner\u2019s knowledge of charges against or convictions of an operator that would or could result in suspension or cancellation of driving privileges also requires proof that the operator resided with the vehicle owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 21} While Officer Keegan testified that appellant and his son worked closely together, her testimony did not provide any detail to support an inference that their contacts provided appellant with actual or constructive knowledge that Anthony\u2019s driving privileges were under suspension on July 11, 2010. Viewing the evidence in the record in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that no trier of fact could have found that appellant knew or had reason to know that Anthony\u2019s driving privileges were under suspension when Anthony operated appellant\u2019s pickup on July 11, 2010. Because such knowledge is a necessary element for a conviction of wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle under R.C. 4511.203(A)(2), we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to grant appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 22} In view of our determination of error based upon insufficiency of the evidence, it is unnecessary for the court to consider appellant\u2019s arguments as to whether the guilty verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, because the issue is moot. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>{\u00b6 23} We find that appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken. Accordingly, the judgment of the Norwalk Municipal Court is reversed, and appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-6\">Handwork and Singer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
