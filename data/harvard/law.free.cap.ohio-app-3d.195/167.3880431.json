Stewart, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">{\u00b6 1} Defendants-appellants, Alamo Rent A Car, National Rental, Inc., and Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc. (\u201cthe rental companies\u201d), appeal from the trial court\u2019s orders denying their motion for a protective order and granting the motion to compel of plaintiffs-appellees Dawn M. Hart (\u201cHart\u201d) and Timothy J. Hart. Hart seeks discovery of the Social Security number of a nonparty, Jason Chang, a former employee of the rental companies, to locate him and obtain his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">{\u00b6 2} Hart, as guardian of Timothy J. Hart Jr. (\u201cTimothy\u201d), brought a personal-injury action against the rental companies, when Timothy suffered a severe brain injury after becoming trapped under a rental vehicle that required roadside assistance. Timothy last spoke to former rental companies\u2019 employee Chang by telephone before the incident, but the content and nature of their discussion remain unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Hart asserts that the subject matter of the discussion with Chang could be dispositive of liability in the underlying cause of action because Chang could have deviated from company policy, given erroneous advice to Timothy regarding the correct action to be taken under the circumstances, or received improper training to manage incidents requiring roadside assistance. Consequently, when the rental companies refused to produce Chang\u2019s Social Security number for the limited purpose of locating Chang to obtain testimony, Hart filed a motion to compel the rental companies to make the information available. Hart argues that Chang\u2019s Social Security number is not privileged and falls within the scope of discovery, and she warrants that she will take all reasonable steps to keep the information confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">{\u00b6 4} The rental companies thereafter moved the trial court for a protective order to prevent the release of the Social Security number and insist that it is confidential as well as protected by state and federal privacy law. The rental companies explain that they have provided Chang\u2019s last-known address, phone numbers, and date of birth to Hart and that their exhaustive efforts to locate Chang while using the Social Security number have been futile. The rental companies assert that they lack Chang\u2019s consent to release the information and that they are prohibited from producing the information by law and could incur adverse legal repercussions if they violate these directives. As a final point, the rental companies insist that Hart presents no law to bolster her assertion that the nonparty\u2019s Social Security number is in fact discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 5} On September 22, 2010, the trial court granted Hart\u2019s motion to compel and denied the rental companies\u2019 motion for a protective order, with the related journal entry specifically conditioning that \u201c[plaintiffs must agree to a confidentiality agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[W]e review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the management of discovery under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Cepeda v. Lutheran Hosp., </em>8th Dist. No. 90031, 2008-Ohio-2348, 2008 WL 2058588, at \u00b6 9. An abuse of discretion \u201c \u2018connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 7} Matters that are not privileged are discoverable if they are relevant to the pending action and relate to the claim or defense of the inquiring party. Civ.R. 26(B)(1). \u201cOhio Courts have permitted discovery of confidential information to further a countervailing interest only if the non-party[\u2019s] * * * identity is sufficiently protected.\u201d <em>Cepeda </em>at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Civ.R. 37(A) authorizes and governs motions to compel discovery and provides: \u201c(2) Motion. If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or submitted * * * or a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted * * * the discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer * * * in accordance with the request.\u201d Civ.R. 37(A)(2). In addition, Civ.R. 26(C) allows the trial court to grant protective orders regarding discovery in order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Civ.R. 26(C). \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a protective order is within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Stanton v. Univ. Hosps. Health Sys., Inc., </em>166 Ohio App.3d 758, 2006-Ohio-2297, 853 N.E.2d 343, at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 9} In modern society, Social Security numbers play a unique role in the identification, authentication, and scrutinizing of the populace. Privacy concerns abound because Social Security numbers are very clearly a tool that is often used to invade privacy and to commit crimes such as identity theft and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 10} While neither the United States nor the Ohio Constitution \u201cspecifically mentions an inherent right to privacy, * * * Ohio courts, like the United States Supreme Court, have established that an inherent right exists.\u201d <em>Doe v. Univ. of Cincinnati </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 227, 231, 538 N.E.2d 419. The constitutional right to privacy includes \u201cthe individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201d <em>Whalen v. Roe </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 589, 599, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64. Presently there exists a hodgepodge of statutory enactments, court rules, and decisions regarding constitutional rights of privacy pertaining to the nondisclosure of Social Security numbers. Even so, numerous trial and appellate courts have required civil litigants to disclose Social Security numbers in the confines of discovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> {\u00b6 11} In one instance, a plaintiff filed a motion to compel production of Social Security numbers from an employer to facilitate contacting \u201cpreviously unreachable individuals.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Papa John\u2019s USA, Inc. </em>(Apr. 15, 2009), N.D. Ohio No. 1:08-CV-2791, 2009 WL 1011105. The court in this instance used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>a balancing test that entailed \u201cweighing the plaintiffs\u2019 need for social security numbers * * * against the privacy interests [of absent individuals].\u201d Id. at <em>*2; Gieseke v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp. </em>(Feb. 7, 2007), D.Kan.No. 04-2511-CM-GLR, 2007 WL 445202. \u201cThis balancing test considered] the highly personal and confidential nature of social security numbers and the harm that can flow from disclosures, then balance[d] it against the plaintiffs need for the information * * Id. When using this test, courts will not require a Social Security number to be produced unless a plaintiff makes a showing that the unavailable person could be contacted by the use of less private information. In other words, the requesting party must provide \u201ca convincing rationale] to explain why the production of such sensitive information is needed.\u201d Id., citing <em>Lee v. ABC Carpet &amp; Home </em>(May 9, 2008), S.D.N.Y. No. 00 Civ. 0984(DAB), 2008 WL 2073932.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">{\u00b6 12} <em>Papa John's </em>also noted that \u201c \u2018providing sensitive personal data such as a social security number is not to be done lightly. Nor should people who appear to have no or little interests in joining the lawsuit be faced with the possibility of being contacted by telephone or having additional personal information released.\u2019 \u201d Id. at *3, quoting <em>Vennet v. Am. Intercontinental Univ. Online </em>(Apr. 5, 2006), N.D.Ill.E.D. No. 05 C 4889, 2006 WL 908030, *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, this court assumes the undertaking of balancing nonparty Chang\u2019s countervailing privacy concern of nondisclosure of his Social Security number against Hart\u2019s significant interest in compelling disclosure of the information to try to locate Chang and obtain his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 14} Hart justifies her request for disclosure of Chang\u2019s Social Security number by arguing that it is the best information available with which to locate Chang, the last party to speak with Timothy, and whose testimony is essential to ascertain the sequence of events leading to Timothy\u2019s injury. She additionally asserts that the interests of justice outweigh any privacy interests that Chang may have. Finally, Hart opines that the laws prohibiting disclosure of the Social Security number pertain to governmental agencies and do not shield the rental companies from compliance with the discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 15} In contrast, the rental companies take issue with releasing the Social Security number and rely upon former employee Chang\u2019s privacy rights as well as the absence of Chang\u2019s consent to allow delivery of the requested data. To demonstrate the futility of using the identifying number, the rental companies point to their own comprehensive, yet barren, efforts to locate Chang while using his Social Security number. Last, they cite an abundance of law that is marginally associated with disclosure of Social Security numbers by private entities in support of nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>{\u00b6 16} In this instance, Hart\u2019s interest in disclosure of the Social Security number outweighs nonparty Chang\u2019s interest in confidentiality. Relinquishing the requested Social Security number, made within the confines of the discovery process, is paramount to Hart\u2019s legitimate interests in pretrial discovery and is minimally intrusive to Chang\u2019s privacy interests. The harm likely to result from the disclosure of the requested information is negligible because the trial court has incorporated a confidentiality agreement to the request; it is improbable that the Social Security number will be disseminated publicly. The cases relied upon by the rental companies are not binding on this court and are readily distinguishable to reinforce the reality that governmental (as opposed to private) disclosure of Social Security numbers is prohibited by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-7\">Celebrezze and Rocco, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">.
