This court affirms in part and reverses in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">{\u00b6 2} Scott Saari (\u201cHusband\u201d) and Patricia Saari (\u201cWife\u201d) were married in June 2004 and divorced in October 2008. Husband appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment entry of divorce in regard to several orders arising out of the court\u2019s interpretation of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement. This court reversed that judgment in part and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. <em>Saari v. Saari, </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA009507, 2009-Ohio-4940, 2009 WL 2992301 <em>(\u201cSaari </em>I\u201d). On remand, the domestic relations court held a status conference and ordered that the parties may file proposed judgment entries based on this court\u2019s decision. The trial court scheduled the matter for another status conference on May 18, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 3} In the meantime, Husband filed a motion for reimbursement of spousal-support fees and a motion for interest on the monies Wife must pay Husband as a result of this court\u2019s decision. In addition, Husband filed a proposed judgment entry in which he recited the monies Wife owed Husband, based on this court\u2019s decision, including spousal-support processing fees, plus interest. Husband\u2019s proposed order stated that all payments shall be made within 30 days of the journalization of the trial court\u2019s order. Before the trial court entered a final judgment, Husband also filed a motion for dividing the parties\u2019 interests in the marital real estate. Wife did not file a proposed judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 4} On May 26, 2010, the domestic relations court issued a \u201cjudgment\u201d in which it dismissed all the pending motions as premature, further noting that it had not yet issued a \u201cfinal decision based upon the Decision rendered by the Court of Appeals.\u201d The court further cancelled a hearing that it had apparently scheduled for June 4, 2010, although the record contains no formal scheduling order. On June 23, 2010, with no indication of any hearing on the matter, the trial court rejected Husband\u2019s proposed judgment entry and issued a judgment purported to effect the mandates of this court\u2019s September 21, 2009 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 5} This court had concluded that the trial court erred in finding the spousal-support provision of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement to be void as unconscionable and in awarding spousal support to Wife in the amount of $4,000 per month for a term of 12 months. <em>Saan I, </em>2009-Ohio-4940, 2009 WL 2992301. On remand, the domestic relations court ordered Wife to reimburse Husband $48,000, the amount he paid ostensibly as spousal support. Specifically, the trial court ordered the reimbursement of the erroneously ordered spousal support by directing Wife to pay Husband directly the sum of $250 per month until the total of $48,000 was repaid, a feat that would take 16 years to accomplish. Moreover, while the trial court ordered the reimbursement to Husband of $1,030.23 in processing fees procured from him by Lorain County Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d), it did not order the reimbursement of processing fees pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>cured by his employer, National City Bank. The trial court ordered Wife to reimburse Husband within 30 days for three payments this court concluded that the trial court erroneously ordered Husband to make in contravention of the terms of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement. Finally, the domestic relations court ordered Wife to pay Husband an additional six percent of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of the marital residence within 30 days, which amount the trial court believed would represent Husband\u2019s 46 percent share of equity in the home pursuant to the terms of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement. Husband filed a timely appeal, raising three assignments of error for review. Some assignments of error have been consolidated to facilitate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The trial court abused its discretion in ordering the repayment of spousal support of $48,000, at a rate of $250.00 per month for a period of 16 years to the defendant, at no interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The trial court erred when ordering the reimbursement to the defendant, [omitting] processing charges associated with the payment of spousal support to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">{\u00b6 6} As a preliminary matter, this court notes that appellee Wife has failed to file an appellee\u2019s brief. Accordingly, we may accept appellant Husband\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if Husband\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action. App.R. 18(C); see also <em>Akron v. Carter, </em>9th Dist. No. 22444, 2005-Ohio-4362, 2005 WL 2031778, at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">{\u00b6 7} Husband argues that the trial court erred by ordering Wife to reimburse, through monthly payments of $250 without interest, the $48,000.00 he was required to pay pursuant to an unlawful spousal-support order. In addition, Husband argues that the trial court erred by failing to order the reimbursement of processing fees associated with the withholding of the unlawfully ordered spousal support. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">{\u00b6 8} As a general rule, appellate courts review the propriety of a trial court\u2019s determination in a domestic relations case for an abuse of discretion. <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028. This is true because the domestic relations court, as a court of equity, \u201cmust have discretion to do what is equitable upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d Id., citing <em>Cherry v. Cherry </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 348, 355, 20 O.O.3d 318, 421 N.E.2d 1293. Specifically, this court recognizes the domestic relations court\u2019s broad discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>regarding matters involving spousal support. See <em>Abram v. Abram </em>(Jan. 9, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 3233-M, 2002 WL 22894.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Saari I, </em>this court concluded that the domestic relations court erred when it found the spousal-support provision of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement to be unconscionable and awarded spousal support to Wife. On remand, the domestic relations court was mandated to vacate the prior spousal-support order and issue any orders necessary to return Husband to a position as if he had never been obligated to pay spousal support. The trial court\u2019s sua sponte June 23, 2010 judgment constitutes an unreasonable attempt to effect that mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">{\u00b6 10} When ordering Wife to pay to Husband other monies pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Saari I, </em>the trial court ordered Wife to make those payments within 30 days of the journalization of the lower court\u2019s judgment entry. However, when ordering Wife to reimburse Husband for the spousal support he was wrongfully ordered to pay over the course of one year, the domestic relations court did not order the immediate repayment in full. Rather, its order allowed Wife to pay that same amount over a period of 16 years. In other words, Husband was forced to wait 16 times as long to recover a substantial sum of money that he was never legally obligated to pay in the first instance. This court has found no legal authority addressing a lower court\u2019s authority to institute a repayment plan to a party who was wrongfully ordered to pay a judgment, and we do not here decide that issue. We conclude, however, that an order that allows a party who wrongfully obtained a judgment for spousal support to repay the unlawfully obtained money, without interest, over a period of time consisting of 16 times the length of time in which she acquired the windfall is unreasonable and arbitrary. In fact, such a long-term reimbursement schedule is grossly unreasonable. Accordingly, the domestic relations court abused its discretion by ordering Wife to repay Husband $250 per month, without interest, until she had reimbursed him for the entire $48,000 he paid over the course of one year. Husband\u2019s argument in support of his first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 11} Husband next challenges the domestic relations court\u2019s failure to order the reimbursement of processing fees associated with his spousal-support payments. Although the trial court ordered CSEA to reimburse to Husband the $1,030.23 it collected for processing fees, Husband argues that the agency has a pending motion to intervene in the action below and a companion motion to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment in regard to agency-processing fees. The record does not contain any indication that the trial court has ruled on the agency\u2019s motions. Accordingly, this court declines to address Husband\u2019s argument in this regard because it is not yet ripe for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Husband next argues that the domestic relations court erred by failing to order Wife to repay him for the amount of money retained by his employer as service charges associated with its compliance with the trial court\u2019s spousal-support withholding order. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 3121.03 requires a court that issues a support order to issue a withholding notice to the obligor\u2019s employer (the \u201cpayor\u201d). R.C. 3121.037(A)(12) requires that such withholding notice contain a statement that the employer \u201cmay withhold a fee from the obligor\u2019s income as a charge for its services in complying with the [withholding] notice.\u201d R.C. 3121.18 establishes that fee as \u201cthe greater of two dollars or an amount not exceeding one per cent of the amount withheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 14} Husband\u2019s employer withheld $469.78 in processing fees associated with its compliance with the spousal-support withholding order. It is axiomatic that because Husband never had any lawful obligation to pay spousal support, he should never have been subjected to the loss of income in the form of processing fees associated with the erroneous withholding order. While Wife did not receive those additional monies withheld as fees, she benefitted from the employer\u2019s processing of the support order pursuant to the withholding notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">{\u00b6 15} It has long been held that as \u201cbetween two innocent parties, he who has caused the loss shall bear it.\u201d <em>Forbes &amp; King v. Espy, Heidelbach &amp; Co. </em>(1871), 21 Ohio St. 474, 479. See also 42 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1980) Estoppel and Waiver, Section 53 (\u201cEstoppel by negligence is said to be an application of the general principle of equity that when one of two innocent persons must suffer a loss, the loss must fall on the one who made the loss possible or who could have prevented it. * * * This may be true even where no positive fault has been committed by the one bringing about the situation, but more especially if there has been any carelessness on his part which caused or contributed to the loss\u201d). In her complaint for divorce, Wife prayed for certain relief, including \u201can award of such further relief as this Court may find just and equitable.\u201d Fifteen days later, she filed a motion for temporary spousal support. Husband filed a counterclaim for divorce in which he alleged that the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement precluded either party from paying spousal support to the other. In Wife\u2019s answer to Husband\u2019s counterclaim, she denied Husband\u2019s allegation in regard to the spousal-support provision of the prenuptial agreement. Wife continued to challenge the validity of the prenuptial agreement, and the trial court held a hearing on the issue, ultimately upholding the validity of the agreement, with the exception of the spousal-support provision. The domestic relations court awarded spousal support to Wife based on her request for it and the court\u2019s finding that the spousal-support provision was unconscionable. This court concluded that the trial court had erred by awarding spousal support to Wife. Wife\u2019s active pursuit of an award of spousal support despite the provision in the parties\u2019 prenuptial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>agreement precluding such an award caused Husband to suffer an additional loss of income associated with his unwarranted payment of spousal support. Husband\u2019s employer provided a service for which it had a right to be compensated. Of the remaining innocent parties, Wife, as the party who caused the loss, should be the one to bear it. Accordingly, the domestic relations court abused its discretion by failing to order Wife to reimburse Husband for the $469.78 retained as fees by his employer in connection with complying with the withholding order. Husband\u2019s argument in regard to his second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 16} The domestic relations court\u2019s long-term repayment plan, without any provision for the payment of interest or the reimbursement of all processing charges, is in conflict with the court\u2019s remand in <em>Saari I. </em>See <em>Vail v. Vail, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 85587 and 85590, 2005-Ohio-4308, 2005 WL 1994515, at \u00b6 20. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion in its issuance of an unreasonable and arbitrary judgment. Husband\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The trial court erred in deviating from the decision and journal entry of the court of appeals and the terms of the prenuptial agreement in terms of dividing the parties\u2019 separate interests in the marital real estate and in unequally dividing the marital interest in said property}.]</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 17} Husband argues that the domestic relations court erred by failing to carry this court\u2019s mandate regarding the division of the marital home into execution. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Saari I, </em>this court concluded that the domestic relations court erred by ordering that Husband was entitled to 40 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the parties\u2019 marital home instead of the 46 percent as determined by his equity interest as set forth in the prenuptial agreement. <em>Saari I, </em>2009-Ohio-4940, 2009 WL 2992301, at \u00b6 21-23. On remand, the domestic relations court ordered Wife to pay Husband \u201can additional 6% of the amount of the proceeds from the sale of the marital residence.\u201d By that order, the trial court complied with the mandate of this court and ordered the distribution of the marital residence pursuant to the terms of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">{\u00b6 19} Husband argues that Wife paid him an additional $7,720.28 which \u201c}s]he calculated\u201d to be the additional six percent of the proceeds. Husband argues that he is entitled to an additional $2,496.87. Based on the total proceeds from the sale of the home ($128,670.38) and the amount that Husband has received from the proceeds ($56,691.46), he is correct. However, that Wife has not yet paid Husband an amount that represents his full 46 percent interest in the marital property is not trial-court error. The domestic relations court entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>appropriate order on remand. If Wife has not fully complied with that order, Husband\u2019s recourse lies before the trial court, not this one. Husband\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">{\u00b6 20} Husband\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. His second assignment of error is sustained as it relates to processing fees withheld by his employer. Husband\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part, arid the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-8\">Whitmore and Dickinson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
