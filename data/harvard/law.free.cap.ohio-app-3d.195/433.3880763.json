Leach, appeals his conviction and sentence entered in the Delaware County Common Pleas Court, following a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2007, Leach was hired as a retail sales representative by Rex Gore, the owner of Black Wing Shooting Center. Black Wing Shooting Center is a full-service, federally licensed firearms dealer and shooting range.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">{\u00b6 4} Black Wing used a point-of-sale system to track its sales and inventory. In October 2008, Gore directed Robin Salvo, the manager and computer technician for Black Wing, to implement the security features that they had previously not been using. These new security features allowed Gore to run audit reports on his point-of-sale system, making it possible for him to track the activities of each username registered on the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">{\u00b6 5} Upon studying the audit reports, Gore noticed a number of irregular transactions, including transactions where items had been taken out of the electronic inventory without authorization. Gore then directed Salvo to determine who had been altering the inventory numbers. Upon further investigation, Salvo discovered that the inconsistent inventory transactions had been done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>under multiple usernames and that appellant had been working when each of the transactions occurred. Salvo also discovered that many of the same items that were missing from Black Wing\u2019s inventory had been posted for sale on various web sites by appellant. Further, appellant had removed a large gun safe from Black Wing\u2019s inventory and arranged to have it delivered to his father\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 6} Gore also noticed a number of voided sales of concealed-carry classes, which are courses that are required in order to obtain a concealed-weapons permit. Depending upon when the customer registered, these classes would cost either $150 or $175. If these classes are later voided, it would create an overage in the register system. Gore noticed, however, that each of the voided class transactions was either immediately preceded or followed by a deposit to a layaway account for a rifle under the name of Stephen Leach, appellant\u2019s father. In total, there were seven deposits to the layaway account, five of which were closely associated with voided concealed-carry class transactions. Appellant did make two deposits with his debit card towards the layaway account, amounting to a total of $262.50. The retail price of the rifle was over $1,000. The entire remaining balance was removed by deposits associated with voided concealed-carry classes, and each of these transactions was processed under appellant\u2019s username. Once the final deposit from the voided transaction had been made, appellant removed the rifle from Black Wing and gave it to his father. Gore stated that he had never reported the rifle as stolen and had never reported a theft of the firearm to the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, because he knew the location of the rifle and appellant\u2019s father had already informed him that he was going to return it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant was accused of a number of improprieties while working at Black Wing, including the unauthorized removal of various gun accessories and a Remington rifle from the Black Wing establishment. In all, a total of $17,476 in items was found to have been \u201cbacked out\u201d of inventory, including a couple of high-value scopes for black guns and a parts kit for a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 8} As a result of the above actions, appellant Gregory S. Leach was charged with one count of theft by deception of a firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer in violation of R.C. 2918.02(A)(3), one count of theft by deception of a firearm in violation of 2913.02(A)(3), one count of theft beyond the scope of consent of merchandise worth more than $5,000 but less than $100,000 in violation of 2913(A)(2), and one count of tampering with records resulting in a loss of more than $5,000 but less than $100,000 in violation of 2913.42(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 9} On December 14, 2010, a jury trial commenced in this matter. During the trial, the charge for theft by deception of a firearm was dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 10} At trial, the jury heard testimony from Rex Gore, the owner of Black Wing, Ronald Messick, Shirley Turrill, Robin Salvo, Judy Stadtlander, John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Richardson, and Andrew Loeffler, all employees of Black Wing Shooting Center, Todd Casey, a customer of Black Wing, and Steven Leach, appellant\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 11} Ronald Messick, the retail manager for Black Wing, testified that during the period in question, the retail staff all shared an office. Messick and the other manager each had his own desk and computer in the office, and there was a third computer for the retail sale staff to use for paperwork. He testified that during the time in question, the employees did not always remember to log out after they were done using the computer and that that practice was not strictly enforced. Messick recalled that he often saw appellant bring a backpack and a rifle bag or a large duffle bag for carrying rifles, ammunition, and equipment case to work with him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Messick stated that he thought nothing of it, assuming that appellant was bringing in his personal weapons to shoot at the range after work or to show to people.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 12} Shirley Turrill, a salesperson with Black Wing, testified that in April 2009, she had signed up a doctor from Delaware for a concealed-carry class. The doctor had paid $175 in cash. Turrill logged the doctor\u2019s name into the class log book and noted a cash payment. She then gave the doctor a receipt and put a duplicate receipt in the back of the class log book. Turrill stated that later on, she went back to the log book and noticed that the receipt was missing. She went to a co-worker, Judy Stadtlander, and they checked the computer and found that the transaction had been voided under Turrill\u2019s log-in code. Turrill denied that she had voided the transaction and testified that this could not occur by accident because it required multiple steps. Turrill testified that the doctor never cancelled the class through her, and he eventually took the class as originally scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 13} Judy Stadtlander similarly testified about the discovery of a voided concealed-carry-class purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 14} A Black Wing customer named Todd Casey testified that he had purchased a number of rifle scopes directly from appellant. Casey testified that when he began looking at tactical rifles at Black Wing, he was directed toward appellant because those were his specialty. On one occasion when Casey was looking at scopes, appellant asked whether he was looking to buy. Casey commented that he had to sell some of his guns before he could afford scopes. Appellant responded that he had some extra scopes that he had picked up over time when opportunities arose to buy them at reduced prices. Appellant was looking to sell some scopes and said that Casey could look at them and maybe bring in some of his guns to see about getting rid of them. When Casey was in the store again, appellant informed him that he had the scopes with him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pulled out a bag with four scopes in it. Although a couple of them were in boxes, Casey understood that appellant had used them for a short period of time, but decided he did not want them. Appellant told Casey that he could take them to the back of the store to look them over. Casey looked them over and told appellant that he was not sure; he would have to see what he had to mount them on. Appellant told him to just take them home, give them a try, and get back to him about them. Casey took them home and reviewed his own collection to see what he could get rid of. He eventually came back to appellant with a trade for a couple of weapons and some parts. Appellant agreed, and Casey brought the guns to the store. Appellant told Casey that trading guns in the store was frowned upon so he directed Casey to just toss them in the trunk of his car which was parked outside, and they would call it even.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 15} When presented with a list of items that disappeared from Black Wing, Casey identified several of them as items that appellant claimed to have in his collection. Casey also mentioned trading a gun bag for a knife. Casey also indicated that on a couple of occasions, he called to ask appellant to hold back new items for him, but appellant said they were not allowed to do that and that instead he would buy the items himself, and then Casey would pay appellant directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 16} The jury also heard testimony from appellant\u2019s father, Steven Leach, who testified that he had been a regular customer at Black Wing for a number of years. He stated that in 2008, he received two guns as Christmas presents from appellant. One was a handgun, and another was a Remington 700 rifle. Steven testified that at some point after appellant resigned, he had a conversation with John from Black Wing concerning those guns and whether appellant had ever paid for them. During that conversation, Steven also disclosed that appellant had had a Browning gun safe delivered to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 17} At the conclusion of the trial, the jury entered a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 18} On January 24, 2011, the trial court sentenced appellant to the minimum sentence on each count: three years for theft by deception of a firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer, six months for theft beyond the scope of consent of merchandise, and six months for tampering with records. The trial court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of four years. The trial court also ordered restitution in the amount of $23,295.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following errors for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cI. Defendant\u2019s due process rights under the state and federal constitutions were violated because there was insufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilty of theft of a firearm where the prosecution merely alleged that defendant used stolen money to purchase the firearm through a fully and properly documented transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cII. Defendants [sic] rights to due process and protections from double jeopardy under the state and federal constitutions were violated when the trial court failed to merge the convictions for theft and tampering with evidence under R.C. 2941.25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cHI. Defendant\u2019s rights to due process under the state and federal constitutions were violated when the trial court imposed consecutive sentences on counts three and four based on the mistaken belief that consecutive sentences were required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 23} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction on R.C. 2913.02(A)(3). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 24} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, our inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence; that is, whether the evidence, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (\u201csufficiency is the test of adequacy\u201d); <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>Jenks </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">{\u00b6 25} In this ease, appellant is challenging his conviction for theft of a firearm in violation of R.C. 2913.02, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(A) No person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services in any of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(3) By deception[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant argues that the state failed to prove any deception, asserting that the actual purchase of the firearm was properly documented. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>further argues that the alleged deception of fraudulently canceling the concealed-carry class registrations resulted in a theft of money and not the theft of a firearm. Additionally, appellant argues that the actual amount of money stolen was only approximately $1,000, which would only have been classified as a fifth-degree felony rather than the first-degree felony status assigned for theft of a firearm from a federally licensed firearm dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 30} Deception is defined in R.C. 2913.01(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(A) \u2018Deception\u2019 means knowingly deceiving another or causing another to be deceived by any false or misleading representation, by withholding information, by preventing another from acquiring information, or by any other conduct, act, or omission that creates, confirms, or perpetuates a false impression in another, including a false impression as to law, value, state of mind, or other objective or subjective fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 32} Upon review, we find that appellant\u2019s actions fall squarely within the definition of deception. The deceptive scheme hatched by appellant in this case was for the purpose of making it appear that he had paid for the firearms so that he could remove them from Blackwing. His scheme prevented Blackwing from \u201cacquiring information\u201d and learning that he was removing the firearm from the store without having first paid for it in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 33} Further, we find that no cash was actually stolen or removed from the store. Instead, appellant voided transactions and followed those voided transactions with bogus deposits to the firearm he had on a lay-away plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 34} Based on the foregoing, we find appellant\u2019s assignment of error not well taken, and we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">{\u00b6 35} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in not merging appellant\u2019s convictions for theft and tampering with evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 2941.25 governs multiple counts and states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-14\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cWhen determining whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25, the conduct of the accused must be considered. <em>(State v. Ranee </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, overruled.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 41} <em>Johnson </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cIn determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A), the question is whether it is possible to commit one offense and commit the other with the same conduct, not whether it is possible to commit one without committing the other. <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Blankenship </em>[ (1988) ], 38 Ohio St.3d [116] at 119, 526 N.E.2d 816 (Whiteside, J., concurring) (Tt is not necessary that both crimes are always committed by the same conduct but, rather, it is sufficient if both offenses <em>can be </em>committed by the same conduct. It is a matter of possibility, rather than certainty, that the same conduct will constitute commission of both offenses.\u2019 [Emphasis sic.]) If the offenses correspond to such a degree that the conduct of the defendant constituting commission of one offense constitutes commission of the other, then the offenses are of similar import.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cIf the multiple offenses can be committed by the same conduct, then the court must determine whether the offenses were committed by the same conduct, i.e., \u2018a single act, committed with a single state of mind.\u2019 <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, at \u00b6 50 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cIf the answer to both questions is yes, then the offenses are allied offenses of similar import and will be merged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cConversely, if the court determines that the commission of one offense will <em>never </em>result in the commission of the other, or if the offenses are committed separately, or if the defendant has separate animus for each offense, then, according to R.C. 2941.25(B), the offenses will not merge.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 48-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">{\u00b6 46} In the instant case, appellant was convicted of one count of theft of a firearm pursuant to R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and one count of tampering with records pursuant to R.C. 2913.42(A)(1), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 2913.02, Theft; aggravated theft</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>{\u00b6 48} \u201c(A) No person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services in any of the following ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(3) By deception; * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 51} R.C. 2913.42, Tampering with records</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(A) No person, knowing the person has no privilege to do so, and with purpose to defraud or knowing that the person is facilitating a fraud, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(1) Falsify, destroy, remove, conceal, alter, deface, or mutilate any writing, computer software, data, or record[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 54} As specifically noted in <em>Johnson, </em>it is appellant\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d that must be examined in determining separate animus. Therefore, the issue post-<em>Johnson </em>is whether the offenses were committed by the same conduct i.e., \u201c \u2018a single act, committed with a single state of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 49, citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 447, 2008-Ohio-4569, 895 N.E.2d 149, \u00b6 50 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 55} With regard to the first prong of the analysis under <em>Johnson, </em>it is undisputed that it is possible for both counts to be committed with the same act. We will therefore focus our analysis on the second prong: whether, under the facts of this case, the offenses were actually committed separately or with a separate animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">{\u00b6 56} The animus for the tampering-with-records charge occurred when appellant manipulated Blackwing\u2019s sales records to show canceled class registrations followed by deposits made to appellant\u2019s lay-away account.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">{\u00b6 57} The conduct, or animus, for the theft-of-a-firearm-by-deception charge occurred when appellant physically removed the firearm from the Blackwing premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">{\u00b6 58} We therefore find that appellant committed separate and distinct crimes for which he had a separate animus. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in not merging the sentences for these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">{\u00b6 59} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">{\u00b6 60} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in interpreting the theft statute to require the sentences on all counts to be served consecutively. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>{\u00b6 61} Appellant argues that the trial court ordered the sentences on all his counts to be served consecutively only because it believed it did not have the discretion to run them concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 62} We have reviewed the trial court\u2019s sentencing entry and the transcript of the sentencing hearing and find appellant\u2019s arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 63} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cMr. Leach, on December 15th, 2010, was found guilty by a jury of theft of a firearm from a Federally Licensed Firearm Dealer, Count 1. Count 3, theft, felony of the fourth degree. And Count 4, tampering with records, felony of the fourth degree. And at that time was referred for a presentence report. And the Court has received that, reviewed that, considered the principles and purposes of the sentencing. Also took into consideration the factors, But, in this case, there isn\u2019t much discretion the Court has since there\u2019s a mandatory prison term, which must be served consecutively to the other counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cUnder 2913(B), you did hold a position of trust and that position related to the offense, obligated you to prevent the offense or bring others committing any into justice. It\u2019s certainly in your position to facilitate the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe Court also considers recidivism factors related to your history of criminal convictions. The Court finds you show no remorse for the offense. And I didn\u2019t find anything indicating recidivism unlikely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cSerious factors, again, separate serious, you had knowledge, you held a position of trust, the offense related to that. Your profession facilitated the offense, the relation to the victim facilitated the offense. Basically, those all fall under one factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cI don\u2019t find anything indicating it\u2019s less serious than a normal offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cAre you amenable to Community Control, probably you\u2019re amenable to Community Control. But, based on the principles and purposes of sentencing, which is to punish you, and in doing that keep you from doing something like this again, and to serve as an example to others, the Court finds that a prison term is necessary here. And would, therefore, impose three years in prison on Count 1, which is the minimum prison term. Six months on Count 3, six months on Count 4.
