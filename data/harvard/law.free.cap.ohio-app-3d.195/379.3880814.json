(\u201cMother\u201d), appeals from the decision of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, that adjudicated her minor child, A.W., to be dependent and placed her in the temporary custody of the Summit County Children Services Board (\u201cCSB\u201d). This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">{\u00b6 2} The central issue in this case stems from CSB\u2019s removal of a newly born infant directly from the hospital in the belief that she was at risk of harm because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>an older sibling had suffered injuries more than two years earlier. Mother has argued that there is no evidence that this infant is at similar risk of harm, or more precisely, that she is a dependent child pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 3} Mother\u2019s first child, F.M., was born on August 14, 2007. At four months of age, F.M. was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a hematoma on her brain and bruising on her chest. The child was subsequently adjudicated to be abused and dependent by the juvenile court pursuant to a stipulation by the parties. No perpetrator was ever identified. There is no evidence that either of A.W.\u2019s parents was involved in harming F.M., and no criminal charges were brought against anyone. Mother initially engaged in a reunification plan, but at 17 years of age, she ultimately decided to surrender her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 4} At the conclusion of the proceedings regarding F.M., the CSB caseworker learned that Mother was pregnant with another child. Thereupon, the caseworker initiated inquiries to area hospitals, which resulted in CSB\u2019s learning when and where Mother delivered A.W. Two days after the child\u2019s birth on March 15, 2010, CSB removed the infant from the hospital, based upon a claim that she was at risk of harm. The agency sought and obtained temporary custody upon an adjudication of dependency. Mother has now appealed and has assigned six errors for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\n<em>First Assignment of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The trial court committed reversible error when it improperly found dependency under [R.C.] 2151.04(D) as that finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 5} In her first assignment of error, Mother argues that the trial court finding of dependency under R.C. 2151.04(D) is not supported by the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">{\u00b6 6} In its complaint, CSB alleged that A.W. was dependent under R.C. 2151.04(C), maintaining that the child\u2019s \u201ccondition or environment is such as to warrant the state, in the interests of the child, in assuming the child\u2019s guardianship.\u201d The agency subsequently amended its complaint to also include R.C. 2151.04(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">{\u00b6 7} Following the adjudicatory hearing, the magistrate found A.W. to be dependent under R.C. 2151.04(C). Thereafter, the trial judge rejected that finding and found A.W. to be dependent under R.C. 2151.04(D) instead. On appeal, Mother challenges the trial court finding that A.W. was dependent under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>R.C. 2151.04(D). CSB does not challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that A.W. was not dependent pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 8} In determining whether an adjudication of a child as abused, neglected, or dependent is against the manifest weight of the evidence, this court \u201c \u2018[reviews] the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the [trier of fact] clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the [adjudication] must be reversed[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>In re M.H., </em>9th Dist. No. 09CA0028, 2009-Ohio-6911, 2009 WL 5150363, at \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 9} Moreover, an adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Juv.R. 29(E)(4) and R.C. 2151.35(A). Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 368, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">R.C. 2151.04(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2151.04(D) provides that a dependent child is a child to whom both of the following apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">(1) The child is residing in a household in which a parent, guardian, custodian, or other member of the household committed an act that was the basis for an adjudication that a sibling of the child or any other child who resides in the household is an abused, neglected, or dependent child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">(2) Because of the circumstances surrounding the abuse, neglect, or dependency of the sibling or other child and the other conditions in the household of the child, the child is in danger of being abused or neglected by that parent, guardian, custodian, or member of the household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">R.C. 2151.04(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">{\u00b6 11} A finding of dependency under this section requires proof that both of the above provisions apply. Thus, a lack of clear and convincing evidence on either paragraph will prevent a finding of dependency under R.C. 2151.04(D). Under the first paragraph of the statute, CSB was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that A.W. would be residing in a household in which a member of that household had committed an act that was the basis of an adjudication that F.M. was an abused or dependent child. Alternatively, CSB was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that A.W. would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>residing in a household in which a member of that household committed an act that was the basis of an adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency as to any other child residing in A.W.\u2019s household. See <em>In re P.G., </em>2d Dist. No. 22706, 2008-Ohio-4015, 2008 WL 3199474, at \u00b6 24 (statutory language suggests that if the previously harmed child is not a sibling of the child at issue, then \u201cit would make sense\u201d that those two children should live in the same household before R.C. 2151.04(D) is applicable). In this case, there is no evidence that any child who was not a sibling would be residing in A.W.\u2019s household. Therefore, the focus of this matter is upon that portion of the statute that refers to an adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency as to a sibling.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 12} Mother contends that CSB did not present evidence that satisfies the requirements of R.C. 2151.04(D)(1) because F.M. is not AW.\u2019s sibling, as Mother\u2019s parental rights to F.M. were terminated at the time of A.W.\u2019s birth. We disagree. In examining the language of the statute, the legislature did not qualify the word \u201csibling\u201d in any manner. Thus, although there may have been a legal termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights, this did not negate the sibling relationship that was established by virtue of F.M. and AW.\u2019s common biological mother. Consequently, for purposes of R.C. 2151.04(D), F.M. and A.W. are siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 13} Mother next argues that CSB failed to satisfy R.C. 2151.04(D)(1) because F.M. would not be residing in the household with A.W. Although the parties have extensively debated the meaning of the word \u201chousehold\u201d as applied to the statute, that issue is not dispositive. This court has previously rejected Mother\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 2151.04(D)(1) on this point. In <em>In re E.R., </em>we held that when the previously harmed child and the child at issue are siblings, the child at issue is not required to reside in the same household as the sibling who had previously been harmed. <em>In re E.R., </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA0108-M, 2006-Ohio-4816, 2006 WL 2661046, at \u00b6 32. Other courts considering the question have similarly concluded that the phrase \u201cwho resides in the household\u201d modifies \u201cany other child\u201d and not \u201ca sibling of the child.\u201d Id. See <em>In re M.W., </em>7th Dist. No. 07 BE 40, 2008-Ohio-4525, 2008 WL 4120021, at \u00b6 18, citing <em>In re S.M., </em>12th Dist. No. CA2006-08-030, 2007-Ohio-2297, 2007 WL 1394634, at \u00b6 17, and <em>In re P.G., </em>2008-Ohio-4015, 2008 WL 3199474, at \u00b6 24. The consequence of this conclusion is that R.C. 2151.04(D)(1) is applicable to this case, notwithstanding the fact that A.W. would not be residing in the same household as her sibling, F.M. See <em>In re E.R., </em>2006-Ohio-4816, 2006 WL 2661046, at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 14} Finally, Mother contends that CSB failed to demonstrate that the person who committed the act that resulted in the adjudication as to F.M. would be residing with A.W. as required under R.C. 2151.04(D)(1). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2151.04(D)(1) specifically requires that A.W. reside \u201cin a household in which a parent, guardian, custodian, or other member of the household committed an act that was the basis for an adjudication\u201d of AW.\u2019s sibling. Only three people were expected to be residing with A.W.: Mother, the maternal grandmother, and Mother\u2019s 16-year-old sister. Significantly, the record contains no evidence whatsoever that any of those individuals committed an act that formed the basis of the adjudication regarding F.M., as is required by R.C. 2151.04(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 16} CSB acknowledges that it has no evidence that Mother abused or neglected F.M., even though it reportedly conducted an investigation. Nor is there any evidence that the maternal grandmother or Mother\u2019s sister committed such acts. In fact, no one was charged with or convicted of harming F.M. There is no medical evidence in the record regarding any of the details surrounding F.M.\u2019s condition. Nor is there any evidence as to when F.M. might have been injured, who took her to the hospital, whether Mother reacted appropriately upon learning of F.M.\u2019s condition, what treatment the child received, the child\u2019s current condition, or whether any part of the child\u2019s condition was the result of an intentional act, an accident, or even a medical condition. The agency presented no evidence that a member of A.W.\u2019s household had \u201ccommitted an act\u201d that was the basis for F.M.\u2019s adjudication. Thus, CSB failed to connect any members of AW.\u2019s household to F.M.\u2019s condition in order to demonstrate that a similar risk of harm existed for A.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 17} Notwithstanding, CSB has argued that the statute is satisfied simply by virtue of Mother having custody of F.M. In other words, Mother should be deemed to have committed an act that resulted in F.M.\u2019s adjudication because F.M. was in her care and custody at the time that harm befell F.M. In effect, CSB contends that because Mother had custody of her child, she was responsible for everything that happened to her, regardless of whether Mother was present, involved, or had any knowledge of the situation and regardless of whether F.M.\u2019s condition was the result of intention, accident, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 18} Of course, parents are always ultimately \u201cresponsible\u201d in a broad sense for their children, but we have not found any authority that provides such a sweeping interpretation of the \u201ccommitted an act\u201d language contained in R.C. 2151.04(D). In ascertaining legislative intent and applying a statute, this court is obligated to give effect to the words used in a statute. <em>Pearn v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 228, 2002-Ohio-3197, 772 N.E.2d 712, at \u00b6 63, citing <em>Lesnau v. Andate Ent., Inc. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 467, 471, 756 N.E.2d 97. R.C. 2151.04(D) contains language that requires that a member of A.W.\u2019s household \u201ccommitted an act\u201d that formed the basis of an adjudication of her sibling. In keeping with the plain language of the statute, we conclude that there must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>clear and convincing evidence that some person in the child\u2019s household committed an act that resulted in an adjudication of that child\u2019s sibling. See <em>Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 52 (\u201cAn unambiguous statute must be applied in a manner consistent with the plain meaning of the statutory language, and a court cannot simply ignore or add words\u201d). Our application of the plain language of the statute is also consistent with our understanding of the legislative intent of R.C. 2151.04(D): \u201cto protect the next child from a similar fate.\u201d <em>In re E.R., </em>2006-Ohio-4816, 2006 WL 2661046, at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 19} The Twelfth District Court of Appeals has addressed a situation in which the perpetrator against the first child was also unknown, but ample facts and evidence were placed upon the record, which permitted the trial court to conclude that the second child would be residing with one of the four people responsible for the prior abuse. See <em>In re S.M., </em>12th Dist. No. CA2006-08-030, 2007-Ohio-2297, 2007 WL 1394634. In <em>S.M., </em>the record contained specific findings by the trial court that the first child had been intentionally and brutally injured by one of four people who were also members of the second child\u2019s household and would be responsible for that child\u2019s care. Id. at \u00b6 4. Therefore, on the basis of the record before it, the reviewing court was able to affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the continued presence of the same four people put the second child in danger of being abused or neglected. Id. at \u00b6 17. See also <em>In re Pieper Children </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 318, 323-324, 619 N.E.2d 1059 (separation between mother and abusive father was a sham, permitting the conclusion that restoring custody to mother would subject the children to possible further abuse). In marked contrast to the detailed record and specific findings by the court in <em>S.M., </em>no such evidence was presented in this case, and no detailed findings were made based upon the record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 20} Based upon the record before this court, we find that CSB failed to present clear and convincing evidence that A.W. would be residing in a household with a person who committed an act that was the basis for the adjudication regarding F.M. Accordingly, CSB has not clearly and convincingly established the statutory requirements of R.C. 2151.04(D)(1). Having concluded that CSB failed to meet its burden of proof regarding R.C. 2151.04(D)(1), this court need not consider R.C. 2151.04(D)(2). Nor have we considered R.C. 2151.04(C), because that statute was not properly before us. Mother\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 21} Mother\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. The remaining assignments of error need not be addressed. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). The judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-6\">Dickinson, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b420-7\">Carr, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b420-8\">Carr, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 22} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">{\u00b6 23} I agree that CSB has not challenged the trial court\u2019s determination that A.W. was not dependent pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(C). Therefore, I am unable to render an opinion as to the propriety of that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">{\u00b6 24} I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion that CSB failed to present clear and convincing evidence that A.W. was residing in a household in which a person residing therein committed an act that was the basis for an adjudication that A.W.\u2019s sibling was an abused, neglected, or dependent child so as to find A.W. dependent pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(D). I would not construe the phrase \u201ccommitted an act that was the basis for an adjudication\u201d as narrowly as does the majority. I do not believe that the legislature intended to protect only those children whose siblings had been abused or neglected under known circumstances by clearly identifiable perpetrators who had been held criminally accountable. Rather, I believe that the legislature intended to provide a safety net for all children whose siblings had been subjected to circumstances giving rise to their abuse, neglect, or dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">{\u00b6 25} In this case, A.W.\u2019s sibling was adjudicated abused and dependent based on Mother\u2019s stipulation to those facts. Mother\u2019s act of stipulating that F.M. was abused and dependent resulted in that child\u2019s adjudication as such. Notwithstanding the absence of evidence regarding th\u00e9 specific circumstances resulting in F.M.\u2019s injuries, I would conclude that Mother\u2019s stipulation that the child was both abused and dependent constituted the commission of an act that formed the basis of the child\u2019s adjudication pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">{\u00b6 26} Moreover, I would conclude that the circumstances surrounding F.M.\u2019s abuse and dependency, specifically the child\u2019s sustaining of unusual, unexplained, and significant injuries, indicate that A.W. is in danger of being abused or neglected by a person in the household so as to satisfy R.C. 2151.04(D)(2). Accordingly, I would affirm the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of dependency.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
