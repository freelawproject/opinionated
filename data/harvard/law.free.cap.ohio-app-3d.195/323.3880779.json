He was sentenced to a five-year term of imprisonment on each count, to be served consecutively, for an aggregate term of 20 years, with five years of mandatory postrelease control. He was classified as a Tier II sexual offender. Trial counsel filed a timely notice of appeal and requested that Nichols be appointed new counsel for the appeal; this motion was overruled by the trial judge. Counsel was then appointed by this court. Nichols appeals from his conviction, challenging only his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Nichols worked as a janitor at the Enon Elementary School for approximately four years, and one of his responsibilities was to clean the cafeteria after lunch. Pursuant to his plea, Nichols admitted to sexual contact with four girls, who were first- and second-grade students at the school; specifically, according to the facts stated by the prosecutor at the plea hearing, he touched the girls \u201con their butts and pubic area of their skirts and under their skirts and over their clothing\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while they worked with him to clean the cafeteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 3} Nichols was indicted on four counts of gross sexual imposition, which occurred over a period of five months, and pleaded guilty to each offense. In exchange, the state agreed that a presentence investigation (\u201cPSI\u201d) would be prepared and considered before sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 4} The PSI that was submitted to the court included a probation department report, which indicated that Nichols was 40 years old, was married with two young children, and had no prior adult or juvenile criminal record. It also included numerous letters from Nichols\u2019s family members, church associates, friends, and his attorney asking that his good character, contributions to the community, and genuine remorse be considered in imposing sentence. The PSI did not include any recommendation from the court\u2019s probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 5} The court was also presented with a \u201cVictim Impact Statement\u201d regarding one of the victims, R.T.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a letter purportedly from another victim, B.P. The two other victims chose not to complete victim-impact statements, but one of the mothers spoke at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 6} According to the victim-impact statement, R.T.\u2019s mother reported changes in her daughter\u2019s behavior, including \u201ccrying a lot, nervousness, not sleeping, biting her fingernails and being withdrawn.\u201d It also indicated that R.T. had become more \u201cintroverted.\u201d Under headings entitled \u201cPhysical Injuries Suffered by Victim\u201d and \u201cSeriousness and Permance [sic] of Injuries,\u201d the statement indicated \u201cN/A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 7} The letter from B.P.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated, \u201cI feel really upset that you did this to all these girls, including me. I\u2019m very mad and upset that you did this to younger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>girls. You made my mom be very worried about me. I\u2019ve been doing bad at school because of you. I hope this time in prison really makes you think of what you did and understand everything you\u2019ve done to hurt people. I\u2019m not going to let this overpower my life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 8} A third victim\u2019s mother spoke at the sentencing hearing. She stated that her daughter, A.B., had \u201cnightmares, bedwetting, anger issues and anxiety\u201d and was in therapy \u201cto help her get through this.\u201d She also stated that her daughter was insecure, had low self-esteem, and was fighting with her siblings in ways that the mother attributed to the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 9} The prosecutor\u2019s comments at sentencing included an acknowledgement that Nichols\u2019s statement of remorse was \u201cone of the most sincere statements [he had] heard\u201d in his many years of prosecuting sexual crimes against children, noting that Nichols did not ask for the minimum sentence or for leniency and commenting on Nichols\u2019s \u201ctrue genuine remorse.\u201d However, the prosecutor cited the young age of the victims, the existence of multiple victims, and Nichols\u2019s \u201cbrazen\u201d act of abusing the children in a public place as factors contributing to the seriousness of the offense. The prosecutor encouraged the court to impose a \u201csubstantial sentence\u201d and consecutive sentences because of the high risk of recidivism with \u201cpedophilia\u201d and because a concurrent sentence \u201creally only punishes him for one crime, one act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 10} As discussed above, the trial court sentenced Nichols to the maximum term of imprisonment on each count and ordered that his sentences be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 11} Nichols raises two assignments of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s sentence is contrary to law in that it totally failed to apply the factors for recidivism mandated by O.R.C. 2929.12(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by imposing maximum consecutive sentences herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">{\u00b6 14} Nichols argues that the trial court failed to properly apply the law and abused its discretion in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences under the circumstances presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.11(A). A court that imposes a sentence for a felony has discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11. R.C. 2929.12(A). \u201cAlthough <em>[State </em>v.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>Foster </em>[109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470] eliminated judicial fact-finding, courts have not been relieved of the obligation to consider the overriding purposes of felony sentencing, the seriousness and recidivism factors, or the other relevant considerations set forth in R.C. 2929.11, 2929.12, and 2929.13.\u201d <em>State v. Hairston, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 289, 2008-Ohio-2338, 888 N.E.2d 1073, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 16} We review a felony sentence using a two-step procedure. <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 4. \u201cThe first step is to \u2018examine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>179 Ohio App.3d 97, 2008-Ohio-5775, 900 N.E.2d 1037, \u00b6 4, quoting <em>Kalish </em>at \u00b6 4. If this step is satisfied, the second step requires that the trial court\u2019s decision be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Id. Generally, abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is grossly unsound, unreasonable, illegal, or unsupported by the evidence. <em>State v. Money, </em>Clark App. No. 2009CA119, 2010-Ohio-6225, 2010 WL 5276904, \u00b6 13. A brief, but thorough, attempt to define the term is set out by Judge Fain in <em>State v. Beechler, </em>Clark App. No. 09CA54, 2010-Ohio-1900, 2010 WL 1731784, \u00b6 60-70. In felony sentencing, the sentencing court abuses its discretion if it unreasonably or arbitrarily weighs the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>Columbiana App. No. 09 CO 31, 2010-Ohio-3456, 2010 WL 2891699, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2929.12(B) and (C) enumerate factors to be considered in weighing the seriousness of an offender\u2019s conduct, and R.C. 2929.12(D) and (E) enumerate factors to be considered in weighing the likelihood of the offender\u2019s recidivism. The court also may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and principles of sentencing. <em>State v. Saunders, </em>Greene App. No. 2009 CA 82, 2011-Ohio-391, 2011 WL 334299, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court stated that it considered the statutory factors in imposing its sentence, and it imposed a sentence within the statutory range. Accordingly, Nichols\u2019s sentence was not \u201cclearly and convincingly contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b6 19} Having concluded that Nichols\u2019s sentence was not contrary to law, we must consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence that it did. R.C. 2929.12(A) mandates that in exercising its discretion, \u201cthe court shall consider the factors set forth in divisions (B) and (C) of this section relating to the seriousness of the conduct and the factors provided in divisions (D) and (E) of this section relating to the likelihood of the offender\u2019s recidivism and, in addition, may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving those purposes and principles of sentencing.\u201d The court did not elaborate on which factors it considered, nor was it required to do so. <em>Foster, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraph seven of the syllabus. The court had discretion to consider additional relevant factors as well. To the extent it may consider other, nonstatutory factors (e.g., facts adduced at trial, prior arrests, crimes of which the defendant was acquitted, otherwise inadmissible evidence that was suppressed), the court did not indicate that it did so, and the record does not contain any such factors. In addressing Nichols\u2019s argument that the court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence, we must consider the seriousness and recidivism factors more closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Seriousness</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 20} Factors \u201cindicating that the offender\u2019s conduct is more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense\u201d (R.C. 2929.12(B)) include (1) the physical or mental injury to the victim was exacerbated because of the physical or mental condition of the victim, (2) the victim suffered serious physical, psychological, or economic harm as a result of the offense, (3) the offender held a public office or position of trust in the community, and the offense related to that office or position, (4) the offender was obliged by the nature of his profession or occupation to prevent the offense or bring others committing it to justice, (5) the offender\u2019s professional reputation or occupation was used to facilitate the offense or is likely to influence the future conduct of others, (6) the offender\u2019s relationship with the victim facilitated the offense, (7) the offender committed the offense for hire or as a part of an organized criminal activity, and (8) in committing the offense, the offender was motivated by prejudice based on race, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. R.C. 2929.12(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 21} No evidence was presented or contained in the PSI that the physical or mental injury to any of the victims was exacerbated by her physical or mental condition, that the offenses were committed for hire, or that race, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, or religion played a role in the offenses. R.C. 2929.12(B)(1), (7), and (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 22} Although Nichols worked for a school district, he did not hold a public office or position of trust. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the term \u201cposition of trust,\u201d as used in R.C. 2929.12(B)(3), applies to a private individual (as opposed to a public official) only if the person occupied a fiduciary relationship or other \u201cspecial relationship of trust\u201d with the victim. <em>State v. Massien, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 204, 2010-Ohio-1864, 926 N.E.2d 1282, \u00b6 41. \u201cAn unrestrained application of the phrase \u2018position of trust\u2019 to \u2018every breach of ethical, moral, or filial duty by a private individual\u2019 is not consistent with the sentencing principles set forth by the General Assembly * * Id. at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Applying the standard set forth in <em>Massien, </em>the trial court could not have reasonably concluded that Nichols had \u201c \u2018held a public office or position of trust in the community,\u2019 and the offense related to that office or position.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 24} The PSI contained limited information about the physical and psychological harm to the victims. (R.C. 2929.12(B)(2).) The victim-impact statement indicated that R.T. suffered from \u201ccrying a lot, nervousness, not sleeping, biting her fingernails and being withdrawn,\u201d which her mother attributed to Nichols\u2019s conduct; but with respect to the seriousness and permanence of R.T.\u2019s injuries, the report contained the notation \u201cN/A.\u201d A.B.\u2019s mother reported similar behavior issues. B.P.\u2019s letter stated that she was \u201cvery mad and upset\u201d at Nichols. The PSI contained no information about the other two victims and no indication that any of the children were being treated by healthcare professionals for physical or psychological problems, although A.B.\u2019s mother stated at the sentencing hearing that her daughter was \u201cin therapy.\u201d We do not question that the victims sustained psychological harm, but any such harm is inherent in the offense for which the legislature established a penalty range and does not appear to be \u201cmore serious than [would result from] conduct normally constituting the offense.\u201d The trial court could not have reasonably concluded that any of the victims \u201csuffered serious physical, psychological, or economic harm\u201d (R.C. 2929.12(B)(2)) based on the information before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 25} Nichols\u2019s occupation (R.C. 2929.12(B)(5)), which could also be construed as his \u201crelationship with the vietim[s]\u201d (R.C. 2929.12(B)(6)), was used to facilitate the offense, in that his role as a janitor at the school gave him access to the victims. However, the nature of his occupation did not oblige Nichols \u201cto prevent the offense or bring others committing it to justice.\u201d R.C. 2929.12(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 26} In sum, the only factor indicating that Nichols\u2019s offense was more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense of gross sexual imposition was that his occupation facilitated the offense. In so holding, we do not suggest that Nichols\u2019s offenses were not serious criminal offenses; we simply conclude that they were not \u201cmore serious than conduct normally constituting the offense,\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 2929.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Factors indicating that an offender\u2019s conduct is less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense include (1) the victim induced or facilitated the offense, (2) in committing the offense, the offender acted under strong provocation, (3) in committing the offense, the offender did not cause or expect to cause physical harm to any person or property, (4) there are substantial grounds to mitigate the offender\u2019s conduct, although the grounds are not enough to constitute a defense. R.C. 2929.12(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cPhysical harm\u201d means \u201cany injury, illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(3). In adopting this definition, the Legislative Service Commission commented that \u201cwhile physical illness is included in the concept of physical harm to persons, mental illness is not. Serious mental conditions are reserved for the definition of serious physical harm to persons, but the milder mental disturbances cannot be pinpointed with sufficient precision for use in the criminal law.\u201d A psychological effect on the victim does not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cphysical harm.\u201d <em>State v. Dawson </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 443, 16 OBR 515, 476 N.E.2d 382; <em>State v. Collier, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20131, 2005-Ohio-119, 2005 WL 78548, \u00b6 61. Therefore, the \u201cless serious\u201d factor that \u201cthe offender did not cause or expect to cause physical harm to any person or property\u201d is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 29} None of the other factors enumerated as R.C. 2929.12(C), which indicate that the offender\u2019s conduct is less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense, are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Recidivism</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 30} A court \u201cshall consider\u201d all of the following factors that apply regarding the offender, and any other relevant factors, as factors indicating that the offender is \u201clikely to commit\u201d future crimes: (1) at the time of committing the offense, the offender was under release from confinement before trial or sentencing, was under postrelease control for an earlier offense, or had been unfavorably terminated from postrelease control for a prior offense, (2) the offender previously was adjudicated a delinquent child or has a history of criminal convictions, (3) the offender has not been rehabilitated to a satisfactory degree after previously being adjudicated a delinquent child or has not responded favorably to sanctions previously imposed for criminal convictions, (4) the offender has demonstrated a pattern of drug or alcohol abuse that is related to the offense, and the offender refuses to acknowledge that he has demonstrated that pattern, or the offender refuses treatment for the drug or alcohol abuse, and (5) the offender shows no genuine remorse for the offense. R.C. 2929.12(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 31} With respect to Nichols\u2019s likelihood of committing future crimes, several of the statutory factors are inapplicable because Nichols had no criminal record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>or prior involvement with the justice system (R.C. 2929.12(D)(1 through 3)). He also had no pattern of drug or alcohol abuse (R.C. 2929.12(D)(4)). The prosecutor commented on Nichols\u2019s \u201ctrue genuine remorse,\u201d and the judge acknowledged that \u201cif I was here to grade you on whether or not you\u2019re respectful in Court, you\u2019d get an A-plus. Whether or not you\u2019re remorseful, you\u2019d probably get an A-plus. Whether or not you have support from friends and family you get an A-plus.\u201d (R.C. 2929.12(D)(5)). Thus, none of the statutory factors are present indicating a likelihood of committing future crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, we review the factors \u201cindicating that the offender is not likely to commit future crimes\u201d: (1) prior to committing the offense, the offender had not been adjudicated a delinquent child, (2) prior to committing the offense, the offender had not been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense, (3) prior to committing the offense, the offender had led a law-abiding life for a significant number of years, (4) the offense was committed under circumstances not likely to recur, and (5) the offender shows genuine remorse for the offense. R.C. 2929.12(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 33} Again, Nichols\u2019s lack of a criminal record, the undisputed fact that he \u201chad led a law-abiding life for a significant number of years,\u201d and his remorsefulness make it less likely that he will commit future offenses. Moreover, because Nichols\u2019s conviction in this case makes it very unlikely that he will ever be employed in a school again, the circumstances under which these offenses took place are \u201cnot likely to recur.\u201d Therefore, all of the \u201cnot likely to commit future crimes\u201d factors are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> {\u00b6 34} A trial court has discretion to impose any sentence within the authorized statutory range, but in exercising its discretion, it is nonetheless required to consider the statutory policies and factors that apply to every felony offense. <em>Hairston, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 289, 2008-Ohio-2338, 888 N.E.2d 1073. Insofar as only one of the statutory factors applied to suggest that Nichols\u2019s offense was more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense, and there were no statutory or nonstatutory factors tending to show that Nichols is likely to commit future crimes and all of the statutory factors were present to show that he is not likely to commit future crimes, it is difficult to imagine the trial court\u2019s basis for imposing maximum consecutive sentences in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 35} After imposing sentence, the court remarked to Nichols, \u201cIn one of the letters there was a comment about what good would it do for you to sit in prison for twenty years. The answer to that is: You won\u2019t be able to hurt anybody for the next twenty years.\u201d While this may be literally accurate, it could be said about, and then used to subjectively justify, the maximum sentence in every case irrespective of the offense or the offender. It is vital to avoid both the reality and \u201cperception that no clear standards are being applied, and that the rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>law is imperiled by sentences imposed for no discernible reason other than the subjective reactions of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Harmelin v. Michigan </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 957, 1007, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Consideration of the statutory factors does not support such a sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 36} Further, at the sentencing hearing, the judge stated to Nichols: \u201cI\u2019m not here to be concerned about what happens to you. Whether or not you\u2019re rehabilitated * * * \u2014 It\u2019s not my job to worry about what happens to you. It\u2019s my job to punish you, and it\u2019s my job to protect the community.\u201d Although the court correctly identified that the overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender, it seems to have ignored the fact that to achieve those purposes, the court was required to consider, among other things, rehabilitating the offender. R.C. 2929.11(A). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge [should] consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\u201d <em>Pepper v. United States </em>(2011), \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1240, 179 L.Ed.2d 196, citing <em>Koon v. United States </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392. \u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe </em>(1937), 302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S.Ct. 59, 82 L.Ed. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 37} Certainly, there are acts that could be called \u201cthe worst form of the offense\u201d or offenders who by their actions or psychopathic make-up are not subject to habilitation, let alone rehabilitation. However, with the facts before it, by sentencing a 40-year-old first-time offender with no prior criminal record to 20 years in prison, the trial court failed to reasonably consider the concept of rehabilitation. See <em>State v. Parker, </em>193 Ohio App.3d 506, 2011-Ohio-1418, 952 N.E.2d 1159, \u00b6 64, citing <em>State v. Culp </em>(May 25, 2001), Champaign App. No. 2000CA17, 2001 WL 561288.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 38} At the sentencing hearing, the court stated that the \u201cdamage here is way too great to temper it with people that want to tell me what a good guy you are.\u201d However, there is little, if any, evidence in the record to suggest that the victims suffered \u201cgreat\u201d damage. As we discussed above, there was no evidence of physical injury, and while the anger, fear, and disturbances experienced by the children are heartbreaking, there is nothing in the record to suggest that these injuries are qualitatively greater than those predictably experienced by any victim of a gross sexual imposition or that the children are unlikely to overcome these effects in a reasonable period of time with the love and support of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>families and the knowledge that Nichols has admitted his wrongdoing and been punished for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">{\u00b6 39} We in no way detract from the criminality of Nichols\u2019s actions and the wrong done to the children; however, treating this case as if it were the most serious form of the offense and Nichols as being the most depraved offender is not supported by the record and, further, depreciates the lawfulness and validity of such a finding in those cases that truly do merit such conclusions. As Justice Lanzinger has written, \u201c[i]t is a rare victim who does not consider the crime committed by an offender to be undeserving of a maximum penalty. * * * It will take a courageous judge not to \u2018max and stack\u2019 every sentence in multiple-count cases.\u201d <em>Hairston, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 289, 2008-Ohio-2338, 888 N.E.2d 1073, at \u00b6 31 (Lanzinger, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 40} The court recited that it had considered \u201cthe record, oral statements of counsel, the defendant\u2019s statement, the pre-sentence investigation report, the principles and purposes of sentencing under Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.11, and * * * the seriousness and recidivism factors under Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.12.\u201d And we have held that even absent such a statement, we presume that the court properly considered the factors. <em>State v. McClure, </em>Montgomery App. No. 24129, 2011-Ohio-1415, 2011 WL 1086699, \u00b6 15. \u201cWhile it is prudent to a trial court to mimic the language of a sentencing statute * * * the exact language [of] the sentencing statute is not \u2018talismanic,\u2019 and, therefore, the trial court need not recite the exact language * * * as if it amounted to the \u2018magic words\u2019 necessary to impose a prison term on an offender.\u201d <em>State v. Marple, </em>Clermont App. No. CA2004-09-073, 2005-Ohio-6272, 2005 WL 3148083, \u00b6 30. But the converse is true as well \u2014 merely mimicking the \u201cmagic words\u201d does not by itself make a sentence lawful or not subject to an abuse-of-discretion analysis. The list of factors a court \u201cshall consider\u201d is not a parade of meaningless words, and the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Foster </em>jurisprudence does not contemplate unbridled discretion or converting a sentencing hearing into a peremptory proceeding. The maximum consecutive sentence imposed on Nichols was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b6 41} Nichols\u2019s assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 42} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-9\">Fain and Hall, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\">. Although the nature of the contact is not clear from the recitation of facts at the plea hearing, the probable-cause affidavit attached to the presentence investigation indicates that \"[n]o \u2018[s]kin-to-skin' touching\u201d occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-11\">. It is unclear who prepared the victim-impact statement. Its format is similar to the PSI prepared by the probation department, but it was not attached to that document, and it was not signed by the probation officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b360-12\">. The signature on this document looks like a child\u2019s handwriting, but the text appears to have been written by someone else.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. R.C. 2929.12(B)(9) relates to domestic violence and certain offenses \"involving a person who was a family or household member\u201d; it is not applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. <em>Massien </em>was decided one day before Nichols was sentenced. However, prior to <em>Massien, </em>this court had limited the applicability of the \"public office or position of trust\u201d criteria to public officials and public servants and did not apply it to private individuals. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(Nov. 13, 1998), Greene App. No. 98CA009, 1998 WL 864761; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22901, 2009-Ohio-6016, 2009 WL 3792359. Thus, even if the trial court had been unaware of the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Massien </em>when it sentenced Nichols, it could not have considered Nichols as holding a public office or position of trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
