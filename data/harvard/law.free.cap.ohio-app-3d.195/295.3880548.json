For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">{\u00b6 2} In July 2010, the Hamilton County Probate Court entered judgment against Schwartz for over $300,000. The trial court then issued a writ of execution, and sheriffs deputies later seized several items of personal property belonging to Schwartz. At a hearing the next day, Schwartz argued that some of this property was exempt from execution under R.C. 2329.66. He also told the court that he was unable to litigate the issue in person because he was scheduled to begin a prison term in less than a week. The court advised Schwartz that his attorney could represent him while he was incarcerated and scheduled a hearing on his exemption claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Before the second hearing, the estate moved for an order to sell some of the seized property at a \u201chigh end auction of art, antiques, and collectibles.\u201d Among the items listed in its motion were several slot machines, various Andy Warhol memorabilia, and celluloids of Looney Tunes and Disney cartoons. Together, this property was purportedly worth $8,270.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 4} At the second hearing, Schwartz\u2019s attorney argued that the items in the estate\u2019s motion were exempt from execution under R.C. 2329.66(A)(4)(a) as household goods and household furnishings that Schwartz held primarily for his personal, family, or household use. The court disagreed and ordered the sale of the property. Schwartz now appeals, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Schwartz argues that the trial court erred in ordering the sale of exempt property. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 6} Under R.C. 2329.66, persons domiciled in Ohio may hold certain property exempt from \u201cexecution, garnishment, attachment, or sale to satisfy a judgment or order.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This includes any \u201cinterest not to exceed [$525] in any particular item or [$10,775] in aggregate value, in household furnishings, household goods, wearing apparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, musical instruments, firearms, and hunting and fishing equipment that are held primarily for the personal, family, or household use of the person.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, whether a person may exempt property under this provision depends on the property\u2019s value, its type, and why the person holds it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 7} Schwartz argues that the trial court ordered the sale of \u201chousehold goods\u201d and \u201chousehold furnishings\u201d that he held primarily for his \u201cpersonal, family, or household use.\u201d The legislature has not defined these terms, and neither the Ohio Supreme Court nor Ohio\u2019s courts of appeals have interpreted them in this context. Therefore, we must construe their meaning as a matter of first impression. Statutory interpretation presents questions of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 8} Although there is no binding precedent, we do not lack guidance. For instance, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio has defined \u201chousehold goods\u201d under R.C. 2329.66 as \u201c \u2018items of personal property reasonably necessary for the day to day existence of people in the context of their homes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying this test, the court has held that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>television and one videocassette recorder are household goods, but that an extra television and a lawn edger are not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 9} The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio, however, disagreed with this approach when interpreting the nearly identically worded federal exemption statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court opposed any \u201cnecessity\u201d requirement as having no basis in the statute\u2019s language. Instead, the court held that \u201c \u2018household goods\u2019 * * * are those items of personal property that are typically found in or around the home and used by the debtor or his dependents to <em>support and facilitate day-to-day living within the home, </em>including maintenance and upkeep of the home itself.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under this test, the court determined that a water softener was a household good.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 10} This \u201cfunctional nexus\u201d test was first articulated by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>McGreevy v. ITT Fin. Servs</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court explained that \u201cthe requisite functional nexus exists where \u2014 and only where' \u2014 the good is used to support and facilitate daily life within the house. It is the household good\u2019s use <em>for these </em>purposes that distinguishes it from a good that is merely located and used within the house. Pots and pans are household goods <em>because </em>they are used to support and facilitate daily household living; a model car collection, by contrast, is not a household good because it serves no such purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 11} We adopt the <em>McGreevy </em>approach, which is consistent with the language of R.C. 2329.66 and the statute\u2019s underlying purpose \u201cto protect funds intended primarily for maintenance and support of the debtor\u2019s family.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the legislature had intended a \u201creasonably necessary\u201d test, it would have included this language in R.C. 2329.66(A)(4)(a), as it did in the exemption provisions for child support, spousal support, pensions, and annuities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This definition satisfies our duty to read the words and phrases of the Revised Code in context and according to the rules of grammar and common usage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And for the sake of consistency, it must apply with equal force to the term \u201chousehold furnishings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Next we must decide what it means to hold property for one\u2019s \u201cpersonal, family, or household use.\u201d In other chapters of the Revised Code, this phrase essentially distinguishes consumer purposes from business purposes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We find no reason to apply a different meaning here. We also agree with the <em>McGreevy </em>court that this requirement does not \u201cindependently ensure the existence of a functional nexus between the good and the household. This portion of the statute, however, requires only that the good be \u2018held\u2019 for a personal as distinguished from a commercial use, not that it actually be used for such a purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, Schwartz seeks to protect property that allegedly has sentimental value. But items that have only sentimental value, such as art, do not support and facilitate daily household living. Thus, this property cannot qualify as either household goods or household furnishings under R.C. 2329.66(A)(4)(a). Schwartz presented no evidence that any of the items either facilitated daily life in his household or were held for consumer purposes; therefore, he failed to carry his burden of proof.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we overrule his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 14} In his second assignment of error, Schwartz argues that he was denied due process of law because the trial court \u201crefused to allow\u201d him to claim his property as exempt. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 15} The United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution guarantee procedural due process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough the concept is flexible, at its core, procedural due process under both the Ohio and United States Constitutions requires, at a minimum, an opportunity to be heard when the state seeks to infringe a protected liberty or property right.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Schwartz personally appeared before the trial court to argue that some of his seized property was exempt from execution under R.C. 2329.66. Although he did not attend a second hearing on the issue, due to his incarceration, this does not mean that he was deprived of due process of law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court personally notified Schwartz about the second hearing, and there is no indication that Schwartz ever requested to attend.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, his counsel did attend and presented argument. On this record, we cannot say that Schwartz lacked either notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard. We overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-7\">Dinkelacker, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">.
