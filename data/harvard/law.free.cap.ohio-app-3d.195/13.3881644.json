Summerville, individually and in her capacity as administrator of her husband\u2019s estate, filed a complaint against Forest Park, Pape, and Hall, asserting causes of action for (1) excessive use of force under Section 1983, (2) deliberate indifference in failing to provide adequate medical care under Section 1983, (3) deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train under Section 1983, (4) wrongful death under R.C. 2125.01, (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (6) loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">{\u00b6 3} The officers moved for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 on the state-law claims and to qualified immunity on the federal claims. The city also moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to immunity on the state-law claims and that it was not liable for the officers\u2019 conduct with respect to the federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the officers on the state-law claims and on the Section 1983 claim for deliberate indifference in failing to provide adequate medical care. The court denied summary judgment to the officers with respect to Summerville\u2019s excessive-force claim. It also denied summary judgment to the city with respect to the claim for deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">{\u00b6 5} We dismissed the appeal by the city and the officers of the trial court\u2019s decision. In its opinion reversing this court\u2019s dismissal, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n order denying a motion for summary judgment in which an employee of a political subdivision [has] sought immunity from claims brought under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\n<em>Background Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">{\u00b6 6} On September 15, 2005, Detective Adam Pape of the Forest Park Police was dispatched to a residence for a \u201cpossible suicide, inside the bedroom with blood coming out.\u201d A life squad was on its way to the same residence. Within two or three minutes, Pape arrived at the home, where he was met by a distraught Leola Summerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">{\u00b6 7} Summerville told Pape that Roosevelt was upstairs. As Pape reached the top of the stairs, he could hear the sound of gurgled breathing. He turned to his right and saw Roosevelt lying on the floor of a bedroom at the end of the hallway. Roosevelt was lying on his back, with his feet near the bedroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 8} As Pape approached, he saw that Roosevelt was clutching with his right hand a knife that protruded from the left side of his chest. Pape radioed for the life squad to \u201cexpedite.\u201d Roosevelt pulled the knife from his chest and began to plunge it into his chest repeatedly, despite Pape\u2019s commands for him to stop. Pape used his Taser on Roosevelt, but Roosevelt used his left hand to pull one of the Taser\u2019s barbs from his chest. According to Pape, Roosevelt showed no indication that he felt pain from either the stabbing or the Taser barbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">{\u00b6 9} By that point, Forest Park Officer Corey Hall had arrived at the home and was standing in the hallway behind Pape.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">{\u00b6 10} After pulling out the Taser barb, Roosevelt started to stand up. According to Pape, Roosevelt fixed his gaze directly on him. Pape testified that \u201cit was obvious that he was angry that I had deployed the Taser.\u201d Pape kept yelling at him to stay down. But Roosevelt got to his feet, still holding the knife in his hand, and began moving towards Pape.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">{\u00b6 11} Pape backed out of the bedroom and pulled the door shut to establish a barrier between Roosevelt and himself, Hall, and Summerville. Then, to put distance between himself and the closed door, Pape stood in the doorway of an adjacent bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">{\u00b6 12} Within seconds, Roosevelt opened the bedroom door that Pape had shut. He was holding the knife in his right hand over his shoulder in a threatening manner. The knife\u2019s blade was pointed in a downward stabbing position. He was about five or six feet away from Pape.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">{\u00b6 13} Both officers began yelling at Roosevelt to drop the knife. But Roosevelt lunged toward Pape, raising the knife higher. Roosevelt had taken a step and a half in Pape\u2019s direction when Pape and Hall simultaneously fired their guns at Roosevelt, killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">{\u00b6 14} An autopsy revealed that Roosevelt had sustained four gunshot wounds, 11 penetrating stab wounds, and three superficial stab wounds. In addition, a barb from a Taser gun was removed from his abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\n<em>Assignments of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">{\u00b6 15} In two assignments of error, the city and the officers now argue that the trial court erred (1) by not granting summary judgment to the officers on the basis of qualified immunity on the Section 1983 claims and (2) by not granting summary judgment to the city on the Section 1983 claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">{\u00b6 16} We review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper if \u201c \u2018(1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>(2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion when viewing [the] evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>A. Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">{\u00b6 17} Qualified immunity shields a government official from civil liability unless (1) the official violated a statutory or constitutional right and (2) that right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the challenged conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cQualified immunity balances two important interests \u2014 the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">{\u00b6 18} The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that government officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the plaintiff fails to demonstrate that a constitutional right was violated or that the right was clearly established, she will have failed to carry her burden.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\n<em>1. No Constitutional Violation Occurred</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">{\u00b6 19} Claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive force are governed by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Application of the test for reasonableness \u201crequires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The use of deadly force is reasonable if \u201cthe officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">{\u00b6 20} In determining the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s use of force, courts must judge the situation \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Courts must allow \u201cfor the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 -in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">{\u00b6 21} In the summary-judgment context, <em>\u201cif </em>there is some evidence\u2014 more than a mere scintilla of evidence \u2014 that [the decedent], through his conduct, judged from the perspective of reasonable officers on the scene, did not give the officers probable cause to believe that he posed a serious threat of harm, a genuine fact dispute is created.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But \u201c \u2018the mere existence of <em>some </em>alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <em>genuine </em>issue of <em>material </em>fact.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">{\u00b6 22} Pape and Hall argue that the evidence demonstrated that they did not violate Roosevelt\u2019s constitutional rights. They contend that the circumstances had clearly established probable cause to believe that serious harm was imminently threatened and that their use of deadly force in self-defense was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">{\u00b6 23} In support of their summary-judgment motion, Pape and Hall offered the opinion of Joseph J. Stine, an expert in the training, practices, and procedures used by police in the performance of their duties. According to Stine, police officers are trained that when they encounter a person who is armed with a knife and ist deemed a threat, the officers should maintain a \u201creactionary gap of 21 feet between themselves and the person with the knife.\u201d If a suspect with a knife is within the \u201c21 foot reactionary gap,\u201d the suspect can stab or cut an officer before the officer has a chance to defend himself. Stine opined that in this case, the officers had been even more vulnerable to attack because Roosevelt had been only a few steps away when he had lunged at them. According to Stine, Pape and Hall had acted in accordance with professional police practices and procedures and within accepted guidelines for the use of deadly force.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">{\u00b6 24} On the other hand, Summerville argues that a genuine issue of fact remained as to whether the officers\u2019 use of force was unreasonable and excessive. First, she points to her own testimony that she had not seen Roosevelt rise from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>his position on the ground and that she had not heard the bedroom door being shut or reopened. But her testimony presented no genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">{\u00b6 25} Summerville testified that when she had gone upstairs, she saw her husband lying on the bedroom floor, stabbing himself. At that time, Pape had instructed her to go into the bathroom. She had acquiesced and had closed the bathroom door behind her. From the bathroom, she had heard the officers repeatedly instruct Roosevelt to drop the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">{\u00b6 26} At one point, Summerville testified, she had opened the bathroom door and had seen Pape standing immediately outside the bathroom, holding a Taser. She testified that she had not known whether Roosevelt was still on the ground at that time because she did not look into the bedroom. She had then closed the bathroom door and, within a minute, had heard four or five gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">{\u00b6 27} Summerville\u2019s testimony in no way contradicted the officers\u2019 testimony with respect to Roosevelt\u2019s actions immediately preceding the shooting. Her testimony did not dispute the officers\u2019 testimony that Pape had shut the bedroom door and that Roosevelt had lunged at Pape. Whether or not Summerville had seen Roosevelt get up or had heard the bedroom door being moved was immaterial to the determination of whether the officers had reasonably believed that Roosevelt posed an imminent risk of serious harm to them or to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">{\u00b6 28} Summerville also points to the report of her expert witness, Gary Rini, a forensic-science consultant, who opined that (1) the autopsy description of the bullet path of \u201cgunshot wound # 1\u201d precluded the possibility that Roosevelt\u2019s right arm had been \u201craised upright, and facing the officers,\u201d at the time he had sustained the wound; (2) based upon the width of the bedroom doorway and Roosevelt\u2019s final resting place on the bedroom floor, Roosevelt was inside the bedroom at the time he sustained his fatal gunshot wounds; and (3) based upon the autopsy\u2019s description of the bullet wounds through the body, and upon the officers\u2019 statements that they had fired their weapons at the same time, Roosevelt \u201ccould not have been standing upright, facing Pape and Hall, when he sustained his fatal gunshot wounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">{\u00b6 29} None of Rini\u2019s opinions created a genuine issue of material fact. Rini\u2019s opinion that Roosevelt\u2019s right arm could not have been \u201craised upright, and facing the officers\u201d at the time that he had sustained \u201cgunshot wound # 1\u201d was of no consequence because neither officer testified that Roosevelt\u2019s right arm had been raised in an upright position \u201cfacing\u201d them. Hall testified that as Roosevelt had started toward Pape, \u201chis torso leaned forward and the knife began to raise higher above his head and shoulders.\u201d Pape testified that Roosevelt\u2019s hand was above his shoulder and then went higher as he lunged. Moreover, even taken at face value, Rini\u2019s statement does not contradict the officers\u2019 testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Roosevelt was holding a knife as he advanced toward them in an aggressive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">{\u00b6 30} Rini\u2019s opinion that Roosevelt had been inside the master bedroom when he sustained his fatal gunshot wounds was immaterial as well. Pape testified that after having been shot, Roosevelt \u201cfell back into the bedroom almost into the exact same position he was when [Pape] initially came up the stairs.\u201d Hall testified, \u201c[M]y handgun was still up and he was gone \u2014 which means [Roosevelt] dropped out from below \u2014 then when I brought my handgun back down, I saw him on the ground.\u201d Even if it was true that Roosevelt had not fully exited the bedroom before being shot, the officers\u2019 uncontroverted testimony was that Roosevelt had been five to seven feet from Pape when he lunged one or two steps toward him and that both officers had believed that serious harm was imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, Rini opined, \u201cBased on the description of the bullet wounds provided in the autopsy, and the officers\u2019 statements that \u2018I think we shot at the very same time,\u2019 Mr. Summerville could not have been standing upright, facing Pape and Hall, when he sustained his fatal gunshot wounds.\u201d But Hall testified that Roosevelt\u2019s torso was bent forward. When Pape was asked whether Roosevelt had been \u201cstanding straight up,\u201d Pape responded, \u201cHe was lunging. * * * [H]is right foot [was] forward.\u201d When asked if Roosevelt\u2019s weight was forward, Pape answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Neither officer had testified that Roosevelt had been standing upright when he was shot, so Rini\u2019s opinion on that point was irrelevant. Moreover, the uncontradicted autopsy report, relied on by Rini in forming his opinion, explicitly described the four gunshot wounds as having entered the front of Roosevelt\u2019s body, thus supporting the officers\u2019 contention that he had been advancing toward them.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">{\u00b6 32} The relevant and undisputed testimony of the officers was that their attempts at controlling Roosevelt with nonlethal force \u2014 verbal commands and a Taser \u2014 had failed. Roosevelt had shown no signs of pain when he was stabbing himself or when he was struck by the Taser barbs. When he got up, he was holding a knife in a stabbing position while ignoring the officers\u2019 commands to drop the knife. He lunged toward Pape, who stood just a few feet away, and both officers believed that Roosevelt presented an imminent risk of death or serious injury to themselves and to Summerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">{\u00b6 33} Summerville failed to adduce evidence refuting the officers\u2019 account of the circumstances they confronted. Consequently, Summerville failed to present a genuine issue of material fact on her claim that Pape and Hall had violated Roosevelt\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure. Moreover, she failed to demonstrate that they were not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Therefore, we hold that Pape and Hall are entitled to qualified immunity on Summerville\u2019s Section 1983 claims against them. We sustain the first assignment of error and enter judgment for both Pape and Hall on those claims. Because Summerville has not shown that Pape and Hall used excessive force in shooting at Roosevelt, we need not address whether Roosevelt had a \u201cclearly-established\u201d right to be free from being fired upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\n<em>B. No Liability for the City</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">{\u00b6 35} Because Summerville failed to establish that the officers had committed a constitutional violation, the city of Forest Park cannot be held liable under Section 1983.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we sustain the second assignment of error and enter judgment in favor of Forest Park on Summerville\u2019s failure-to-train claim under Section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-8\">Sundermann, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-14\">. <em>Summerville v.
