Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to support the administrative decision, we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">{\u00b6 2} Ohio\u2019s Smoke Free Workplace Act, R.C. Chapter 3794, prohibits proprietors of public places or places of employment from permitting smoking in those places. R.C. 3794.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">{\u00b6 3} On May 16, 2009, Franklin County received a complaint that people were smoking in the Tavern, a bar in Grove City, Ohio. As a result, Franklin County opened an investigation. Shortly thereafter, Kent Bradley and Jere Marks, registered sanitarians for Franklin County, inspected the Tavern as part of that investigation. On the evening of June 10, 2009, Bradley and Marks walked into the Tavern and observed several patrons smoking at a table in the bar. For a period of five minutes, they did not observe any Tavern employee ask the patrons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to stop smoking or to take their cigarettes outside. When the wife of the Tavern\u2019s owner recognized the inspectors, she asked the patrons to stop smoking, and they immediately complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">{\u00b6 4} Based on those observations, Franklin County found that the Tavern violated Ohio\u2019s Smoke Free Workplace Act by permitting smoking in prohibited areas (\u201csmoking violation\u201d). Because the Tavern had prior smoking violations, and because this violation was determined to be intentional, Franklin County imposed a $2,000 fine for this smoking violation. The Tavern, through counsel, requested an administrative review to contest the smoking violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">{\u00b6 5} At the administrative hearing, Bradley and Marks testified to the facts described above. The Tavern presented additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">{\u00b6 6} Pam Parker, who is married to the owner of the Tavern, testified that the Tavern has a strict no-smoking policy. The bar has a number of no-smoking signs, has no ashtrays inside the bar, and instructs its employees to ask smokers to either stop smoking or to take the cigarettes outside. Parker was at the Tavern on the night in question. She testified that the people smoking at the Tavern that night were not regulars and that some of them had been smoking since they arrived at the bar. She stated that shortly after those patrons arrived, she asked them to stop smoking. However, some of them did not comply with her request. She did not think it was reasonable to take any other steps to prevent them from smoking after they refused her first request to stop smoking. She further stated that the Tavern was \u201cstruggling for business now,\u201d and she implied that she was unwilling to kick out more people because they were smoking. After she saw the inspectors enter the Tavern, she told the patrons who were smoking that they would be fined if they did not stop, and they put out their cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">{\u00b6 7} At the end of the hearing, Franklin County affirmed the smoking violation. Franklin County concluded that the Tavern permitted smoking by not taking reasonable measures to prevent smoking in the establishment. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">{\u00b6 8} The Tavern appeals and assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">I. The trial court erred in affirming the decision of the Franklin County Board of Health where the inspectors failed to conduct an interview of the proprietor, employees, or patron\u2019s of Parker\u2019s Tavern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">II. The trial court erred in finding that Parker\u2019s Tavern permitted smoking within the establishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">{\u00b6 9} This appeal is governed by R.C. 119.12. R.C. 3794.09(C); <em>The Boulevard v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-837, 2010-Ohio-1328, 2010 WL 1229184, \u00b6 7. Therefore, the trial court reviews the agency\u2019s order to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. Determining whether an agency order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence is essentially a question of the presence or absence of the requisite quantum of evidence. In undertaking this hybrid form of review, the trial court must give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts, but the findings of the agency are not conclusive. <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 110-111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">{\u00b6 10} On appeal to this court, the standard of review is more limited. Unlike the common pleas court, the court of appeals does not determine the weight of the evidence. In reviewing the common pleas court\u2019s determination that an agency order is or is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, the appellate court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the common pleas court abused its discretion. <em>Ace Ventures L.L.C. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp., </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-280, 2003-Ohio-6556, 2003 WL 22889567, \u00b6 6. On questions of law, the court of appeals\u2019 review is plenary. <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 587 N.E.2d 835, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">First Assignment of Error \u2014 Ohio Adm.Code 3701-52-08(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">(\u00b6 11} In- this assignment of error, the Tavern argues that Franklin County did not comply with Ohio Adm.Code 3701-52-08(D) because Bradley and Marks did not conduct interviews of the owner, employees, or patrons. However, the Tavern did not make this argument in the trial court. The failure to raise this issue in the trial court forfeits this issue for appellate purposes. <em>Pole v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-1110, 2009-Ohio-5021, 2009 WL 3066676, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Colonial Village Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 493, 2007-Ohio-4641, 873 N.E.2d 298, \u00b6 15. Accordingly, we will not consider the issue, and we overrule the Tavern\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Second Assignment of Error \u2014 Did The Tavern Permit Smoking?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">{\u00b6 12} The Tavern argues in this assignment of error that there was insufficient evidence in the record to prove that it permitted smoking. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">{\u00b6 13} To prove a violation of R.C. 3794.02(A), Franklin County had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Tavern permitted smoking. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Pour House, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 680, 2009-Ohio-5475, 925 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 18-20. A proprietor permits smoking when the proprietor affirmatively allows smoking or implicitly allows smoking by failing to take reasonable measures to prevent patrons from smoking, such as by posting no-smoking signs and notifying patrons who attempt to smoke that smoking is not permitted. Id., citing <em>Traditions Tavern v. Columbus, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 383, 2006-Ohio-6655, 870 N.E.2d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Tavern argues that it did not permit smoking because it took the measures to prevent patrons from smoking that this court mentioned in <em>Pour House. </em>While the Tavern did take the measures mentioned in <em>Pour House, </em>compliance with those measures is not, by itself, sufficient to prove that an owner did not permit smoking in every case. The preventive measures mentioned in <em>Pour House </em>were only examples of measures that an owner could take to demonstrate a reasonable attempt to prevent smoking in the establishment. We did not indicate that implementation of those specific measures created a \u201csafe harbor.\u201d Whether the owner took reasonable measures to prevent its patrons from smoking depends on the particular circumstances and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">{\u00b6 15} Here, Bradley\u2019s and Marks\u2019s observations are reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that support the smoking violation. They observed patrons smoking in the bar and did not witness anyone from the Tavern ask them to stop smoking until shortly after the inspectors were recognized. <em>The Boulevard, </em>2010-Ohio-1328, 2010 WL 1229184, at \u00b6 18. The Tavern is a small bar, and the patrons in question were openly smoking. The inspectors stated that cigarette smoke was very noticeable as soon as they entered the Tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">{\u00b6 16} Parker testified at the administrative hearing that she had asked the patrons to stop smoking about an hour before the inspectors arrived, and some of them had refused. She did not approach the patrons again until after the inspectors arrived. Given these particular circumstances, one request to the patrons to stop smoking in an hour may not constitute reasonable measures to prevent smoking. We cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to support the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">{\u00b6 17} Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it affirmed the Tavern\u2019s smoking violation, we overrule the Tavern\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">{\u00b6 18} Having overruled the Tavern\u2019s two assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-11\">Sadler and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
