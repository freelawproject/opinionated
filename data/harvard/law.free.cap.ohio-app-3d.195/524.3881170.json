For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 2} On December 17, 2009, Brimacombe was indicted on one count of rape, a first-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(a) and (b), and four counts of sexual battery, fourth-degree felonies, in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(5) and (B). The substance of the indictment charged Brimacombe with separate instances of felony sexual conduct with his stepson beginning in October 2003, when the boy was 12 years old, and continuing through July 2008. The indictment alleged that the sexual conduct occurred in Brimacombe\u2019s home in Sylvania, Ohio, where the victim and his mother also resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 3} On December 23, 2009, following Brimacombe\u2019s request for pretrial release on bond, the trial court set an aggregate monetary bond of $210,000 on the five counts. As additional conditions of release, the court ordered Brimacombe to have no contact with the victim and to \u201csurrender all weapons and guns owned by him to the Sylvania Police Department.\u201d On January 5, 2010, he was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. The court granted Brimacombe\u2019s request to travel beyond Lucas County for work purposes while on release. Previous terms and conditions of the bond were ordered continued, but \u201cwith the following stipulation [that] any and all weapons in the possession of attorney [Ken] Sass, relating to this case, shall be turned over to the Sylvania Police Department; a total of seven (7) firearms shall be surrendered in all, no later than 4:30 p.m. on the 6th day of January 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 4} Eventually, on May 28, 2010, Brimacombe pleaded guilty to the rape count charged under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(a) and (b). Nolle prosequi were entered on the four sexual-battery counts. The sentencing transcript indicates that after informing Brimacombe of the consequences of his guilty plea, the court permitted the prosecutor to ask him a series of questions to which he responded in more detail about his relationship to the victim, the specific sexual conduct involved, and the dates and location where it occurred. After this questioning, the court accepted his guilty plea and reviewed defense counsel\u2019s sentencing memorandum. A presentence investigation and report were waived. The court received mitiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tion statements from defense counsel and Brimacombe and a victim-impact statement from the victim\u2019s mother. The prosecutor offered no statement, but asked the court to order the surrendered weapons destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 5} The court then proceeded with sentencing and sexual-offender classification hearings. The court imposed the maximum term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment on the rape count and ordered Brimacombe to be registered as a Tier-Ill child-sex offender. The court also imposed five years of mandatory postrelease control and then further stated: \u201c[A]ny and all weapons that were confiscated, those will be ordered destroyed.\u201d A judgment entry recounting Brimacombe\u2019s plea and sentence and ordering the firearms destroyed was filed June 2, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 6} This appeal followed. Brimacombe now assigns two errors for review, the first of which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cA. The trial court\u2019s [sic] abused its discretion when it sentenced the appellant to a maximum prison term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 8} In support of the first assignment, counsel for Brimacombe asserts that the court abused its discretion in failing to articulate the specific aspects of his conduct that warranted the maximum sentence. Counsel points to Brimacombe\u2019s having no prior criminal record, his steady employment for 15 years, and the numerous favorable letters that his friends and colleagues filed with the court. Balanced against these positive facts, he argues that the court misapplied the sentencing factors in R.C. 2929.12 by \u201cfailing] to provide any support on the record\u201d as to how Brimacombe\u2019s sexual abuse of his stepson was \u201cmore serious than conduct that normally constitutes the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellate courts review assigned errors challenging the sentencing court\u2019s application of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under the two-step approach announced in <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before evaluating Brimacombe\u2019s maximum sentence under <em>Kalish, </em>however, we will first address his contentions regarding the general application of R.C. 2929.12 in the wake of <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 10} After <em>Foster, </em>\u201ctrial courts have full discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required <em>to make findings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>or give their reasons </em>for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences.\u201d Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus. (Emphasis added.) While trial courts are not required to make findings or give reasons for imposing such sentences, they still must carefully consider the sentencing statutes that apply to every felony case. See <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 38. R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 were left undisturbed by <em>Foster </em>and thus remain the two principal statutes for the trial court to employ when sentencing felony offenders. See <em>State v. Teel, </em>6th Dist. No. S-06-045, 2007-Ohio-3570, 2007 WL 2013529, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Elswick, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-L-075, 2006-Ohio-7011, 2006 WL 3833868, \u00b6 53. As well, the court must be \u201cguided by statutes that are specific to the case itself.\u201d <em>Mathis </em>at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2929.12 is a guidance statute. It sets forth the seriousness and recidivism criteria that a trial court <em>\u201cshall consider </em>\u201d in fashioning a felony sentence. Id. at \u00b6 38. Subsections (B) and (C) establish the factors indicating whether the offender\u2019s conduct is more serious or less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. Subsections (D) and (E) contain the factors bearing on whether the offender is likely or not likely to commit future crimes. While the phrase \u201cshall consider\u201d is used throughout R.C. 2929.12, the sentencing court is not obligated to give a detailed explanation of how it algebraically applied each seriousness and recidivism factor to the offender. Indeed, no specific recitation is required. <em>State v. Arnett </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 208, 215, 724 N.E.2d 793. Merely stating that the court considered the statutory factors is enough. Id. See also <em>State v. Friess, </em>6th Dist. No. L-05-1307, 2007-Ohio-2030, 2007 WL 1229313, \u00b6 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 12} We turn now to Brimacombe\u2019s argument regarding the trial court\u2019s choice of the maximum sentence for his rape conviction. In <em>Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, the Supreme Court established a \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d approach for appellate review of felony sentences, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cFirst, [appellate courts] must examine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. If this first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>prong is satisfied, the trial court\u2019s decision shall be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Kalish </em>at \u00b6 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 14} Here, our review of Brimacombe\u2019s sentence is abbreviated, for he concedes that it \u201cwas not contrary to law.\u201d A choice of sentence from within the permissible statutory range cannot, by definition, be contrary to law. Id. at \u00b6 15. Thus, Kalish\u2019s first prong is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 15} The second prong directs us to review the trial court\u2019s \u201cexercise of its discretion in selecting a sentence within the permissible statutory range,\u201d using the sentencing record as the context. <em>Kalish </em>at \u00b6 17. This prong employs the traditional language for assessing discretion \u2014 that is, whether in selecting a specific prison term the court\u2019s decision was \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. Brimacombe argues that his receipt of the maximum sentence was an abuse of discretion because he did not meet any of the statutory criteria for likely recidivism and, further, the court failed \u201cto explain on the record\u201d how the admitted conduct was more egregious than comparative behavior in other child-rape cases. These two points, he insists, indicate that the court must have ignored the criteria set forth in R.C. 2929.12(B) and (D)(1) through (4). We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 16} Brimacombe\u2019s plea of guilty operated as a judicial admission of factual guilt. Crim.R. 11(B)(1); <em>State v. Barnett </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 244, 248, 596 N.E.2d 1101. As a complete admission of guilt, it embraced not only the discrete acts alleged, but the totality of the substantive conduct involved in committing the crime. Id. We have thoroughly reviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statements at the hearing graphically informed the court that Brimacombe\u2019s stepson suffered exacerbated psychological harm from the sexual abuse. The abuse began when the boy was 12 and continued over four years. The admitted conduct included anal and oral penetration. The court specifically noted how Brimacombe\u2019s acts had inflicted severe, if not irreparable, mental and emotional harm on his victim. As described, the boy had been a \u201cbright and happy A-B student,\u201d but the abuse rendered him depressed and angry, and he began failing in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 17} Statements taken at the hearing also indicated how Brimacombe\u2019s method of manipulation and control, combined with overt threats, verbal abuse, and his physically intimidating stature, was an aggravating part of the total conduct. To monitor access and movement, he installed cameras and warning buzzers throughout the home, including the boy\u2019s bedroom. Additional state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ments indicated that the boy had been threatened \u201cnot to tell his mother,\u201d implying that harm might ensue if the abuse were revealed. Finally, the court stated its belief that the psychological and emotional damage suffered would be \u201clifelong\u201d and that cruelty was indicated by Brimacombe\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated pattern of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 18} A sentencing court has broad discretion to determine the relative weight to assign the sentencing factors in R.C. 2929.12. <em>Arnett, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 215, 724 N.E.2d 793, citing <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 193, 631 N.E.2d 124. R.C. 2929.12(B)(1) requires the court to consider whether the victim\u2019s age made Brimacombe\u2019s conduct more serious than conduct that would normally constitute the offense. That section explicitly recognizes that \u201coffenses against children are especially serious.\u201d <em>Arnett </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 19} As the sentencing transcript reflects, the court also considered Brimacombe\u2019s lack of a criminal record, acknowledged his employment history, and discussed the supportive letters it received on his behalf. However, the court could reasonably assign this evidence little or no mitigating weight as compared to the aggravating circumstances. <em>Fox </em>at 193. As we have said, the court is required only to <em>consider </em>these factors, not <em>explain </em>how it considered or assigned weight to any of them. <em>Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 20} Nonetheless, that the court weighed the sentencing factors is clear. The transcript reveals the court\u2019s explicit reference to R.C. 2929.11 and to balancing the seriousness and recidivism factors under R.C. 2929.12. These references, which were repeated in the sentencing entry, only further confirm that the court considered those factors. See <em>State v. Kase, 187 </em>Ohio App.3d 590, 2010-Ohio-2688, 932 N.E.2d 990, \u00b6 17-18. Nothing in the sentencing record otherwise suggests that the court\u2019s selection of the maximum sentence was \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d Under <em>Kalish\u2019s </em>second prong, no more is required. See <em>State v. Harris, </em>2008-Ohio-5873, 2008 WL 4885049, at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, the first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 22} The second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cB. The trial court without legal authority confiscate [sic] weapons or guns owned by the appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 24} At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, after defense counsel Schwab finished speaking, there occurred the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cMr. Sass: Your Honor, may I address the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-13\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe Court: On what basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cMr. Sass: My name is attorney Ken Sass. He [Brimacombe] does have the firearms disability at this time, Your Honor. If the Court would allow me to take possession of them, I would sell them to provide monetary value to the family. I would not give any access to anyone that is not allowed to have access to the weapons. They do have significant monetary value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe Court: What family are you going to provide it to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cMr. Sass: His mother, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe Court: No. Answer is no. Destroyed. Any questions?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 31} Counsel for Brimacombe argues that the court\u2019s rather quick and sententious order to destroy the firearms was a de facto forfeiture that disregarded the statutory procedure for forfeiting property in criminal cases. The state, in response, quotes only a portion of R.C. 2981.02, defining \u201cinstrumentality,\u201d and then summarily concludes that \u201cthe weapons should be destroyed pursuant to a legal order made by the trial court.\u201d That assertion, however, merely begs the question, for the court did not indicate on what statutory authority it relied in ordering the firearms destroyed. Hence, the state\u2019s abbreviated reply is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 32} As a general matter, forfeitures of property are not favored under Ohio law. <em>State v. Lilliock </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 23, 25, 24 O.O.3d 64, 434 N.E.2d 723; <em>State v. Clark, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 719, 2007-Ohio-6235, 880 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 8. \u201cWhenever possible, [applicable-forfeiture] statutes must be construed so as to avoid a forfeiture of property.\u201d <em>Lilliock </em>at 26. Thus, a forfeiture will not be presumed. Moreover, statutes \u201cin derogation of private property rights\u201d are strictly construed against the state. Id. See also <em>State v. Rogers, </em>5th Dist. No. CT2010-0013, 2010-Ohio-5543, 2010 WL 4621516, \u00b6 26. Here, the seven firearms at issue were surrendered to the Sylvania Police Department as one of the conditions of the court\u2019s order by which Brimacombe secured his pretrial release. Also, neither party disputes that as a putative felon then under indictment, Brimacombe fell within the legal disability of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). Thus, from penal interest as well, he was compelled immediately to divest himself of their possession. However, a strict construction against forfeiture precludes construing those reasons for surrendering the firearms as a basis for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 33} Effective July 1, 2007, the former statutes regulating the disposition of property seized and held by a law-enforcement agency, such as R.C. 2933.41 and 2933.43, were repealed. The General Assembly replaced them with a significantly different and comprehensive scheme under R.C. Chapter 2981. See <em>State v. Cruise, </em>185 Ohio App.3d 230, 2009-Ohio-6795, 923 N.E.2d 702, \u00b6 6. R.C. 2981.01 through 2981.14 now define and establish the mandatory procedures for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>forfeiture of property involved in, or relating to, certain offenses. They also delineate the notice requirements, procedures, and hearings for adjudicating the validity of interests asserted by third persons and for reviewing the proportionality of a particular forfeiture in relation to the value of the property involved. See R.C. 2981.03, 2981.04(D) through (G), 2981.05(B) and (C), and 2981.09; <em>State v. Jamison, </em>2d Dist. No. 23211, 2010-Ohio-965, 2010 WL 892082, \u00b6 29; <em>State v. Clark, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 719, 2007-Ohio-6235, 880 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 34} To pursue forfeiture of an offender\u2019s property, Chapter 2981 creates both a criminal process under R.C. 2981.04 and a civil process under R.C. 2981.05. R.C. 2981.03(F) allows the prosecutor to elect either process. Where the commission of an offense has entitled a law-enforcement agency to seize and hold \u201cproperty subject to forfeiture,\u201d that section also mandates that if \u201ca criminal forfeiture has <em>not </em>begun under section 2981.04 * * *, the prosecutor * * * <em>shall commence a civil action to forfeit that property </em>under section 2981.05}.]\u201d Id. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 35} Those general observations aside, certain portions of several of these statutes are directly relevant to resolving the forfeiture issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 36} Two of the purposes of R.C. Chapter 2981 are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(2) To ensure that seizures and forfeitures of instrumentalities are proportionate to the offense committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(3) To protect third parties from wrongful forfeiture of their property}.]\u201d R.C. 2981.01(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 2981.01(B)(6) defines \u201cinstrumentality,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c \u2018Instrumentality\u2019 means property <em>otherwise lawful to possess that is used in or intended to be used in an offense. </em>An \u2018instrumentality\u2019 may include, but is not limited to, a firearm, a mobile instrumentality, a computer, a computer network, a computer system, computer software, a telecommunications device, money, and any other means of exchange.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">{\u00b6 42} Pertinent here is R.C. 2981.02, on which the state bases its argument. It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(A) The following property is subject to forfeiture to the state or a political subdivision <em>under either the criminal </em>* * * <em>process in section 2981.01/ of the Revised Code or tke civil process in section 2981.05 of the Revised Code:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(3) An instrumentality that is used in or intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of any of the following offenses when the use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>intended use, consistent with division (B) of this section, is sufficient to warrant forfeiture under this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(a) A felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c(B) <em>In determining whether an alleged instrumentality was used in or was intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of an offense </em>or an attempt, complicity, or conspiracy to commit an offense in a manner sufficient to warrant its forfeiture, <em>the trier of fact shall consider the following factors the trier of fact determines are relevant:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(1) Whether the offense could not have been committed or attempted but for the presence of the instrumentality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(2) Whether the primary purpose in using the instrumentality was to commit or attempt to commit the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(3) The extent to which the instrumentality furthered the commission of, or attempt to commit, the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">{\u00b6 52} From the plain language of the foregoing statutes, it is apparent that R.C. 2981.01(B)(6) merely defines what an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d is within the larger forfeiture scheme. The purpose of R.C. 2981.02 is to identify the categories of \u201cproperty subject to forfeiture,\u201d i.e., contraband, proceeds, and instrumentalities. But that language in itself provides no authority to order forfeiture absent compliance with the requirements and timelines of either the criminal process in R.C. 2981.04 or the civil process in R.C. 2981.05. Subsections (A)(3)(a) and (B)(1) through (3) of that statute do nothing more than establish the predicate offense (i.e., a \u201cfelony\u201d) and the criteria by which the \u201ctrier of fact\u201d may determine, during an appropriate hearing, whether a particular firearm was used as an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d in committing that offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">{\u00b6 53} In addition to Chapter 2981, R.C. 2941.1417 became effective on the same date. That statute mandates the inclusion of a forfeiture specification in a charging instrument, such as an indictment. It states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 54} \u201c(A) <em>Property is not subject to forfeiture in a criminal case unless </em>the indictment * * * charging the offense specifies, to the extent it is reasonably known at the time of filing, the nature and extent of the alleged offender\u2019s interest in the property, a description of the property, and, <em>if the property is alleged to be an instrumentality, the alleged use or intended use of the property in the commission or facilitation of the offense. </em>The specification shall be stated at the end of the body of the indictment, count, or information and shall be in substantially the following form:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cSPECIFICATION (or SPECIFICATION TO THE FIRST COUNT). The grand jurors (or insert the person\u2019s or prosecuting attorney\u2019s name when appropriate) further find and specify that (set forth the alleged offender\u2019s interest in the property, a description of the property subject to forfeiture, and any alleged use or intended use of the property in the commission or facilitation of the offense).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(B) The trier of fact shall determine whether the property is subject to forfeiture. * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 57} Nothing in R.C. 2981.02 operates to avoid the prohibition on forfeiture in R.C. 2941.1417, where the indictment fails to contain the required specification identifying the property to be forfeited and alleging how it was used as an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d in committing the offense. Further, that prohibition is substantially repeated in R.C. 2981.04(A)(1), delineating the initiation of the criminal forfeiture process. That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cProperty described in division (A) of section 2981.02 of the Revised Code <em>may be forfeited under this section only if the </em>* * * <em>indictment </em>* * * <em>charging the offense * </em>* * <em>contains a specification of the type described in section 29jl.lJpl7 of the Revised Code </em>that sets forth all of the following to the extent it is reasonably known at the time of the filing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c(a) The nature and extent of the alleged offender\u2019s * * * interest in the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(b) A description of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c(c) <em>If the property is alleged to be an instrumentality, </em>the alleged use or intended use of the property in the commission or facilitation of the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">{\u00b6 62} Because it may not always be clear at the time of indictment whether, or to what extent, particular property was used in a crime so as to be an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d amenable to forfeiture, R.C. 2981.04(A)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cIf any property is not reasonably foreseen to be subject to forfeiture at the time of filing the indictment * * *, the trier of fact still may return a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>of forfeiture concerning that property in the hearing described in division (B) of this section <em>if the prosecutor, upon discovering the property to be subject to forfeiture, gave prompt notice of this fact to the alleged offender </em>* * * <em>under Criminal Rule 7(E) </em>[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 64} Because R.C. 2941.1417 and the foregoing provisions of Chapter 2981 refer to each other, and because all relate to the same general subject, these statutes must be read in pari materia. <em>Maxfield v. Brooks </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 566, 144 N.E. 725. Moreover, in construing statutes, the Supreme Court long ago held that \u201cthe word \u2018may\u2019 shall be construed as permissive and the word \u2018shall\u2019 shall be construed as mandatory unless there appears a clear and unequivocal legislative intent that they receive a construction other than their ordinary usage.\u201d <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dish </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 65} R.C. 2941.1417 and 2981.04(A)(1) and (2) are clearly mandatory in requiring (1) notice to the \u201calleged offender\u201d that the state will seek forfeiture of property believed to be an instrumentality used in committing the offense <em>and </em>(2) in requiring that such notice be given either by a specification in the indictment when filed or afterward, \u201cupon discovering\u201d that the property\u2019s use as an instrumentality renders it subject to forfeiture. Within the criminal process of R.C. 2981.04 generally, the procedures, rights, and obligations of the parties in pursuing or defending against forfeiture, and the rights of third parties with an alleged interest in the property (and the procedure for adjudicating their claims), are similarly mandatory, except when a permissive intent is explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 66} As applied to the firearms at issue here, there is little question that the trial court\u2019s order was a de facto forfeiture that was inconsistent with these statutory requirements. First, in issuing its order, the court did not cite as authority any provision of R.C. Chapter 2981. Second, none of the counts in the indictment, including the rape count, referred to any of the surrendered firearms, much less alleged any to be an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d in the form of the specification required by R.C. 2941.1417 and 2981.04(A)(1). <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2010-Ohio-5543, 2010 WL 4621516, at \u00b6 34; <em>State v. Coleman, </em>8th Dist. No. 91058, 2009-Ohio-1611, 2009 WL 866896, \u00b6 75-76. See also R.C. 2981.04(B) (\u201cIf a person pleads guilty to * * * an offense * * * <em>and the </em>* * * <em>indictment </em>* * * <em>contains a specification </em>covering property subject to forfeiture under section 2981.02 * * (Emphasis added.)) Between the filing of the indictment and the sentencing hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>nothing in the record indicates that the prosecutor furnished \u201cprompt notice\u201d to defense counsel that the firearms were being made \u201csubject to forfeiture,\u201d notwithstanding the lack of the specification. <em>State v. Haymond, </em>5th Dist. No. 2009-CA-00078, 2009-Ohio-6445, 2009 WL 4682145, \u00b6 35; <em>State v. Pollard, </em>8th Dist. No. 93002, 2010-hio-908, 2010 WL 877525, \u00b6 13. Indeed, there was no attempt at all to initiate forfeiture under either the criminal or civil process.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 67} Even assuming that such notice had been given in this case, the prosecutor did not demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence at the postplea hearing envisioned in R.C. 2981.04(B), that any of the firearms met the test for an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d using the criteria in R.C. 2981.02(B)(1) through (3). During sentencing, the prosecutor merely requested destruction of <em>all </em>the firearms previously surrendered, as if that followed automatically from the guilty plea. Under R.C. 2941.1417 and the applicable provisions of R.C. Chapter 2981, it did not. Given these deficiencies in complying with the statute, the trial court had no authority to order the firearms destroyed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Coleman; Haymond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 68} Both parties agree that Brimacombe\u2019s felony conviction prohibits him from acquiring, owning, possessing, using, or carrying firearms. His acquisition of that disability, however, is distinct from the consequence of forfeiture under R.C. 2981 et seq. His conviction also did not render the seven firearms in this case \u201ccontraband,\u201d although the trial court appeared to treat them as if they were. See <em>Cleveland v. Fulton, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 451, 2008-Ohio-4702, 898 N.E.2d 983, \u00b6 27-36; <em>Dayton v. Boddie </em>(1984), 19 Ohio App.3d 210, 211, 19 OBR 354, 484 N.E.2d 171. Thus, their disposition remains an issue, notwithstanding Brimacombe\u2019s admitted legal disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 69} Even when a valid forfeiture has been accomplished with respect to the <em>offender\u2019s </em>ownership or possessory interest, R.C. 2981.04(C) states that \u201c[t]he property vests with the state or political subdivision <em>subject to the claims of third </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>parties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. R.C. 2981.04(D), (E), and (F) address the rights of third parties and \u201c[a]ny person, <em>other than the offender </em>* * *, who asserts a legal interest in the property that is the subject of the order.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See R.C. 2981.04(E)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 70} Presumably, attorney Sass was attempting, as a third party, to assert the rights of some member of Brimacombe\u2019s family, seeking return of the firearms held by the Sylvania Police Department. On remand, the issue of their appropriate disposition will need to be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 71} Accordingly, the second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 72} We further find that the order to destroy the firearms is severable from the court\u2019s sentencing entry of June 2, 2010, and thus only that order is reversed and vacated. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision in order to determine the proper disposition of the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 73} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-10\">Handwork and Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-11\">.

Brimacombe relies on <em>Kalish </em>in claiming that an on-the-record explanation from the sentencing court is necessary in order to demonstrate how it weighed and applied the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12. <em>Kalish, </em>however, affords no aid for this view. Indeed, there the Supreme Court arguably moved from permitting merely pithy recitations of statutory factors in post <em>-Foster </em>sentences to allowing, if not approving, muteness. The <em>Kalish </em>court explicitly stated that a sentencing court need not give <em>any </em>reason for the sentence selected within the permissible range and that even a sentence imposed on a \"silent record\" will be presumed compliant with R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. See <em>Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, at \u00b6 12 and \u00b6 18, fn. 1, citing <em>State v.

Where the indictment contains the required specification, that section states that following a guilty plea or conviction, \u201cthe trier of fact shall determine whether the person\u2019s property shall be forfeited.\u201d Likewise, R.C. 2981.04(A)(3) distinguishes between \u201cissues of the guilt of the alleged offender\u201d and \u201cwhether property specified as subject to forfeiture should be forfeited.\u201d We also note that R.C. 2981.08(A) states, \u201cIn a criminal forfeiture action, the defendant has the right to trial by jury.\u201d See also R.C. 2981.04(B) (\"If the trier of fact is a jury * * * \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">.

During the sentencing hearing, the victim's mother alleged that Brimacombe carried \"a gun\u201d while making threatening remarks during the time he abused her son. On appeal, the state contends that this statement and nothing more was sufficient to support the trial court's order to destroy <em>all </em>the firearms. R.C. 2929.19(B)(1) directs that such statements be considered in imposing a sentence for the underlying offense; however, statements made in that context are not substitutes for the statutory pleading and proof requirements for forfeiture. Nor are they sufficient to adjudicate the rights of third parties claiming an interest in property the state seeks to forfeit. As noted, R.C. 2981.04(A)(3) explicitly distinguishes between issues relating to the defendant's guilt and \u2018\u2018whether property specified as subject to forfeiture should be forfeited.\u201d Moreover, as the record indicates, the state was fully aware of the firearms after the court\u2019s initial bond order and their surrender in January 2010 to the custody of the Sylvania Police Department. From the state\u2019s interaction with the victim's mother, it was presumably aware of her claim about Brimacombe's use of this firearm in relation to the acts for which he was indicted. Thus, the state had ample opportunity to give the postindictment notice under R.C. 2981.04(A)(2) and to pursue as \u2018\u2018instrumentalities\u201d subject to forfeiture any of the firearms that were provably used as such.
