DCWI contends that the trial court erred in failing to find that the auditor breached its duties under R.C. Chapter 5713. DCWI further contends that the trial court erred by disregarding the appraisal of DCWI\u2019s appraiser and by failing to conduct a hearing on valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in affirming the decision of the board of revision. The county auditor indicated at the board of revision hearing that he preferred to use actual income in applying the income approach to valuation of the property. By submitting the evidence that the county auditor specifically prefers, DCWI met its burden of presenting probative evidence that the value of its property was an amount other than the value determined by the auditor. The trial court failed to consider the actual-income evidence when considering valuation, and the court\u2019s decision, therefore, was not within its discretion. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2009, DCWI filed a complaint against the valuation of Parcel No. E20-019998-0161 for the tax year 2008. The Montgomery County Auditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>had. assessed the property for purposes of the tax year 2008 as having a true value of $852,720 and a taxable value of $298,460. This was an increase of $52,750 from the previous valuation of $799,970.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 4} The property consists of a 1.455-acre parcel of land located about six miles north of the downtown Dayton business district, within Harrison Township. The site improvements include a two-story office building on a slab foundation, a three-story office building on a slab foundation, an asphalt parking area, trees, and greenspace. Both buildings were constructed in 1969 of average grade materials and workmanship and were in average condition at the time of the last increase in valuation. Neither building has an elevator. One building has 9,656 square feet suitable for leasing, while the other contains 14,484 square feet, for a total leasing area of 24,140 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 5} In June 2009, the Dayton Board of Education (\u201cBOE\u201d) filed a counter-complaint, asserting that the valuation should not change. The Montgomery County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) then held a hearing in September 2009, at which time DCWI presented limited testimony, documentation of actual income and expenses, and the appraisal report of Leland Coe, a certified real-estate appraiser. Neither the BOE nor the auditor presented testimony or evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 6} In valuing the property, Coe rejected the cost approach because of the age of the structures. Based on the market approach and three allegedly comparable properties at 6300 North Main Street, 1612 Prosser Avenue, and 4517 Honeywell Court, Coe valued the property at $23 per square foot, for a total value of $555,220. At the hearing, Donald Wright briefly discussed the property at 6300 North Main, as well as two other comparable properties located at 4999 Northcutt Place and 249 Erdiel Drive that were for sale or had sold for approximately $22 per square foot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BOR was given some documentation about these properties that was not contained in Coe\u2019s appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">{\u00b6 7} Coe\u2019s appraisal also valued the property using the income approach. Coe indicated that the unadjusted ranges for the several comparable properties ranged from a low of $11 per square foot to $13 per square foot. After making adjustments to each of the leases, Coe assigned an adjusted price for the property of between $11.34 and $12.34 per square foot. Coe then gave the most weight to the middle of the range and used an adjusted rate of $12 per square foot. Coe then multiplied this figure by 20,507 square feet to arrive at a yearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>gross income of $246,084. Using 24,140 square feet would have resulted in an annual gross income of $289,680.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 8} Coe then projected a 15 percent vacancy and credit loss, which was the same vacancy rate as the majority of the properties in the area. This resulted in a deduction of $39,913 from the gross income figure, for an effective gross income of $209,171. From this amount, Coe deducted projected annual expenses (without real estate taxes) of $138,764, for a net operating income of $70,407. Using principles applicable to the income approach, Coe applied a capitalization rate of 13.38 percent, divided the operating income by that figure, and estimated a property value of $526,211, which he rounded down to $520,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 9} As noted, Coe used a lower square-footage figure than the total square feet in the buildings without explaining in the report why he chose that figure. If the larger square-footage figure (24,140) had been used, the final property valuation would have been $803,168. This equates to gross income of $289,680, minus the 15 percent vacancy rate of $43,452, which leaves $246,228 in effective gross income. Subtracting $138,764 in expenses from that amount, the net operating income would have been $107,464, and that amount divided by 13.38 percent is $803,168.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 10} Coe did not use the actual expense and income figures from the property. Those figures for the past five years were submitted to the BOR at the hearing and show steadily declining gross income between 2004 and 2008. Using the figures for the year ending on December 31, 2007, the total gross income was $226,622.90 (in contrast to 2004 gross income of $266,125.89). The actual vacancy rate was 31 percent, leaving an effective gross income of $156,369.80. The annual expenses, minus real estate taxes, were $114,541.43, which leaves a net operating income of $41,828.37. This amount divided by 13.38 percent yields a property valuation of $312,619 (rounded up).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 11} If a 15 percent vacancy rate is used rather than the actual vacancy rate, the effective gross income would have been $192,689.46. Applying the rest of the formula would result in a property valuation of $583,618 (rounded up).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">{\u00b6 12} At the BOR hearing, the county auditor\u2019s office indicated that it prefers to have actual income per square foot for office space, but if the county auditor does not have that, the market rate for the area is used. The county auditor had not previously asked for actual income and expenses when reappraising the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>property, nor had the owner offered these figures, because the owner was not informed that representatives of the county auditor\u2019s office had visited the property to reappraise it. The property owner did, however, provide actual income and expenses for the property at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 13} The county auditor\u2019s office also indicated at the hearing that its model applies a vacancy rate of 12 percent and an expense rate of 43 percent. The auditor\u2019s commercial property card for the property indicates, however, that his office uses an approximate 12 percent downward adjustment to the gross income rate to arrive at the effective gross income, further downward adjustments of approximately 56.8 percent of the effective gross income to arrive at the net operating income, and a capitalization rate of 0.141500 to arrive at the valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 14} If the BOR had applied these rates to the actual income of the property in 2007, the following results would have occurred: (1) Gross income of $226,622.90, (2) downward adjustment to gross income of 12 percent, or $27,194.75, to arrive at an effective gross income of $199,428.15, (3) downward adjustment of 56.8 percent of $199,428.15, to arrive at a net operating income of $113,275.19, (4) application of capitalization rate of 0.141500 to net operating income of $113,275.19, and (5) resulting valuation of $800,531.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 15} DCWI also presented evidence to the BOR of a decline in sales prices in the area during 2007 of approximately 6.5 percent, as well as evidence that a number of buildings in the area of the property were vacant or were declining in value. DCWI also testified about general depreciation of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 16} After hearing the evidence, the BOR concluded, without supplying any reasoning, that the value of the property would remain unchanged, at $852,720. DCWI filed an administrative appeal under R.C. 5717.05 to the common pleas court, which considered the matter on the transcript from the BOR and the briefs of the parties. No additional evidence was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court concluded that DCWI failed to meet its burden of producing sufficient evidence to warrant a reduction in value. The court based its decision on calculation errors, unsupported generalizations in Coe\u2019s income approach, and the failure of Coe\u2019s market approach to adjust for differences in size, age, and construction of the comparable properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">{\u00b6 18} DCWI appeals from the judgment of the trial court affirming the valuation of the BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">{\u00b6 19} DCWI\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred by failing to find that the auditor breached its duties under R.C. \u00a7 5713 et seq.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 21} Under this assignment of error, DCWI contends that the auditor failed to properly appraise the property, because he caused the property to be viewed only from the outside, did not obtain accurate information about the income generated, and used an unexplained \u201cneighborhood model\u201d that was based on unsupported guesswork.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 5713.01(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe auditor shall assess all the real estate situated in the county at its taxable value in accordance with sections 5713.03, 5713.31, and 5715.01 of the Revised Code and with the rules and methods applicable to the auditor\u2019s county adopted, prescribed, and promulgated by the tax commissioner. The auditor shall view and appraise or cause to be viewed and appraised at its true value in money, each lot or parcel of real estate, including land devoted exclusively to agricultural use, and the improvements located thereon at least once in each six-year period and the taxable values required to be derived therefrom shall be placed on the auditor\u2019s tax list and the county treasurer\u2019s duplicate for the tax year ordered by the commissioner pursuant to section 5715.34 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court concluded that the auditor is not required to inspect the interior of properties when performing appraisals. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 5713.01(B) does say that the auditor or its representative shall view the real estate, including improvements, at least once in each six-year period. The statute does not, however, specifically state that the auditor must inspect the interior of the property. R.C. 5713.03 also requires the county auditor to determine the true value of property from \u201cthe best sources of information available.\u201d Viewing the interior of the premises is one source of information about the condition of the property and could be helpful in establishing value. Again, however, the statute does not specifically state that the interior must be viewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">{\u00b6 26} Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 5703-25 contains various regulations that supplement the statutes. For example, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(A) provides that the auditor should determine the \u201ctrue value in money\u201d of property, after considering:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[A]ll facts tending to indicate the current or fair market value of the property including, but not limited to, the physical nature and construction of the property, its adaptation and availability for the purpose for which it was acquired or constructed or for the purpose for which it is or may be used, its actual cost, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the method and terms of financing its acquisition, its value as indicated by reproduction cost less physical depreciation and all forms of obsolescence if any, its replacement cost, and its rental income-producing capacity, if any. The assessor shall likewise take into consideration the location of the property and the fair market value of similar properties in the same locality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b628} Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(B) also requires the auditor to conduct reappraisals of property at least once during every six-year period. With regard to these reappraisals, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-07(B) states that land shall be appraised in accordance with Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-11. Similarly, Ohio Adm. Code 5703-25-07(C) states that buildings are to be appraised in accordance with Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-12. Significantly, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-12(C) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cBuilding inspection \u2014 Each building shall be measured to determine the number of square or cubic feet it contains, and a sketch shall be drawn on the property record card. Major buildings such as dwellings and barns shall be sketched on the property record card with other minor buildings to be numbered, the number encircled to appear in the space for the sketch of buildings in its proper relation to the dwelling and barn, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe exterior, and <em>if possible, </em>the interior of each building shall be inspected with notations being made on the record card of construction features, physical conditions, and other factors that would affect value. Each building shall be graded according to quality of construction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 31} Thus, the administrative regulations provide only that interior inspection is desirable; it is not required. In the case before us, the property card indicates that the buildings were last entered and information was gained in 1995 from a tenant. The property card also states that an entry in May 2007 was unsuccessful, because the occupant was \u201cnot home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 32} At the BOR hearing, witnesses were sworn, but the transcript of the hearing does not generally specify the particular speaker\u2019s name. Some individuals are self-identifying because they stated their names or through the context of their remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 33} An individual who identified himself as a \u201ctenant\u201d stated that to his knowledge, no one from the auditor\u2019s office had asked to enter the buildings. DCWI representatives also indicated that the buildings are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and there was no record of anyone from the auditor\u2019s office having come to view the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 34} The fact that DCWI or one tenant was not specifically aware of an attempt to view the property is irrelevant. A more effective practice may have been to leave notice of the attempt and ask the property owner to schedule an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>inspection, if desired. See <em>State ex tel. Holcomb v. Wurst </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 629, 579 N.E.2d 746 (auditor left information at the premises and asked property owners to call for an inspection). Nonetheless, the regulations require the auditor only to view the premises if possible, and the record indicates that the auditor did make an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">{\u00b6 35} DCWI also challenges the auditor\u2019s analysis because the auditor used a generalized \u201cneighborhood model\u201d that was based on unsupported guesswork and did not obtain actual income information about the property. The trial court rejected this claim, noting that DCWI\u2019s own appraiser, Coe, did not use the property\u2019s actual income as a basis for his opinion but used comparable properties to arrive at annual income. We agree with the trial court that Coe\u2019s report did not use actual income. However, we also conclude that the BOR was provided with actual income and expenses, which the auditor\u2019s representative said would be the auditor\u2019s preferred information for valuing the property. Inexplicably, the BOR and trial court failed to consider this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 36} Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-07(D) provides that in estimating the true value of property, a county auditor may consider any of the three recognized approaches to value: the market-data approach, the income approach, or the cost approach. Market data is most applicable to properties that are sold often, and the cost approach is generally difficult to apply in situations involving older or obsolete buildings. Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-07(D)(1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 37} DCWI\u2019s buildings had not been sold since 1985, and the buildings were also older in nature, having been constructed in 1969. Therefore, the income approach would have been most appropriate. Regarding the income approach, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-07(D)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe value is estimated by capitalizing the net income after expenses, including normal vacancies and credit losses. While the contract rental or lease of a given property is to be considered the current economic rent should be given weight. Expenses should be examined for extraordinary items. In making appraisals by the income approach for tax purposes in Ohio, provision for expenses for real property taxes should be made by calculating the effective tax rate in the given tax district as defined in paragraph (E) of rule 5703-25-05 of the Administrative Code, and adding the result to the basic interest and capitalization rate. Interest and capitalization rates should be determined from market data allowing for current returns on mortgages and equities. The income approach should be used for any type of property where rental income or income attributed to the real property is a major factor in determining value. The value should consider both the value of the leased fee and the leasehold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 39} The county auditor\u2019s office indicated in the hearing that it uses the income approach to value. The county auditor\u2019s office also stated that it prefers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to use actual income per square foot, but if that information is not available, the market value for the area would be used. At the hearing, DCWI questioned the validity of the auditor\u2019s \u201cneighborhood model,\u201d which was based on a vacancy rate of 12 percent and expenses of 43 percent. This resulted in attribution of a net operating income of $120,660 to the property. That net operating income is significantly above the net operating income of the property in 2007, as shown by the actual expenses and income. As was noted above, using the actual income and expenses results in valuation between $312,619 and $583,618, depending on the vacancy and loss rate applied. Even if the BOR and trial court had used the county auditor\u2019s own model for valuation, a reduction in value would still have been warranted. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in rejecting DCWI\u2019s claim that the actual income figures should have been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 40} The auditor did not err in failing to ask DCWI for actual income figures at the time of the inspection, nor did DCWI fail in its burden by not anticipating that the auditor might like to have these figures at the time of the reappraisal. The auditor was conducting a mass appraisal, and DCWI was not aware that the auditor had visited its premises. Therefore, neither party was at fault in not initially relying on actual-income-and-expense figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 41} Nonetheless, based on the county\u2019s representation that actual-income figures are preferred, the BOR and trial court should have taken those figures into consideration. Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding that DCWI\u2019s argument about actual-income figures was baseless. DCWI met its burden of presenting probative evidence that the value of its property was an amount other than the value determined by the county. <em>Fogg-Akron </em>Assoc., <em>L.P. v. Summit Cty.

The trial court concluded that insufficient evidence had been presented, because Coe\u2019s market approach failed to address differences in size, age, and construction of comparable properties. The court also held that Coe\u2019s income approach had calculation errors and used an unsupported generalization about using an income figure of $11.34 to $12.34 per square feet after making adjustments for leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>{\u00b6 46} In <em>Black v.

Bd. of Revision, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 428, 2009-Ohio-5260, 916 N.E.2d 1065, \u00b6 14 (noting that an appellate court \u2014 in that case, the Supreme Court of Ohio \u2014 has the right to decide legal conclusions).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>{\u00b6 50} In the case before us, the trial court acted outside its discretion when it failed to consider the evidence of actual income and expenses that was submitted to the BOR. The county auditor\u2019s office itself indicated that it prefers this data, and a reduction in value was warranted, even if the county auditor\u2019s own income-approach criteria are applied. Again, using the actual income and expenses results in valuation between $312,619 and $583,618, depending on the vacancy and loss rate applied. Even if the BOR and trial court had used the county auditor\u2019s own model for valuation, a reduction in value would still have been warranted, since the figure produced by that model was well below the current valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 51} We also note that the trial court did not fault Coe\u2019s income analysis, other than the calculation error in using a smaller number of square feet, and Coe\u2019s generalization about the adjusted market prices of $11.34 per square foot to a high of $12.34 per square foot (gross). The trial court observed that the latter comment was a generalized statement of little assistance, because details of the adjustment were not given. In view of the fact that the county auditor\u2019s office itself stated that it prefers to use actual-income figures, comparable square foot rates are not particularly relevant to the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 52} Even if these comparable rates were relevant, evidence was presented at the hearing that average sales prices and average sales depreciation in the area were down 6.52 percent and 10.44 percent, respectively, for the year 2007 and that a number of buddings in the area were in decline or were vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 53} In light of the above facts, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider evidence of actual income and expenses submitted to the BOR. When the auditor\u2019s office itself indicated a preference for using actual income in its calculation, the trial court should have considered that evidence in calculating the valuation of the property. DCWI met its burden of presenting probative evidence that the value of its property was an amount other than the value determined by the county. <em>Fogg-Akron Assoc., L.P., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 112, 2009-Ohio-6412, 919 N.E.2d 730, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">{\u00b6 54} DCWI\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">{\u00b6 55} Both of DCWI\u2019s assignments of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-12\">Donovan and Hall, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">. Wright\u2019s status was not identified at the hearing, but the auditor's property card indicates that the property was transferred by Donald C. Wright to the DCWI Office North, L.L.C. in 2004. No sales price was listed for the transfer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">. The discrepancy in figures may have arisen because the lower level of one building was not completely finished. Coe indicated at the hearing that he included this area within the gross building area, even though it was only somewhat finished. The appraisal report also indicates that a minimal amount of rent was being asked for the basement ($100 per month) and the space was vacant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. Comments about determining credibility and weighing evidence, while appropriate for most situations when the trial court is the fact-finder, are of questionable validity when the record, as here, is the same in both the trial and appellate courts. Applying an abuse-of-discretion standard also seems illogical when trial and appellate courts review the same documents and the trial court has not taken live testimony. Nonetheless, these are the standards, and we apply them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
