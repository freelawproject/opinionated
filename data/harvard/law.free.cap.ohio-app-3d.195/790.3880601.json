Kormanik, as the guardian for the estates of Violet Baxter and David Cooper, and defendant-appellant, the Ohio McGivney Pooled Special Needs Trust (\u201cMcGivney\u201d), filed these consolidated appeals. Kormanik and McGivney appeal from judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, that dismissed defendants-appellees, the state of Ohio and the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (collectively, the \u201cstate defendants\u201d), as parties. For the following reasons, we affirm the probate court\u2019s judgment regarding Baxter and we dismiss the appeals from the judgment regarding Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">{\u00b6 2} The probate court appointed Kormanik guardian of Baxter, who is 83 years old. Subsequently, Kormanik filed a petition asking the probate court to \u201ccreate a 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4)(C) qualifying pooled special-needs trust for the benefit of the ward, Violet Baxter, that maintains the Medicaid eligibility for the ward.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition named as defendants Baxter, the state of Ohio, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cODJFS\u201d), and McGivney.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Kormanik included the state of Ohio and ODJFS as defendants due to their statutory duty to \u201coversee[ ] Medicaid benefits and eligibility.\u201d Kormanik later amended the petition to join the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cFCDJFS\u201d) as a defendant. Kormanik added FCDJFS because it would be responsible for making the initial determination regarding Baxter\u2019s Medicaid eligibility once she applied for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 4} Instead of filing an answer, the state defendants moved for dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(1) and (6). In their motion, the state defendants asserted that Kormanik included them as defendants \u201csolely so [the probate court could] affirmatively determine whether Ms. Baxter is eligible for Medicaid.\u201d However, as the state defendants pointed out, the probate court did not possess jurisdiction to decide Medicaid eligibility. Because the court lacked authority to rule on Baxter\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid, the state defendants asserted that they had \u201cno significant role\u201d to play in the proceedings and should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 5} In response, Kormanik argued that federal and state statutes invested the probate court with jurisdiction to establish a pooled trust. According to Kormanik, the probate court could not establish a pooled trust without declaring that the trust complied with the applicable statutory requirements and that any assets transferred into the trust could not be counted as resources for the purpose of deciding Medicaid eligibility. Kormanik reasoned that \u201cif the [probate] court create[d] a pooled trust and declare[d] it to fit within the parameters of [federal and state statute], the State [would] be estopped from later arguing the creation of the trust and the transfer of assets into the trust was an invalid or disqualifying transfer.\u201d Due to the estoppel effect of the declaration, Kormanik argued that the state defendants had an interest to protect and should remain parties to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 6} The probate court agreed with the state defendants\u2019 argument, and it issued a judgment granting their motion to dismiss. Kormanik and McGivney appealed the judgment to this court. After reviewing the matter, we concluded that the dismissal of the state defendants did not completely resolve the action, because the probate court had yet to decide whether to grant Kormanik\u2019s petition and create the pooled trust. <em>Kormanik v. Cooper, </em>190 Ohio App.3d 184, 2010-Ohio-4745, 941 N.E.2d 110, \u00b6 9. As the judgment neither disposed of all issues nor contained Civ.R. 54(B) language, it did not constitute a final, appealable order. Id. at \u00b6 12. Consequently, we dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 7} Immediately before Kormanik and McGivney appealed the probate court\u2019s judgment, McGivney filed a motion for reconsideration. The probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>court held that motion in abeyance during the pendency of the appeal. Once we dismissed the appeal, Kormanik also filed a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 8} The probate court granted Kormanik and McGivney\u2019s motions for reconsideration and reanalyzed whether dismissal of the state defendants was appropriate. The reconsideration, however, did not produce a different result. In a judgment issued December 27, 2010, the probate court again dismissed the state defendants from the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">{\u00b6 9} Both Kormanik and McGivney now appeal the December 27, 2010 judgment. Kormanik assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">1. The trial court erred in dismissing the State of Ohio and the Ohio Department of Jobs [sic] and Family Services as defendants herein in that the Probate Court has jurisdiction over all beneficiaries in the creation and the construction of inter vivos trusts including those created pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">2. The trial court erred in dismissing the State of Ohio and the Ohio Department of Jobs [sic] and Family Services as defendants herein in that they are necessary parties for the creation and construction of the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-9\">3. The trial court erred in dismissing the State of Ohio and the Ohio Department of Jobs [sic] and Family Services as defendants herein in that the Probate Court has plenary power pursuant to R.C. 2101.24(C) to [dispose] fully of any matter that is properly before the court, unless the power is expressly otherwise limited or denied by a section of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-10\">{\u00b6 10} And McGivney assigns the following errors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-11\">1. The trial court erred in finding that the defendants, State of Ohio and Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, were not necessary parties to the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-12\">2. The trial court erred in finding that the plaintiff was requesting determination of Medicaid eligibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-13\">3. The trial court erred in finding that it- is not required under the Ohio Revised Code to make a finding pursuant to R.C. 5111.151(F)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">{\u00b6 11} Before addressing the merits of appellants\u2019 arguments, we must address the effect of Cooper\u2019s death on the viability of the appeals related to him. Cooper passed away on April 18, 2011. Soon thereafter, the state defendants filed a suggestion of death, and in it, they asserted that Cooper\u2019s death rendered moot Kormanik\u2019s request to use Cooper\u2019s assets to fund a special-needs pooled trust. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">{\u00b6 12} Actions are moot when \u201c \u2018they involve no actual genuine, live controversy, the decision of which can definitely affect existing legal relations.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>Ridgeway v. State Med. Bd., </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-1197, 2007-Ohio-5657, 2007 WL 3072635, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Lingo v. Ohio Cent. RR., Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-206, 2006-Ohio-2268, 2006 WL 1230679, \u00b6 20. Ohio courts exercise judicial restraint in cases that do not present actual controversies. <em>Tschantz v. Ferguson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 131, 133, 566 N.E.2d 655; <em>Fortner v. Thomas </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 51 O.O.2d 35, 257 N.E.2d 371. If while an action is pending, an event occurs that renders it impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief, the court will generally dismiss the action. <em>Tschantz </em>at 133, quoting <em>Miner v. Witt </em>(1910), 82 Ohio St. 237, 92 N.E. 21, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 13} Here, Cooper\u2019s death eliminates any need to place his assets in trust so that he can qualify for Medicaid. Accordingly, the underlying petition, as well as this appeal, are moot. We thus dismiss the two appeals related to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 14} Resolution of the remaining appeals requires an examination of the Medicaid program, and particularly, the role of pooled special-needs trusts in the determination of Medicaid eligibility. Congress established the Medicaid program in 1965 by adding Title XIX to the Social Security Act. <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. Ahlborn </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 268, 275, 126 S.Ct. 1752, 164 L.Ed.2d 459. Through the Medicaid program, the federal government provides financial assistance to states that reimburse needy persons for the cost of medical care. <em>Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Mfrs. v. Walsh </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 644, 650, 123 S.Ct. 1855, 155 L.Ed.2d 889; <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Health &amp; Family Servs. v. Blumer </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 473, 479, 122 S.Ct. 962, 151 L.Ed.2d 935. In order to participate in the Medicaid program, a state must adopt a plan for medical assistance approved by the secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201csecretary\u201d). Section 1396a(b), Title 42, U.S.Code; <em>Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Mfrs. </em>at 650. The plan must contain reasonable standards for determining eligibility for- medical assistance within the boundaries set by the Medicaid Act, Section 1396, Title 42, U.S.Code et seq., and its implementing regulations. Section 1396a(a)(17), Title 42, U.S.Code; <em>Blumer </em>at 479. Additionally, the plan must comply with Section 1396p(d), Title 42, U.S.Code, the section of the Medicaid Act that sets forth rules concerning trusts created with an individual\u2019s assets. Section 1396a(a)(18), Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 15} To be financially eligible for Medicaid assistance, a person must have income and resources below a threshold set by the secretary. Section 1396a(a)(17), Title 42, U.S.Code. As a general rule, a person\u2019s resources include assets placed in a trust, and thus, a state must consider trust assets in determining whether the person is eligible for Medicaid. Section 1396p(d)(3), Title 42, U.S.Code; <em>Wong v. Doar </em>(C.A.2, 2009), 571 F.3d 247, 252; <em>Keith v. Rizzuto </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 212 F.3d 1190, 1193. However, Congress provided an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>exception to this general rule. The rules established in Section 1396p(d)(3) do not apply to the type of trusts, commonly known as special-needs trusts, described in Section 1396p(d)(4). Section 1396p(d)(1), Title 42, U.S.Code (making the rules of Section 1396p(d)(3) \u201csubject to\u201d Section 1396p(d)(4), which precludes application of the rules to special-needs trusts); <em>Wong </em>at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 16} One of these special-needs trusts is called a pooled trust. <em>Lewis v. Alexander </em>(E.D.Pa.2011), 276 F.R.D. 421 (\u201c \u2018A \u201cpooled trust\u201d is a special arrangement with a non-profit organization that serves as trustee to manage assets belonging to many disabled individuals, with investments being pooled, but with separate trust \u201caccounts\u201d being maintained for each disabled individual\u2019 \u201d). Pursuant to Section 1396p(d)(4)(C), a pooled trust must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">(i) The trust is established and managed by a nonprofit association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">(ii) A separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust, but, for purposes of investment and management of funds, the trust pools these accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">(iii) Accounts in the trust are established solely for the benefit of individuals who are disabled (as defined in section 1382c(a)(3) of this title) by the parent, grandparent, or legal guardian of such individuals, by such individuals, or by a court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">(iv) To the extent that amounts remaining in the beneficiary\u2019s account upon the death of the beneficiary are not retained by the trust, the trust pays to the State from such remaining amounts in the account an amount equal to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary under the State plan under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">{\u00b6 17} Pooled trusts enable disabled persons to combine trust accounts, thus reducing management fees. <em>Lewis. </em>Additionally, the nonprofit associations that manage pooled trusts can use funds left in a beneficiary\u2019s account after death for the benefit of other pooled-trust beneficiaries. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">{\u00b6 18} Having examined the applicable federal Medicaid provisions, we now turn to Ohio law. Ohio participates in the Medicaid program. <em>Ohio Academy of Nursing Homes v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 14, 2007-Ohio-2620, 867 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 2. Thus, Ohio has adopted a plan, approved by the secretary, which includes rules for determining a person\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. See R.C. 5111.01 et seq.; Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39 et seq. (setting forth eligibility requirements for the aged, blind, and disabled). Ohio\u2019s plan designates ODJFS as the sole state agency to supervise the administration of the Medicaid program. R.C. 5111.01. Generally, the county department of job and family services, which in this case is FCDJFS, initially determines whether an applicant is eligible for Medicaid. R.C. 5111.012(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Upon receipt of a Medicaid application, FCDJFS must conduct a resource assessment to determine whether the applicant or recipient\u2019s aggregate resources exceed the \u201cresource limit.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1\u201439\u201405(C)(1). Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-05(B)(11) defines \u201cresource limit\u201d as the \u201cmaximum combined value of all resources an individual can have an ownership interest in and still qualify for [M]edicaid.\u201d For a person, the resource limit is $1,500. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-05(B)(11)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 20} A trust\u2019s assets may or may not be a countable resource. R.C. 5111.151(C); Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1. See also Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39\u201405(B)(3) (defining \u201ccountable resources\u201d as \u201cthose resources remaining after all exemptions have been applied\u201d). If an applicant or recipient is a beneficiary of a trust, FCDJFS must first determine what type of trust it is. R.C. 5111.151(C); <em>Pack v. Osborn, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 14, 2008-Ohio-90, 881 N.E.2d 237, \u00b6 9. The nature of the trust determines whether its assets are available resources in determining whether the applicant or recipient\u2019s resources exceed the maximum limit for Medicaid eligibility. Id. After categorizing the trust, FCDJFS must apply the appropriate provision of R.C. 5111.151 and Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1 to determine whether the trust\u2019s assets are countable resources. R.C. 5111.151(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">{\u00b6 21} Pooled trusts are one of the five types of trusts recognized in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1. A trust qualifies as a pooled trust only if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">(i) The trust contains the assets of an individual of any age who is disabled as defined in rule 5101:1-39-03 of the Administrative Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">(ii) A separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust but, for purposes of investment and management of funds, the trust pools the funds in these accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">(iii) Accounts in the trust are established by the individual, the individual\u2019s parent, grandparent, or legal guardian, or a court solely for the benefit of individuals who are disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">(iv) To the extent that any amounts remaining in the beneficiary\u2019s account upon the death of the beneficiary are not retained by the trust, the trust pays to the state the amount remaining in the account equal to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary. To meet this requirement, the trust must include a provision specifically providing for such payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1(C)(3)(c). See also R.C. 5111.151(F)(3)(a). The principal in or income from a pooled trust is \u201cexempt from being counted as a resource by a county department of job and family services.\u201d R.C. 5111.151(F). See also Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1(C)(3)(c) (\u201cPooled trusts are not countable resources\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Here, Kormanik petitioned the court to open an account with McGivney, which manages a pooled trust on Baxter\u2019s behalf. In response, the state defendants asked the probate court to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, pursuant to Civ.R.. 12(B)(1), and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">{\u00b6 23} We will first address those assignments of error relating to the jurisdictional issue; namely, Kormanik\u2019s first and third assignments of error and McGivney\u2019s second and third assignments of error. A trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a case if it has the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case. <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 11. A motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction raises a question of law, and thus, appellate courts review such a motion de novo. <em>Crosby-Edwards v. Ohio Bd. of Embalmers &amp; Funeral Directors, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 213, 2008-Ohio-762, 886 N.E.2d 251, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 24} Probate courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and can exercise only the authority granted to them by statute or the Ohio Constitution. <em>In re Guardianship of Spangler, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 339, 2010-Ohio-2471, 933 N.E.2d 1067, \u00b6 46. R.C. 2101.24, which sets forth the general jurisdictional parameters of probate courts, grants probate courts the power \u201c[t]o appoint and remove guardians, conservators, and testamentary trustees, direct and control their conduct, and settle their accounts.\u201d R.C. 2101.24(A)(1)(e). Additionally, R.C. 2111.50(A)(1) designates probate courts the superior guardians of the wards who are subject to their jurisdiction. In the superior-guardian role, probate courts have \u201call the powers that relate to the person and estate of the person and that he could exercise if present and not * * * under a disability,\u201d with some unrelated exceptions. R.C. 2111.50(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 25} Given this broad endowment of authority, we conclude that the probate court has jurisdiction to open a trust account with McGivney on Baxter\u2019s behalf. If Baxter were not a ward, she could have opened such an account herself. R.C. 5111.151(F)(3)(a)(iv); Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1\u201439\u201427.1(C)(3)(c)(iii). Because Baxter is the subject of a guardianship, the power to open the account accrues to the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">{\u00b6 26} The state defendants do not contest the above analysis. Rather, they dispute the probate court\u2019s power to declare either that the trust account, once open, satisfies all the statutory requirements for a pooled trust or that any assets placed in the trust account are uncountable resources. Such determinations are integral to Medicaid eligibility, and citing <em>In re the Guardianship of Stowell </em>(Aug. 3, 1995), 10th Dist. No. 95AP-128, 1995 WL 458963, the state defendants argue that a probate court lacks jurisdiction to decide a person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>eligibility for Medicaid. In response, Kormanik and McGivney argue that a probate court has the authority to interpret a trust and that the probate court\u2019s interpretation must be used in the Medicaid-eligibility-review process. Kormanik and McGivney rely on <em>Pack </em>for that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Pack, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 14, 2008-Ohio-90, 881 N.E.2d 237, a trustee filed a declaratory judgment action requesting that the trial court declare the trust assets unavailable and not a countable resource for determining the trust beneficiary\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Id. at \u00b6 4. The state, however, maintained that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the trustee\u2019s request because it amounted to bypassing the county department of job and family services\u2019 administrative Medicaid-eligibility review. Id. at \u00b6 23. In rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that Ohio statutes permitted the trial court to fulfill the trustee\u2019s request to interpret the trust and that the court\u2019s interpretation would be binding in the determination of the beneficiary\u2019s Medicaid eligibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 28} We hold that <em>Pack </em>has no application to this case. Unlike in <em>Pack, </em>here, no party has sought a declaratory judgment from the probate court regarding the nature of the trust or whether assets placed in the trust constituted uncountable resources. As the petition lacks a demand for such a declaration, we need not decide whether the probate court has the authority to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, we reject Kormanik and McGivney\u2019s argument that the probate court must necessarily declare that a pooled-trust account that it opens on a ward\u2019s behalf complies with R.C. 5111.151(F)(3)(a) and Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1(C)(3)(c). While R.C. 5111.151(F)(3)(a)(iv) and Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1(C)(3)(c)(iii) permit a court to establish a pooled-trust account, they do not mandate that the court declare anything about the legality, nature, or effect of the trust account. Of course, in determining whether opening a pooled-trust account is in Baxter\u2019s best interest, the court may consider whether Baxter, McGivney, and the potential trust account would satisfy the requirements of R.C. 5111.151(F)(3)(a) and Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-39-27.1(C)(3)(c). The probate court also may consider whether establishment of a pooled-trust account would improve Baxter\u2019s chances of qualifying for Medicaid. However, consideration of these issues does not entail issuance of a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 30} In sum, we conclude that the probate court possesses the jurisdiction to carry out the only relief Kormanik requested \u2014 the establishment of a trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>account with McGivney on Baxter\u2019s behalf. We thus overrule Kormanik\u2019s first and third assignments of error and McGivney\u2019s second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 31} Having determined the parameters of the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction, we turn to the issue whether the state defendants must remain parties to the proceedings. This issue is addressed by Kormanik\u2019s second assignment of error and McGivney\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 32} Although the state defendants framed this part of their argument as a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, Civ.R. 21 more aptly addresses the substance of their challenge. Civ.R. 21 provides that \u201c[p]arties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\u201d This rule is the mechanism by which a court can correct the misjoinder of a party by dropping that party from an action. <em>EnQuip Technologies Group, Inc. v. Tycon Technoglass, S.R.L., </em>2d Dist. No. 2009 CA 42, 2010-Ohio-28, 2010 WL 53151, \u00b6 33. A court may find that a party is misjoined when that party has no legal interest in the litigation. Id.; <em>In re H.W., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 65, 2007-Ohio-2879, 868 N.E.2d 261, \u00b6 11. See also <em>Letherer v. Alger Group, L.L.C. </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 328 F.3d 262, 267 (holding that a court may rely on Fed.R.Civ.P. 21 to delete parties that have no connection to an action); <em>Cohn v. KeySpan Corp. </em>(E.D.N.Y.2010), 713 F.Supp.2d 143, 152 (same).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Misjoinder also occurs when no relief is demanded from one or more of the parties joined as defendants. <em>EnQuip Technologies Group, Inc. </em>at \u00b6 33. See also <em>Letherer </em>at 267; <em>Cohn </em>at 152, quoting <em>Barrundia v. New York </em>(S.D.N.Y.1988), No. 84 Civ. 6801, 1988 WL 96063 (finding misjoinder where \u201c \u2018there is clearly no right or basis of relief from a party\u2019 \u201d); <em>Moubry v. Kreb </em>(D.Minn.1999), 58 F.Supp.2d 1041, 1047 (holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 21 is the proper vehicle for dismissing parties where \u201c \u2018no relief is demanded from * * * or no claim of relief is stated against [them]\u2019 \u201d). Appellate courts review a decision to drop a party pursuant to Civ.R. 21 under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Darby v. A-Best Products Co., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 410, 2004-Ohio-3720, 811 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 33} We agree with the state defendants that they lack any real interest in the instant proceedings. The state defendants will develop an interest in whether Baxter is a beneficiary of a pooled-trust account only if Kormanik applies for Medicaid benefits on Baxter\u2019s behalf. Upon application, the state must determine whether the trust meets the requirements of R.C. 5111.151(F)(3)(a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1\u201439\u201427.1(C)(3)(c), thus making the trust assets unavailable for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. Until that point, the existence and terms of the pooled-trust account contain no significance for the state defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 34} We are not persuaded that the state defendants possess an interest in these proceedings because a properly constructed pooled trust requires the trust to pay the state the amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary if at the beneficiary\u2019s death, any amounts remain in the beneficiary\u2019s account. At best, the state\u2019s receipt of payment from Baxter\u2019s proposed trust account is a remote possibility, as it is contingent on (1) the probate court\u2019s opening a trust account for Baxter, (2) the transfer of assets into the trust account, (3) Kormanik\u2019s applying for Medicaid benefits on Baxter\u2019s behalf, (4) Baxter\u2019s being found eligible for Medicaid, (5) Baxter\u2019s receiving Medicaid benefits, and (6) assets remaining in Baxter\u2019s trust account upon her death. Additionally, the state defendants do not have <em>any </em>chance of benefiting from the trust unless and until the process reaches step five. If the state never pays out Medicaid benefits for Baxter, it cannot receive any reimbursement from the trust account. The state defendants\u2019 alleged beneficial interest, therefore, is so remote as to be nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 35} Misjoinder is also evidenced by Kormanik\u2019s failure to demand any relief involving the state defendants. Whether the probate court grants or denies Kormanik\u2019s petition, the state defendants will remain unaffected. Only if Kormanik applies for Medicaid benefits for Baxter will the state be obliged to take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">{\u00b6 36} In sum, because the state defendants do not have an interest in the instant action and the relief sought does not involve them, the probate court did not abuse its discretion in dropping them as parties. Accordingly, we overrule Kormanik\u2019s second assignment of error and McGivney\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">{\u00b6 37} For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss as moot the appeals arising from the judgment relating to Cooper, i.e., appeal Nos. 11AP-74 and 11AP-76. Additionally, we overrule all of Kormanik\u2019s and McGivney\u2019s assignments of error, and we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, that relates to Baxter.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Appeals in 11AP-74 and 11AP-76 dismissed, and judgments in 11AP-75 and 11AP-77 affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b835-12\">Bryant, P.J., and Tyack, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-17\">. Kormanik also filed a petition requesting the creation of a pooled trust for Cooper's benefit. During the course of these proceedings, Cooper passed away. As we discuss below, Cooper's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>death has rendered the petition relating to him moot. Consequently, we set forth only the procedural history of Baxter\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\">. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that a trustee could bring a declaratory-judgment action to determine any question arising in the administration of the trust pursuant to R.C. 2721.05(C) and 5802.01(C). The court also noted that R.C. 5111.151(G)(4)(e), (g), and (h) sanctioned the trial court's involvement with respect to interpretation of the trust's terms in a Medicaid-eligibility context. None of these statutory provisions pertain to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">. Ohio\u2019s Civ.R. 21 is substantially similar to Fed.R.Civ.P. 21. Therefore, we look to federal case law for assistance in interpreting the Ohio rule. <em>Myers v.
