He unsuccessfully challenged his convictions in appeals to this court and to the Ohio Supreme Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in his 2006 App.R. 26(B) application to reopen his appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 3} In June 2010, Gonzalez filed with the common pleas court a motion seeking a new sentencing hearing on the ground that his sentence was void because the trial court had failed to adequately notify him concerning postrelease control. The common pleas court overruled the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, Gonzalez presents two assignments of error. We address first his second assignment of error, in which he cites the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in <em>State v. </em>Johnson<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to argue that the trial court, in imposing prison terms on both felonious-assault charges, violated R.C. 2941.25. The offenses, Gonzalez insists, were allied offenses of similar import that had been committed neither separately nor with a separate animus as to each. We do not reach the merits of this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 5} This court has jurisdiction to review only the judgment from which Gonzalez appeals. In that judgment, the common pleas court overruled Gonzalez\u2019s motion challenging the adequacy of postrelease-control notification. The court did not rule upon, because Gonzalez had not asserted in his motion, an allied-offenses challenge to his sentences. His failure to present this challenge as a ground for relief in his motion precludes this court from reviewing it on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>from the judgment overruling the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And while a trial court retains jurisdiction to correct a void judgment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Ohio Supreme Court has not held that a judgment of conviction is rendered void by the imposition of multiple sentences in violation of R.C. 2941.25.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Gonzalez contends that the common pleas court erred in overruling his motion seeking resentencing on the ground that his sentences are void for inadequate postrelease-control notification. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 7} Gonzalez was found guilty of two counts of felonious assault, both second-degree felonies. The trial court was thus required to notify Gonzalez at sentencing that upon his release from prison, he would be subject to postrelease-control supervision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court failed to do so. Consequently, to the extent that Gonzalez was not adequately notified concerning postrelease control, his sentences are void and he is \u201centitled * * * to proper imposition of postrelease control.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 8} Gonzalez did not assign this matter as error in his direct appeal from his conviction. He instead presented the challenge in his postconviction motion for resentencing. But when a sentence is void to the extent that it was not imposed in conformity with the statutory mandates concerning postrelease control, and the matter has come to the attention of a court, whether on direct appeal or in a collateral challenge, the court \u201ccannot ignore\u201d the matter,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u201cthe offending portion of the sentence is subject to review and correction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Gonzalez\u2019s felonious-assault sentences are void to the extent that he was not notified at sentencing concerning postrelease control. Because his motion for resentencing brought this matter to the attention of the common pleas court, the court erred in overruling the motion. We, therefore, sustain the first assignment of error and remand this case for correction of the offending portions of his sentences in accordance with the law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-5\">Sundermann, P.J., and Hendon and Fischer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\">.
