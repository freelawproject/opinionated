This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">{\u00b6 2} Father and Mother married in August 2003 and had a child in March 2006. In May 2007, Mother filed a complaint for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, and the parties were granted a divorce in August 2007. Under the terms of the original divorce decree, Mother was designated the residential and custodial parent of their child. Father\u2019s child-support obligation was calculated in accordance with the child-support worksheet in the amount of $258.68 per month; however, he agreed to pay $400 per month to Mother, an obligation that was reflected in the terms of their decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">{\u00b6 3} In October 2007, the parties filed an agreed entry in which they consented to handle matters of child support \u201cindependently with each other until further notice.\u201d The record reveals that from that point forward, the parties shared parenting time approximately 50-50, with each parent caring for the child on alternating weeks. Father continued, however, to pay for the child-care expenses of $400 per month while the parties split the parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On November 5, 2009, Father filed an emergency motion to reinstate visitation, asserting that since Mother sought an ex parte civil-protection order (\u201cCPO\u201d) against him in October 2009, she had withheld Father\u2019s visitation with their child, despite the child\u2019s not being included as a protected party in the ex parte order. At the same time, Father stopped paying Mother the $400 per month that he was paying to cover their monthly child-care expenses. Both parties assert that they entered into a CPO consent agreement in December 2009, although that agreement is part of a separate case and is not a part of this court\u2019s record.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 5} After being contacted by Mother, on January 5, 2010, the Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d) filed a motion to set support in order to establish Father\u2019s child-support obligation. On March 23, 2010, Father was served with CSEA\u2019s motion, a notice of hearing before the magistrate set for April 20, 2010, and a request for production of documents. Both parties appeared and testified at the hearing, though Mother appeared pro se while Father appeared with counsel he had retained just days before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 6} On August 17, 2010, the magistrate issued a decision that was simultaneously adopted by the trial court. Father timely objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, arguing that the findings of fact were not supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing and that the magistrate inappropriately sought and relied upon evidence outside the record for use in calculating his support obligation. The trial court overruled Father\u2019s objections, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 7} Father asserts six assignments of error for our review, some of which have been rearranged and consolidated for purposes of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Assignment of Error Number One</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The trial court erred as a matter of law when the court conducted an independent investigation into other cases concerning father, questioned father about the information, then relied on the information when determining the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Assignment of Error Number Two</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">The trial court erred as a matter of law by imputing income to father without following the requisite guidelines for imputation of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">Assignment of Error Number Four</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">The trial court erred as a matter of law when the findings of fact in the magistrate\u2019s decision contained facts which were not in the record, and the judge\u2019s order overruling the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision relied on such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Father argues that the magistrate violated the Code of Judicial Conduct and committed reversible error by independently investigating the online docket of other cases to obtain Father\u2019s financial information for use in calculating his support obligation in this case. In his second assignment of error, Father argues that the trial court erred in imputing income because it did not properly consider the statutory factors necessary to do so. In his fourth assignment of error, Father argues that the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by the evidence at trial. Specifically, he takes issue with the magistrate\u2019s findings that he was unemployed at the time of the hearing; that there was \u201cuncontroverted\u201d evidence that he had never earned less than $30,000 per year; and that he was \u201ccharged\u201d with assaulting Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 9} Generally, this court reviews a trial court\u2019s action with respect to a magistrate\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fields v. Cloyd, </em>9th Dist. No. 24150, 2008-Ohio-5232, 2008 WL 4493144, at \u00b6 9. \u201cIn so doing, [however,] we consider the trial court\u2019s action with reference to the nature of the underlying matter.\u201d <em>Tabatabai v. Tabatabai, </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA0049-M, 2009-Ohio-3139, 2009 WL 1844353, at \u00b6 18. The trial court\u2019s calculation of child support is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028. An abuse of discretion means that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 10} While the decision to award support is discretionary, an appellate court reviews the factual findings to support that award under a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard. <em>Chatman v. Chatman, </em>9th Dist. No. 24514, 2009-Ohio-4516, 2009 WL 2768023, at \u00b6 5. Thus, this court reviews the record to determine whether there is competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 24, quoting <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus (in civil cases, \u201c \u2018[judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence\u2019 \u201d). If a trial court concludes when addressing child support that a parent is voluntarily unemployed, it can impute income to that parent based on a review of the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">(i) The parent\u2019s prior employment experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">(ii) The parent\u2019s education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">(iii) The parent\u2019s physical and mental disabilities, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">(iv) The availability of employment in the geographic area in which the parent resides;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>(v) The prevailing wage and salary levels in the geographic area in which the parent resides;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(vi) The parent\u2019s special skills and training;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(vii) Whether there is evidence that the parent has the ability to earn the imputed income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">(viii) The age and special needs of the child for whom child support is being calculated under this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">(ix) The parent\u2019s increased earning capacity because of experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">(x) Any other relevant factor. R.C. 3119.01(C)(11)(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">See also Ohio Adm.Code 5101:12-60-05.1(E)(1) (requiring CSEA to consider the same criteria when imputing income to a parent when it conducts an administrative review of support).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">{\u00b6 11} At the beginning of the support hearing, Father\u2019s counsel sought a continuance of the matter based on the fact that she was newly retained and had received the documents requested by CSEA from Father only the day before the hearing. The trial court denied Father\u2019s request and went forward with testimony from both Father and Mother as to their employment status and current earnings. Neither party, however, introduced any documents, employment-related or otherwise, into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">{\u00b6 12} When testifying, Father stated that he was currently employed as an independent contractor who delivered packages for an entity named \u201cPrestige\u201d and that he started working there one to two months ago. He stated that he was paid $2.13 per delivery stop and was currently making approximately $500 per month, though his recent paychecks ranged from $93 to $250 a week. Father acknowledged that in his previous position as an independent contractor doing commercial cleaning for System Four, his income was higher, as he testified that his 2009 tax return reflected a self-employed income of $45,000 in that position. He further testified that his income with System Four for 2007 was approximately $87,000 and in 2008 was approximately $102,000, though he testified that his income in that position was \u201cabnormal [compared] to [his] other jobs.\u201d No testimony was elicited, however, as to what those \u201cother jobs\u201d were. When CSEA finished questioning Father as to his current income, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-13\">[Court:] Mr. Wallace, what is the name of your oldest child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-14\">[Father:] Marquise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-15\">[Court:] Could you spell that for me[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-16\">[Father:] M-a-r-q-u-i-s-e.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-17\">[Court:] And when did he turn 18?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-18\">[Father:] September 21st of last year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>[Court:] Wasn\u2019t there a recommendation for termination of child support filed last year for this child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">[Father:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">[Court:] And at that time you were ordered to pay $606 per month for child support or had that been waived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">[Father:] That had been waived also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The magistrate continued to question Father as to why he no longer worked for System Four, at which point he explained that the previous franchise of System Four that he worked for \u201cwent under\u201d in 2009, and the new owner of the local franchise had been undergoing financial difficulties since taking ownership. He stated that under the new owner, he would get a paycheck, but when he would attempt to cash it, it would not clear because of insufficient funds. Thus, he reached a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d with the new franchise owner that the two parties would \u201crelease[ ] one another\u201d from any further obligations due to his inability to regularly pay Father. He explained that he had received a $10,000 \u201cbuyout\u201d from System Four at the end of his relationship with the new owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 13} After further questioning from the magistrate as to Father\u2019s current position with Prestige, the magistrate indicated that she was \u201clooking at [his] history here with [his] other children, and it [did not] look like [he had] ever earned less than [$]34,000.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Father\u2019s counsel objected, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">[Father\u2019s Counsel:] I haven\u2019t seen CSEA present any evidence on his prior work history or the amount that he\u2019s come \u2014 given forth on his cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">[Court:] Pm just looking it up on his prior history on the court documents that are of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">[Father\u2019s Counsel:] So * * * it\u2019s not in the file or anything on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">[Court:] It\u2019s in a file, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">[Father\u2019s Counsel:] In this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">[Court:] It\u2019s part of a record as a matter of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">[Father\u2019s Counsel:] Okay. I was just raising an objection because I hadn\u2019t seen anything or heard anything about his past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">[Court:] Well, I will say that this was a child support order with Mavies Grimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">[Father:] That was ten years ago, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">[Court:] But you\u2019re saying that the two children that you had with her are living with you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-20\">[Father:] Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>[Court:] I\u2019m just saying that for purposes of this \u2014 this hearing, I\u2019m just surprised that you are only making $500 a month when it looks like the lowest you\u2019ve ever made was [$]34,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">[Father:] Well, actually, the lowest I ever made was [$]21,000 * * * when I first started * * * for the county * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Father later testified that he had also worked for the probation department where he earned $28,000 annually, though he did not specify the timeframe in which he held that position or the type of work he performed there. CSEA, however, indicated that it had records of Father\u2019s 2006 tax return, which listed his income as $28,795, but CSEA did not indicate the employer or the nature of the work that Father was doing at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 14} In the findings of fact issued four months after the hearing, the magistrate concluded that \u201c[Father] was unemployed as of the date of the hearing\u201d and further noted that \u201c[i]t is uncontroverted that [Father] has never earned income less than $30,000.00 annually since he joined the work force.\u201d While these findings are clearly contrary to the evidence contained in the record, this Court has previously noted that \u201c \u2018[a]ny claim of trial court error must be based on the actions of the trial court, not on the magistrate\u2019s findings or proposed decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Knouff v. Walsh-Stewart, </em>9th Dist. No. 09CA0075, 2010-Ohio-4063, 2010 WL 3385545, at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Mealey v. Mealey </em>(May 8, 1996), 9th Dist. No. 95CA0093, 1996 WL 233491, at *2. In overruling Father\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, however, the trial court similarly concluded in its findings that Father was \u201cvoluntarily unemployed.\u201d The trial court further concluded that his income was \u201cusually in the range of $30,000\u201d and therefore imputed income to him at that amount, in light of his \u201cvocational history, education[,] nature of his work\u201d and \u201cthe availability of employment in the area as evidenced by his failure to renew his employment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 15} Initially, we note that there was uncontroverted evidence in the record that Father was employed at the time of the hearing, and the trial court engaged in a lengthy discussion with him in this regard. We further note that despite the findings articulated by the court in support of its decision to impute income to Father, the record reveals that there was little to no information as to Father\u2019s \u201cvocational history\u201d discussed at the hearing. Though Father testified that he was currently a delivery driver and had been a commercial cleaner in the past, the evidence was limited solely to the positions and their corresponding income, with no testimony concerning the requisite skills or experience necessary to obtain either position, despite Father\u2019s ability to earn only $6,000 to $12,000 per year in one, and over $100,000 in the other. We further note that the record is devoid of any evidence as to Father\u2019s education level, licensures, or specialized training, such that the trial court could appropriately impute income to him at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>level nearly twice minimum wage. See <em>Bentley v. Rojas, </em>9th Dist. No. 10CA009776, 2010-Ohio-6243, 2010 WL 5276998, at \u00b6 10-11 (reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to impute income where there was \u201cpractically no evidence * * * offered\u201d in relationship to the factors outlined in R.C. 3119.01(C)(11)(a), particularly in terms of Father\u2019s vocational abilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 16} To the extent that there was any evidence adduced as to the \u201cnature of [Father\u2019s] work,\u201d the only testimony developed in this regard pertained to his current position as a delivery driver. That is, there was no testimony as to what work he performed as a commercial cleaner to account for the disparity in income between that position and his current job. Additionally, there was no testimony as to what other jobs Father might have held in the past, aside from evidence that he was once employed by the county and/or the probation department in an unknown capacity for an unspecified period of time. Finally, though the court considered his \u201cfailure to renew his employment contract\u201d with System Four as evidence of the availability of employment in the area, the record simply does not support such a finding, as Father testified that while he continued to work for the franchise once it was under new ownership, it was unable to continue to pay him for his services and consequently terminated the relationship. We again note that there was no documentary evidence admitted throughout the hearing by any of the parties present, nor was there a discussion of any of the statutory factors set forth in R.C. 3119.01(C)(ll)(a) beyond what is set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 17} In closing, we note that though it is unclear what, if any, effect the magistrate\u2019s decision to sua sponte review matters outside the record relative to Father\u2019s earnings might have had on the trial court\u2019s review of this matter, we would admonish any magistrate or trial court from doing so, as it is the burden of the parties appearing before the court to introduce evidence for the trier of fact to consider, not the reverse. See <em>In re J.C., </em>186 Ohio App.3d 243, 2010-Ohio-637, 927 N.E.2d 69, at \u00b6 13-16 (concluding that it was reversible error for the trial court to sua sponte consider matters outside the record and rely on docket entries from a prior case file in making a custody determination). See also <em>McMahon v. Continental Express, Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. WD-07-030, 2008-Ohio-76, 2008 WL 110630, at \u00b6 34 (reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment when the court\u2019s decision and judgment entry reflected that it relied on evidence from a different, but related, case between the same parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 18} Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision and imputing income to Father, because its findings of fact were not supported by competent, credible evidence. Accordingly, Father\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error are sustained, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Assignment of Error Number Three</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The trial court erred as a matter of law by computing and ordering child support without following the requisite child support guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Assignment of Error Number Five</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The trial court erred as a matter of law when it failed to hold the pro se plaintiff to the same standards as the represented defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Assignment of Error Number Six</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The trial court erred as a matter of law, in calculating child support with insufficient information, after refusing to grant a continuance in order to allow the parties sufficient time to conduct discovery, when neither party provided substantiating evidence of income}.]</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 19} In light of our determination of Father\u2019s other assignments of error, his third, fifth, and sixth assignments of error are moot, as the trial court will be required to recalculate his support obligation in light of our decision in this matter. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 20} Father\u2019s first, second, and fourth assignments of error are sustained.
