Kaigler, appellant, appeals his sentence in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas on his conviction of attempted grand theft, a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>R.C. 2923.02 and 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2) and a fifth-degree felony. Appellant pleaded no contest to the offense. In a judgment filed on July 23, 2010, the court sentenced appellant to imprisonment for 12 months, the statutory maximum prison term for the offense. R.C. 2929.14(A)(5). The trial court also ordered the sentence to be served consecutively to a prison term that appellant was serving at the time of sentencing for two felony convictions in the Marion County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 2} Kaigler asserts two assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cAssignments of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c(1) The trial court imposed a sentence contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c(2) The trial court abused its discretion in sentencing appellant to maximum consecutive sentences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 6} Under assignment of error No. 1, appellant argues that the United States Supreme Court established the constitutionality of state requirements for judicial fact-finding before imposition of consecutive sentences in the decision of <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>(2009), 555 U.S. 160, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517. Appellant argues that the decision in <em>Ice </em>conflicts with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, and that after <em>Ice, </em>Ohio statutory requirements for such fact-finding, invalidated by <em>Foster, </em>should be enforced. R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.41(A) required judicial fact-finding before imposition of consecutive sentences prior to <em>Foster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant made this argument in an appellate brief filed before the Ohio Supreme Court addressed the issue in <em>State v. Hodge, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768. The Ohio Supreme Court considered and rejected appellant\u2019s argument in <em>Hodge. </em>At paragraphs two and three of the syllabus in the decision, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c2. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Oregon v. Ice </em>(2009), 555 U.S. 160, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517, does not revive Ohio\u2019s former consecutive-sentencing statutory provisions, R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.41(A), which were held unconstitutional in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c3. Trial court judges are not obligated to engage in judicial fact-finding prior to imposing consecutive sentences unless the General Assembly enacts new legislation requiring that findings be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s assignment of error No. 1 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Under assignment of error No. 2, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a maximum and consecutive sentence is unreasonable and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant pleaded no contest to attempted grand theft on July 6, 2010. The state contended at the plea hearing that if the case against appellant had proceeded to trial, the evidence would have established that appellant and the codefendant engaged in a scheme to steal merchandise from Meijer stores across Ohio and Michigan. In this case, the state contends that a conviction for attempted grand theft is supported by evidence that the two went into a Meijer store in Lucas County, Ohio, and broke into a jewelry case to steal jewelry valued at $59,189.89. According to the state, appellant\u2019s convictions in Marion County were for similar behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant was originally indicted for grand theft, a violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2). He pleaded and was convicted of a lesser included offense of attempted grand theft, a violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2913.02(A)(1) and (B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a maximum sentence and ordering that it be served consecutively to sentences for two felony convictions in Marion County. Appellant states that his criminal history is limited and nonviolent in nature in that his two felony convictions arose out of criminal activities occurring during a single event.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 26, the Ohio Supreme Court set forth the standard of review on appeal of felony sentencing. Appellate courts \u201cmust examine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. If this first prong is satisfied, the trial court\u2019s decision in imposing the term of imprisonment is reviewed under the abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 16} We addressed appellant\u2019s sole contention that his sentence is contrary to law under assignment of error No. 1. Under assignment of error No. 2, appellant claims abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion \u201c \u2018implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">{\u00b6 17} After <em>Foster, </em>trial courts remain required to \u201ccarefully consider the statutes that apply to every felony case. Those include R.C. 2929.11, which specifies the purposes of sentencing, and R.C. 2929.12, which provides guidance in considering factors relating to the seriousness of the offense and recidivism of the offender. In addition, the sentencing court must be guided by statutes that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>specific to the case itself.\u201d <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">{\u00b6 18} At the time of sentencing, appellant was 21 years of age. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court discussed the fact that there was an outstanding warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest in the state of Michigan and that appellant was serving a sentence for two felony convictions by judgment of the Marion County Court of Common Pleas. The court stated that it had considered the principles and purposes of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 and had balanced seriousness and recidivism factors under R.C. 2929.12 in determining sentence. The sentence imposed was within the statutory range for fifth-degree felony convictions. R.C. 2929.14(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 19} This conviction and the Marion felony convictions demonstrate that appellant has engaged in a serious criminal enterprise involving crimes in different jurisdictions during the short period of time he has been an adult. In our view, the trial court acted within its discretion in sentencing appellant to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for attempted grand theft and in ordering that the sentence run consecutively to felony sentences imposed by the Marion County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 20} We find that appellant\u2019s assignment of error No. 2 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 21} We conclude that appellant has not been denied a fair trial and affirm the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas. Pursuant to App.R. 24(A), we order appellant to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b794-9\">Osowik, P.J., and Singer, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
