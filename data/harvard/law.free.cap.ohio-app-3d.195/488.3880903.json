Stults, appeals the Seneca County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 judgment entry of conviction and sentence and its separately entered forfeiture order. We dismiss the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 2} On December 2, 2009, the Seneca County Grand Jury indicted Stults as follows: count one, trafficking in cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and (C)(4)(b), a fourth-degree felony; and count two, permitting drug abuse in violation of R.C. 2925.13(B), a fifth-degree felony. Count one contained a specification that the offense was committed within the vicinity of a juvenile, and count two contained a criminal-forfeiture specification seeking 20 items of personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 3} On December 29, 2009, Stults appeared for arraignment and entered pleas of not guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 4} On July 2, 2010, Stults filed a motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of a search of his residence. A brief hearing on the motion was held on July 6, 2010, and the trial court overruled the motion the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 5} On August 30, 2010, the state filed a motion to amend count two of the indictment to reduce the number of items sought in the criminal-forfeiture specification from 20 to 16. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 6} On August 30 and 31 and September 1, 2010, a jury trial was held, and thereafter, the jury found Stults guilty on both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">{\u00b6 7} On October 6, 2010, the trial court held a bifurcated hearing on forfeiture and sentencing. The trial court sentenced Stults to seven months\u2019 imprisonment on each count and ordered that the terms be served concurrently, for a total of seven months\u2019 imprisonment. The trial court also ordered forfeiture of the 16 items sought by the state. On October 8, 2010, the trial court filed its entry of conviction and sentence and separately filed its forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">{\u00b6 8} On October 29, 2010, Stults filed a notice of appeal. Stults now appeals, raising two assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">The trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">Assignment of Error No. II</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">The trial court erred in its finding that certain articles seized were used or intended to be used in the commission of the offense and thereby erred in ordering said articles be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In Ms first assignment of error, Stults argues that Detective Boyer\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant did not meet the statutory conditions for nonconsensual, forcible entry under R.C. 2933.231(B)(1) and (2). Therefore, Stults argues that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence seized as a result of the erroneously granted no-knock search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 10} In his second assignment of error, Stults argues that the trial court erred in determining that the following seized items were used or intended to be used in the commission of the drug-trafficking offense: (1) $356, less $275 that was attributable to drug-buy money, (2) a Samsung cell phone, (3) $890, (5) a Hi Point Model C-9 SCR, 9 mm handgun, (7) a black monitor, (8) a night-vision wireless camera, (11) wireless motion cameras, (12) a Blackberry cell phone, (13) a Westernfield bolt-action 20-gauge firearm,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (14) a Remington .22-caliber rifle, and (15) a .22-caliber magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 11} Before we can reach the merits of Stults\u2019s assignments of error, though, we must determine whether the entry Stults appealed from is a final, appealable order. The Ohio Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction over final and appealable orders. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. If a judgment appealed from is not a final order, an appellate court has no jurisdiction to consider it and the appeal must be dismissed. <em>State v. O\u2019Black, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-09-46, 2010-Ohio-192, 2010 WL 252300, \u00b6 4, citing <em>State v. Sandlin, </em>4th Dist. No. 05CA23, 2006-Ohio-5021, 2006 WL 3060130, \u00b6 9, citing <em>Davison v. Rini </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 688, 692, 686 N.E.2d 278; <em>Prod. Credit Assn. v. Hedges </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 207, 210, 621 N.E.2d 1360, fn. 2; <em>Kouns v. Pemberton </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 499, 501, 617 N.E.2d 701. Moreover, we must raise jurisdictional issues sua sponte. <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 159-160, 556 N.E.2d 1169, fn. 2; <em>Whitaker-Merrell Co. v. Geupel Const. Co. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 184, 186, 58 O.O.2d 399, 280 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 12} The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v. Baker </em>was presented with two issues: (1) whether a judgment of conviction must include the defendant\u2019s plea entered at arraignment to be a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 and (2) whether \u201cthe plea, the verdict or findings, and the sentence\u201d required by Crim.R. 32(C) must be contained in one document to be a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02. <em>Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 1 and 5. At the time <em>Baker </em>was decided, Crim.R. 32(C) provided: \u201cA judgment of conviction shall set forth the plea, the verdict or findings, and the sentence. * * * The judge shall sign the judgment and the clerk shall enter it on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>journal. A judgment is effective only when entered on the journal by the clerk.\u201d See id. at \u00b6 10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals for the Ninth District had previously determined that to be a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02, Crim.R. 32(C)\u2019s plain language required that the judgment entry of conviction contain <em>five </em>elements: (1) the plea, (2) the verdict or findings, (3) the sentence, (4) the signature of the judge, and (5) the time stamp of the clerk to indicate journalization. Id. at \u00b6 13, citing <em>State v. Miller, </em>9th Dist. No. 06CA0046-M, 2007-Ohio-1353, 2007 WL 879666, \u00b6 5. In order to satisfy the first element, the Ninth District held: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment entry must comply fully with Crim.R. 32(C) by setting forth the defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty, guilty, no contest, or not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 10. The court in <em>Baker </em>acknowledged that the Ninth District\u2019s approach \u201cmay be supported grammatically because in the phrase \u2018the plea, the verdict or findings\u2019 the missing comma after the word \u2018verdict\u2019 confuses whether \u2018the plea, the verdict or findings\u2019 is intended to be a series.\u201d <em>Baker </em>at \u00b6 13. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the \u201cmore logical interpretation\u201d of the phrase \u201cthe plea, the verdict or findings, and the sentence\u201d in Crim.R. 32(C) was that the trial court was required \u201cto sign and journalize a document memorializing the sentence and the manner of the conviction: a guilty plea, a no contest plea upon which the court has made a finding of guilt, a finding of guilt based upon a bench trial, or a guilty verdict resulting from a jury trial.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 1 and 14. Consequently, the court in <em>Baker </em>concluded that a judgment of conviction is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 when it sets forth the following <em>four </em>elements: (1) the guilty plea, the jury verdict, or the finding of the court upon which the conviction is based, (2) the sentence, (3) the signature of the judge, and (4) entry on the journal by the clerk of court. Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 13} Concerning the second question, the Court of Appeals for the Twelfth District concluded that two separate journal entries could be read together to meet Crim.R. 32(C)\u2019s requirements. <em>State v. Postway, </em>12th Dist. No. CA200206-154, 2003-Ohio-2689, 2003 WL 21213409, \u00b6 7. Although the judgment entry of conviction in <em>Postway </em>stated that the defendant had been found guilty of robbery, it did not state that the defendant had pleaded guilty to that charge. Id. Instead, a separate journalized entry stated that the defendant had pleaded guilty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>that the trial court had accepted defendant\u2019s plea. Id. The court in <em>Baker </em>rejected <em>Postway\u2019s </em>approach, because \u201callowing multiple documents to constitute a final appealable order, is * * * an erroneous interpretation of [Crim.R. 32(C) ]. Only one document can constitute a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, at \u00b6 17. This holding became known as <em>Baker\u2019s </em>\u201cone-document rule,\u201d which requires that Crim.R. 32(C)\u2019s four elements be recorded in one document to constitute a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 14} A little over two years after <em>Baker, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court made an exception to <em>Baker\u2019s </em>one-document rule when it determined that for aggravated-murder cases subject to R.C. 2929.03(F), the final, appealable order consists of the <em>combination of </em>the judgment entry <em>and </em>the sentencing opinion. <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, 935 N.E.2d 9, \u00b6 17. The court in <em>Ketterer </em>distinguished <em>Baker </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">Because R.C. 2929.03(F) <em>requires </em>the court to file a sentencing opinion, <em>Baker </em>does not control this case, because <em>Baker </em>addressed only noncapital criminal cases, in which a judgment of conviction alone constitutes a final, appealable order. R.C. 2929.03(F) <em>requires </em>that a separate sentencing opinion be filed in addition to the judgment of conviction, <em>and the statute specifies that the court\u2019s judgment is not final until the sentencing opinion has been filed. </em>Capital cases, in which an R.C. 2929.03(F) sentencing opinion is <em>necessary, </em>are clear exceptions to Baker\u2019s \u201cone document\u201d rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">(Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 15} The entry from which Stults appeals sets forth the means of conviction, is signed by the trial court judge, and was entered upon the journal by the clerk. The entry sets forth the terms of imprisonment (ordered pursuant to R.C. 2929.14), an order to make restitution (ordered pursuant to R.C. 2929.18), an order to pay court costs (ordered pursuant to R.C. 2947.23), and an order to pay appointed counsel fees (ordered pursuant to R.C. 2941.51); however, the entry does not set forth the forfeiture order pursuant to R.C. 2981.04. Instead, the trial court\u2019s forfeiture order is contained in a separate entry, entitled \u201cJudgment Entry \u2014 Forfeiture,\u201d which was filed on the same day as the above-described entry. The issue we must address is whether the entry Stults appealed from sets forth the \u201csentence\u201d in conformity with Crim.R. 32(C) and <em>Baker\u2019s </em>one-document rule. More specifically, the issue is whether a criminal-forfeiture order made pursuant to R.C. 2981.04 is part of the \u201csentence\u201d for purposes of Crim.R. 32(C) and <em>Baker\u2019s </em>one-document rule. We answer this inquiry in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 16} As an initial matter, we acknowledge that the Court of Appeals for the Eighth District has already determined that a criminal-forfeiture order must be made part of the judgment entry of sentence to be a final, appealable order under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Baker, 119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163; <em>State v. Harris, </em>190 Ohio App.3d 417, 2010-Ohio-5374, 942 N.E.2d 407, \u00b6 7. The state appealed the Eighth District\u2019s decision, and the Ohio Supreme Court has accepted review of the following proposition of law: \u201cBecause forfeiture of items contemplates actions and issues that extend beyond the criminal case and sentence, Crim.R. 32(C) does not require the forfeiture of items be listed in the sentencing entry.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1425, 2011-Ohio-1049, 943 N.E.2d 572. Although we agree with the Eighth District\u2019s conclusion, their conclusion was reached without much analysis of the issue. Therefore, we set forth our reasons for following the Eighth District\u2019s application of <em>Baker\u2019s </em>one-document rule for cases involving criminal forfeitures ordered pursuant to R.C. 2981.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">{\u00b6 17} Crim.R. 32(C) does not set forth a definition of the term \u201csentence,\u201d nor has the Ohio Supreme Court defined the term \u201csentence\u201d as it is used in Crim.R. 32(C). However, R.C. 2929.01 provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">(DD) \u201cSanction\u201d means <em>any </em>penalty imposed upon an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, as punishment for the offense. \u201cSanction\u201d <em>includes </em>any sanction imposed pursuant to any provision of sections 2929.14 to 2929.18 or 2929.24 to 2929.28 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">(EE) \u201cSentence\u201d means the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">(Emphasis added.) The criminal forfeiture statute, R.C. 2981.04, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">(A) (1) Property described in division (A) of section 2981.02 of the Revised Code may be forfeited under this section only if the * * * indictment * * * contains a specification of the type described in section 2941.1417 of the Revised Code[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(B) If a person * * * is convicted of an offense * * * and the * * * indictment * * * contains a specification covering property subject to forfeiture under section 2981.02 of the Revised Code, the trier of fact shall determine whether the person\u2019s property shall be forfeited. If the state or political subdivision proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is in whole or part subject to forfeiture under section 2981.02 of the Revised Code, after a proportionality review under section 2981.09 of the Revised Code when relevant, the trier of fact shall return a verdict of forfeiture that specifically describes the extent of the property subject to forfeiture. If the trier of fact is a jury, on the offender\u2019s * * * motion, the court shall make the determination of whether the property shall be forfeited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">(C) If the court enters a verdict of forfeiture under this section, <em>the court imposing sentence or disposition, in addition to any other sentence authorized </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>by Chapter 2929 of the Revised Code or any disposition authorized by Chapter 2152 of the Revised Code, </em>shall order that the offender * * * forfeit to the state or political subdivision the offender\u2019s * * * interest in the property. The property vests with the state or political subdivision subject to the claims of third parties. The court may issue any additional order to affect the forfeiture, including, but not limited to, an order under section 2981.06 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 18} Consequently, whether a criminal-forfeiture order pursuant to R.C. 2981.04 is a \u201csentence\u201d as defined by R.C. 2929.01(EE) depends upon whether a criminal-forfeiture order is a \u201csanction\u201d under R.C. 2929.01(DD). While R.C. 2929.01(DD)\u2019s second clause does not specifically list criminal-forfeiture orders under R.C. 2981.04 as a sanction, the list of possible sanctions includes other monetary penalties, such as fines and restitution. Furthermore, by using the term \u201cincludes\u201d in R.C. 2929.01(DD)\u2019s second clause, the legislature did not intend to provide an exhaustive list of sanctions, only common examples. Any interpretation of R.C. 2929.01(DD) that would limit the term \u201csanction\u201d to only those enumerated within the subsection\u2019s second clause would render R.C. 2929.01(DD)\u2019s first clause superfluous. \u201cA basic rule of statutory construction requires that \u2018words in statutes should not be construed to be redundant, nor should any words be ignored.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172, 773 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 26, quoting <em>E. Ohio Gas Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 295, 299, 530 N.E.2d 875. Statutory language \u201c \u2018must be construed as a whole and given such interpretation as will give effect to every word and clause in it. No part should be treated as superfluous unless that is manifestly required, and the court should avoid that construction which renders a provision meaningless or inoperative.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Bd. of Edn. of Rural School Dist. of Spencer Twp., Lucas Cty. </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 367, 372-373, 116 N.E. 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2929.01(DD)\u2019s first clause states that \u201c \u2018[sjanction\u2019 means any penalty imposed upon an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, as punishment for the offense.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has previously held that \u201cforfeiture of property, pursuant to R.C. 2925.42, <em>is a form of punishment for a specified offense </em>and, therefore, is a \u2018fine\u2019 for purposes of Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Hill </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 25, 34, 635 N.E.2d 1248. Former R.C. 2925.42(A)(1)(b) permitted forfeiture if \u201c[t]he property was used or intended to be used in any manner to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, the felony drug abuse offense or act.\u201d Similarly, R.C. 2981.02(A)(3)(a) permits forfeiture of \u201c[a]n instrumentality that is used in or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of * * * [a] felony.\u201d Although R.C. 2981.02 expands forfeiture to all felonies, not just felony drug offenses as former R.C. 2925.42 did, the language and effect of R.C. 2981.02 is similar to R.C. 2925.42, which was at issue in <em>Hill. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that a criminal-forfeiture order under R.C. 2981.04 is a form of punishment or penalty imposed for specified offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 20} Therefore, since a criminal-forfeiture order under R.C. 2981.04 is a form of punishment or penalty imposed for specified offenses, a criminal-forfeiture order is a \u201csanction\u201d under R.C. 2929.01(DD). As a \u201csanction\u201d under R.C. 2929.01(DD), a criminal-forfeiture order is also a \u201csentence\u201d under R.C. 2929.01(EE). Thus, we conclude that a criminal-forfeiture order made pursuant to R.C. 2981.04 is part of the \u201csentence\u201d for purposes of Crim.R. 32(C); and therefore, a criminal-forfeiture order must be incorporated into the judgment entry of sentence to constitute a final, appealable order under <em>Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163. A separately entered forfeiture order does not comply with Baker\u2019s one-document rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 21} Furthermore, we conclude that unlike the sentencing opinions for aggravated-murder cases subject to R.C. 2929.03(F), a criminal-forfeiture order made pursuant to R.C. 2981.04 is not an exception to Baker\u2019s one-document rule. See <em>Ketterer, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, 935 N.E.2d 9, at \u00b6 17. Unlike R.C. 2929.03(F), R.C. 2981.04 does not explicitly require a separate entry or indicate that the trial court\u2019s sentence is not final until forfeiture is ordered. To the contrary, R.C. 2981.04(C), provides that <em>\u201cthe court imposing sentence </em>* * *, <em>in addition to any other sentence authorized by Chapter 2929 </em>* * * <em>of the Revised Code </em>* * *, shall order that the offender * * * forfeit to the state or political subdivision the offender\u2019s * * * interest in the property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language indicates that the court \u201cimposing sentence\u201d should make the criminal-forfeiture order part of the offender\u2019s sentence for the specified offense at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 22} Requiring criminal-forfeiture orders to be incorporated into the judgment entry of sentence is a matter of good public policy. Just as an indictment initiates the criminal proceedings against the accused and provides the accused with notice of <em>all </em>the charges in one document, the judgment entry of sentence should finalize the criminal proceedings with notice of <em>all </em>the corresponding penalties and responsibilities imposed upon the convicted offender in one document. The right to receive notice was the implicit public policy undergirding Baker\u2019s one-document rule, and notice is a necessary element of due process. Additionally, criminal forfeitures are by specification within the indictment. The punishment for other criminal specifications (e.g., firearm specifications, prior-offense specifications, drug specifications) within an indictment and upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the trier of fact makes an affirmative finding is resolved at sentencing and incorporated into the judgment entry of sentence. Why should criminal-forfeiture specifications within an indictment be treated differently?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 23} For all these reasons, we hold that a criminal-forfeiture order made pursuant to R.C. 2981.04 is part of the \u201csentence\u201d for purposes of Crim.R. 32(C). In accordance with that holding, a criminal-forfeiture order must be incorporated into the judgment entry of sentence for the judgment entry of sentence to constitute a final, appealable order under <em>Baker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 24} The criminal-forfeiture order sub judice was a separate document and was not incorporated into the sentencing entry. Thus, the entry that Stults is appealing from is not a final, appealable order under <em>Baker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 25} Having found that the entry Stults appealed from is not a final, appealable order, we sua sponte dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-9\">Rogers, P.J., and Willamowski, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">. Stults refers to this firearm as a \"Bolt action rifle \u2014 Westernfield\u201d since the firearm is referred to as such in the specification of the indictment. The record, however, indicates that the firearm was a \"Westernfield bolt action .20 gauge,\u201d which is not a rifle, but a shotgun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. Following <em>Baker, </em>Crim.R. 32(C) was amended to provide: \"A judgment of conviction shall set forth the plea, the verdict, or findings, <em>upon which each conviction is based, </em>and the sentence. Multiple judgments of conviction may be addressed in one judgment entry. * * * The judge shall sign the judgment and the clerk shall enter it on the journal. A judgment is effective only when entered on the journal by the clerk.\u201d (Eff. July 1, 2009; amendments emphasized.) <em>State ex rel. DeWine v.
