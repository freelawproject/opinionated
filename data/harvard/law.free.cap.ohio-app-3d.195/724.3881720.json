The trial court immediately sentenced defendant to a period of supervised probation. On September 10, 2009, the trial court filed an entry discharging defendant from supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">{\u00b6 3} On January 5, 2011, defendant filed a pro se application to seal the record of his misdemeanor public indecency conviction pursuant to R.C. 2953.32. At the initial hearing held on April 8, 2011, both the state and the court\u2019s own probation department objected to sealing the record of defendant\u2019s public-indecency conviction because defendant is not a first offender, having been previously convicted on or about July 23, 2008, of disorderly conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor, in Fairborn Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court held a full evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s application for expungement on May 16, 2011. Defendant admitted that he had been previously convicted in July 2008 of disorderly conduct in Fairborn Municipal Court. Nevertheless, immediately following the hearing, the trial court filed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>judgment entry granting defendant\u2019s application to seal the record of his public-indecency conviction. The court concluded that defendant had made a compelling argument of undue hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 5} The state timely appealed to this court. The trial court, at the request of the state, stayed its order of expungement pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s application for sealing his record of misdemeanor conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 7} The state of Ohio argues that the trial court erred when it granted defendant\u2019s application for statutory expungement of his misdemeanor public-indecency conviction because defendant is not a first offender and therefore is not eligible for statutory expungement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 8} Expungement is an act of grace created by the state and is a privilege, not a right. <em>State v. Simon </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 531, 533, 721 N.E.2d 1041. Expungement should be granted only when all requirements for eligibility are met. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2953.32(A)(1) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in section 2953.61 of the Revised Code, a first offender may apply to the sentencing court * * * for the sealing of the conviction record.\u201d R.C. 2953.32(B) further provides: \u201cThe prosecutor may object to the granting of the application by filing an objection with the court prior to the date set for the hearing\u201d on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Dayton v. Salmon </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 671, 674, 671 N.E.2d 599, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cR.C. 2953.32(B) requires a court to which an application is made to seal the records of a criminal case to set the matter for hearing, to notify the prosecutor, and to direct its probation officer to make inquiries and file a written report concerning the application. Paragraph (C)(1) of the statute provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u2018The court shall do each of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018(a) Determine whether the applicant is a first offender or whether the forfeiture of bail was agreed to by the applicant and the prosecutor in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018(b) Determine whether criminal proceedings are pending against the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-16\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018(c) If the applicant is a first offender who applies pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section, determine whether the applicant has been rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018(d) If the prosecutor has filed an objection in accordance with division (B) of this section, consider the reasons against granting the application specified by the prosecutor in the objection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c \u2018(e) Weigh the interests of the applicant in having the records pertaining to his conviction sealed against the legitimate needs, if any, of the government to maintain those records.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cIf none of those matters is determined adverse to the applicant, then pursuant to R.C. 2953.32(C)(2) the court \u2018shall order all official records pertaining to the case sealed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe threshold issue in any proceeding on an application to seal the records of a criminal conviction is whether the applicant is qualified for \u2018first offender\u2019 status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cFirst Offender\u201d is defined in R.C. 2953.31(A) as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018First offender\u2019 means anyone who has been convicted of an offense in this state or any other jurisdiction and who previously or subsequently has not been convicted of the same or a different offense in this state or any other jurisdiction. When two or more convictions result from or are connected with the same act or result from offenses committed at the same time, they shall be counted as one conviction. When two or three convictions result from the same indictment, information, or complaint, from the same plea of guilty, or from the same official proceeding, and result from related criminal acts that were committed within a three-month period but do not result from the same act or from offenses committed at the same time, they shall be counted as one conviction, provided that a court may decide as provided in division (C)(1)(a) of section 2953.32 of the Revised Code that it is not in the public interest for the two or three convictions to be counted as one conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">{\u00b6 22} One of the requirements for expungement pursuant to R.C. 2953.32 is that the defendant be a \u201cfirst offender.\u201d R.C. 2953.32(A)(1), (C)(1)(a), and (C)(2). Clearly, defendant is <em>not </em>a first offender because, before being convicted in September 2008 in Dayton Municipal Court of public indecency, defendant was convicted in July 2008 in Fairborn Municipal Court of an unrelated offense, disorderly conduct. Therefore, defendant does not qualify for expungement under R.C. 2953.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">{\u00b6 23} In granting defendant\u2019s application to seal the record of his public-indecency conviction, the trial court noted that defendant had made a compelling argument of undue hardship and that the court was relying upon <em>State v. Hilbert </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 824, 764 N.E.2d 1064, wherein the Eighth District Court of Appeals held that the trial court must liberally construe the expungement statute (R.C. 2953.32) so as to promote the legislative purpose of allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>expungements. Id. at 827. <em>Hilbert </em>does not, however, stand for the proposition that the expungement statute, R.C. 2953.32, should be construed so liberally in favor of the applicant as to ignore or excuse eligibility requirements for expungement, including not being a first offender. If an applicant for expungement is not a first offender, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant expungement, and any such order is void. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 141, 144, 18 O.O.3d 106, 411 N.E.2d 845; <em>State v. Winship, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-384, 2004-Ohio-6360, 2004 WL 2715906, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 24} Defendant complains that the prosecutor, acting on behalf of the state of Ohio, failed to file an \u201cobjection\u201d allowed by R.C. 2953.32(B). However, written objections by the prosecutor are not required. The purpose of the requirement is to set the grounds for the objection before the court. <em>State v. Hamilton </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 636, 665 N.E.2d 669. In this case, at the initial hearing on April 8, 2011, the prosecutor objected to granting defendant\u2019s application because he is not a first offender. We deem that action to satisfy the prosecutor\u2019s obligation to object imposed by R.C. 2953.32(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 25} Because defendant does not qualify as a first offender, he is not eligible for expungement of his public-indecency conviction. The trial court erred when it ordered expungement of the record of that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 26} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court granting defendant\u2019s application to seal the record of his public-indecency conviction will be reversed and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-9\">Donovan and Hall, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
