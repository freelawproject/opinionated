Roberts filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained incident and subsequent to the investigatory stop that gave rise to his arrest. The State of Montana (the State) appeals from the order of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, granting Roberts\u2019 motion to suppress. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in suppressing the State\u2019s evidence on the ground that the arresting officer lacked a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to stop Roberts\u2019 motor vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b63 Hearing loud and angry voices outside her house at 105 Daly Ave. in Hamilton on the evening of July 4, 1997, Davie Joan Neville (Neville) peeked out her window to investigate. In the front yard of the house next door at 107 Daly Ave., Neville observed that two men, whose movements were unsteady and whose speech was slurred, were engaged in a heated exchange. This conflict culminated with one man attempting to hit the other man with a piece of rebar. The sloppy speech and mannerisms of the two men led Neville to believe that they were extremely intoxicated. Neville then observed the two men climb into a white pickup truck and leave the house next door, heading towards downtown Hamilton. Just before 9:00 p.m. on the evening of July 4, 1997, Neville called the 911 dispatcher in Hamilton \u201cto report a guy that is drunk, [who] just left the driveway\u201d of 107 Daly Ave. in a pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b64 The information given by Neville to the 911 dispatcher included: Neville\u2019s description of the truck as a white Ford pickup, license plate number 13T-76V; Neville\u2019s observation that the truck, which contained two male occupants who had been engaged in a \u201cbig fight\u201d at 107 Daly Ave., appeared to be traveling towards downtown Hamilton; Neville\u2019s belief that the man driving the pickup, whom she could not identify by name or description, was \u201cdrunk\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t be driving\u201d because he \u201ccan barely walk\u201d; and Neville\u2019s name, address, and phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u00b65 Shortly after Neville\u2019s call, at 8:57 p.m., the 911 dispatcher sent out an \u201cattempt to locate\u201d bulletin to all police on patrol that evening. Overhearing this dispatch, on-duty Hamilton police officer, Ryan Oster (Officer Oster), responded. Officer Oster positively identified the white Ford truck approximately three minutes later, around 9:00 p.m., parked in downtown Hamilton. Although the pickup was unoccupied, Officer Oster noted that the truck was parked across the street from the Rainbow Bar. At that time, Officer Oster did not investigate the complaint further, but continued on his routine patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b66 Approximately 38 minutes later, at about 9:38 p.m., Officer Oster again passed by the Rainbow Bar and observed that the white pickup truck was no longer parked across the street. As he continued on his routine patrol, however, Officer Oster spotted the truck about a block-and-a-half away traveling back towards Daly Ave.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Officer Oster could not identify who was driving the pickup from that distance, he decided to \u201ccatch up with the vehicle\u201d and watch for signs of drunk driving. Officer Oster, a veteran of over 100 investigatory traffic stops, did not turn on his lights or sirens as he followed the pickup truck. During this time, Officer Oster did not observe any erratic driving or infractions of traffic laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b67 Officer Oster followed the white pickup truck and watched it turn into the one-lane driveway at 107 Daly Ave. Officer Oster pulled into the driveway behind the pickup truck, blocking its exit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon blocking Roberts\u2019 exit, both Officer Oster and Roberts got out of their vehicles simultaneously. Without any verbal invitation, Officer Oster then walked up the driveway and began to speak with Roberts. Officer Oster immediately noted that Roberts was \u201cextremely unsteady on his feet\u201d and \u201chad to hang on to the side of the vehicle\u201d to steady himself. In response to questioning, Roberts informed Officer Oster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>that he had injured his knee earlier in the day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Officer Oster observed a \u201cvery strong odor\u201d of alcohol on Roberts\u2019 breath, and also noted that his speech was \u201cslow and slurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b68 Due to Roberts\u2019 difficulty standing and the smell of alcohol on his breath, Officer Oster administered several field sobriety tests on Roberts and subsequently arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol and driving without a valid Montana driver\u2019s license. Later, at the Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Roberts provided a breath sample and his blood alcohol concentration was found to be .221.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b69 Although police attempted, after Roberts\u2019 arrest, to obtain an official statement from Neville, she steadfastly refused to cooperate. Only when the State subpoenaed Neville, did she appear at the suppression hearing and testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the suppression hearing, the District Court held that \u201cOfficer Oster did not have sufficient objective facts to support the conclusion that [Roberts] was engaged in wrongdoing and therefore when he blocked [Roberts\u2019] car in the driveway, he effected an unconstitutional seizure of [Roberts] under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d The State appeals from this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in suppressing the State\u2019s evidence on the ground that the arresting officer lacked a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to stop Roberts\u2019 motor vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b611  The standard of review for a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>1998 MT 233, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 77, \u00b6 9, 966 P.2d 137, \u00b6 9. Atrial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Henderson, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b6 12  When a police officer seizes a person, such as in a brief investigatory stop of a vehicle, the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures applies. <em>Bauer v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 119, 125, 910 P.2d 886, 889; <em>see also Reid v. Georgia </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 438, 440, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 2753, 65 L.Ed.2d 890, 893. However, this Court has recognized an exception to the general warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, which permits a limited and reasonable investigatory stop of a vehicle without probable cause where the State can establish: (1) objective data from which an experienced law enforcement officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting particularized suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity. <em>State v. Gopher </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (borrowing the test from <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621); <em>see also Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b613  This legal standard of \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d of wrongdoing is now codified at \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">Investigative Stop. In order to obtain or verify an account of the person\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest the person, a peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Section 46-5-401, MCA. The question of whether particularized suspicion of wrongdoing exists is a factually driven inquiry dependent upon the totality of circumstances giving rise to the investigative stop. <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 46, 50, 899 P.2d 540, 542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\u00b6 14 At the outset, we must determine whether an investigative stop occurred in this case. Even though, as the State points out, Roberts voluntarily pulled into the driveway and could have simply ignored Officer Oster\u2019s presence and walked into the house at 107 Daly Ave., we have no problem concluding, as the District Court did, that Officer Oster\u2019s actions constitute an investigative stop within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. This case is factually similar to <em>United States v. Kerr </em>(9th Cir. 1987), 817 F.2d 1384, wherein the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals faced \u201cthe unusual problem of characterizing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>automobile stop as either a voluntary encounter or an investigative stop.\u201d <em>Kerr, </em>817 F.2d at 1386.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Kerr, </em>an officer was on routine patrol in a rural neighborhood when he observed a parked car, with its trunk open, near a barn located on a residential property. In order to reach this residence, it was necessary to drive approximately seventy to one-hundred feet down a one-lane dirt driveway. Instead of waiting in his patrol car at the roadside, the officer pulled into and blocked the one-lane driveway just as the defendant was backing his car out. When the officer\u2019s vehicle was within approximately forty to fifty feet of the defendant\u2019s car, the defendant exited his vehicle and approached the officer on foot. The officer subsequently questioned the defendant, investigated the premises and, upon discovering a methamphetamine laboratory in the barn, arrested the defendant. <em>Kerr, </em>817 F.2d at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b6 15 The district court in <em>Kerr </em>concluded that the encounter did not constitute a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, as \u201c \u2018the mere fact that the road was temporarily blocked by a police car is not detention, inasmuch as defendant Kerr still could have done numerous things at this point, such as driving around the car, or simply ignoring the police officer.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Kerr, </em>817 F.2d at 1386. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, finding that the officer had \u201cprecipitated the confrontation\u201d when he pulled into the one-lane driveway and blocked the defendant\u2019s exit. Under these circumstances, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">[The officer\u2019s] authority and conduct provided [the defendant] with no reasonable alternative except an encounter with the police. Consequently, the encounter cannot be deemed voluntary. Voluntariness presupposes a freedom of choice that [the defendant] did not have. The district court\u2019s suggestion that [the defendant] could have backed around the car or ignored [the officer] defies common sense; <em>[the defendant\u2019s] freedom to depart was restrained at the moment [the officer] blocked the one-lane driveway. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKo\"><em>Kerr, </em>817 F.2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b616  \u201c[A] person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he [or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>she] was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497, 509 (footnote omitted). In this case, as in Kerr, while Officer Oster could have merely parked his patrol car on the shoulder in front of 107 Daly Ave., he chose to instead pull into the one-lane driveway and block Roberts\u2019 exit, thereby physically constraining Roberts\u2019 means and direction of travel. Furthermore, Officer Oster was armed and in uniform, and his show of authority in immediately exiting his patrol car and approaching Roberts added to the official nature of the encounter. Given these circumstances, the District Court correctly concluded that \u201c[a] reasonable person would not have felt free to leave a situation where a uniformed officer, in his patrol car, pulled his car into a driveway behind that person\u2019s car, blocking its exit.\u201d We hold that when Officer Oster pulled his patrol car into the one-lane driveway at 107 Daly Ave., thereby blocking Roberts\u2019 exit, he precipitated an investigative stop \u2014 amounting to a Fourth Amendment \u201cseizure\u201d of the person \u2014 during which a reasonable person would not have felt free to simply leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b617 We must now decide whether Officer Oster possessed a sufficient particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to justify the stop of Roberts\u2019 vehicle. Where, as here, an investigative stop stems from the tip of a citizen informant, this Court has adopted a three-part test to determine the reliability of the citizen informant\u2019s information: (1) whether the citizen informant identified herself to the authorities and thus exposed herself to civil and criminal liability if the report is false; (2) whether the report is based upon the citizen informant\u2019s personal observations; and (3) whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information. <em>State v. Pratt </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 156, 165, 951 P.2d 37, 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b6 18 The State contends that Officer Oster had a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to justifiably stop Roberts\u2019 vehicle based upon the information provided by Neville and Officer Oster\u2019s subsequent corroboration of that information, as required by <em>Pratt. </em>Roberts relies upon our decision in <em>State v. Lee </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 391, 938 P.2d 637, to argue that the District Court did not err in finding that an unconstitutional seizure had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b619 We agree with the District Court that the threshold element of <em>Pratt </em>is satisfied. Neville provided her name, address, and phone number to the 911 operator, thereby subjecting herself not only to civil liability, but also to criminal prosecution pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-205, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>MCA, if the authorities determined that the report was fabricated. We are unconvinced by Roberts\u2019 attempt to analogize this case to that of Lee, in which the citizen informant did not subj ect herself to civil or criminal liability because the tip was from an \u201canonymous caller.\u201d <em>See Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 395, 938 P.2d at 640; <em>see also Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 167, 951 P.2d at 44. Since Neville provided ample information upon which to find her liable for a false report, we give little stock to Roberts\u2019 argument that her \u201crefusal to cooperate\u201d with authorities following the initial 911 call suggeststhatNeville\u2019stip \u201cshould be likened to that of an anonymous informant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b620 However, we disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that neither the second nor the third <em>Pratt </em>elements are met in this case. With respect to the second <em>Pratt </em>element\u2014 whether the citizen informant\u2019s report is based on personal observations \u2014 the District Court reasoned that the \u201climited information\u201d provided in Neville\u2019s 911 call undermined its reliability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">[Neville] identified the truck, and said she suspected the individual driving the truck was intoxicated, because \u201che can barely walk.\u201d She did not identify the driver or passenger by name or description. She was able to only surmise where the truck was headed, and was not as particular as the informant in <em>Pratt, </em>who stated what direction and on what street the vehicle was traveling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6X\">\u00b621 Roberts argues that the court correctly found that, similar to <em>Lee, </em>Neville did not provide sufficient information to determine whether Neville\u2019s call was based on her personal observations. We disagree. In <em>Lee, </em>the anonymous caller provided only the following information: a statement that she \u201c \u2018believed [the defendant] was under the influence of alcohol and speeding,\u2019 \u201d along with a description of the vehicle and the direction in which it was heading. <em>Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 395, 938 P.2d at 640. While it is true that, like the informant in <em>Lee, </em>Neville did not state whether she had actually observed Roberts drinking or driving erratically, we adjudge Neville\u2019s information to be at least on par with that provided by the informant in <em>Pratt </em>and, thus, reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b622 In <em>Pratt, </em>a night manager for a convenience store informed authorities that he had observed a driver whom he believed to be intoxicated, and provided a description of the vehicle, including its license plate number, and the street name and direction in which the vehicle was traveling. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 159, 951 P.2d at 39. Here, Neville informed the 911 dispatcher that, from her residence at 105 Daly Ave., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>she had observed two males engaged in a \u201cbig fight\u201d in the front yard of 107 Daly Ave.; that the men had then climbed into a white Ford pickup truck, license plate number 13T-76V, and left the residence, heading down Daly Ave. in the general direction of downtown Hamilton; and that the driver was \u201cdrunk\u201d because he could \u201cbarely walk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeb\">\u00b623 Furthermore, as we recognized in <em>Pratt:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">An officer may infer that the information is based on the informant\u2019s personal observations if the information contains sufficient detail that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cit is apparent that the informant had not been fabricating [the] report out of whole cloth... [and] the report [is] of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reasonable way ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\"><em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42-43, <em>quoting State v. Villegas-Varela </em>(Or. App. 1994), 887 P.2d 809, 811. Thus, even though it was unclear from the record whether the informant in <em>Pratt </em>had personally observed the defendant, we concluded that the informant\u2019s identification of himself as an \u201con-duty manager of a retail establishment\u201d provided sufficient information to infer that he was \u201cin a position to have observed\u201d the defendant\u2019s intoxication. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 166, 951 P.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b624 Likewise, we conclude that the transcript of Neville\u2019s 911 call is of sufficient detail to infer that her report is of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way. The information relayed by Neville, as Roberts\u2019 next door neighbor, clearly placed her in a position to have observed indications of Roberts\u2019 intoxication. The basis for Neville\u2019s report that Roberts was a drunk driver consisted primarily of the following personal observations: \u201cThere was a big fight and then he got in the pickup with another guy, but he shouldn\u2019t be driving. He can barely walk.\u201d While Roberts\u2019 difficulty walking may be explained in part after the fact by his knee injury, it was reasonable for the authorities to infer that the altercation Neville observed was alcohol-related. Nor should we disregard, under the totality of the circumstances, the fact that Neville\u2019s report was filed on the eve of the Fourth of July, a national holiday renowned among Americans for its celebratory fervor. We hold that the second <em>Pratt </em>element is satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b625 Moreover, pursuant to the third element of the <em>Pratt </em>test, we conclude that Officer Oster adequately corroborated the information provided by Neville, thus giving rise to a particularized suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Roberts was driving under the influence of alcohol. In so concluding, we disagree with the District Court\u2019s finding that Officer Oster\u2019s corroboration was not sufficiently \u201ctimely\u201d because of the 38-minute time-lapse between his initial identification of the pickup and his ensuing pursuit of that truck. Principles of common sense must guide an officer\u2019s assessment of the objective facts and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in deciding whether to initiate an investigative traffic stop, much as common sense must illumine this Court\u2019s review of whether an officer had the requisite particularized suspicion to justify such a stop. \u201cDrawing artificial distinctions or \u2018time lines\u2019 in situations such as these does not comport with reality or common sense.\u201d <em>State v. Sharp </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 40, 47, 702 P.2d 959, 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b626 Corroboration occurs, under the third <em>Pratt </em>factor, when the officer either observes illegal activity <em>or </em>finds the person, the vehicle, or the vehicle\u2019s occupants <em>\u201csubstantially as described by the informant.\u201d Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43 (emphasis added). In applying the <em>Pratt </em>test, it is important to remember that the standard of \u201cparticularized suspicion does not require that the law enforcement officer be certain that an offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 12 <em>(citing State v. Morsette </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 233, 240, 654 P.2d 503, 507). Furthermore, a trained and experienced law enforcement officer is entitled to draw inferences and make deductions that might well elude a layperson in determining whether a specific vehicular stop is justified. <em>Gopher, </em>193 Mont. at 192-93, 631 P.2d at 295 (citing <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 418, 101 S.Ct. at 695, 66 L.Ed.2d at 629).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b627 Officer Oster, a veteran of over one-hundred prior investigatory traffic stops, corroborated Neville\u2019s description of the white pickup, as well as her tip that it had been heading in the general direction of town, when he positively identified the truck in downtown Hamilton a mere three minutes after receiving Neville\u2019s information from the 911 dispatcher. Although the vehicle was unoccupied at that time, Officer Oster noted that the truck was parked across the street from the Rainbow Bar at a time of night when most of the other businesses in the vicinity had already closed. Roughly 38 minutes later, Officer Oster again spotted the same vehicle, and noted at that time that the vehicle contained two occupants, as Neville had reported. While Officer Oster did not observe any indications of drunk driving in pursuing the vehicle, he did follow the pickup back to 107 Daly Ave., the very same address which Neville\u2019s 911 call had identified as the locale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the \u201cbig fight\u201d earlier in the evening. Given these circumstances, it was reasonable for Officer Oster to infer that the driver of the pickup \u2014 later identified as Roberts \u2014 left 107 Daly Ave. with a passenger and drove approximately five blocks to the Rainbow Bar to have a drink or purchase some alcohol, and that the driver he observed in the vehicle returning to 107 Daly Ave. was in fact the very same drunk driver whom Neville had reported driving away from that residence shortly before.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b628  Thus, in concluding that Neville\u2019s tip was not reliable and that Officer Oster\u2019s corroboration was not sufficiently timely, the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence before it. As such, the findings of the court regarding Officer Oster\u2019s lack of a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing are clearly erroneous. We hold that the investigatory stop of Roberts\u2019 vehicle was justified pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the District Court granting Roberts\u2019 motion to suppress and remand for trial. At trial, the State shall be permitted to introduce all evidence obtained incident and subsequent to the investigative stop giving rise to Roberts\u2019 arrest.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">.

Exhibits admitted at the suppression hearing show that the house at 107 Daly Ave. sits on the back of a small 14-acre lot; that the one-lane driveway is only wide enough to accommodate one vehicle for purposes of entry to and exit from the residence; that an irrigation ditch runs along the front edge of the lot, through the yard and underneath the driveway; and that, at the front of the lot parallel to the irrigation ditch, there is an unpaved shoulder with sufficient space to park a vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\">. In fact, Roberts had injured his knee earlier that day. Following his arrest, Roberts was thus taken to the local emergency room and given crutches prior to being booked in jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\">. As Roberts correctly notes, Neville\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing is largely irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment issue in this case because most of the information conveyed by Neville at the hearing was not communicated to the 911 dispatcher on the night in question and, thus, cannot be considered in determining whether Officer Oster had a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to stop Roberts\u2019 vehicle on the evening of July 4, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\">. This is a crucial characterization because a purely voluntary encounter between a law enforcement officer and a citizen intrudes upon no constitutionally protected interest and, thus, is accorded no protection under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Kerr, </em>817 F.2d at 1386.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b511-7\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajp\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u00b629 I concur in the result reached by the Court and, indeed, in its <em>Pratt </em>analysis. I would not reach the <em>Pratt </em>issue, however, because I would reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that an investigative stop occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\u00b630 As the Court points out, Roberts had just pulled into the driveway at 107 Daly Avenue when Officer Oster pulled in behind him. He easily could have ignored Officer Oster and proceeded into the house at that address. That he did not do so does not convert a voluntary encounter into an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">\u00b631 Moreover, <em>Kerr </em>is readily distinguishable. There, the officer blocked the one-lane driveway just as the defendant was backing his car out. As the Court emphasizes from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion, the defendant\u2019s \u201cfreedom to depart\u201d was restrained when the officer blocked the driveway. In the present case, however, Roberts was not attempting to depart and being \u2014 as the Court puts it \u2014 physically constrained as to his means and direction of travel by Officer Oster\u2019s arrival. Indeed, he had arrived at the place he was intending to reach and could have proceeded inside. I would conclude that the encounter between Roberts and Officer Oster was voluntary and that no invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>gative stop occurred. On that basis, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s suppression of the evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b512-4\">JUSTICE REGNIER</author>\n<p id=\"AcS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b632 I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion reversing the District Court\u2019s suppression of the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b633 The District Court carefully analyzed the facts of this case under our recent pronouncements in <em>State v. Lee </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 391, 938 P.2d 637, and <em>State v. Pratt </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 156, 951 P.2d 37. I agree with the majority that the first two parts of the <em>Pratt </em>test have been satisfied, that is, first, the citizen informant identified herself to the authorities, and, second, the informant\u2019s report was based upon an informant\u2019s personal observations. I do not believe, however, that the third part of the <em>Pratt </em>test, namely corroboration by the officer, was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b634 The District Court found that the citizen informant did not identify the driver or passenger by name or description. Officer Oster did observe the truck in question parked in Hamilton shortly after the informant\u2019s call, but it was 38 minutes later that Oster observed the truck being driven back toward 107 Daly. Without a description of the driver, Oster had no idea if the individual driving the truck was the same individual that the informant observed leave 107 Daly over one-half hour before. By the time Oster observed the truck, the informant\u2019s information was nearly 40 minutes old, and when Oster parked his patrol car behind the defendant\u2019s truck, he had only scant information from the 911 call, observed no traffic violations, and had no other basis to justify the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\u00b635 In <em>Pratt, </em>corroboration was found where the officer \u201cobserved the described vehicle within a short period of time, traveling in the direction and on the same street indicated by Lafournaise.\u201d <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 166, 951 P.2d at 43. The investigative stop in <em>Pratt </em>occurred \u201cmere moments\u201d after the officer was advised by dispatch. <em>See Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 167, 951 P.2d at 44. Under this scenario, the officer could be almost certain that the person driving was the same one reported mere moments before. Here, the informant was only able to surmise where the truck was headed. By the time Oster saw the vehicle in motion, he had no idea who was driving. The officer conducting the stop must have a particularized suspicion and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity. <em>See Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 394, 938 P.2d at 639. Furthermore, where a citizen tip is less reliable, as with the tip here, more corroboration is required by the ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>resting officer to establish particularized suspicion. <em>See </em>Pratt, 286 Mont. at 168, 951 P.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b636 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s suppression of this evidence. In my view, the District Court properly concluded that, based on the totality of the circumstances, there was not a particularized suspicion to support this investigative stop.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-5\">JUSTICES HUNT and TRIEWEILER join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
