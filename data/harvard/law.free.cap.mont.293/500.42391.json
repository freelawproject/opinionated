They separated on January 4, 1995. Nine months later, on September 14, 1995, Julie filed a petition for dissolution of marriage. On March 8, 1996, Julie moved the court to allow her to amend her petition for dissolution to add Don Moss (Don) and Shirley Moss (Shirley), Steve\u2019s parents, as additional parties to the case and to include a cause of action to quiet title in Steve and Julie\u2019s names to a 20 acre tract known as the Spaulding Bridge Property. The District Court granted Julie\u2019s motion on March 27, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b68 On August 23, 1996, Julie filed an amended petition for dissolution wherein she alleged that Don and Shirley advanced her and Steve the money to pay for the Spaulding Bridge Property and that she and Steve repaid the advance. Thus, even though Don and Shirley held title to the Spaulding Bridge Property, Julie contended that she and Steve owned it and, consequently, that it should be included in the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b69 On September 30, 1996, Don and Shirley filed a response to Julie\u2019s amended petition wherein they alleged that neither Steve nor Julie had an ownership interest in the Spaulding Bridge Property. Don and Shirley also requested the court to quiet title to the Spaulding Bridge Property in their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b610 The District Court held a bench trial on November 14 and 15, 1996. On May 21, 1997, the court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order wherein it found that Don and Shirley advanced Steve and Julie the money to buy the Spaulding Bridge Property and that Steve repaid Don and Shirley. Notwithstanding, the court found that Steve\u2019s interest in the Spaulding Bridge Property is equal to one-half of its value. As a result, the court included one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property in the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"AMt\">\u00b6 11 The District Court also heard testimony at the trial on this matter regarding a $1,400 check which Julie\u2019s and Steve\u2019s homeowners insurance carrier paid them for damage to the siding of their garage which occurred when Julie and Steve were separated. The court, however, did not make any findings regarding the check nor did the court apportion it to either Julie or Steve.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b612 Steve appeals and Julie cross-appeals from the court\u2019s decision to include one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property in the marital estate and from the court\u2019s failure to distribute the $1,400 insurance check. Julie also requests her attorney fees, mediation fees and costs for defending Steve\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b613 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Pfeifer, </em>1998 MT 228, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 23, \u00b6 9, 965 P.2d 895, \u00b6 9 (citing Ash <em>Grove Cement Co. v. Jefferson County (1997), 283 Mont. 486, 491-92, 943 P.2d 85, 89).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b614 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact in a distribution of marital property case to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Kovarik v. Kovarik, </em>1998 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 287 Mont. 350, \u00b6 20, 954 P.2d 1147, \u00b6 20. See also Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Kovarik, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Stufft </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 454, 459, 916 P.2d 767, 770).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b6 15 If a district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, we review the court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Kovarik, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Marriage of Stufft, </em>276 Mont. at 459, 916 P.2d at 770). To determine whether a district court abused its discretion, we review the case to ascertain whether the court \u201cacted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Kovarik, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>In re Marriage of Wessel </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 326, 333, 715 P.2d 45, 50).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court err in including one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property in the marital estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\u00b6 17 Julie argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that Steve owned a one-half interest in the Spaulding Bridge Property is clearly erroneous because it is not supported by substantial evidence. Steve argues that the District Court erred in including one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property in the marital estate because Don and Shirley own it.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">\u00b6 18 Although it is undisputed that Don and Shirley hold title to the Spaulding Bridge Property, the testimony at the bench trial on this matter was conflicting as to who paid for the property. Julie testified that Steve purchased the property for them in April 1985 with money that Don and Shirley loaned them. Julie explained that she and Steve, at that point in time, planned to build a house on the property. Julie testified that Steve told her that he had paid off the loan and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>that she remembered him \u201cfeeling good about that.\u201d Julie also re\u00a3 membered a conversation which occurred at the Taco Time restaurant in Belgrade wherein she said, \u201cnow that we have the property paid for, Steve, we should probably have it put in our name.\u201d Julie testified that Steve replied, \u2018Yeah, I gotta do that one of these days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">\u00b619 Julie\u2019s parents also testified that Steve told them that he bought the Spaulding Bridge Property. Julie\u2019s parents also recalled that Steve stated at Taco Time that he agreed that title should be transferred into his and Julie\u2019s names.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b620 Steve, in contrast, testified that he told his parents about the property and that they purchased it. Steve stated that his parents owned the property and denied that he paid his parents for the property. Similarly, Don testified that he and Shirley own the property. Shirley, likewise, stated that she and Don bought the property as an investment and denied that the property was purchased for Julie and Steve.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b621 The District Court specifically found Julie\u2019s and her parent\u2019s testimony credible. In contrast, the court specifically found Steve\u2019s, Don\u2019s and Shirley\u2019s testimony not credible. Therefore, the court found that \u201cDon and Shirley advanced the money to Steve and Julie for the purchase of an interest in the Spaulding Bridge property\u201d and that \u201cSteve repaid his parents in cash.\u201d The court then found that Steve had an interest in one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property and thus, in effect, that Steve jointly owned the property with Don and Shirley.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b622 Having reviewed the record, however, we conclude that there is no evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Steve had an ownership interest in only one-half of the value of the property. The trial testimony left no room for the District Court to take the middle ground and find, in effect, that Steve jointly owned the property with Don and Shirley. Thus, since there is not substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that Steve had an ownership interest in only one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property, the court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous and we therefore reverse that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"AYY\">\u00b623  Consequently, since \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, states that the court shall \u201cequitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both...,\u201d the District Court erred in including only one-half the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property in the marital estate on the grounds that Steve owned a one-half interest in the property. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>include only one-half of the value of the Spaulding Bridge Property in the marital estate on the grounds that Steve owned a one-half interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court err in not imposing a constructive trust on the Spaulding Bridge Property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b625 As noted above, it is undisputed that Don and Shirley hold title to the Spaulding Bridge Property. Julie, however, argues that the District Court should have imposed a constructive trust on the property, in favor of her and Steve, and, consequently, should have included the entire value of the property in the marital estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Steve argues that the District Court correctly concluded that a constructive trust should not be imposed in the instant case because there is no evidence of fraud or other wrongful acts to support such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b626 Steve cites <em>In re Marriage of Malquist </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 419, 763 P.2d 1116 and In <em>re Marriage of Owen </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 306, 797 P.2d 226, in support of his argument that there is no basis to impose a constructive trust in the instant case because the record does not contain any evidence of fraud or wrongful acts. In <em>Marriage ofMalquist, </em>the wife asserted that the family home was either part of a voluntary trust or that the district court should have imposed either a constructive trust or a resulting trust on the property. This Court refused to address her argument that a constructive trust should be imposed because the record was \u201cvirtually silent as to any such fraudulent or wrongful acts which would justify the implication of a constructive trust.\u201d <em>Marriage of Malquist, </em>234 Mont. at 422, 763 P.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">\u00b627 Similarly, in <em>Marriage of Owen, </em>the wife argued that a constructive trust should have been imposed on a house purchased by her husband\u2019s parents. The wife pointed out that she and her husband selected the house, handled the negotiations for its purchase and paid $1,000 of the $15,000 down payment. Even so, we rejected the wife\u2019s claim that she and her husband had an ownership interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>house because her husband\u2019s parents not only held title to the property but also paid the mortgage, entered into a written lease agreement with their son and his wife, sent them an eviction notice for failing to pay rent, and discussed selling the house with a real estate agent. <em>Marriage of Owen, </em>244 Mont. at 309, 797 P.2d at 228. Moreover, we stated that we would not address the wife\u2019s argument that a constructive trust should have been imposed because \u201cthe record [was] silent as to any wrongful or fraudulent acts requiring such a remedy.\u201d <em>Marriage of Owen, </em>244 Mont. at 309, 797 P.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b628 The rule requiring fraud or other wrongful acts to impose a constructive trust on property can be traced to a longstanding statute which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">One who gains a thing by fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful act is, unless he has some other or better right thereto, an involuntary trustee of the thing gained for the benefit of the person who would otherwise have had it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Section 72-20-111, MCA (1987) (repealed 1989). See also <em>Meagher v. Harrington </em>(1927), 78 Mont. 457, 470, 254 P. 432, 435 (citing \u00a7 7887, ROM (1921)) and <em>Platts v. Platts </em>(1959), 134 Mont. 474, 480, 334 P.2d 722, 727 (citing \u00a7 86-210, ROM (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b629  However, the 1989 Montana Legislature repealed \u00a7 72-20-111, MCA (1987), along with several other statutes concerning trusts, and enacted the Trust Code, codified at Title 72, Chapters 33-36 of the Montana Code Annotated. Section 72-33-104, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Other than 72-33-216 through 72-33-220, nothing in chapters 33 through 36 affects the law relating to constructive or resulting trusts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Section 72-33-219, MCA, however, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">A constructive trust arises when a person holding title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that the person holding title would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Hence, \u00a7 72-33-219, MCA, affected the law relating to constructive trusts by making constructive trusts dependent upon, and related to, the equitable principle of unjust enrichment. See <em>Lawrence v. Clepper </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 45, 53, 865 P.2d 1150, 1156. More to the point, \u00a7 72-33-219, MCA, by its plain language, does not require a party seeking to impose a constructive trust to prove that the party who holds ti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tie to the property obtained title by fraud or other wrongful acts. Rather, a person seeking to impose a constructive trust on property must only prove that the title holder would be unjustly enriched if they were permitted to retain title. Thus, as stated in the comments to the Restatement section from which \u00a7 72-33-219, MCA, was drawn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnD\">A constructive trust is imposed not because of the intention of the parties but because the person holding the title to property would profit by a wrong <em>or would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to keep the property.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Restatement of the Law of Restitution, \u00a7 160, Comment <em>b </em>(1937) (emphasis added). See also George T. Bogert, Trusts \u00a7 77 at 287 (6th ed. 1987) (stating \u201c[wjhenever equity finds that one has title to property, real or personal, originally acquired by any kind of wrongdoing <em>or, although innocently obtained, now held under such circumstances that retention of the title will result in unjust enrichment, </em>equity may declare such title-holder to be the trustee of a trust constructed by it for the purpose of working out justice, which is merely a convenient means of remedying a wrong.\u201d) (emphasis added). Therefore, although a constructive trust may be imposed because the title holder obtained title by fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful act, a constructive trust may also be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-219, MCA, in cases where a title holder innocently obtained title to property but would be unjustly enriched if they were allowed to retain the title.</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">\u00b630 Notwithstanding, we recognize that this Court has stated in cases decided after the effective date of the Trust Code that fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful acts are the bases upon which a constructive trust is found. See, for example, <em>Hilliard v. Hilliard </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 487, 489, 844 P.2d 54, 55 (citing <em>Gitto v. Gitto </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 47, 778 P.2d 906 and <em>Howard v. Dalio </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 316, 815 P.2d 1150). However, based on the foregoing, we conclude that, although fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful acts may be the basis for imposing a constructive trust, these factors are not necessarily a prerequisite to imposing a constructive trust pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-219, MCA. Consequently, <em>Hilliard, </em>255 Mont. 487, 844 P.2d <em>54; Howard, </em>249 Mont. 316, 815 P.2d 1150; <em>Marriage of Owen, </em>244 Mont. 306, 797 P.2d 226; and any other Montana case decided after the effective date of the Trust Code which requires fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>wrongful acts as the only basis on which to impose a constructive trust, are hereby clarified to that extent. Moreover, cases decided before the effective date of the Trust Code, such as <em>Marriage of Malquist, </em>are inapplicable to constructive trust cases under the Trust Code to the extent that they require fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful acts as the only basis on which to impose a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b631 In the instant case, Julie argues, and we agree, that Don and Shirley would be unjustly enriched if they retained title to the Spaulding Bridge Property even though they hold title to the property and have paid the taxes and insurance on the property. The District Court found that Don and Shirley advanced Steve and Julie the purchase price of the property and that Steve paid off this debt. Moreover, the court found that Steve spent more than $4,000 of marital funds to drill a well on the property and that Steve and Julie obtained the water rights to the property. The court also found that Steve and Julie built a barn on the property so that they would have a place to live while they built a house on the property and that Steve paid for the electrical and building permits necessary to construct the barn. Finally, the court found that Steve paid for the utility bills on the property and that he was the contact person for the property owner\u2019s association. Steve has not appealed from these findings of fact, and thus they constitute established facts. <em>St. John v. Missoula Elec. Co-op., Inc. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 315, 320, 938 P.2d 586, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b632 Moreover, testimony which the District Court found credible shows that the parties treated the property as though Steve and Julie owned it. For example, David Gannett (Gannett), who is not related to either Julie or Steve, testified that he called Don in an effort to set up a property owner\u2019s association. Gannett testified that Don stated that he was only the title holder for \u201cconvenience purposes,\u201d that Steve was handling the property, and, therefore, that Gannett should contact Steve regarding any meetings. Similarly, Jeannette Carlson (Carlson), who also is not related to either Julie or Steve, testified that she approached Don at his shop to talk about the property owner\u2019s association. Carlson testified that Don told her that his name was on the title \u201cjust to help [Steve and Julie] buy the property\u201d and that she should talk to Steve about matters concerning the property. Carlson also recounted that she asked Steve if he was interested in selling the property and that Steve quoted her a price. Additionally, the court found that Julie\u2019s family helped build the barn on the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>planted trees on the property and that Julie\u2019s father helped Steve put up a fence on the property. The court noted that Julie\u2019s family testified that they helped with the improvements because they believed that the property belonged to Steve and Julie.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b633  Consequently, based on the District Court\u2019s findings that Steve repaid his parents the purchase price of the property, that Steve paid for improvements on the property and that the parties acted as though Steve and Julie owned it, we hold that Don and Shirley would be unjustly enriched if they retained title to the Spaulding Bridge Property. Thus, the District Court erred in not imposing a constructive trust on the property pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-219, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b634 Finally, we must address Steve\u2019s arguments that the statute of frauds and the statute of limitations for agreements not in writing bar any claim that Julie has to the Spaulding Bridge Property. Section 70-20-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">No estate or interest in real property, other than an estate at will or for a term not exceeding 1 year can be created, granted, assigned, surrendered, or declared otherwise than by <em>operation of law </em>or a conveyance or other instrument in writing, subscribed by the party creating, granting, assigning, surrendering, or declaring it or by his lawful agent thereunto authorized by writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">(Emphasis added.) Constructive trusts arise by operation of law, \u00a7 72-33-220, MCA, thus, \u00a7 70-20-101, MCA, does not bar Julie\u2019s claim to the Spaulding Bridge Property. See also \u00a7 70-20-102(2), MCA (stating that \u00a7 70-20-101, MCA, must not be construed to \u201cprevent any trust from arising... by... operation of law.\u201d). Moreover, since Julie is not attempting to directly enforce a verbal agreement, \u00a7 27-2-202(2), MCA, which requires that an action based upon a contract, account, or promise not founded on an instrument in writing be brought within five years, is not applicable in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u00b635 Based on the foregoing, we reverse the District Court\u2019s decision not to impose a constructive trust on the Spaulding Bridge Property and remand the instant case with instructions to impose a constructive trust on the property in favor of Steve and Julie and, consequently, to impose an equitable duty on Don and Shirley to convey the property to Julie and Steve and, thereafter, to include it in the marital estate and equitably apportion the full value of the property pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court err in not distributing an insurance check to either Steve or Julie?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b637 Steve and Julie agree that the District Court erred in failing to apportion a $1,400 insurance check which was issued to them jointly for damage to the siding on their garage which occurred after they separated. Steve argues that, since he repaired the siding, this Court should distribute the check to him as reimbursement for his labor and expenses. Julie requests that we remand this issue to the District Court with instructions to divide the check equally between Steve and Julie.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b638 However, since the District Court made no findings or conclusions regarding the $ 1,400 check, we have no basis to instruct the District Court on how to apportion it. Cf. <em>St. John, </em>282 Mont. at 321, 938 P.2d at 589 (citing <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 239, 896 P.2d 411, 429 and Saner <em>v. Cook </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 221, 228, 596 P.2d 200, 204) (ruling that this Court had no basis for determining whether a claim for severe emotional distress had merit because the trial court made no findings and conclusions regarding whether the evidence supported such a claim). Accordingly, we remand this case to the District Court with instructions to enter findings of fact regarding the $1,400 insurance check and to equitably apportion it pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u00b639 <em>Should this Court require Steve to pay Julie\u2019s attorney fees, mediation fees and costs for this appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\u00b640 Julie argues that we should award her attorney fees, mediation fees and costs for defending this appeal pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-110(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">The court from time to time, after considering the financial resources of both parties, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under chapters 1 and 4 and for professional fees, including sums for legal and professional services rendered and costs incurred prior to the commencement of the proceeding or after entry of judgment. The court may order that the amount be paid directly to the professional, who may enforce the order in the professional\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA, this Court may award attorney fees incurred in defending an appeal. <em>In re Marriage of Dorsey </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 392, 397, 945 P.2d 430, 433. See also <em>In re Marriage of Conkey </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 200, 207-08, 890 P.2d 1291, 1295. Section 40-4-110, MCA, requires the court to consider the financial resources of both parties. We cannot consider the financial resources of the parties at this stage of the instant case, however, because the complete marital estate has not been equitably apportioned by the District Court. Moreover, we note that the trial court is in a better position to rule on the matter of attorney fees and that Julie can raise her claim for attorney fees on remand. Accordingly, we decline to award Julie her attorney fees, mediation fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"APG\">\u00b641 Julie also argues that we should award her attorney fees, mediation fees and costs pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P, on the grounds that Steve\u2019s appeal was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds. Rule 32, M.R.App.P, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">If the supreme court is satisfied from the record and the presentation of the appeal in a civil case that the same was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds, such damages may be assessed on determination thereof as under the circumstances are deemed proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">As a general rule, this Court will not impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.Civ.P, unless the appeal is entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay or unless counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse of the judicial system. <em>Bi-Lo Foods, Inc. v. Alpine Bank, Clifton, </em>1998 MT 40, \u00b6 36, 287 Mont. 367, \u00b6 36, 955 P.2d 154, \u00b6 36 (citing CNA <em>Ins. Companies v. Dunn </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 295, 301, 902 P.2d 1014, 1018 and <em>Bickler v. The Racquet Club Heights Assoc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 19, 25, 850 P.2d 967, 971). Although we did not rule in Steve\u2019s favor nor grant him the relief he requested, the issues he raised had merit and were not unreasonable. Therefore, we deny Julie\u2019s request for attorney fees, mediation fees and costs pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b642 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-7\">JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">. Julie also argues for the first time in her reply brief that, even if a constructive trust is not imposed in the instant case, a resulting trust should be imposed. This Court, however, will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 28, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 28, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 28 (citation omitted). Moreover, this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>Unified Industries, </em>\u00b6 28 (citation omitted). Accordingly, we will not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
