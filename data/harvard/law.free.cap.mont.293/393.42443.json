After briefing and oral argument by the parties and by the Montana Trial Lawyers Association (MTLA) as <em>amicus curiae, </em>we answer this question in the negative for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b63 On May 30,1997, Reann Rothwell (Rothwell) filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company, Allstate Indemnity Company, Novus Credit Service, Inc. f/k/a Allstate Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiary companies, and Allstate Motor Club, Inc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cAllstate\u201d). Rothwell was an insurance agent for Allstate from 1989 until 1997. The complaint sought to require Allstate to indemnify and reimburse Roth-well for office and other employment-related expenses incurred in the course and scope of her employment with Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b64 On July 15,1997, Allstate filed a motion to dismiss the complaint arguing that it failed to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., and that Rothwell had waived her statutory right to seek indemnification or reimbursement of these expenses by signing Allstate\u2019s standardized employment agreement. This agreement provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">II. Office Expense Allowance (OEA)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">1. The Neighborhood Office Agent is responsible for his/her office expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">2. The Office Expense Allowance, the formula for which is described in the Neighborhood Office Agent Manual(s), is a Company authorized office expense reimbursement and is not a fund, compensation, or income. As such, amounts accrued in your OEA account belong to the Company and these amounts are used to reimburse you for Company authorized expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">3. Allstate reimburses actual expenses to the limit of the agent\u2019s OEA for specified office expenses as described in the Neighborhood Office Agent Manual(s). Any amount spent in excess of the OEA is the responsibility of the agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Allstate asserted that this agreement required Rothwell to assume responsibility for the expenses of operating an office for Allstate subject to partial reimbursement by Allstate pursuant to the contract language quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\u00b65 Rothwell opposed Allstate\u2019s motion to dismiss arguing that the agreement is unenforceable and that the OEA reimbursement scheme is void as against public policy because it is inconsistent with \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA. The United States District Court certified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>above question to this Court and stayed all proceedings pending this Court\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b66 Allstate argues that under \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, while an employer is generally responsible for reimbursing an employee\u2019s necessary expenses, the provisions of that subsection may be waived and the parties may agree to a different relationship. Allstate relies on \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Waiver of benefit of a law. Anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit. But a law established for a public reason cannot be contravened by a private agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_XG\">Under this code section, individuals may waive any of their statutory rights unless waiver of those rights violates public policy. Thus, resolution of the certified question turns on whether \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, was established for a public reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b6 7 Although this is an issue of first impression in Montana, previous decisions of this Court involving employment-related issues provide guidance in determining this question. In <em>State ex rel. Neiss v. District Court </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 324, 511 P.2d 979, a hotel owner failed to pay the minimum wage as prescribed by statute to various desk clerks and room maintenance employees. The Montana Commissioner of Labor and Industry ordered the employer to pay the employees the difference between the amount actually paid and the minimum wage. Instead, the employer settled the claims of several employees for amounts less than the amounts due under the minimum wage statute. This Court determined that minimum wage provisions exist for the benefit of the public as a whole, thus employees may not bargain away their right to receive minimum wage. <em>Neiss, </em>162 Mont. at 328, 511 P.2d at 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b68 Similarly, <em>in Hoehne v. Sherrodd, Inc. </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 365, 668 P.2d 232, an employer who provided heavy equipment and personnel to operate that equipment to oil companies in Montana and North Dakota, failed to pay overtime compensation to one of its heavy equipment operators. The employee claimed that he accumulated overtime hours but was not paid the overtime rate for such hours. The employer argued that the employee was estopped from claiming overtime compensation because he failed to report accumulated overtime hours and did not inform the employer that he expected overtime pay. This Court determined that the laws establishing an employee\u2019s right to receive overtime compensation are expressions of public policy ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ated for the protection and benefit of the general public, thus, private waiver of that right, by implication or agreement, is contrary to public policy. <em>Hoehne, </em>205 Mont. at 369-70, 668 P.2d at 234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b69 Indemnification of an employee for expenses incurred in the discharge of the employee\u2019s duties is a form of employee compensation similar to the payment of overtime compensation and minimum wage. Section 39-3-406(1), MCA, sets forth a list of exclusions describing 16 different categories of workers to whom Montana\u2019s minimum wage and overtime compensation laws do not apply. In addition, \u00a7 39-3-406(2), MCA, sets forth a list of an additional 25 categories of workers to whom Montana\u2019s overtime compensation laws do not apply. Hence, while not all workers in Montana are entitled to the benefits of the minimum wage and overtime compensation laws, this Court has determined that these laws were established for a public reason and that they are expressions of public policy. Section 39-2-701(1), MCA, has no comparable list of exclusions, thus it protects a greater number of workers than the minimum wage and overtime compensation laws. Consequently, if the minimum wage and overtime compensation laws are expressions of public policy, then \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, which protects a greater number of workers, is also an expression of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b610 Moreover, in <em>Hoehne, </em>this Court cited three cases to illustrate what laws are considered to be for a private benefit, thus waiver was deemed proper: <em>H. Earl Clack Co. v. Staunton </em>(1937), 105 Mont. 375, 72 P.2d 1022 (holding that a statutory notice requirement was enacted for the benefit of the subcontractor, thus the notice requirement could be waived); <em>Anaconda Copper Mining Co. v. Ravalli County </em>(1919), 56 Mont. 530, 186 P. 332 (holding that waiver of a statutory notice requirement was proper where the taxpayer had the opportunity to appear to oppose an increase in taxes); <em>Shea v. North-Butte Mining Co. </em>(1919), 55 Mont. 522, 179 P. 499 (holding that an employee\u2019s election not to be bound by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act did not constitute a waiver in violation of public policy because the law in existence at that time allowed employees to elect not to be bound by the Act, thereby preserving their right to prosecute an action for damages against an employer for injuries suffered during the course of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b611 Similarly, in <em>Matter of Gaither </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 383, 797 P.2d 208, this Court determined that a widow had the right to waive or abandon her right to receive her deceased husband\u2019s worker\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>pensation benefits because the right to receive those benefits was personal to her. And, in <em>Parchen v. Chessman </em>(1914), 49 Mont. 326, 142 P. 631, this Court determined that statutes of limitations may be waived because they are a personal privilege for the benefit of individuals and not to secure general objects of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b612 We conclude that the case <em>sub judice </em>is dissimilar to the five cases cited above wherein we determined that the statutory provision at issue in each case was enacted for a private benefit and could, thus, be waived. In the present case, waiver of the right to indemnification would result in the forfeiture of a valuable right granted to all Montana employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b613 The Montana statutes governing payment of minimum wage, overtime compensation, workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and unemployment benefits, contain separate statutory provisions prohibiting waiver of those benefits. Allstate argues that because \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, is not accompanied by an express statement of public policy or an express prohibition of contracts that waive the right to indemnify, the principle of <em>expressio unius estexclusio alterius </em>(the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another) demonstrates that there is no bar to waiver of the general indemnity right. We- disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b614  Section 39-2-701 (l), MCA, provides for only one exception to the requirement that an employer indemnify his employee. That exception is found in subsection (2), which provides: \u201cAn employer is not bound to indemnify his employee for losses suffered by the latter in consequence of the ordinary risks of the business in which he is employed.\u201d Thus, under the above principle, \u201cthe expression of one thing\u201d\u2014i.e., the exception for losses\u2014\"is the exclusion of another\"\u2014i.e., any exception for waiver of the right to seek indemnification or reimbursement of expenses by private agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b615 Allstate also argues that we should look at the legislative history of \u00a7 39-2-701, MCA, and conclude that, under basic principles of agency, <em>in the absence of a contract to the contrary, </em>an employer is responsible for the necessary expenses of its employees. However, to do so would require us to read into the statute a provision that is not there. That is not the function or duty of this Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b616  Because we conclude that \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, is a form of employee compensation that exists for the benefit of the public as a whole, the answer to the certified question is \u201cNo,\u201d the provisions of \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, may not be waived by an employee.</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b423-4\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ASg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b617 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion holding that the indemnification provisions contained in \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, cannot be waived by an employee via contract. As result, I would answer the question certified to this Court from the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Great Falls Division, in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"AOa\">\u00b618 The present case requires us to focus on two statutes. The first, \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, provides that an employer is generally responsible for reimbursing expenses necessarily expended by an employee in the discharge of employment duties. The second, \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, provides that a person may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his or her benefit, but that \u201ca law established for a public reason cannot be contravened by a private agreement.\u201d The issue before us is whether \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, is a law established for a public reason which may not be waived by the contract between Rothwell and Allstate or, alternatively, whether it is a law intended solely for the benefit of individual employees like Rothwell which she waived via the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b619 I agree with the Court that, in previous cases such as <em>Neiss </em>and <em>Hoehne, </em>we have held that certain laws \u2014 specifically, minimum wage and overtime compensation statutes \u2014 were enacted for a public reason (that is, for the benefit of the public as a whole rather than for the sole benefit of individual employees) and were not waivable via private contract. In addition, the Court is correct that, in other cases, we have held that a statute requiring notice to a subcontractor, a statutory notice requirement favoring a taxpayer, and a law permitting an employee to elect not to be bound by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (under the law in effect at the time which allowed such an election, thereby preserving the employee\u2019s right to sue the employer for damages) were waivable statutory rights intended to benefit the individuals, rather than statutes established for a public reason. <em>See Earl Clack Co., Anaconda Copper Mining Co., </em>and <em>Shea. </em>In addition, we have held that a widow could waive her right to receive her deceased husband\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits because the right to those benefits was personal to her, and that statutes of limitations may be waived because they are a personal privilege benefitting individuals and were not established to secure general objects of policy. <em>See Matter of Gaither </em>and <em>Parchen. </em>However, none of our previous opinions re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>lating to whether certain statutes are \u201cestablished for a public reason\u201d or are intended solely for the benefit of the individual contains a substantive analysis or evaluation of the appropriate means for distinguishing between the two types of statutes for purposes of determining whether they can \u2014 or cannot \u2014 be waived by private agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b620 Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s opinion in the present case also does not offer any insight into the proper way to distinguish between the two types of statutes at issue here in order to resolve the ultimate issue of waiver. As a result, it also does not provide any guidance to trial courts, lawyers and litigants in resolving this issue in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"Aac\">\u00b621 Instead, the Court simply states in a conclusory fashion, and without further elucidation, that \u201c[i]ndemnification of an employee for expenses incurred in the discharge of the employee\u2019s duties is a form of employee compensation similar to the payment of overtime compensation and minimum wage.\u201d On that basis, it concludes that the present case \u201cis dissimilar\u201d to our earlier cases, referenced above, which determined that the specific statutory provisions at issue therein were enacted for a private benefit and, thus, could be waived. Again, no explanation or analysis is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b622 Given this backdrop, it is difficult to discuss the legal error in the Court\u2019s opinion, so I will confine myself to two points. First, at least as presented by the Court, I disagree that the indemnification of an employee for expenses necessarily expended in the discharge of employment duties is a form of compensation \u201csimilar\u201d to the payment of overtime and minimum wage. The Court cites to no authority in support of this proposition and, certainly, nothing in the language of \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, fairly can be said to support the Court\u2019s statement. Rather, it is important to observe that \u00a7 39-2-701, MCA, is located in a different chapter of Title 39 than are the minimum wage and overtime laws: \u00a7 39-2-701, MCA, is located in Chapter 2 of that Title, entitled \u201cThe Employment Relationship,\u201d while the minimum wage and overtime laws are contained in Chapter 3 of Title 39, entitled \u201cWages and Wage Protection.\u201d Moreover, the Legislature has enacted a strong policy statement with regard to minimum wage and overtime compensation, which makes clear that those statutes are, indeed, established for a public reason and not intended for the sole benefit of individuals. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-3-401, MCA. Thus, it is clear from both the Legislature\u2019s policy declaration and our prior cases that the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>fits of the minimum wage and overtime statutes cannot be waived by private agreement, a proposition with which I wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AdS\">\u00b623 No such policy declaration or case law, however, supports the notion that statutory indemnification of employees is a \u201cform of employee compensation similar to\u201d minimum wage and overtime. In addition, while the statutory definition of \u201cwage\u201d set forth at \u00a7 39-3-402(7)(a), MCA \u2014 in the Wages and Wage Protection chapter of Title 39 \u2014 conceivably could be read to include indemnification of or reimbursement to an employee for expenses relating to the employment, the Legislature has limited the application of that definition to the minimum wage and overtime compensation statutes <em>(see </em>\u00a7 39-3-402, MCA) and, as a result, that definition cannot properly be applied in the context of \u00a7 39-2-701, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-107, MCA. The same is true of the statutory definition of \u201cwages\u201d contained in \u00a7 39-3-201(7)(a), MCA. Finally, in this regard, we have held that indemnification payments to employees under \u00a7 39-2-701(1), MCA, the very statute at issue in the present case, are not \u201cwages\u201d under \u00a7 39-3-201, MCA, or \u00a7 39-3-206, MCA, for purposes of the penalty provided in the latter statute for failure to timely pay wages. <em>Johnston v. K &amp; T Mfg., Inc. </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 458, 460, 625 P.2d 66, 67. For all these reasons, it is my view that the Court\u2019s \u201csimilar to\u201d conclusion is without legal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b624 My second point with regard to the error I perceive in the Court\u2019s opinion is the Court\u2019s somewhat loose use of the term \u201can expression of public policy\u201d as the equivalent of the language \u201cestablished for a public reason\u201d which is contained in \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA. It can \u2014 and should \u2014 be said that every statute duly enacted by the Legislature is an expression of public policy with regard to its subject matter. However, the \u201cpublic policy\u201d connotation cannot properly be equated to the \u201cpublic reason\u201d language in \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, because to do so would render \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA, a nullity. Section 1-3-204, MCA, clearly contemplates that only some laws have been established for a \u201cpublic reason\u201d and, pursuant to the statute, the benefit of such laws cannot be waived by private contract. Interpreting \u201cpublic reason\u201d and \u201cpublic policy\u201d as essentially identical renders the language of \u00a7 1-3-204, MCA \u2014 permitting waiver of the advantage of a law intended solely for an individual\u2019s benefit \u2014 totally ineffective and mere verbiage. Such a result clearly was not intended by the Legislature and we are obligated to interpret statutes to give them effect wherever possible, rather than to render them mere surplusage. <em>Formicove, Inc. v. Burlington Northern, Inc. </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 189, 194, 673 P.2d 469, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>471 (citation omitted). For these reasons, it is my view that the Court\u2019s implicit substitution of \u201can expression of public policy\u201d for the statutory language \u201cestablished for a public reason\u201d is both inappropriate and unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b625 My disagreement with the result the Court reaches in this case does not mean that no supportable arguments can be made for that result. My disagreement is that the Court has not supported its result with any legal analysis or authority. Absent such support, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
