Defendant Ranch Recovery, LLC, is the assignee of the vendor\u2019s interest in the subject property. H&amp;L Properties is the vendee. The District Court granted First Security\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ranch Recovery appeals from the District Court\u2019s \u201corder on sale on decree of foreclosure,\u201d from the final judgment, from the denial of its motion for relief from judgment based upon newly discovered evidence, and from denial of its motion to amend its counterclaim. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b62 There are three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied Ranch Recovery\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Ranch Recovery\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaim?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it concluded that First Security Bank was entitled to summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">\u00b66 This case arises from the transfer of a business and real property located in Sanders County, known as Quinn\u2019s Natural Hot Springs Resort. In December 1988, the resort was sold by its owners to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>couples: John and Johnea Leinan, and Michelle and John Hayder, Jr. The conveyance was accomplished through several different agreements, and only those relevant to this appeal will be described here.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">\u00b67 The real property on which the resort is situated was conveyed by contract for deed from the original owners to H&amp;L Properties, a partnership entity created by the Leinans and the Hayders. The two couples also formed a corporation, which operated the resort and which received the proceeds of a loan guaranteed by H&amp;L\u2019s real property. Because the distinctions between these entities and their principals are unimportant to our decision, this opinion will not distinguish between the entities and will refer to the two couples, the partnership, and the corporation, only as \u201cH&amp;L.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b68 H&amp;L financed the purchase of the resort, including the initial $450,000 payment on the contract for deed, through a business loan from First Security. This loan was eighty-five percent guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and secured by, among other things, a mortgage of H&amp;L\u2019s interest in the real property. The existence of the bank\u2019s security interest in the real property and the relationship of its security interest to the underlying contract for deed were reflected in the real property agreement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">The parties shall further understand and agree that in the event of BUYER\u2019S default under the First Security Loan, SELLER herein shall be secondarily responsible for such defaults and responsible for that First Security Loan; and First Security Bank shall have the right to foreclose on its loan directly against SELLER herein, as well as BUYER\u2019S interest as purchasers under this contract, and to assert against SELLER any rights the bank could assert against BUYER in that foreclosure proceeding or any proceeding to enforce this loan agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b69 Before the SBA would guarantee the loan, it required First Security, H&amp;L, and the original vendors to enter into a \u201cstandby agreement,\u201d which set forth limitations on the vendors\u2019 right to receive payments or retake title to the property, and pursuant to which the vendors\u2019 interest in the contract for deed would be essentially subordinated to the bank\u2019s security interest. The standby agreement was incorporated by reference into the contract for deed and stated that, pursuant to SBA authorization requirements, in the event of H&amp;L\u2019s default or a determination by the bank that H&amp;L was a substantial financial risk, the vendors could not accept any payments on the contract for deed, nor take any action to enforce their claims, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>out the written consent of the bank. The standby agreement also required that any property received by the sellers following a default be delivered to First Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b6 10 In March 1996, the vendors assigned their remaining interest in the contract for deed to Ranch Recovery. H&amp;L subsequently defaulted on the bank loan, and First Security instituted foreclosure proceedings. The District Court awarded summary judgment in favor of the bank, whereupon Ranch Recovery moved for reconsideration and for permission to amend its counterclaim based upon \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d which had come to light during the summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b6 11 The newly discovered evidence consisted of SBA authorization documents which Ranch Recovery alleged were incorporated by reference into the standby agreement and, thus, into the contract for deed, as well as privileged information from H&amp;L\u2019s bank accounts, which it had been unable to obtain prior to the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b6 12 The SBA documents set forth the terms pursuant to which First Security was required to distribute the loan proceeds. Ranch Recovery\u2019s proposed amended counterclaim alleged that First Security did not comply with the terms of the authorization, as evidenced by certain overdrafts and deposits to the vendee\u2019s accounts, and thereby committed a breach of the standby agreement and a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Because of factual issues raised by these claims, Ranch Recovery contends that summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b613 In March 1998, the District Court denied Ranch Recovery\u2019s motions and entered final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.R This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u00b6 14 Did the District Court err when it denied Ranch Recovery\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\u00b615 We review a District Court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>See Fjelstad v. State </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 211, 220, 883 P.2d 106, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\u00b616 Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.R, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">On such motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (2) newly discovered evidence which by due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b617 Moreover, factors which must be considered by the district court include whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">1. The alleged \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence came to a party\u2019s knowledge after the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">2. It was not a want of diligence which precluded its earlier discovery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">3. The materiality of the evidence is so great it would probably produce a different result on retrial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">4. The alleged \u201cnew evidence\u201d is not merely cumulative, and not tending to impeach or discredit witnesses in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\"><em>Fjelstad, </em>267 Mont. at 220-21, 883 P.2d at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\u00b618 The District Court concluded that, had Ranch Recovery exercised due diligence, it could have discovered the evidence on which it based its Rule 60(b) motion prior to the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b619 The bank points out that Ranch Recovery could have obtained the newly discovered evidence prior to entry of summary judgment through the discovery process, and argues that the failure to do so constitutes a lack of due diligence for which its motion must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">\u00b620 Ranch Recovery\u2019s manager stated by affidavit that he attempted, but was unable, to informally obtain the privileged loan documents and bank account information from H&amp;L prior to the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">\u00b621  Here, judgment was the result of a summary proceeding, and not the result of a trial on the merits. Upon review, in fact, the record indicates that First Security\u2019s motion for summary judgment was filed before Ranch Recovery had even filed its answer and counterclaim. We can find no indication from the record that any formal discovery was conducted. Because <em>summary judgment </em>was entered before Ranch Recovery had an opportunity to conduct any meaningful discovery, it would be unjust to characterize the failure to discover this particular evidence as a failure to exercise due diligence for the discovery and presentation of the evidence at <em>trial. </em>Therefore, we hold that based on the circumstances of this case, Ranch Recovery met its burden of establishing that the newly discovered evidence was not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d for lack of diligence. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to consider Ranch Recovery\u2019s evidence in support of its Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">\u00b622 The Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion interpreting Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>which is identical to the Montana rule, in a case in which a party sought relief from a default judgment. The court held that \u201cwhere timely relief is sought... and the movant has a meritorious defense, doubt, if any, should be resolved in favor of the motion so that cases may be decided on their merits.\u201d <em>See Gregorian v. Izvestia </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 871 F.2d 1515, 1526. Unlike a default judgment, summary judgment proceedings normally involve the resolution of cases on their merits; however, the principle from <em>Gregorian </em>is still applicable to the instant case, particularly in light of the fact that summary judgment was entered very early in the development of the facts and issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err when it denied Ranch Recovery\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaim?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b624 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s motion to amend the pleadings pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Peuse v. Malkuch </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 221, 226-27, 911 P.2d 1153, 1156. Rule 15(a), M.R.Civ.P, provides in pertinent part that \u201ca party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and <em>leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b625 In this case, Ranch Recovery moved for leave to amend its counterclaim after the entry of summary judgment and after obtaining newly discovered evidence. Ranch Recovery contends that justice requires amendment of the pleadings to address the new counterclaims, while First Security contends that it would be unfairly prejudiced if Ranch Recovery is allowed to amend the pleadings after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b626 While favored, amendment can be inappropriate when the party opposing the amendment would incur substantial prejudice as a result of the amendment. <em>See Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1156. In Peuse, the defendants sought leave to amend their answer after a motion for summary judgment was made and more than two years after the original pleadings were filed, to reflect claims of which they had knowledge much earlier. The analysis of whether justice requires leave to amend is essentially an equitable one, and the defendants in <em>Peuse </em>fell victim to the following maxim: <em>Vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit, </em>or \u201cequity aids the vigilant, not those who sleep on their rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b627  In this case, Ranch Recovery sought leave to amend its counterclaim as soon as newly discovered evidence came to light. We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>elude that the interests of justice and judicial efficiency favor the amendment of Ranch Recovery\u2019s pleadings so that all claims arising from the same transaction may be resolved in the same action. This policy, which underlies the rules of civil procedure, outweighs any prejudice to the bank. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to allow Ranch Recovery to amend its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">\u00b628 First Security also contends that Ranch Recovery is not the real party in interest and, therefore, that it should not be entitled to assert its proposed counterclaims. The bank argues that Ranch Recovery\u2019s proposed counterclaims sought to allege causes of action which could only be brought by the original vendors who were parties to the standby agreement. Therefore, it argues, Ranch Recovery did not have a right to prosecute its proposed counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b629 In support of its contention, First Security cites <em>Hollingsworth v. Satterwhite </em>(Colo. App. 1986), 723 P.2d 169, for the proposition that \u201ca real party in interest is a party who, by the substantive law, has the right sought to be enforced.\u201d <em>See Hollingsworth, </em>723 P.2d at 170. However, this proposition would appear to support the conclusion that Ranch Recovery is the proper party to plead the proposed counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b630  Rule 17, M.R.Civ.R, requires the prosecution of actions in the name of the real party in interest. It provides that \u201ca party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another, or ... [who is] authorized by statute may sue in that person\u2019s own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b631 Ranch Recovery\u2019s proposed counterclaims were for breach of the standby agreement, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and constructive fraud by the bank related to the loan. Ranch Recovery is the assignee of the vendors\u2019 interest in the contract for deed and, thus, the assignee of a signatory to all of the sale agreements, including the standby agreement and the loan authorization documents incorporated by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b632 This Court has previously held that \u201cevery contract, regardless of type, contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A breach of the covenant is a breach of contract.\u201d <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 436, 450, 791 P.2d 767, 775. If Ranch Recovery, as the assignee of the vendors\u2019 interest in the contract for deed, is, as First Security alleges, the proper party against which the bank may enforce the provisions of the standby agreement, then it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>must necessarily be the real party in interest for the purpose of asserting defenses and counterclaims based upon the same contract. As the successor to the vendors\u2019 interest in the agreement, Ranch Recovery assumed not just the vendors\u2019 obligations, but also inherited the vendors\u2019 rights. It is therefore the real party in interest for the purpose of asserting those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b633 Finally, First Security contends Ranch Recovery was properly denied leave to amend because its counterclaims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitation. The bank characterized the claims as \u201cbad faith, fraud, and unconscionable circumstances\u201d and as \u201cclaims... founded neither \u2018upon an instrument in writing\u2019 nor upon \u2018a contract, account, or promise.\u2019 \u201d It therefore argues that the applicable limitation periods are those for tort and fraud claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"A9E\">\u00b634 Section 27-2-202(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he period prescribed for the commencement of an action upon any contract, obligation, or liability founded upon an instrument in writing is within 8 years.\u201d Ranch Recovery\u2019s claims are based upon the underlying contract for deed and the standby agreement, both of which are written contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b635  More importantly, because Ranch Recovery\u2019s claims are counterclaims arising from the same written contract from which First Security asserts its right to foreclose and to priority, Ranch Recovery is entitled to assert those claims notwithstanding any applicable limitation periods. Section 27-2-408(1), MCA, provides that the period of limitation is extended, and \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to assert against a plaintiff, by pleading or amendment, any counterclaim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against him.\u201d Because Ranch Recovery\u2019s counterclaims arise out of the same transaction as First Security\u2019s foreclosure action, we conclude that the District Court erred when it found that the counterclaims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitation. We furthermore conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Ranch Recovery\u2019s motion to amend its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b636 Did the District Court err when it concluded that First Security Bank was entitled to summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u00b637 The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of First Security pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R, based upon the court\u2019s conclusion that no genuine issue of material fact existed and the bank was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u00b638 We review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Motaire v. Northern Montana Joint Refuse Disposal Dist. </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156; <em>Mead v. M.S.B., Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 465, 470, 872 P2d 782, 785. When we review a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, we apply the same analysis as the district court based upon Rule 56:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of material fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b639 The newly discovered evidence which Ranch Recovery has offered, and should have been allowed to present in support of an amended counterclaim, raises genuine issues of fact regarding First Security\u2019s compliance with the standby agreement upon which it relies for foreclosure against Ranch Recovery\u2019s interest and, therefore, we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b640 Ranch Recovery raises two additional arguments on appeal. It contends that a mortgagee of a vendee\u2019s interest in a contract for deed cannot obtain a lien superior to the vendor\u2019s interest, absent an assignment or mortgage of the vendor\u2019s interest, and that the purported subordination language of the agreement violates \u00a7 28-2-708, MCA. Because we reverse the judgment of the District Court on other grounds, resolution of those issues is unnecessary to our decision and we decline to address the arguments at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b641 Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"APM\">JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
