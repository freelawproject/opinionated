(K-Decorators) on Delaware\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. K-Decorators cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees to Delaware, from the court\u2019s order denying Lee Judson\u2019s (Judson) motion to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claims against him, and from the court\u2019s order imposing discovery sanctions on K-Decorators.

Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees and costs to Delaware?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">\u00b68 5. Did the District Court err in refusing to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claims against Judson, individually?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">\u00b69 6. Did the District Court err in imposing discovery sanctions on K-Decorators?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b610 K-Decorators hired Delaware in the mid-1980s to sell home improvement construction projects. After Delaware worked for the company for approximately one year, K-Decorators fired him. Judson, K-Decorators\u2019 president, rehired Delaware in the fall of 1990 to manage the company\u2019s sales staff. Delaware began working for K-Decorators for the second time on September 30, 1990. Delaware sold for K-Decorators and was responsible for generating and training a sales staff. K-Decorators paid Delaware commissions based on his sales and on the sales which his sales staff made. Delaware was entitled to his commission when K-Decorators completed a project and received payment for its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b6 11 Delaware worked full-time as K-Decorators\u2019 sales manager for approximately three years. Judson testified that K-Decorators\u2019 sales volume \u201csubstantially increased\u201d during Delaware\u2019s tenure as sales manager. Similarly, Delaware estimated that he increased K-Decorators\u2019 sales volume by 80 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b612 On September 20, 1993, Judson removed Delaware from the sales manager position but offered to keep Delaware on as a salesman. Judson wrote Delaware a letter the following day which explained that Judson was reorganizing K-Decorators to \u201cimprove [the] bottom line results for the company.\u201d Judson\u2019s letter also explained that the sales manager position and the general manager position were being consolidated and that Judson\u2019s brother A1 was going to take over the new position. The letter also reiterated Judson\u2019s offer to keep Delaware on as a salesman. Delaware declined Judson\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"AdH\">\u00b613 On September 7, 1994, Delaware filed a complaint which included claims against Judson individually. Count I of Delaware\u2019s Complaint alleged that he had been discharged in violation of Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act. Count II of Delaware\u2019s Complaint alleged that K-Decorators owed him $146,271.99 for unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b614 On September 30,1994, K-Decorators filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.R K-Decorators, however, did not file a supporting brief with this motion. Consequently, the District Court denied this motion to dismiss on October 18,1994, pursuant to Rule 2(b), Unif.Dist.Ct.R., which provides that a motion is to be deemed without merit if the moving party does not file a supporting brief within five days after filing the motion. On October 28, 1994, K-Decorators filed a second motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., and a supporting brief, which asserted that Judson was not a proper defendant since corporate officers cannot be held individually liable for acts taken on behalf of a corporation in furtherance of corporate goals, policies and business interests. The District Court denied this motion reasoning that Judson conceded that a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted on his behalf was without merit when he failed to file a supporting brief within five days after the first motion for failure to state a claim was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b615 On November 16, 1994, Delaware filed a Motion to Compel Discovery. In his supporting brief, Delaware stated that K-Decorators had not answered his first set of interrogatories, requested the court to compel K-Decorators to answer the interrogatories, and requested the court to award him his attorney fees and costs for filing the motion. In response, K-Decorators filed a brief on November 23, 1994, wherein it argued that Delaware\u2019s interrogatories violated Rule 33(a), M.R.Civ.P, and thus requested the District Court to deny Delaware\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b616 On December 13, 1994, the District Court issued an Order which granted Delaware\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery and ordered K-Decorators to answer Delaware\u2019s first set of interrogatories within fifteen days. One month later, on January 13,1995, Delaware filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., and a supporting brief wherein he requested the District Court to grant default judgment against K-Decorators because it did not comply with the District Court\u2019s order to answer his first set of interrogatories within fifteen days. In the alternative, Delaware requested the District Court to pierce the corporate veil so that all named defendants would be liable. Delaware also requested his attorney fees and costs for filing his motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b617 The District Court held a hearing on Delaware\u2019s motion for sanctions on March 1, 1995. Since K-Decorators\u2019 attorney acknowledged that Delaware\u2019s interrogatories were not answered within fifteen days of the court\u2019s order dated December 13, 1995, the District Court sanctioned K-Decorators by awarding Delaware his attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b618 On May 3,1995, K-Decorators filed an offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68, M.R.Civ.P, for $32,500. Delaware rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b6 19 Delaware filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., on January 31,1996. Delaware argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether K-Decorators owed Delaware unpaid wages nor whether K-Decorators discharged Delaware. On February 6,1996, K-Decorators filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. K-Decorators asserted that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Delaware was constructively discharged nor whether K-Decorators had a legitimate business reason to restructure upper management and eliminate Delaware\u2019s sales manager position.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b620 The District Court issued an Order on February 27, 1996, wherein it denied Delaware\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and granted K-Decorators\u2019 Motion For Partial Summary Judgment. The court ruled that no issue of material fact existed as to whether K-Decorators had a legitimate business reason for discharging Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b621 A jury trial was held April 1 through 4, 1996, on Delaware\u2019s claim for unpaid wages. At trial, both parties had accountants testify as expert witnesses as to the amount of commissions which K-Decorators owed Delaware based on the company\u2019s books. K-Decorators introduced testimony and evidence that it made payments on behalf of Delaware which Delaware did not pay back and that Judson paid Delaware commission out of his personal checking accounts which were not recorded in K-Decorators\u2019 books. K-Decorators argued that these amounts should be subtracted from the amount of commissions that K-Decorators\u2019 books showed that the company owed Delaware. The jury returned a verdict for Delaware in the amount of $1,185.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b622 On August 5, 1996, Delaware filed a Motion for a New Trial pursuant to Rule 59, M.R.Civ.P, and \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA. In his supporting brief, Delaware argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. On September 30, 1996, the District Court denied Delaware\u2019s Motion for New Trial. The court pointed out that Delaware, in his supporting brief, showed how the jury could have reached its verdict based on the testimony and evidence admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b623 On April 9, 1996, K-Decorators filed a Memorandum of Costs pursuant to \u00a7 25-10- 201, MCA, and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA. Delaware filed his Memorandum of Costs pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, and attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA, on April 19, 1996. The District Court held a hearing on these motions on October 30, 1996. K-Decorators and Delaware each presented evidence and testimony as to reasonable attorney fees and costs. On De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>cember 26, 1996, the District Court issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order wherein it ruled that Delaware\u2019s Memorandum of Costs was timely filed, ordered that Delaware\u2019s costs be taxed at $165, ordered that K-Decorators\u2019 costs be taxed at $314.50, awarded Delaware attorney fees in the amount of $10,000, and deified K-Decorators\u2019 request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b624 Delaware appeals from the District Court\u2019s ruling on the penalty provision of the Montana Wage Protection Act, from the court\u2019s order denying his motion for a new trial, and from the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to K-Decorators on Delaware\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. K-Decorators cross-appeals from the court\u2019s order which awarded attorney fees to Delaware, from the court\u2019s order denying K-Decorators\u2019 motion to dismiss Judson, and from the court\u2019s order imposing discovery sanctions on K-Decorators.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b625 <em>Did the District Court err in ruling that Delaware could only recover a penalty pursuant to Montana\u2019s Wage Protection Act for wages which K-Decorators owed Delaware on his last day of employment which K-Decorators did not pay within three days thereafter?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b626 At the beginning of the trial on Delaware\u2019s unpaid wage claim, the District Court ruled that, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-3-205(1) and 39-3-206(1), MCA, Delaware could recover a penalty for wages which K-Decorators owed Delaware on his last day of employment but not paid within three days thereafter. K-Decorators argues that the District Court erred in ruling that Delaware could recover a penalty pursuant to the Wage Protection Act because it does not protect employees who are paid on a commission basis. Delaware asserts that the District Court erred in ruling that he could not recover a penalty on wages which became due after his last day of employment at K-Decorators.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b627 This Court\u2019s standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u00b628 <em>Did the District Court err in ruling that the Montana Wage Pror tection Act\u2019s penalty provision applied in the instant case?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00b629 K-Decorators argues that the District Court erred in ruling that Delaware could recover a penalty because the Wage Protection Act does not apply since K-Decorators and Delaware mutually agreed that Delaware would be paid on a commission basis. In effect, K-Decorators argues that the Wage Protection Act does not protect employees who are paid on a commission basis. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b630 This Court\u2019s function in construing and applying statutes is to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. To determine legislative intent, we first look to the plain meaning of the words used in the statute. If the legislature\u2019s intent can be determined by the plain language of the words used, we may not go further and apply other means of interpretation. It is only when the intent cannot be determined from the language of the statute that we will examine legislative history. <em>Skinner Enterprises v. Board of Health </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 256, 274, 950 P.2d 733, 744 (quoting <em>Thomas Brothers v. Cargill, Inc. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 105, 110, 915 P.2d 226, 229).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b631 In support of its argument that the Wage Protection Act does not protect employees who are paid on a commission basis, K-Decorators relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>McBride v. School Dist. No. 2 </em>(1930), 88 Mont. 110, 290 P. 252. In that case, this Court looked to the legislative intent underlying the Wage Protection Act and stated that Montana\u2019s statute governing wage payments and the statute mandating a penalty for failing to comply with the statute governing wage payments \u201cwere intended only to apply to the semi-monthly payment of wages due from all \u2018employers of labor....\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 McBride, </em>88 Mont. at 117, 290 P. at 255 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 3084 and 3085, RCM (1921)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b632 Notwithstanding this Court\u2019s statement in <em>McBride, </em>we reject K-Decorators\u2019 argument because the plain language of the Wage Protection Act, which has been substantially amended since <em>McBride </em>was decided, shows that its broad scope covers employees who are paid on a commission basis. Section 39-3-201(7), MCA, defines \u201cwages\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\"><em>any money due an employee from the employer or employers, </em>whether to be paid by the hour, day, week, semimonthly, monthly, or yearly and shall include bonus, piecework, tips, and gratuities of any kind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">(Emphasis added.) Since \u201cwages\u201d are \u201cany money due an employee from an employer,\u201d earned commissions fall within the Wage Protection Act\u2019s definition of \u201cwages.\u201d Thus, the Wage Protection Act is sufficiently broad to protect employees who are paid on a commission ba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sis. As a result, an employer who fails to pay an employee his or her earned commissions in accordance with the Wage Protection Act is subject to \u00a7 39-3-206(1), MCA, which provides that an employer who fails to pay an employee as provided by the Wage Protection Act must be assessed a penalty based on the amount of wages which are due and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b633 The policy underlying the Wage Protection Act also supports our conclusion that it protects employees who are paid on a commission basis. In <em>Como v. Rhines </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 279, 285-86, 645 P.2d 948, 951-52, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">The policy of the [Wage Protection Act] is to aid an employee in the prompt collection of <em>compensation </em>due him and to discourage an employer from using a position of economic superiority as a lever to dissuade an employee from promptly collecting his agreed upon <em>compensation....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">(emphasis added) (quoting <em>State ex rel. Nilsen v. Oregon State Motor Assoc. </em>(1967), 248 Or. 133, 432 P.2d 512, 515). Because commissions are one form of compensation, it is clear that this underlying policy supports our holding that the Wage Protection Act protects employees who are paid on a commission basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b634  In sum, the Wage Protection Act\u2019s plain language and its underlying policy show that it protects employees who are paid on a commission basis. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling that the Wage Protection Act applied in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b635 <em>Did the District Court err in ruling that the Wage Protection Act only allowed Delaware to recover a penalty on commissions which K-Decorators owed Delaware on his last day of employment and not paid within three days thereafter?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u00b636 Delaware argues that the District Court erred in ruling that he could only recover a penalty for wages which K-Decorators owed Delaware on his last day of employment which K-Decorators did not pay within three days. Delaware relies on our decision in <em>Craver v. Waste Mgt. Partners of Bozeman </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 37, 874 P.2d 1, and argues that he was entitled to recover a penalty for wages which became due during the eighteen-month period after his last day of employment with K-Decorators. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">\u00b637 Section 39-3-206(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">An employer who fails to pay an employee as provided in this part or who violates any other provision of this part is guilty of a misde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>meanor. A penalty must also be assessed against and paid by the employer to the employee in an amount not to exceed 110% of the wages due and unpaid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ang\">Section 39-3-207, MCA, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">Any employee may recover all such penalties as are provided for the violation of 39-3-206 which have accrued to him at any time within 18 months succeeding such default or delay in the payment of such wages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In <em>Craver, </em>we stated that \u00a7 39-3-207, MCA, is an eighteen-month statute of limitations. It is \u201cthe period of time in which an employee has to file a penalty claim against the employer.\u201d <em>Craver, </em>265 Mont. at 45, 874 P.2d at 5 (citing Pope v. <em>Keefer </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 454, 591 P.2d 206, 213).</p>\n<p id=\"AQn\">\u00b638 In the instant case, Delaware apparently contends that K-Decorators violated \u00a7 39-3-205(1), MCA (1993), which provided that \u201cwhen an employee is separated from the employ of any employer, all the unpaid wages of the employee are due and payable within 3 days ...\u201d In <em>Craver, </em>we explained that, since \u00a7 39-3-205(1), MCA, requires an employer to pay a terminated employee\u2019s unpaid wages within three days of termination, \u00a7 39-3-207, MCA, requires a terminated employee to file a penalty claim within eighteen months after the third day following his or her termination. <em>Craver, </em>265 Mont. at 45, 874 P.2d at 5. Delaware argues that we held in <em>Craver </em>that wages which have accrued during the eighteen-month period after an employee is terminated are subject to the mandatory penalty in \u00a7 39-3-206(1), MCA. In <em>Craver, </em>however, we held that an employee has eighteen months after a <em>claim </em>accrues to file a penalty claim against an employer. <em>Craver, </em>265 Mont. at 45, 874 P2d at 5. We were not faced with, and thus did not address, the issue of whether an employee may recover a penalty on <em>wages </em>which accrue after the employee is separated from the employ of an employer. Consequently, Delaware\u2019s reliance on <em>Craver </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b639  Here, since Delaware was entitled to his commissions when K-Decorators completed a project and received payment for its work, some of Delaware\u2019s commissions became due after his last day of employment with K-Decorators. Section 39-3-205(1), MCA, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>only provides a rule regarding the payment of wages which are due to an employee on his or her last day of employment. It does not provide a rule regarding wages which become due after the employee\u2019s last day of employment. Thus, as the District Court correctly reasoned, since \u00a7 39-3-201(7), MCA, states that \u201cwages\u201d are \u201cany money due an employee,\u201d K-Decorators could only be penalized for violating \u00a7 39-3-205(1), MCA, for commissions which were due to Delaware on his last day of employment at K-Decorators which were not paid within three days thereafter. K-Decorators could not be penalized pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-3-205(1) and 39-3-206(1), MCA, for commissions which became due after Delaware separated from the employ of K-Decorators.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b640 Accordingly, we affirm the District Courtfs conclusion that Delaware could only recover a penalty pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-3-205(1) and 39-3-206(1), MCA, for commissions which K-Decorators owed Delaware on his last day of employment and did not pay within three days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b641 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Delaware\u2019s Motion for a New </em>Trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b642 After the jury returned its verdict, Delaware filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59, M.R.Civ.R, and \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict for $1,185.14. The District Court denied this motion reasoning that Delaware showed in his motion how the jury could have reached its verdict based on the testimony and evidence introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AKO\">\u00b643 A district court may grant a motion for a new trial if there is insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. Section 25-11-102(6), MCA. The decision to grant or deny a new trial is in the sound discretion of the district court judge and will not be overturned unless there is a showing that the judge manifestly abused that discretion. <em>McGillen v. Plum Creek Timber Co., </em>1998 MT 193, \u00b6 15, 290 Mont. 264, \u00b6 15, 964 P.2d 18, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Geiger v.

If there is conflicting evidence on an issue, it is an abuse of a district court\u2019s discretion to grant a new trial on that issue on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Thompson v.

Delaware asserts that the District Court \u201cmisse[d] the point\u201d of his argument because he showed that the jury improperly calculated its verdict based on the testimony and evidence introduced at trial. In support of his argument that the jury improperly calculated its verdict, Delaware points out that K-Decorators\u2019 expert testified that the company owed Delaware more than the amount that the jury awarded, K-Decorators\u2019 attorney stated in his opening statement and in his closing argument that K-Decorators owed Delaware more than what the jury awarded Delaware, and that the District Court stated, after listening to K-Decorators\u2019 opening statement, that the jury \u201cwill have to bring in a verdict of at least 7,000 some odd dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b646 In support of his argument, Delaware cites this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tappan v. Higgins </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 158, 783 P.2d 396. In <em>Tappan, </em>the jury awarded plaintiff damages for past wage loss in an amount less than the amount that the defendant\u2019s expert testified that the plaintiff lost. In addition, the jury did not award the plaintiff damages for future wage loss even though the evidence introduced at trial clearly supported such an award and that the jury\u2019s verdict for medical expenses was unsubstantiated by the evidence. In <em>Tappan, </em>we stated that \u201conly in rare cases should a jury verdict be set aside and a new trial granted.\u201d <em>Tappan, </em>240 Mont. at 160, 783 P.2d at 397. We also stated that while the amount of damages awarded is within the province of the jury, it is not given carte blanche. <em>Tappan, </em>240 Mont. at 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>783 P.2d at 397 <em>(citing Sanders v. Mount Haggin Livestock Co. </em>(1972), 160 Mont. 73, 89, 500 P.2d 397, 406). Because there were \u201csome glaring discrepancies\u201d between the evidence introduced at trial and the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirmed the grant of a motion for a new trial on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Tappan, </em>240 Mont. at 164, 783 P.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b647 Delaware contends that the case at bar is identical to the situation in <em>Tappan </em>because K-Decorators introduced evidence and testimony which showed that it owed Delaware more than the amount that the jury awarded Delaware. Delaware points out that K-Decorators\u2019 expert witness testified that K-Decorators owed Delaware $68,112.58 for unpaid wages and that Judson\u2019s testimony established that K-Decorators owed Delaware an additional $1,000 for an unpaid bonus. Delaware then explains that K-Decorators introduced evidence and testimony that K-Decorators paid $27,079.42 on behalf of Delaware which he did not pay back and that it paid Delaware $34,190 in commissions which were not recorded in K-Decorators\u2019 books. Thus, Delaware argues that, if the jury believed the entirety of K-Decorators\u2019 presentation of testimony and evidence, its verdict should have been at least $8,133.16. Delaware supports this conclusion by pointing out that K-Decorators\u2019 trial attorney argued to the jury in his closing argument to return a verdict for Delaware in the amount of $8,133.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b648 Notwithstanding Delaware\u2019s argument, the case at bar is unlike <em>Tappan. </em>In <em>Tappan, </em>our rationale for affirming the district court\u2019s decision that the verdict was not supported by the evidence was that the testimony and evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that Tappan was entitled to damages in excess of the jury\u2019s verdict. In the case at bar, however, the record shows that conflicting testimony and evidence was admitted as to the amount of unpaid wages that K-Decorators owed Delaware. Even though K-Decorators\u2019 expert witness testified that K-Decorators\u2019 books showed that it owed Delaware $68,112.58 in unpaid wages, Delaware\u2019s expert witness, Jerry Hansen (Hansen), testified that K-Decorators\u2019 books showed that it owed Delaware only $61,454.56 for unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b649 Delaware, however, contends that the jury improperly calculated its verdict by improperly \u201cmixing\u201d the evidence and testimony introduced at trial. Delaware states that the jury improperly calculated its verdict by crediting K-Decorators twice for money that it spent on a Lincoln Continental that Delaware drove while he worked for K-Decorators. Delaware explains that the jury reached its verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>by adding the amount of wages that Hansen testified that K-Decorators owed Delaware to the value of a bonus that K-Decorators owed Delaware and then subtracting payments made by K-Decorators on behalf of Delaware which he did not pay back and also subtracting commissions paid to Delaware which were not recorded in K-Decorators\u2019 books. Delaware contends that Hansen testified that he subtracted the payments that K-Decorators made for the Lincoln Continental in his calculation of the wages that K-Decorators owed Delaware. As a result, Delaware argues that the jury subtracted the payments made by K-Decorators for the car a second time when it computed the amount that K-Decorators owed Delaware. Delaware therefore concludes that the jury\u2019s verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b650 Resolving conflicts in the evidence, judging the credibility of the witnesses, and finding the facts, however, are acts uniquely within the province of the jury. <em>Moore v. Imperial Hotels, Corp., </em>1998 MT 248, \u00b6 18, 291 Mont. 164, \u00b6 18, 967 P.2d 3832, \u00b6 18, <em>(citing Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b6 27, 288 Mont. 1, \u00b6 27, 955 P.2d 160, \u00b6 27). Here, even though the record shows that Hansen testified on cross-examination that he subtracted out payments made on behalf of Delaware on the Lincoln Continental when he computed the amount that K-Decorators owed Delaware, the record also shows that Hansen testified that, rather than subtracting out payments made on behalf of Delaware on the car, he \u201crefunded\u201d $6,792.57 to Delaware for money that Delaware paid on the car because Delaware argued that he should only be responsible for twenty percent of the payments made on the car because he used the car eighty percent of the time for business purposes. Since Hansen\u2019s testimony is apparently contradictory, it was within the province of the jury to judge his credibility and resolve the conflicts in his testimony. Moreover, it was within the province of the jury to consider the entirety of the testimony and evidence in determining the amount that K-Decorators owed Delaware; it was not bound to accept one party\u2019s presentation of testimony and evidence to the exclusion of the other party\u2019s presentation. Thus, we conclude that the jury did not improperly \u201cmix\u201d the evidence and therefore that the record shows substantial evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b651 Delawarealso argues that the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence because K-Decorators\u2019 attorney argued to the jury that K-Decorators owed Delaware more than the amount that the jury awarded. Statements of counsel, however, are not evidence. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>State v. Ahto, </em>1998 MT 200, \u00b6 35, 290 Mont. 338, \u00b6 35, 965 P.2d 240, \u00b6 35. The record shows that K-Decorators argued to the jury to accept its expert\u2019s opinion concerning the amount that K-Decorators owed Delaware. The jury, however, was not bound by K-Decorators\u2019 expert\u2019s opinion. <em>Estate of Spicher v. Miller </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 504, 508, 861 P.2d 183, 186. Thus, the verdict cannot be said to be unsupported by the evidence only because K-Decorators\u2019 attorney argued to the jury to accept its expert\u2019s opinion and award Delaware more than the amount that the jury eventually awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b652 In sum, having thoroughly reviewed the record of the trial, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. The question is not what this Court would have awarded. Rather, our review is limited to whether substantial evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Delaware\u2019s Motion for a New Trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b653 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to K-Decorators on Delaware\u2019s wrongful discharge claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b654 The District Court granted K-Decorators summary judgment on Delaware\u2019s wrongful discharge claim ruling that K-Decorators had good cause to discharge Delaware because restructuring the company\u2019s management was a legitimate business reason. The District Court also ruled that K-Decorators\u2019 decision to restructure its management was neither false nor a pretext to discharge Delaware. Delaware contends that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to K-Decorators because the record shows conflicting evidence as to whether K-Decorators proffered reason for discharging Delaware was false or pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u00b655 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo.

In <em>Buck, </em>the new owner of a car dealership terminated the plaintiff\u2019s general manager position and replaced him with a person whom the new owner had employed for a long period of time. The new owner explained that the plaintiff was discharged pursuant to a company policy which placed its long-term employees in charge of newly acquired dealerships. Instead of offering evidence to dispute the new owner\u2019s explanation, the plaintiff argued that the employer\u2019s explanation was not adequate under the Act. This Court, however, affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the employer and held that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was a legitimate business reason. <em>Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 283, 811 P.2d at 541. We stated that, under the facts before us, to conclude otherwise would \u201cforce the new owner of a business to retain someone it did not know or perhaps even trust to manage a large dollar investment.\u201d <em>Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 282-83, 811 P.2d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b660  Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Buck, </em>however, Delaware does not argue that restructuring or reorganizing a business is not a legitimate business reason. Rather, he argues that the affidavits that he filed with his brief opposing K-Decorators\u2019 motion for summary judgment could lead a fact-finder to conclude that K-Decorators\u2019 proffered reason is false or pretextual. After reviewing the record, we agree with Delaware that these affidavits raise a material issue of fact as to whether K-Decorators\u2019 proffered reason was false or pretextual. The record shows that Judson testified that he removed Delaware from the sales manager position as part of a plan to reorganize and restruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ture K-Decorators. Similarly, A1 Judson testified that he moved back to Billings to run K-Decorators as its general manager and to reorganize and restructure the \u201cwhole program\u201d to make the company more efficient, cost effective, and profitable. Delaware, however, filed three affidavits with his brief opposing K-Decorators\u2019 motion for summary judgment from salesmen who continued working for K-Decorators after Delaware was removed as sales manager wherein each affiant stated that he saw few, if any, changes in the sales department after A1 Judson replaced Delaware as sales manager. This testimony contradicts A1 Judson\u2019s testimony that he assumed K-Decorators\u2019 general manager position to restructure the \u201cwhole program\u201d and Judson\u2019s testimony that he eliminated Delaware\u2019s sales manager position as part of a plan to restructure and reorganize K-Decorators. These affidavits are neither mere denial nor speculation; they are direct evidence that K-Decorators did not restructure or reorganize. Therefore, these affidavits are sufficient to raise a factual issue as to whether K-Decorators discharged Delaware as part of a bona fide managerial reorganization or whether K-Decorators\u2019 proffered reason is false or pretextual. Consequently, we hold that the District Court erred by granting K-Decorators summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b661 Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to K- Decorators on Delaware\u2019s wrongful discharge claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b662 <em>Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees and costs to Delaware?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b663 After the trial on Delaware\u2019s claim for unpaid wages, both parties filed memoranda of costs which included requests for attorney fees. Thereafter, the District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the parties\u2019 requests for costs and attorney fees. Subsequently, the District Court ruled that Delaware timely filed his memorandum of costs, taxed Delaware\u2019s costs at $165, awarded him attorney fees in the amount of $10,000, and denied K-Decorators\u2019 request for attorney fees. K-Decorators argues that the District Court erred in granting attorney fees to Delaware and in denying its request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">\u00b664 Because these issues concern questions of law, our review is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon </em>County, 271 Mont. at 469, 898 P.2d at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b665 <em>Did the District Court err in ruling that Delaware timely filed his memorandum of costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b666 K-Decorators argues that Delaware is not entitled to his attorney fees or costs because he did not timely file his memorandum of costs.

Hence, pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, Delaware was required to file his memorandum of costs on or before April 11, 1996. <em>See </em>Rule 6(a), M.R.Civ.P, Delaware, however, did not file his memorandum of costs until April 19,1996. Because Delaware did not timely file his memorandum of costs, he waived his right to receive his costs which, under \u00a7 39-3-214, MCA, include attorney fees. <em>See Cenex, </em>283 Mont. at 338, 941 P.2d at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"AH6\">\u00b672  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in ruling that Delaware timely filed his bill of costs and thus in awarding Delaware his costs and attorney fees. Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b673 <em>Did the District Court err in denying K-Decorators\u2019 request for attorney </em>fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u00b674 K-Decorators argues that the District Court erred in granting attorney fees to Delaware because Delaware was not the successful party because the jury\u2019s verdict did not exceed the amount of K-Decorators\u2019 offer of judgment. For this same reason, K-Decorators asserts that it was the successful party and thus that the District Court erred in denying its request for attorney fees. Because we have held that Delaware is not entitled to recover attorney fees because he failed to timely file his memorandum of costs, we will only address K-Decorators\u2019 argument that the District Court erred in denying its request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b675 In general, a prevailing litigant is not entitled to attorney fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>Marsh v. Overland </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 21, 30, 905 P.2d 1088, 1093 (citing <em>Howell v. State </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 275, 868 P.2d 568, 574). Section 39-3- 214(1), MCA, however, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">Whenever it is necessary for the employee to enter or maintain a suit at law for the recovery or collection of wages due as provided for by [the Wage Protection Act], <em>a resulting judgment must include a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in favor of the successful party, </em>to be taxed as part of the costs in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b676 K-Decorators argues that it was the successful party under \u00a7 39-3-214(1), MCA, because K-Decorators\u2019 offer of judgment was $31,314.86 greater than the jury\u2019s verdict for $1,185.14. Consequently, K-Decorators argues that the District Court erred in denying its requests for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b677 An offer of judgment in an amount greater than the jury\u2019s verdict is a factor that a court should consider when determining which party is the successful or prevailing party for the purpose of attorney fees. <em>Doig v. Cascaddan </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 105, 113, 935 P.2d 268, 272. Nevertheless, we reject K-Decorators\u2019 argument that it was the successful party under \u00a7 39-3-214(1), MCA, because it is unclear from the record whether K-Decorators offered to have judgment taken against it on Delaware\u2019s unpaid wage claim or on his wrongful discharge claim. Although K-Decorators\u2019 offer of judgment states that it is offering to have judgment taken against it \u201cin the amount of $32,500 for [Delaware\u2019s] wage claims\u201d and cites the Wage Protection Act\u2019s attorney fees provision, it also states that K-Decorators is offering to have judgment taken against it on Count I of Delaware\u2019s Complaint which alleged wrongful discharge. Moreover, K-Decorators\u2019 offer of judgment states that \u201c[t]his offer is made without reference to, and without prejudice to, Plaintiff\u2019s claims [for unpaid wages].\u201d Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>K-Decorators\u2019 offer of judgment is ambiguous as to whether it applied to Delaware\u2019s unpaid wage claim or to his wrongful discharge claim, it is immaterial to determining which parly prevailed in the trial on Delaware\u2019s claim for unpaid wages. Thus, we conclude that K-Decorators is not the successful party on the grounds that the jury verdict did not exceed K-Decorators\u2019 offer of judgment. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying K-Decorators\u2019 request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"Abp\">\u00b678 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of K-Decorators\u2019 request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Issue 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b679 <em>Did the District Court err in refusing to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claim against Judson, individually?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b680 K-Decorators contends that the District Court erred when the court denied its second motion to dismiss wherein it moved to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claim against Judson individually. Specifically, K-Decorators argues that Rule 12(b), M.R.Civ.R, required the District Court to treat its second motion to dismiss as a motion for partial summary judgment and that the court should have granted summary judgment in favor of Judson on the grounds that a corporate officer cannot be personally hable for acts taken on behalf of the corporation in furtherance of corporate goals, policies and business interests. In response, Delaware points out that the parties stipulated before trial that Judson is a proper defendant. In spite of the stipulation, K-Decorators argues that Judson\u2019s stipulation did not waive its right to appeal the issue of whether the District Court erred in denying its motion to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claim against Judson individually. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b681 This Court will not address an issue on appeal concerning a question of law or fact which a party raises after stipulating to that law or fact. <em>Topco, Inc. v. State, Dept. of Highways </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 352, 358, 912 P.2d 805, 808 (citing <em>Penn v. Burlington Northern, Inc. </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 223, 228, 605 P.2d 600, 603-4). <em>See also Westland Enterprises, Inc. v. Boyne, USA, Inc. </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 186, 191, 772 P.2d 309, 312, (citing <em>In re Marriage of Prevost </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 116, 731 P.2d 344).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">\u00b682 In the instant case, the stipulation states that Judson agreed that he was a proper party to the case. Even so, K-Decorators argues that Judson did not waive his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s decision denying K-Decorators\u2019 motion to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claim against Judson individually because the stipulation shows that Judson only agreed that he was a proper defendant to streamline the issues for trial. However, Judson\u2019s reason for stipulating that he is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>proper defendant in this case is immaterial; we will not address an issue on appeal concerning a question of law or fact which a party raises after stipulating to that law or fact regardless of the party\u2019s reason for stipulating. Thus, by stipulating that he is a proper party to the case, Judson waived his right to appeal whether the District Court erred by denying K-Decorators\u2019 motion to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claims against Judson individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b683 Accordingly, we will not address the issue of whether the District Court erred in denying K-Decorators\u2019 motion to dismiss Delaware\u2019s claims against Judson.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Issue 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b684 <em>Did the District Court err in imposing discovery sanctions on K-Decorators?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b685 The District Court imposed discovery sanctions on K-Decorators pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.R, for failing to comply with the court\u2019s order to serve answers to Delaware\u2019s first set of interrogatories within fifteen days of the date of the order. Although K-Decorators acknowledges that it did not comply with the District Court\u2019s order, it argues that the court abused its discretion in imposing discovery sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b686 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s imposition of discovery sanctions to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 500, 506, 949 P.2d 1168, 1172 (citing <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 329, 916 P.2d 91, 93). <em>See also Sullivan v. Sisters of Charity </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 71, 77, 885 P.2d 488, 492 (citing <em>Eisenmenger v. Ethicon, Inc. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 393, 402, 871 P.2d 1313, 1319). We generally defer to the district court\u2019s decision \u201cbecause the trial court is in the best position to know whether parties are disregarding the rights of opposing parties in the course of litigation and which sanctions for such conduct are most <em>appropriate.\u201d McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 500, 949 P.2d at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"AL8\">\u00b687  Since 1981, we have consistently stated that a party\u2019s abuse of discovery procedures which results in unnecessary delay of a case should not be dealt with leniently. <em>Morris v. Big Sky Thoroughbred Farms, Inc., </em>1998 MT 229, \u00b6 13, 291 Mont. 32, \u00b6 13, 965 P.2d 890, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>Owen v. F.A. Buttrey Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 274, 278, 627 P.2d 1233, 1235). More to the point, we have stated that those who abuse the discovery rules should be punished rather than encouraged repeatedly to cooperate in the discovery process. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 506, 949 P.2d at 1171 (citing <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 332, 916 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>92-93). The policy behind judicial intolerance of discovery abuses is the concern over crowded dockets and the need to maintain fair and efficient judicial administration of pending cases. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 506, 949 P.2d at 1171 (citing <em>Smith, </em>916 P.2d at 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b688 Rule 37, M.R.C\u00cdV.P., governs sanctions for failure to comply with discovery procedures. Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., provides in pertinent part that \u201c[ijf a party... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, ... the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just...\u201d Moreover, Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., states that \u201c[tjhe court <em>shall </em>require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b689 In short, Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., is strict; a district court must sanction those who disobey a discovery order by ordering them to pay the other party\u2019s reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, which arise because of the failure to comply with a discovery order, unless the court finds that the failure to comply with the order was substantially justified, or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. The party attempting to avoid Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., sanctions has the burden of proving that its failure to comply with the order was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d or that other circumstances make such an award unjust. <em>See Hyde &amp; Drath v. Baker </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 24 F.3d 1162, 1171 (citing <em>Falstaff Brewing Corp. v. Miller Brewing Co., </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 702 F.2d 770, 784) (interpreting the identical federal rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b690 In the instant case, therefore, the District Court was required to sanction K-Decorators for failing to comply with its order by awarding Delaware his reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, unless K-Decorators proved that it was substantially justified in failing to comply with the court\u2019s order or that other circumstances made an award of reasonable expenses unjust. Thus, our review in this case is whether the District Court abused its discretion by not ruling that K-Decorators\u2019 failure to comply with the court\u2019s order was substantially justified or that other circumstances made an award of sanctions unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b691 K-Decorators argues that the District Court erred in sanctioning K-Decorators for failing to comply with the court\u2019s order for several reasons. We construe K-Decorators\u2019 arguments to be that its failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s order was substantially justified or that other circumstances existed that made the sanctions unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u00b692  First, K-Decorators contends that the District Court should not have sanctioned it because its response to Delaware\u2019s interrogatories was late because of the \u201crush of the Christmas season and the crunch of counsel\u2019s schedule.\u201d This Court has held, however, that an attorney\u2019s busy schedule does not constitute \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Rule 5, M.R.Civ.P. <em>In re Marriage of Bahm </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 331, 333, 732 P.2d 846, 847-48. Similarly, an attorney\u2019s busy schedule is not substantial justification for failing to comply with a district court\u2019s order nor is it a circumstance that makes an imposition of sanctions unjust under Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P. As stated by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, \u201c[mjost attorneys are busy most of the time and they must organize their work so as to be able to meet the time requirements of matters they are handling or suffer the consequences.\u201d <em>Pinero Schroeder v. Federal National Mortgage Ass\u2019n </em>(1st Cir. 1978), 574 F.2d 1117, 1118. In sum, neither the \u201crush\u201d of the holiday season nor the \u201ccrunch\u201d of K-Decorators\u2019 attorney\u2019s schedule constitutes substantial justification for failing to comply with the District Court\u2019s order nor are they circumstances which make the sanction unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b693 Second, K-Decorators asserts that the District Court erred in imposing sanctions because its failure to comply with the court\u2019s order was not the result of an intentional disregard of Delaware\u2019s discovery rights nor was the failure to comply an attempt to prevent discovery. In <em>McKenzie, </em>however, we ruled that a party should be sanctioned for an attitude of unresponsiveness to the discovery process regardless of their intent behind that attitude. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 508, 949 P.2d at 1172 (citations omitted). We also pointed out that refusing to provide discovery unnecessarily delays cases and is the precise reason behind the availability of sanctions pursuant to Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 516, 949 P.2d at 1177. Because K-Decorators\u2019 intent behind its failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s order is immaterial and because its failure to comply with the court\u2019s order unnecessarily delayed the case, these proffered reasons are neither substantial justification for failing to comply with the court\u2019s order nor are they circumstances which make the sanctions unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b694 Finally, K-Decorators contends that the District Court erred in imposing the sanctions because the delay was insignificant and because Delaware did not express an immediate need for answers. K-Decorators\u2019 argument that the District Court erred in imposing sanctions because the delay was insignificant is without merit. The severity of a party\u2019s failure to comply with a discovery order is a factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>that is to be considered only when determining an appropriate sanction under Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P. <em>See McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 516, 949 P.2d at 1177-78. Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., requires a district court to, at the least, sanction a party who has disobeyed a discovery order by ordering that party to pay the other party\u2019s reasonable expenses caused by the party\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery order. In the instant case, K-Decorators violated a discovery order and received the lightest sanction allowed by Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P. Moreover, the severity of a party\u2019s failure to comply with a discovery order cannot constitute substantial justification for failing to comply with a district court\u2019s order nor is it, under the facts of the instant case, a circumstance which makes the sanctions unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b695 K-Decorators\u2019 argument that it should not be sanctioned because Delaware never expressed an immediate need for the answers is equally without merit. Delaware did not need to ask K-Decorators for the answers after the District Court ordered K-Decorators to answer the interrogatories. Thus, the fact that Delaware did not express an immediate need for answers did not substantially justify K-Decorators\u2019 failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s order nor is it a circumstance which makes the sanctions unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b696 In sum, Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P, required the District Court to award Delaware his reasonable expenses, including his attorney fees, caused by K-Decorators\u2019 failure to comply with the District Court\u2019s order to answer Delaware\u2019s first set of interrogatories within fifteen days of the date of the order, unless K-Decorators proved that its failure to comply with the order was substantially justified or that other circumstances made an award of sanctions unjust. We conclude that K-Decorators did not prove that it was substantially justified in disobeying the District Court\u2019s order nor did it prove that other circumstances made the sanctions unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b697 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of discovery sanctions on K- Decorators pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u00b698 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. In the instant case, Delaware\u2019s last day at K-Decorators was September 20, 1993. On that day the maximum penalty under \u00a7 39-2-206, MCA, was 100 per cent of the wages due and unpaid. On October 1,1993, the maximumpenalty increased to 110 per cent. Consequently, the District Court ruled that Delaware could recover a maximum penalty of 100 per cent of the wages due and unpaid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
