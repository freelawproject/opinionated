On May 14, 1987, Wilson filed an acknowledgment of waiver of rights by plea of guilty, and entered a guilty plea to both counts in accordance with the plea agreement. On May 13, 1992, Wilson filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas and a motion for appointment of counsel. On December 14, 1992, the District Court deemed Wilson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas to be a petition for postconviction relief. On June 3, 1996, Wilson filed an amended petition for postconviction relief. On November 5, 1997, the District Court denied Wilson\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief. Wilson ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>peals the District Court\u2019s denial of his request for postconviction relief. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b62 The issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Wilson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b63 On March 11,1987, Lloyd James Wilson was charged by information with deliberate homicide (count one) and accountability for deliberate homicide (count two) in connection with the murders of Richard and Bernadette Cowen at a farm house in Blaine County on January 21, 1987. A codefendant, Robert Bone, was similarly charged in the same proceeding for his role in the murders. <em>See Bone v. State </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 293, 944 P.2d 734. Judge Leonard H. Langen was the original presiding judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b64 On May 14,1987, after Robert Bone had pled guilty to charges pursuant to a plea agreement, Wilson appeared before Judge Langen with counsel, filed an acknowledgment of waiver of rights by plea of guilty, and entered a guilty plea to both counts in accordance with the plea agreement set forth in the acknowledgment. The acknowledgment states the potential punishment for each count, including the maximum punishment of death or life imprisonment. The acknowledgment also recognizes the sentence enhancement for use of a dangerous weapon which is required to run consecutively to any sentence imposed for each initial offense. <em>See State v. Byers </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 17, 861 P.2d 860, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Rothacher </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 303, 310, 901 P.2d <em>82, 86-87; State v. </em>Egelhoff (1995), 272 Mont. 114, 124, 900 P.2d 260, 266. These potential sentences were reviewed orally by Judge Langen during the hearing on Wilson\u2019s plea agreement. Judge Langen did not specifically advise Wilson at the hearing that any terms of imprisonment imposed for the two counts could be made to run consecutive to each other or that the application of \u201cgood time\u201d earned by Wilson could in any way be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b65 The plea agreement recited in the acknowledgment shows that the State agreed not to seek the death penalty for Wilson and further agreed to recommend <em>concurrent </em>sentences of 100 years each for the two counts, and a <em>consecutive </em>sentence enhancement of two years for the use of a weapon. The acknowledgment further recognizes that the State\u2019s recommendations are not binding upon the court and that the judge is not required to allow Wilson to withdraw his guilty pleas even if the judge wishes to sentence him more harshly.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b66 At the hearing on the plea agreement, Wilson stated that he had read the acknowledgment several times and knew it \u201cpretty well by heart.\u201d Judge Langen reviewed the provisions of the acknowledgment with Wilson, and Wilson stated that he had consulted with his attorneys and understood the terms and conditions contained in the acknowledgment. Wilson also stated that he understood that the court is not bound by the recommendation and may make an entirely different determination as to what an appropriate and fair sentence would be under the circumstances. Judge Langen thereafter accepted Wilson\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b67 On July 6, 1987, Judge Langen sentenced Wilson to a term of 100 years at the state prison for count one, with an additional consecutive term of ten years for using a weapon during the commission of the offense. Judge Langen sentenced Wilson to a <em>consecutive </em>term of seventy-five years for count two, with a consecutive term of ten years for the use of a weapon. Judge Langen stated that he intended Wilson to serve a total of 195 years, pursuant to the applicable statutes, with no portion suspended. The judge declared Wilson to be dangerous for purposes of parole eligibility and restricted Wilson\u2019s eligibility for parole or participation in any supervised release program for the first thirty years of his sentence with no \u201cgood time\u201d allowances to be given against the thirty-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b68 Wilson did not appeal from the sentencing order. On May 13, 1992, five years after entering his guilty pleas, Wilson filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Judge Langen deemed his motion a motion for postconviction relief. Wilson filed an amended postconviction petition on June 3,1996, which the District Court denied on November 5,1997, and filed on November 7, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err when it denied Wilson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b610 Wilson contends that the District Court erred because Judge Langen did not properly advise him of the consequences of his guilty pleas, because Judge Langen\u2019s limitation on his \u201cgood-time\u201d allowances was illegal, and because, contrary to the assertion of the District Court, his claims were not procedurally barred. Wilson\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief requested that the District Court order the withdrawal of his guilty pleas or, alternatively, modify his sentences. Wilson urges this Court to reverse the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief and remand this matter for modification of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b611 The standard of review of a denial of postconviction relief is whether substantial evidence supports the findings and conclusions ofthe district court. <em>See State v. Sheppard </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 122, 127, 890 P.2d 754, 757 (citing <em>State v. Barrack </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 154, 159, 882 P.2d 1028, 1031). We review a district court\u2019s findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous, and the district court\u2019s conclusions to determine if the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>See Bone v. State </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 293, 302-03, 944 P.2d 734, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b612 Section 46-16-105(l)(b), MCA (1985), governed the entry of guilty pleas at the time Wilson\u2019s guilty plea was entered. That statute provides that \u201c[bjefore or during trial, a plea of guilty may be accepted when ... the court has informed the defendant of the consequences of his plea and of the maximum penalty provided by law which may be imposed upon acceptance of such plea.\u201d We have interpreted \u00a7 46-16-105 (l)(b), MCA (1985), as requiring the district court to advise the defendant of the consequences of his guilty plea and the maximum sentence which may be imposed. <em>See State v. Buckman </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 37, 43, 768 P.2d 1361, 1365. Wilson argues that he was not properly advised of the maximum penalty because the District Court did not inform him that he could receive <em>consecutive </em>sentences for both counts and for the use of a weapon, amounting to a possible cumulative maximum sentence of220 years. Upon review of the record, we reject Wilson\u2019s argument for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b613  First, the acknowledgment that Wilson signed clearly advises him of the maximum punishment provided by law for deliberate homicide and for accountability for deliberate homicide. The acknowledgment also contains sufficient language to inform Wilson that he could receive consecutive sentences. Because the sections of the acknowledgment which describe the potential punishment for each count are set forth in separate paragraphs, they are sufficient to have informed Wilson that there was a separate potential punishment of up to 100 years for each offense. Following these paragraphs there is a provision which recites the additional sentence of up to ten years for committing an offense with a dangerous weapon. That provision states that the additional sentence will \u201crun consecutively to the sentence imposed for the initial offense.\u201d Because Wilson pled guilty to committing two initial offenses, the language <em>\u201cthe </em>initial offense\u201d in this provision necessarily implies that the additional pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ishment possible for the use of a dangerous weapon is attached to <em>each </em>initial offense. (Emphasis added). We agree with the District Court that the acknowledgment form itself is sufficient to have informed Wilson that because he committed two separate offenses, he was subject to potential punishment for each offense and an additional potential punishment for the use of a dangerous weapon in each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b614 Following the recital of potential punishments and the trial rights which Wilson waived by his guilty plea, the acknowledgment sets forth the State\u2019s agreed sentencing recommendations. The State agreed to recommend that Wilson \u201cbe sentenced to a period of 100 years ... on each count\u201d with \u201ceach of these sentences ... to run concurrently with the other.\u201d This language is clear and it unambiguously states the recommendation that \u201ceach sentence\u201d run \u201cconcurrently.\u201d The State\u2019s recommendation in the plea agreement is important since without it the State may well have urged the court to \u201cotherwise order\u201d the sentences to run <em>consecutively, </em>as \u00a7 46-18-401(4), MCA (1985), permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b615 Second, Wilson\u2019s awareness of the possibility of consecutive sentences is evidenced by the use of both terms, \u201cconcurrent\u201d and \u201cconsecutive,\u201d in his acknowledgment. In the acknowledgment, the State recommended \u201cconcurrent\u201d sentences on the initial offenses, and a \u201cconsecutive\u201d sentence enhancement for the use of a dangerous weapon. Used in this manner, the language of the acknowledgment itself shows the distinction between the two terms and the two types of sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b616 Third, Judge Langen\u2019s colloquy at the plea agreement hearing removes any remaining doubt as to whether Wilson was made aware of the sentencing possibilities. The judge correctly stated the punishment for each count, including a possible sentence of death or life imprisonment. After reciting the punishment for count one, Judge Langen stated that if Wilson pled guilty to count two, \u201cthe statute provides for the same punishment - exactly the same punishment.\u201d Judge Langen then addressed the sentence enhancement for the use of a dangerous weapon. At no time did the judge advise Wilson that the total possible sentence for the crimes charged was only 110 years. The only reasonable conclusion to be made from the language of the acknowledgment and transcript of the hearing was that Wilson could possibly receive 100 years, plus an additional ten years, on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u00b617  We have held that a written acknowledgment, combined with oral questioning of the defendant, constitutes adequate interrogation. <em>See State v. Johnson </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 124, 907 P.2d <em>150) State v. </em>Duff (1993), 262 Mont. 288, 865 P2d 238. In this case, the specific terms of the acknowledgment of waiver of rights, together with Judge Langen\u2019s colloquy at the hearing, were sufficient to have informed Wilson of the maximum sentence for each count and the possibility of consecutive terms of imprisonment. Because Judge Langen did not incorrectly state the total possible years of punishment, this case is distinguishable from <em>State v. Brown </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 499, 865 P.2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b618 In <em>Brown, </em>the original trial judge, upon entry ofthe defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, incorrectly advised the defendant that the maximum total punishment possible pursuant to the charge was thirty years. The defendant was ultimately sentenced to forty years. Upon review, we concluded that the defendant had not been properly advised of the maximum punishment at the time he entered his guilty pleas and that the sentence should be modified accordingly. In the present case, we decline to apply the holding in <em>Brown </em>because Judge Langen did not mislead Wilson by incorrectly stating the total possible years of punishment. Rather, he correctly stated the maximum possible penalty for each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b619 In <em>State v. Buckman </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 37, 768 P.2d 1361, we indicated that the court need not advise the defendant beyond the specific requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46-16-105 and 46-12-204, MCA (1985). Section 46-12-204, MCA (1985), requires the court to advise the defendant \u201cof the punishment as set forth by statute for the crime charged\u201d and that the defendant and his counsel should consider \u201cthe most severe sentence that can be imposed for a particular crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b620  We conclude that Judge Langen correctly advised Wilson of the maximum possible punishment which could be imposed as a result of each plea of guilty. Judge Langen complied with the statutory requirements and no further advice concerning sentencing possibilities was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u00b621 Next, Wilson contends that Judge Langen did not have statutory authority to restrict Wilson\u2019s right to earn \u201cgood time\u201d against the thirty-year term during which he is ineligible for parole. Wilson cites <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029, in support of his contention that a district court can only impose a sentence that is provided for by statute. Wilson maintains that \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>46-18-202(2), MCA (1985), contains no language that would allow a district court to restrict a defendant\u2019s right to earn \u201cgood time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b622 \u201cGood time\u201d allowances are authorized by \u00a7 53-30-105, MCA (1985), granted by the Department of Corrections, and operate as a credit on a prisoner\u2019s sentence. Wilson\u2019s total sentence of 195 years is therefore reduced by any \u201cgood time\u201d which he is granted. Upon review of Judge Langen\u2019s sentencing order, we conclude that Wilson is not limited in earning \u201cgood time\u201d against his sentence, but rather, his thirty-year period of ineligibility for parole is not to be reduced by any \u201cgood time\u201d credits he receives toward his total sentence. Judge Langen\u2019s order does not affect Wilson\u2019s ability to earn \u201cgood time\u201d based upon his good behavior and therefore the restriction is well within the court\u2019s authority pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"ABm\">\u00b623 Finally, Wilson argues on appeal that the District Court should not have raised <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of whether Wilson\u2019s postconviction claims were procedurally barred because of his failure to directly appeal the sentencing order to this Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-105, MCA (1985). We conclude, however, that while the District Court did suggest that the statutory procedural bar could be applied to Wilson\u2019s claims, the District Court fully discussed Wilson\u2019s claims on their merits and, therefore, contrary to Wilson\u2019s assertions, the procedural bar of \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA (1985), was not the primary or alternative basis for the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Wilson\u2019s postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"A6s4\">\u00b624  The record in this case supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Wilson was aware of the possibility that he could be sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment following his guilty pleas to the separate offenses of deliberate homicide and accountability for deliberate homicide. The record also supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Wilson was sufficiently made aware that he could receive two separate additional sentences for the use of a weapon during the commission of each initial offense. Finally, the District Court correctly interpreted Judge Langen\u2019s sentence when it declined to modify the \u201cgood time\u201d restriction on Wilson\u2019s thirty-year parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"Api\">\u00b625 Accordingly, we conclude that the findings and conclusions of the District Court which serve as the basis for its denial of Wilson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief are supported by substantial evidence. None of the District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and our review of the District Court\u2019s conclusions leads us to conclude that the court correctly interpreted the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b626 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b461-4\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"AER\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b627 Although I concur with the Court\u2019s conclusions that when the plea agreement and the sentencing colloquy are read together, Wilson was adequately advised that he faced a 100-year sentence on each count plus ten years on each count. However, I think the preferable approach in implementing the requirements of \u00a7 46-16-105(l)(b), MCA (1985), is to explicitly advise a defendant of the maximum penalty provided by law assuming that consecutive sentences are imposed for each count involved in the plea. For example, the defendant in this case would have been forewarned that if consecutive sentences were imposed for both counts in the plea he would be exposed to a maximum penalty of 220 years.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the foregoing specially concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b461-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ACR\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b628 I specially concur with the majority opinion. While I agree with the result, I do not agree with all the reasons given for that result.</p>\n<p id=\"ARv\">\u00b629 For example, as pointed out in the majority opinion, pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-105(l)(b), MCA (1985), and as applied by our decision in <em>State v. Buckman </em>(1986), 236 Mont. 37, 43, 768 P.2d 1361, 1365, the district court must advise a defendant of the maximum penalty provided by law before the district court can accept a guilty plea. In this case, had the maximum penalty for each offense been 100 years of imprisonment and the possible enhancement by ten years for use of a weapon, I believe that this statute and our prior decision would have required that the District Court advise Wilson that all periods of imprisonment could be imposed consecutively, and that the maximum term of imprisonment would, in that event, have been 220 years. The District Court did not do that, nor was that information included at any point in the acknowledgment of waiver of rights. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he acknowledgment also contains sufficient language to inform Wilson that he could receive consecutive sentences.\u201d Wilson was told that the sentence enhancement for each offense could run consecutive to the basic sentence for each offense, but was never advised that the term of imprisonment for one offense could be imposed consecutive to the term of imprisonment for the other offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u00b630 However, the maximum sentence provided by law for the offenses to which Wilson pled guilty was not imprisonment for a period of years. Section 45-5-102, MCA, provides the following possible sentences for deliberate homicide or deliberate homicide by accountability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">(2) A person convicted of the offense of deliberate homicide shall be punished by death as provided in 46-18-301 through 46-18-310, by life imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years, except as provided in 46-18-219 and 46-18-222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b631 Punishment, by death or imprisonment for life are both more severe sentences than imprisonment for a period of years, and Wilson was advised of both of those possibilities in the colloquy cited in \u00b6 16 of the majority opinion. It is therefore my conclusion that without regard to the lack of any advice about the possibility for consecutive sentences, Wilson was advised of the maximum penalties provided by law for each of the offenses to which he pled guilty. For that reason, I specially concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court\u2019s advice to Wilson satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 46-16-105(1)00, MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b632 I also concur with the remaining conclusions expressed in the majority opinion and with the reasons given therefore.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
