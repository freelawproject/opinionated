The parties asked the District Court to determine whether the 2% phase-in of changes in real property value, as set forth in \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, violated the United States or Montana Constitutions, or Montana statutory law. After considering written briefs submitted by the parties and hearing oral argument, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), is unconstitutional on its face and in conflict with other statutory law pertaining to the valuation and assessment of real property in Montana. The Department appeals the judgment of the District Court. We affirm that judgment in part, as applied to the petitioner, Theodore Roosevelt, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u00b62 We limit our consideration of the issues raised on appeal to the question of whether, as applied to the petitioner, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), violates his right to equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">\u00b63 The following facts are taken from the parties\u2019 joint petition to the District Court. They are agreed upon by the parties and are the only facts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">\u00b64 Theodore Roosevelt, IV, owns real property and improvements to that property which are located in Fergus County, Montana. At issue in this case is the 1997 taxable value of two improvements to that real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u00b65 In 1996, the market value of the property at issue was appraised by the Montana Department of Revenue at $890,850. In 1997, the Department appraised that same property at $701,890. Roosevelt filed an appeal with the Fergus County Tax Appeal Board challenging the 1997 valuation. For purposes of calculating the 1997 value, the county board reduced Roosevelt\u2019s 1996 appraised value to $820,597, and his 1997 appraised value to $658,840. Pursuant to \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), the Department then phased in the amount of change in valuation at the rate of <em>2% </em>per year beginning in 1997. In other words, although the appraised value of Roosevelt\u2019s property declined by $161,757, he was given credit for only a $3,235 difference, and assessed property taxes based on a value of $817,362, rather than his actual 1997 appraised value of $658,840. The county board affirmed the Department\u2019s calculation of the 1997 phase-in value for Roosevelt\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b66 Roosevelt appealed to the STAB to contest the legality of the <em>2% </em>phase-in provision of \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997). The parties then filed the joint petition to the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-305, MCA, which provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">A district court may make an interlocutory adjudication of an issue pending before the state tax appeal board if that issue involves procedure, the admissibility of evidence, or a substantive question of law and does not require the determination of a question of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5u\">\u00b67 The parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of fact and that the sole issue to be decided was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">Whether the <em>2% </em>phase in of changes in value, as set forth in \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, is in violation of the United States and Montana constitutional requirements of equal protection and due process, and in violation of the Montana statutory requirement of property value equalization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In the District Court, Roosevelt argued that:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b68 1. The phase-in provision violates Article VIII, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution, \u00a7 15-9-101(1), MCA, and \u00a7 15-8-111(1), MCA, which require the equalization of property values for purposes of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u00b69 2. The phase-in provision violates Article VIII, Section 7, of the Montana Constitution, which guarantees a property owner the right to appeal appraisals and assessments because a property owner cannot, in fact, receive a reduction on appeal based on the true market value of his or her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00b6 10 3. The phase-in provision violates the rights to equal protection of laws and due process guaranteed by the United States and Montana Constitutions, as interpreted in <em>Department of Revenue v. Barron </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 100, 799 P.2d 533, and <em>Department of Revenue v. Sheehy </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 104, 862 P.2d 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b611 The Department responded that:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b612 1. Article VIII, Section 3, merely provides for appraisal, assessment, and equalization of value, as provided by law. Section 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), is the method of appraisal and assessment provided for by law and there is no requirement that property be assessed at 100% of current market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b613 2. Article VIII, Section 7, of the Montana Constitution has not been violated because the Legislature has provided for tax appeal procedures at the local government level through \u00a7\u00a7 15-15-101 to -106, MCA, and to the STAB through \u00a7 15-2-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\u00b614 3. Neither Roosevelt\u2019s right to equal protection nor his right to due process has been violated because he has been treated like every other property owner in the state. Rather than <em>Barron </em>and <em>Sheehy, </em>the Court should be guided on this point by <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\u00b615 Following written briefs and arguments by the parties, the District Court found that Roosevelt\u2019s taxes, based on the 1997 phased-in value, were $11,246.31, but that his taxes based on his actual market value would have been $9,065.13, for a difference of $2,181.18. The Court found that for the year 1997 the phase-in provision of the 1997 amendment to \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA, required that Roosevelt pay property taxes based on a valuation which is 124% of the market value of his Class Four property, and concluded, based on the statute, that it would take fifty years for Roosevelt\u2019s property to be assessed at its fair market value. Although the Department questions the District Court\u2019s fifty-year conclusion, the court\u2019s previously referred to findings are not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">\u00b616 Based on its findings, the District Court agreed that the phase-in provision violates Article VIII, Sections 3 and 7, of the Montana Constitution, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of both the United States and Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">\u00b617 On appeal, the parties\u2019 arguments are similar to those raised in the District Court, although the Department argues additionally that the District Court assumed facts not in evidence as the basis for its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u00b618 Except where necessary, we will not repeat the parties\u2019 arguments in detail, nor do we find it necessary to address all of the issues raised in the District Court or decided by the District Court since we conclude that the District Court\u2019s judgment, as it applies to the parties who were before it, is correct based on the District Court\u2019s application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution. Therefore, we will limit our discussion to the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b619 As applied to the petitioner and similarly situated property owners, does \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), violate the right to equal protection as guaranteed by Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b620 Article VIII, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution, provides that \u201c[t]he state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axz\">\u00b621 Pursuant to that mandate, the Legislature enacted the following requirement regarding the appraisal of real property in Montana: \u201cThe same method of appraisal and assessment shall be used in each county of the state to the end that comparable property with similar true market values and subject to taxation in Montana shall have substantially equal taxable values at the end of each cyclical revaluation program hereinbefore provided.\u201d Section 15-7-112, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b622 The Legislature further provided, at \u00a7 15-8-111, MCA, that all taxable property must be assessed at 100% ofits market value, except as otherwise provided, and at \u00a7 15-9-101(1), MCA, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">The department shall adjust and equalize the valuation of taxable property among the several counties ... and between individual taxpayers and shall do all things necessary to secure a fair, just, and equitable valuation of all taxable property among counties ... and between individual taxpayers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b623 The combined effect of these provisions requires standardized appraisal methods throughout the state with the ultimate goal that the valuation of taxable property be equalized among the various counties in the state and among individual taxpayers, and that once equalized, that property be assessed for tax purposes at 100% of its market value, except as otherwise provided. As part of that statutory framework for appraisal, valuation, and assessment of real property, \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA (1995), required that property within the State of Montana be revalued by the Department by December 31, 1996, and revalued at least every three years. However, in 1997, the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>State Legislature became concerned that general increases in the value of real property throughout the State of Montana would result in substantial increases in those taxes derived from real property, impose a hardship on those property owners whose property had appreciated in value, and produce more revenue to the state than was necessary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, in 1997, the Legislature amended \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, to include the following phase-in provision which is at issue in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQq\">(1) The department of revenue shall administer and supervise a program for the revaluation of all taxable property within classes three, four, and ten. All other property must be revalued annually. The revaluation of class three, four, and ten property is complete on December 31,1996. <em>The amount of the change in valuation from the 1996 base year for each property in classes three, four, and ten must be phased in each year at the rate of2% of the total change in valuation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">(3) Beginning January 1,2007, the department of revenue shall administer and supervise a program for the revaluation of all taxable property within classes three, four, and ten.... The reappraisal plan adopted must provide that all class three, four, and ten property in each county is revalued by January 1, 2010, and each succeeding 3 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b624 The Legislature\u2019s amendment had the intended effect on those properties which appreciated in value in 1997. Along with reductions in the tax rate at \u00a7 15-6-134(2), MCA (1997), and limits on the mills that could be levied at \u00a7 15-10-402, MCA (1997), tax increases for those property owners were minimized or avoided. However, for those people in Roosevelt\u2019s situation, tax decreases which would have resulted from the reduction in the market value of property were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>fully realized. While property owners whose property increased in value during 1997 are now taxed at less than the market value of their property, Roosevelt\u2019s taxes are assessed on 124% of the market value of his property. The question is whether this result violates Roosevelt\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), is unconstitutional facially, is a conclusion of law. The standard of review for questions of law is whether they are correct. <em>See Albright v. Department of Revenue </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 196, 206, 933 P.2d 815, 821.</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">\u00b626  It is presumed that all legislative enactments are constitutional. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Nye </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 505, 510, 943 P.2d 96, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b627  When we review legislation for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, the first and often determinative question is the level of scrutiny to be applied. Strict scrutiny, which requires a compelling state interest for statutory classifications which treat otherwise similarly situated individuals differently, is reserved for those situations where a statutory classification \u201cimpermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right or operates to a peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.\u201d <em>Arneson v. Department of Admin. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 269, 272, 864 P.2d 1245, 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b628 Roosevelt does not contend that he is a member of a suspect class, nor that a fundamental right is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b629 We have adopted a middle tier of scrutiny where important rights are involved, even though those rights are not considered fundamental. Rights important enough to warrant middle-tier scrutiny, although not considered fundamental, include rights which, although mentioned in the Constitution, are not found in Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights. <em>See Butte Community Union v. Lewis </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 426, 434, 712 P.2d 1309, 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u00b630 Roosevelt contends that the classifications created by \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), implicate his constitutional right to equalized valuation guaranteed by Article VIII, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution, and, therefore, that the statute should be scrutinized for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause based on a middle-tier review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u00b631 In those cases which do not involve classifications which implicate fundamental rights, constitutionally significant interests, or discrimination based on a suspect class, we will review the classification for whether it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective. <em>See Arneson, </em>262 Mont. at 272-73, 864 P.2d at 1248. While the Department does not directly address the appropriate level of scrutiny since its principal contention is that the statute creates no classifications, its secondary arguments assume that the statute will be reviewed for the purpose of determining whether any classifications that it does create are rationally related to a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"Amp\">\u00b632  We conclude that because \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), as applied to Roosevelt, is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest, it is not necessary to decide whether a higher level of scrutiny applies to classifications created for the purpose of property tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b633 It is clear to us, as it was to the District Court, that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), results in three classifications of Class Four property taxpayers:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b634 1. The first class includes those Class Four property owners whose market value declined from 1996 to 1997 and who were, therefore, assessed in 1997 based on a value greater than the market value of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b635 2. The second class includes those Class Four property owners whose market value did not change from 1996 to 1997 and whose property is, therefore, being assessed based on its actual market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u00b636 3. The third class includes those Class Four property owners whose property increased in value from 1996 to 1997 and who were, therefore, assessed in 1997 based on a value less than the fair market value of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">\u00b637 The Department points to the Legislature\u2019s concern about a windfall in revenue based on increased property values, and to the statement of purpose found at \u00a7 15-10-401, MCA (1997), which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">(1) The state of Montana\u2019s reliance on the taxation of property to support education and local government has placed an unreasonable burden on the owners of all classes of property described in Title 15, chapter 6, part 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>(2) Except as provided in 15-10-412, the people of the state of Montana declare that it is the policy of the state of Montana that no further property tax increases be imposed on property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b638  Although we agree that there is a legitimate state interest in reducing reliance on property taxes and avoiding further property tax increases, we conclude that taxing property owners, such as Roosevelt, based on 124% of the market value of his property, while taxing others in the state at less than the full market value of their property, is not rationally related to those objectives. Furthermore, we conclude that creating a class of property owners whose taxes are assessed on a basis greater than the market values of their property while other property owners are assessed based on the actual, or less than the actual market values of their property, causes the property owners in the first class to pay a disproportionate share of this state\u2019s property taxes, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause found at Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution, as applied by this Court in <em>Barron </em>and <em>Sheehy. </em>In fact, the effect of the classifications created by the 1997 amendment to \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), are very similar to those which this Court held unconstitutional in <em>Barron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b639 In <em>Barron, </em>the issue was the constitutionality of a former provision in \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA (1989), which provided for \u201cstratified sales assessment ratio studies\u201d and assessments based on the results of those studies. Following the studies, the actual sales prices of residential property in a given area were compared to the appraised values of those same properties for the previous three years. If the average assessed value of property in that area was more than 5% less than the average sales price, or more than 5% greater than the average sales price, then all appraised values were to be adjusted by the percentage of difference to arrive at the property\u2019s taxable value. We noted that the impacts of the adjustment had different effects on different property owners depending on the ratio of the appraised value of that person\u2019s property to the market value of that person\u2019s property and, therefore, that those persons whose appraised value exceeded their market value would be taxed at more than the market value and, therefore, taxed disproportionately. We gave the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alv\">It may be demonstrated by the above samples that equalization is not achieved by the application of the 30% factor but rather that any inequality of appraisal is exacerbated by the factor. For example, the first property, which sold for $24,000 in 1989 but was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>praised for $46,497 is now assessed after the application of the factor, at $61,346. That same property was overappraised in relation to its sales price at 193% before the application of the factor, but is overappraised 255% after its application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><em>Barron, </em>245 Mont. at 108, 799 P.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b640 Based on those facts, we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">We determine, therefore, from the record that the methodology prescribed by the legislature and implemented by the DOR for yearly equalization between areas unfairly discriminates against property taxpayers in Area 2.1 whose properties in 1989 were appraised at or above their market values.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">We therefore determine in accord with <em>Larson </em>[v. <em>Department of Revenue </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 449, 534 P.2d 854,] that the use of the 1990 tax values derived from the ratio studies and the application of the 30% factor to residential properties in Area 2.1 require certain taxpayers therein to bear a disproportionate share of Montana\u2019s tax burden in violation of the Equal Protection requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Art. II, \u00a7 4, 1972 Montana Constitution, and the Due Process requirements of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 29 of the 1972 Montana Constitution. This also violates the appraisal provisions of our statutes which require general and uniform appraisal, assessment and equalization of all taxable property in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqY\"><em>Barron, </em>245 Mont. at 108-11, 799 P.2d at 538-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b641 We conclude that just as the stratified sales assessment ratio methodology referred to in <em>Barron </em>discriminated against properties which were appraised at or above their market value and, therefore, required those property owners to \u201cbear a disproportionate share of Montana\u2019s tax burden, in violation of the equal protection requirements,\u201d \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), discriminates against those Class Four property owners whose property declined in value from 1996 to 1997, and requires that they bear a disproportionate share of Montana\u2019s tax burden, in violation of Article II, Section 4\u2019s requirement that Montana\u2019s citizens be provided with equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\u00b642 The Department contends that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>in Nordlinger v. Hahn </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1, requires that we conclude that the 2% phase-in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>provision enacted in 1997 does not violate Roosevelt\u2019s right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b643 In <em>Nordlinger, </em>the issue was whether California\u2019s constitutional requirement that real property be taxed at its \u201cacquisition value,\u201d rather than its current market value, unfairly discriminated against recent property purchasers in favor of those owning similar pieces of property, but which had been purchased years earlier at a lower price. The Supreme Court held that California had demonstrated at least two rational bases for its \u201cacquisition value\u201d system of taxation. It concluded that the state had a legitimate interest in local neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability which was furthered by permitting longer term owners to pay progressively less than new owners of comparable property, and it held that the state could legitimately conclude that a new owner of property does not have the same degree of reliance on protection against higher taxes as does an existing owner. <em>See Nordlinger, </em>505 U.S. at 12, 112 S. Ct. at 2333, 120 L. Ed. 2d at 13-14. <em>Nordlinger </em>is distinguishable from this case for two reasons. First, Montana does not have an \u201cacquisition value\u201d system of taxation. Second, as we have previously held, this state\u2019s discriminatory treatment of Roosevelt is not reasonably related to its obj ective of avoiding tax increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b644 We conclude that to the extent that federal authority is persuasive, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commissioners of Webster County, West Virginia </em>(1989), 488 U.S. 336, 109 S. Ct. 633, 102 L. Ed. 2d 688, is more closely on point. In that case, the tax assessor for Webster County, West Virginia, assessed property at 50% of its appraised value, but fixed appraised value at the consideration for which the property had last sold. When properties had not sold recently, some adjustment was made, but the adjustment was not comparable to actual increase in market value.

As long as general adjustments are accurate enough over a short period of time to equalize the differences in proportion between the assessments of a class of property holders, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied. Just as that Clause tolerates occasional errors of state law or mistakes in judgment when valuing property for tax purposes, it does not require immediate general adjustment on the basis of the latest market developments.

Likewise, we conclude that general adjustments over a short period of time to equalize the treatment of similarly situated property holders is permissible. However, pursuant to our Constitution, seasonable attainment of the equality is required. The 2% phase-in provision at issue in this case does not adjust values over a short period of time and does not result in seasonable attainment of equality in tax treatment of similarly situated property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b646 We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it concluded that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), as applied to Theodore Roosevelt, IV, violates his right to equal protection of the laws. However, we reverse that part of the District Court\u2019s judgment which held that \u00a7 15-7-111( 1), MCA (1997), is unconstitutional on its face. To violate equal protection \u201con its face\u201d means that \u201cthe law by its own terms classifies persons for different treatment.\u201d Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John E. Nowak, <em>Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure \u00a7 </em>18.4 (2d ed. 1992). In this case, the terms of\u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), make no specific classifications. On its face, the statute is neutral. However, as applied to the three classes previously described, the statute imposes different burdens on each class. Therefore, our holding in this case is limited to our conclusion that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), is discriminatory and, therefore, violates the right to equal protection, as applied to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b647 Nor are we inclined to speculate about the constitutionality of the statute as applied to other classes of taxpayers. Other than for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ceptional circumstances, which are not present in this case, we are limited in our decision-making authority to decide the issues raised by those cases or controversies presented to us. Based on our former Constitution, we have concluded that we are as limited as the federal courts to cases or controversies. In <em>Hardy v. Krutzfeldt </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 521, 672 P.2d 274, we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">\u201cThe judicial power vested in the district courts and the Supreme Court of Montana, by the provisions of the Montana Constitution, extend to such \u2018cases at law and in equity\u2019 as are within the judicial cognizance of the state sovereignty.

Raines </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 17, 80 S. Ct. 519, 4 L. Ed. 2d 524. In that case, the United States prosecuted the board of registrars and various deputy registrars in Terrell County, Georgia, for discrimination on racial grounds against some persons who attempted to vote in state elections. The prosecution was based on provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, which guaranteed the right to vote without regard to race, and granted the Attorney General authority to bring an action to enjoin the conduct of any person who would deprive another person of that right. The Federal District Court held the statute unconstitutional because it allowed the United States to enjoin purely private action, even though the complaint was based on only official action. The District Court held that because the statute on its face was susceptible of application beyond the scope of the Fifteenth Amendment, it was invalid in all its applications. The U.S. Supreme Court explained its decision to reverse the district court in the following language applicable to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">This Court, as is the case with all federal courts, \u201chas no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies. In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered: one, never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it; the other, never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\u201d ... Very significant is the incontrovertible proposition that it \u201cwould indeed be undesirable for this Court to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\u201d The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is hot to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined. The Court further pointed to the fact that a limiting construction could be given to the statute by the court responsible for its construction if an application of doubtful constitutionality were in fact concretely presented. We might add that application of this rule frees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Raines, </em>362 U.S. at 21-22, 80 S.

We limit our holding to the facts before us and to those similarly situated Class Four property taxpayers whose actual market value declined from 1996 to 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b651  Because Roosevelt\u2019s property declined in value from 1996 to 1997, and because he is denied full recognition of that decline in value for purposes of assessment pursuant to the phase-in provision in \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), Roosevelt\u2019s 1997 property taxes are based on more than the market value of his property, while the property taxes of other property owners whose property did not decline in value are based on either market value or less than market value. We conclude that creating a class of property owners whose taxes are assessed on a basis greater than the market values of their property while other property owners are assessed based on the actual or less than the actual market values of their property, causes the property owners in the first class to pay a disproportionate share of this state\u2019s property taxes, in violation of the right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Article II, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution. Therefore, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), as applied to Roosevelt, is unconstitutional and he and other similarly situated Class Four property owners are entitled to be assessed at the actual 1997 market value of their property for the purpose of calculating their 1997 property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b652 This holding is limited to the facts before us and to similarly situated. Class Four property owners whose property actually declined in value for 1996 to 1997. We reverse that part of the District Court judgment which held that the phase-in provisions in \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), are unconstitutional on their face. Whether the statute is unconstitutional as applied to other classes of property taxpayers depends on facts which are not before us and about which we decline to speculate. The constitutionality of \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), as applied to other classes of taxpayers, will have to await an actual case or controversy involving one of the members of those classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u00b653 We affirm the judgment of the District Court in part and reverse in part, and remand to the District Court for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-4\">JUSTICES REGNIER, HUNT and GRAY concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">.

The statute is presumed to be constitutional. <em>State v. Nye </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 505, 510, 943 P.2d 96, 99. The party challenging a statute bears the burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt, and if any doubt exists, it must be resolved in favor of the statute. <em>Grooms v. Ponderosa Inn </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 459, 467, 942 P.2d 699, 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b655 The Court concludes that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), is unconstitutional as applied to Roosevelt and others whose property values in 1997 decreased from their 1996 values. The Court holds that such property owners \u201care entitled to be assessed at the actual 1997 market value of their property for the purpose of calculating their 1997 property taxes.\u201d This conclusion assumes that 100% of current market value is the sole standard by which Class Four property can be assessed. However, neither the Montana Constitution nor the United States Constitution prohibit a deviation from that standard. Agricultural and forest lands, for example, have traditionally been assessed on their productive values rather than their market values. <em>See, </em>\u00a7 15-8-lll(6)(c), (d), MCA. In <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1, 11-14, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 2332-34, 120 L.Ed.2d 1, 13-15, the United States Supreme Court held that California\u2019s Proposition 13, which taxed property based upon acquisition value, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution despite the fact that acquisition value may not even remotely represent current market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b656 Prior to 1997,100% of market value was the statutory standard for assessing Class Four property in Montana. However, the 1997 Legislature amended the tax code to provide for a system which no longer relied on 100% of current market value for Class Four property. Rather, the new system assessed and equalized property based on a derivative of its 1996 market value. Under the new system, each property was assigned a 1997 reappraisal value. Each property was then assessed on its 1996 value plus or minus 2% of the difference between its 1997 reappraised value and its 1996 value. The above proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>dure is uniform and applies equally to all Class Four property owners. It is also consistent with the equalization requirements of Article VIII, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution, which provides: \u201cThe state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the <em>manner provided by law.\u201d </em>Art. VIII, Sec. 3, Mont. Const. (emphasis added). Accordingly, I disagree with the Court\u2019s assumption that current (1997) market value is <em>the </em>standard by which we must determine whether there has been a violation of the right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b657 The Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution provides that similarly situated properties must be appraised and assessed in a uniform manner. <em>Patterson v. State, Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 168, 175, 557 P.2d 798, 802. In <em>Patterson, </em>we addressed a 5-year appraisal plan in which 20% of all property, in each county, was appraised annually. In appraising 1/5 of the property each year, all property in the state of Montana would have been valued by the end of the 5-year cycl<em>e. Patterson, </em>171 Mont. at 174-75, 557 P.2d at 802. The taxpayers challenged this method, contending that properties valued in the first year of the cycle would be valued at a different market value than property appraised and assessed in the fifth year of the cycle. They argued, therefore, that this discrepancy would cause some property owners to pay a disproportionate share of taxes. <em>Patterson, </em>171 Mont. at 176, 557 P.2d at 802. In upholding the cyclical revaluation or reappraisal method, this Court acknowledged that \u201ctemporary disparities within the cycle between individual property valuations both within the county and between counties are inevitable.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>171 Mont. at 176, 557 P.2d at 802. We thus concluded that the 5-year appraisal cycle satisfied the Montana statutory uniformity provisions and the equal protection provisions of both the state and federal constitutions, given that similar properties were assessed and appraised in a similar fashion statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b658 The system presently under consideration constitutes an improvement over the 5-year cycle involved in <em>Patterson. </em>In contrast to the situation in <em>Patterson, </em>where 1/5 of all property was appraised each year, under the present system, all property is appraised in the same base year. Under the phase-in provisions of \u00a7 15-7-111, MCA, all property was appraised and assessed under the same standard for tax year 1996. All taxpayers in Montana received exactly the same valuation treatment Roosevelt received. That is, the difference between the 1996 tax year value and the reappraised 1997 value of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>property was phased in at the rate of 2% per year. That phase-in was added to or subtracted from the property\u2019s 1996 value. More particularly, all properties similar to Roosevelt\u2019s (i.e., properties which declined in value in 1997) received similar treatment; such properties had their reduced 1997 value phased-in via a <em>2% </em>reduction from the previous year\u2019s 1996 value.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b659 All Class Four property is taxed at its 1996 value plus or minus <em>2% </em>of the difference between its 1997 value and its 1996 value. All taxpayers have been treated the same and the same standard is applied to all similarly situated property statewide. In my view, this methodology does not, on its face, or as applied to Roosevelt, violate the equal protection guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b660 Roosevelt also argues that the phase-in provision violates Article VIII, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution, which guarantees a property owner the right to appeal appraisals and assessments, because a property owner cannot, under \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA, receive a reduction on appeal to the true market value of his or her property. Given that Roosevelt, in fact, exercised his administrative appeals and received a <em>2% </em>downward adjustment to the 1997 value of his property, this contention is difficult to understand. First, he appears to contend that his right to an effective appeal has been diminished because he did not prevail on his current market value argument. However, this argument assumes that current market value is the sole standard by which to measure the constitutionality of a tax. As I have stated above, I disagree with the underlying assumption in this line of argument. Secondly, he seems to argue that unless an appeal achieves a desired result, the right of effective appeal has been denied. There is no merit to this contention. As this Court\u2019s opinion herein illustrates, Roosevelt\u2019s rights to appeal have been honored from the administrative level all the way through the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b661 For the above reasons, I would reverse the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b282-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AzI\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b662 Although I agree with the majority that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is only unconstitutional as it applies to Roosevelt and similarly situated Class Four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>property owners. I also disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to rewrite the statute so that Roosevelt and other similarly situated Class Four property owners are taxed at the actual 1997 market value of their property for the purpose of calculating their 1997 property taxes. In so holding, the majority has misconstrued equal protection clause jurisprudence and has placed itself into the role of the Montana Legislature.

However, for two reasons, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is only unconstitutional as applied to Roosevelt and other similarly situated Class Four property owners. First, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement in \u00b6 46, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is not neutral on its face. The majority admits as much in \u00b6\u00b6 33-36 wherein it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">It is as clear to us, as it was to the District Court, that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), MCA (1997), <em>results in three classifications </em>of Class Four property taxpayers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">1. The first class includes those Class Four property owners whose market value declined from 1996 to 1997 and <em>who were, therefore, assessed in 1997 based on a value greater that the market value of their property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">2.

In short, it is as clear to the majority as it was to the District Court that \u00a7 15-7-111(1) by its own terms, \u201cresults in\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> three classes of Class Four property owners and the taxpayers in two of these classes pay a disproportional share of Montana\u2019s tax burden. Since the majority concedes that a statute violates equal protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>on its face when, by its own terms, it classifies persons for different treatment, I cannot understand how the majority, after stating that the statute results in three classes of Class Four property owners and acknowledging that two of these classes pay a disproportional share of the tax burden, reaches its conclusion that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is neutral on its face. Clearly, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), by its own terms (and, thus, facially), classifies property owners for disproportional tax treatment. The Court\u2019s inquiry should therefore be whether \u00a7 15-7-111(1), violates Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause on its face pursuant to the appropriate level of scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b666 Second, in holding that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), violates equal protection as applied to Roosevelt and other similarly situated Class Four property owners, the majority misapplies equal protection jurisprudence. A law violates equal protection \u201cas applied\u201d or \u201cin its application\u201d when \u201cthe law either shows no classification on its face or else indicates a classification which seems to be legitimate, but those persons challenging the legislation claim that the governmental officials who administer the law are applying it with different degrees of severity to different groups of persons who are described by some suspect trait.\u201d Rotunda, Nowak &amp; Young, <em>Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 18.4 (1986). <em>See also Cutone v. Anaconda Deer Lodge </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 515, 524, 610 P.2d 691, 697 (stating that a challenge to a statute as violating equal protection as applied arises in cases in which a statute which is constitutionally valid on its face is administered in an arbitrary and discriminatory fashion)(citing <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins </em>(1886), 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220). In simpler terms, a statute violates equal protection \u201cas applied\u201d or \u201cin its application\u201d when the statute is neutral on its face but is being enforced in a disproportionate, discriminatory, or unfair manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b667 Understandably, and for reasons I will discuss later, Roosevelt does not argue in the instant case that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), violates equal protection as applied. This theory in this case finds its genesis solely in the majority\u2019s determination to partially save an otherwise facially unconstitutional statute. In fact, no party in this litigation argued nor did the District Court hold that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b668 Rather, Roosevelt correctly argues that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), violates Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause on its face because the statute, by its own terms, results in three classes of Class Four property taxpayers and imposes disproportional tax burdens on two of the classes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Roosevelt does not argue, nor is there anything in the record that indicates, that the Department of Revenue is enforcing \u00a7 15-7-111(1), in a disproportionate or discriminatory manner. To the contrary, Roosevelt contends, and the statute, on its face, shows, that he is deprived of his right to equal protection of the law because the Department of Revenue is enforcing \u00a7 15- 7-111( 1), on all Class Four property owners in a similar maimer and as mandated by the statute. The result of enforcing \u00a7 15-7-111(1), on all Class Four property owners in a similar manner, however, is that two of the taxpayer classes which the statute creates pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden. This disproportional tax treatment does not result from a discriminatory enforcement policy on the part of the Department of Revenue. Rather, this disproportional tax treatment results because the statute, on its face, mandates an assessment method which causes two of three Class Four property owner classifications to pay a disproportionate share of Montana\u2019s tax burden. Thus, in holding that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), violates the Equal Protection Clause \u201cas applied\u201d or \u201cin its application,\u201d the majority has misconstrued equal protection clause jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b669 Moreover, I cannot agree that the majority needs \u201cto speculate about the constitutionality of the statute as applied to other classes of taxpayers\u201d to hold that it violates equal protection on its face. As noted above, it is as clear to the majority as it was to the District Court that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), results in three classes of Class Four property owners and the taxpayers in two of these classes pay a disproportional share of Montana\u2019s tax burden. The issue in the instant case is not whether the majority should try to \u201canticipate every conceivable fact situation to which the 1997 phase-in provision at issue could be applied and whether that statute is rationally related to the state\u2019s objective under those circumstances.\u201d Rather, the issue in the instant case is whether, under the appropriate level of scrutiny, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), when enforced pursuant to its mandates, violates Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause because it causes similarly situated taxpayers to pay a disproportional share of the tax burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b670 Furthermore, in rewriting the statute, the majority improperly inserts a severability clause into \u00a7 15-7-111(1). This Court has repeatedly held that when an unconstitutional provision of a statute is stricken and rejected, the statute is invalid in its entirety if such provision is \u201cnecessary to the integrity of the statute, or was an inducement to its enactment.\u201d Thus, when an unconstitutional portion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>statute is eliminated, the remainder of the statute may stand only if it is \u201ccomplete in itself and capable of being executed in accordance with apparent legislative intent.\u201d <em>Newville v. State Dept. of Family Services </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 237, 255, 883 P.2d 793, 804 (citing <em>Montana Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Greely </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 378, 399, 632 P.2d 300, 311). <em>See also White v. State </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 81, 759 P.2d 971 (holding that the Science and Technology Development Board Seed Capital Bond Act was void in its entirety because it suffered from a constitutional defect in its core provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b671 By holding that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is unconstitutional only as applied to Roosevelt and similarly situated property owners, the majority has upset whatever balance there was in this statute. The State is still losing revenue from those taxpayers whose property increased in value in 1997, but there is no corresponding gain in revenue from those taxpayers whose property decreased in value in 1997. The majority has effectively destroyed the statutory scheme. By excising that portion of the statute that applies to Roosevelt and similarly situated property owners, the statute is not \u201ccomplete in itself,\u201d nor is it \u201ccapable of being executed in accordance with apparent legislative intent.\u201d What remains and will be enforced under the majority opinion will not be the same statutory scheme as the Legislature intended in the original enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b672 The majority appears to be acting under the mistaken impression that the act amending \u00a7 15-7-111(1) (Senate Bill 195, Ch. 463, Laws of Montana (1997)), contained a \u201cseverability clause\u201d similar to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">If a part of this act is invalid, all valid parts that are severable from the invalid part remain in effect. If a part of this act is invalid in one or more of its applications, the part remains in effect in all valid applications that are severable from the invalid applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">We noted in <em>Greely </em>that the inclusion of a \u201cseverability clause\u201d in an act is an indication that the drafters and the voters desired that the judicial policy of severability be applied. <em>Greely, </em>193 Mont. at 399, 632 P.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b673 However, S.B. 195 did not contain a severability clause. More importantly, the failure to include a severability clause in S.B. 195 was not an oversight on the part of the Legislature. An amendment to S.B. 195 containing a severability clause was proposed early on in the discussions concerning that bill, but that amendment was voted down by members of the Senate Taxation Committee. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>noted in <em>Sheehy v. Public Employees Retirement Div. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 129, 864 P.2d 762, that absent a severability clause, the presumption \u201cis against the mutilation of a statute, and that the legislature would not have enacted it except in its entirety.\u201d <em>Sheehy, </em>262 Mont. at 142, 864 P.2d at 770 (quoting <em>State v. Holmes </em>(1935), 100 Mont. 256, 291, 47 P.2d 624, 636). Nevertheless, this Court has held that even acts containing severability clauses may be voided in toto if they contain constitutional defects in their core provisions. <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 93, 759 P.2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b674 Section 15-7-111(1), contains just such constitutional defects in its core provisions. Moreover, by refusing to include a severability clause in the act amending \u00a7 15-7-111(1), the Legislature\u2019s intent is clear \u2014 \u00a7 15-7-111(1), would not have been enacted except in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b675 The majority asserts that in enacting S.B. 195, the Legislature was concerned about a \u201cwindfall in revenue\u201d based on increased property values. However, nowhere in the legislative history of S.B. 195 is there a discussion of a windfall in revenue. In addition, the majority contends that in his January 24, 1997 testimony before the Senate Committee on Taxation on S.B. 195, Mick Robinson, representing the Governor\u2019s Office, pointed to a concern that general increases in the value of real property throughout the State of Montana would produce more revenue to the state than was necessary. The majority mischaracterizes Robinson\u2019s testimony. Robinson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">In the construction of the budget that was presented to this legislature, this administration chose to address the impact of reappraisal by reducing the statewide mills. This course was chosen for a couple of reasons. First, the variable that is normally available to governments when setting their budgets is the number of mills that are required to adequately fund expenditures. Second, the Montana Tax Policy Task Force, which was appointed jointly by the 1995 Legislature and the Governor, spent almost a year studying this very reappraisal issue and recommended an approach requiring all governments to reduce the number of mills as the appropriate response to reappraisal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, Robinson was pointing out that the statewide mills would be reduced in response to reappraisal thereby preventing the state from obtaining more revenue than was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00b676 Moreover, even if, <em>arguendo, </em>it was the Legislature\u2019s intention to avoid a windfall in revenue, one can hardly envision a more bizarre and circuitous way of solving this problem than the tax scheme set out in S.B. 195. Rather than enacting a statute resulting in three classes of taxpayers, two of which are required, unconstitutionally, to pay a disproportionate share of their Class Four property tax burden, it would have been a simple matter just to reduce the tax rate for all taxpayers to bring down anticipated revenue or, if too much revenue was received, refund a portion of it on a pro-rata basis to all property tax payers.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b677 Indeed, it is ironic that the majority \u2014 which gives testament to the \u201cprinciple of judicial restraint\u201d \u2014 takes it upon itself to effectively rewrite \u00a7 15-7-111(1), so that Roosevelt and other similarly situated Class Four property owners are assessed at the actual 1997 market value of their property for the purpose of calculating their 1997 property taxes while the other Class Four property owners are assessed based on the scheme enacted by the 1997 Legislature. In rewriting the statute, the majority has amended \u00a7 15-7-111(1), so that two of the three classes of Class Four property owners pay tax based on the assessed 1997 market value of their property while the remaining group pays tax on the amount below the assessed 1997 market value of their property. Thus, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), as rewritten, is no more constitutional than it was before. Now, one class of Class Four property owners will still pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, albeit a disproportionally low amount. Since a tax system which causes certain taxpayers to bear a disproportionate share of Montana\u2019s tax burden violates the taxpayers\u2019 right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Montana\u2019s Constitution, \u00a7 15-7-111(1), as amended by the majority, still violates Montana\u2019s Equal Protection Clause because there is not even a rational basis to tax two classes of Class Four property owners at the assessed market value of their property while taxing the remaining class at less than the assessed market value of their property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the majority\u2019s amendment places Roosevelt in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>different class of Class Four property owners, it is apparent that, at the majority\u2019s invitation, Roosevelt can now sue as to the constitutionality of \u00a7 15-7-111(1), as amended by the majority, as it applies to the remaining two classes of Class Four property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b678 Furthermore, the majority\u2019s rewrite of \u00a7 15-7-111(1), fails to solve another sort of unconstitutional classification inherent in the statutory scheme. Besides resulting in three classes of taxpayers with two classes paying a disproportionate share of the tax burden, the statute, originally, and as now rewritten, still decrees that there will be one class of taxpayers who must pay the full amount of their tax burden immediately (i.e., those whose property neither depreciated nor appreciated in value and those, now, whose property depreciated in value) and a second class of taxpayers who will not bear the full burden of their property taxes for 50 years (i.e., those whose property appreciated in value). This, obviously, is one of the reasons Roosevelt did not argue that the statute was unconstitutional as applied. The majority\u2019s rewrite gives him only half a loaf \u2014 he now gets to pay his entire property tax on the depreciated value of his property while his neighbors whose property value appreciated do not have to pay their entire property tax burden for 50 years. The majority has simply substituted one form of unconstitutional statute for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b679 In sum, I agree with the majority that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), is notrationally related to a legitimate state interest and therefore that it is unnecessary to address Roosevelt\u2019s argument that we should apply middle-tier scrutiny. It is, however, the function of the Legislature, not this Court, to write the tax laws for this State. If the Legislature cannot get it right \u2014 and it did not in its enactment of S.B. 195 \u2014 it is not the function of this Court to act as a super-legislature to rewrite the tax laws to achieve what may be perceived as a more politically acceptable result. <em>See Cutone, </em>187 Mont. at 524, 610 P.2d at 697. In its determination to take upon itself the function of the Legislature in rewriting \u00a7 15-7-111(1), the majority has violated the very principles of judicial restraint that it pans in its opinion; it has ignored the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ture\u2019s obvious intent to enact S.B. 195 as a package (albeit an unconstitutional one) without the possibility of severing parts of the package; it has read into the statute a severability clause in violation of \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; it has misapplied equal protection jurisprudence; and it has substituted one form of unconstitutional statute for another, thus inviting still more litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b680 In his January 13,1999 State of the State Address, Governor Racicot, referring to this State\u2019s \u201cantiquated tax system\u201d observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">our state\u2019s tax system is unfair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">It must be changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Our homeowners ... and landowners must be freed from the unfair burdens that have, over the years, been heaped on their financial shoulders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">It is truly unfortunate that this Court in its determination to partially save a facially unconstitutional property tax scheme has only exacerbated and prolonged the unfairness which the Governor correctly observes. Moreover, it is unfortunate that this Court, rather than the Legislature, decided that it was the governmental entity responsible for making the changes to Montana\u2019s property tax system.</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">\u00b681 I would hold that \u00a7 15-7-111(1), violates Roosevelt\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws under Montana\u2019s Constitution on its face. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s decision to limit the Court\u2019s holding to Roosevelt and other similarly situated Class Four property owners. Accordingly, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b682 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">2. The majority uses the phrase \u201cresults in\u201d in an apparent attempt to buttress its conclusion that \u00a715-7-111(1), is not facially unconstitutional. I make two observations in this regard. First, neither the District Court nor Roosevelt used this terminology. However, as the majority notes, the trial court had no problem in discerning the classifying effects of the statute from its plain language. Second, the meaning of \u201cresults in\u201d belies the majority\u2019s attempt to read facial unconstitutionality out of the statute by use of this phrase. \u201cResults in\u201d means \u201cto be the cause of: bring, bring about, bring on, cause, effect, effectuate, generate, induce, ingenerate, lead to, make, occasion, secure, set off, stir (up), touch off, trigger, bring to pass, or give rise to.\u201d <em>Rogets 11, The New Thesaurus, </em>834 (3d ed. 1995). The majority\u2019s use of this phrase results in only semantical distinctions which are without substantive difference. The plain language of the statute facially creates or \u201cresults in\u201d three classes of taxpayers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-5\">. The Department of Revenue could argue that there is a rational basis for taxing taxpayers whose property increased in value from 1996 to 1997 based on a value less than the assessed 1997 market value of their property by analogizing to the rational basis grounds set out in <em>Nordlinger. </em>However, as the majority correctly points out, Montana does not have an \u201cacquisition value\u201d system of taxation which was at issue in <em>Nordlinger. Thus, Nordlinger </em>is not controlling. Moreover, a tax system which undervalues property in the same class as that class is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>by state law violates an individual\u2019s right to equal protection of the law. <em>Nordlinger, </em>505 U.S. at 32, 112 S.Ct. at 2343 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Allegheny, </em>488 U.S. at 345, 109 S.Ct. at 639). Furthermore, equal protection clause jurisprudence mandates that courts look to whether the legislative enactment is rationally related to a legitimate government interest rather than whether a judicial amendment to a statute is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\">4.
