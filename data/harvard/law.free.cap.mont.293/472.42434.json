Anderson appeals his sentence on the grounds that the sentencing court improperly relied upon a psychosexual evaluation which included the results of a polygraph test. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\n<em>ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court err in denying Anderson\u2019s motion to have a new psychosexual evaluation performed without the use of a polygraph test?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b63 2. Did the State breach its plea agreement with Anderson?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u00b64 In May 1997, Anderson was charged with and pled guilty to a charge of incest in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. As part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Anderson was required to and did voluntarily submit to a psychosexual evaluation by Dr. Robert C. Bakko (Dr. Bakko).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">\u00b65 As part of his evaluation, Dr. Bakko conducted a polygraph test on Anderson. Dr. Bakko testified before the District Court that he had considered the results of this test in preparing his presentence sexual offender evaluation. The adult probation and parole officer who prepared Anderson\u2019s presentence investigation testified that she had consulted Anderson\u2019s psychosexual evaluation in making her sentencing recommendations. Dr. Bakko\u2019s evaluation was also reviewed by the District Court prior to Anderson\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">\u00b66 Anderson moved for a continuance of the sentencing hearing so that a new psychosexual evaluation could be performed without the use of a polygraph test. The District Court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">\u00b67 According to the terms of Anderson\u2019s plea agreement, the State was not bound by the plea agreement if the results of the evaluation indicated Anderson was a Level 3 sexual offender as defined by \u00a7 46-23-509, MCA. A Level 3 offender is one for whom the risk of a repeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>sexual offense is high, there is a threat to public safety, and the evaluator believes that the offender is a sexually violent predator. Dr. Bakko testified that although Anderson was sexually violent, he did not meet the profile of a sexual predator. Dr. Bakko nevertheless categorized Anderson as a Level 3 offender in his presentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b68 Based on Dr. Bakko\u2019s assessment of Anderson as a Level 3 offender, the State initially declined to abide by the terms of the plea agreement. However, after further inquiry by the court, the State recommended that Anderson be sentenced according to the plea agreement. The District Court nevertheless disregarded the State\u2019s sentencing recommendations in the plea agreement and sentenced Anderson to ten years at the Montana State Prison. Anderson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in denying Anderson\u2019s motion to have a new psychosexual evaluation performed without the use of a polygraph test?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b610 Our standard of review of discretionary trial administration rulings is whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 475, 803 P.2d 601, 603-604. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b6 11 Anderson argues that the District Court abused its discretion in not granting his motion to continue the sentencing hearing so that a new evaluation could be performed without the use of a polygraph test. The State argues that it was not error for the District Court to deny Anderson\u2019s motion because the results of Anderson\u2019s polygraph test were not introduced as evidence at the hearing, but rather were used only as an interpretative tool during the course of Dr. Bakko\u2019s evaluation. In the alternative, the State argues that since Anderson was the party who introduced the psychosexual evaluation into evidence, Anderson cannot now complain of its consideration by the District Court for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b612  We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for a continuance so that a new evaluation could be performed without the use of a polygraph. Polygraph evidence may not be used in any proceeding in a court of law in Montana. <em>State v. Staat </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 291, 293, 811 P.2d 1261, 1262. This prohibition encompasses the use of polygraph results during sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ing. <em>State v. Hensley </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 478, 483, 821 P.2d 1029, 1032. This prohibition also encompasses the introduction of polygraph results into evidence via a court-ordered sex offender evaluation. <em>In re Marriage of Njos </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 54, 61, 889 P.2d 1192, 1196. In addition to precluding the direct introduction of the results of a polygraph test, it is the law in Montana that any evidence which would otherwise be admissible may be rendered inadmissible where a polygraph is used in the production of or for the purpose of influencing the outcome of such evidence. <em>See State v. Craig </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 240, 242-43, 864 P.2d 1240, 1242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b613 We reject the State\u2019s argument that Anderson is precluded from appealing the introduction of the polygraph results via the psychosexual evaluation performed by Dr. Bakko on the grounds that it was Anderson who placed the evaluation into evidence at,the sentencing hearing. We do so because the record reveals that the District Court had reviewed the evaluation prior to the hearing, and the presentence investigation also had included reference to the evaluation. The evaluation, therefore, was already in evidence insofar as its contents had been consulted for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b6 14 When we held in <em>State v. Staat </em>that polygraph results may not be used in <em>any </em>proceeding in a court of law in Montana, it was made clear that this plain, unambiguous statement needed no further explanation. If a finder of fact, judge, hearing officer, evaluator or any other person in a similar position directly or indirectly allows polygraph results to be made a part of the review leading to a finding or recommendation in a court proceeding, no matter how careful such person may be in not disclosing such fact, the entire review leading to the finding, decision or recommendation is tainted and may not be introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b6 15 Because we find the District Court\u2019s error with regard to the denial of Anderson\u2019s motion for a new psychosexual evaluation to be a dispositive issue on appeal, we decline to address Anderson\u2019s second issue with regard to the breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b6 16 We reverse and remand this case to the District Court with the instruction that a new psychosexual evaluation of Anderson be performed without the use of a polygraph test and that a new presentence investigation be prepared in light of the results of the new psychosexual evaluation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-8\">JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
