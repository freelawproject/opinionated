We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the Youth Court erred in denying R.L.S.\u2019s motion to dismiss five felony assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b63 The State of Montana (State) filed a petition in the Youth Court alleging that R.L.S. was a delinquent youth because he committed five counts of felony assault, by purposely or knowingly causing reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon, and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Insofar as it related to the felony assaults, the affidavit in support of the petition stated that R.L.S. placed a device which appeared to be a bomb under a sink in a restroom of the Castle Rock Middle School, and that five people saw the device, believed it to be a bomb and were frightened or concerned for their safety. The local bomb squad disposed of the device, which, according to R.L.S., was a fake bomb intended as a practical joke.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">\u00b64 At his initial appearance on the petition, R.L.S. admitted having committed disorderly conduct and denied having committed the felony assaults. He subsequently moved the Youth Court to dismiss the felony assault charges and the court denied the motion. R.L.S. then entered into a plea agreement with the State pursuant to which he agreed to admit one felony assault offense and reserved the right to appeal the Youth Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss; the State agreed to move to dismiss the remaining four felony assault charges and recommend probation. The Youth Court subsequently accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>R.L.S.\u2019s admission of one felony assault, dismissed the remaining felony assault charges and adjudicated R.L.S. a delinquent youth. The court ordered that R.L.S. be placed on probation for 180 days, subject to specified conditions. Pursuant to his reservation of his right to appeal under \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, R.L.S. appeals from the Youth Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the five felony assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b65 Did the Youth Court err in denying R.L.S.\u2019s motion to dismiss the five felony assault charges?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b66 R.L.S. asserted that the felony assault charges on which the State\u2019s petition alleging that he was a delinquent youth was based should be dismissed because the facts alleged in the petition did not constitute the offense of felony assault set forth in \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA. Specifically, he argued that the petition failed to allege that the device placed under the restroom sink was a \u201cweapon\u201d \u2014 defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, as an article or instrument \u201creadily capable of being used to produce death or serious bodily injury\u201d \u2014 because the petition alleged only that the device \u201cappeared to be\u201d a bomb. R.L.S. also argued that, because he never threatened anyone with the device and the device was not in his possession when people saw it, the petition failed to allege that he \u201cused\u201d a weapon. The Youth Court denied R.L.S.\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the device must be taken as it appears to be and is a weapon under the statute if it looks readily capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. R.L.S. asserts that the Youth Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss involves a question of law. <em>State v. Koehn, </em>1998 MT 234, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 87, \u00b6 9, 966 P.2d 143, \u00b6 9. We review conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Koehn, </em>\u00b6 9. R.L.S. reiterates on appeal both arguments he advanced in the Youth Court in support of his motion to dismiss. We conclude that his argument regarding whether a fake bomb meets the statutory definition of a weapon is dispositive and, consequently, do not address his argument regarding whether the petition adequately alleged his \u201cuse\u201d of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b68 In determining whether a device which appears to be a bomb, but is not an actual bomb, is a weapon for purposes of the offense of felony assault, we look first to the definition of \u201cweapon\u201d contained in \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA. In construing that statutory definition, our role is \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The intent of the Legislature is to be pursued and we determine that intent by interpreting the plain meaning of the language used by the Legislature. <em>State v. Zabawa </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 307, 313, 928 P.2d 151, 155 (citations omitted). The statutory language must be reasonably and logically interpreted and words given their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>Gallatin County v. Montana Eighteenth Jud. Dist. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 33, 40, 930 P.2d 680, 685 (citations omitted). \u201cWhere the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Zabawa, </em>279 Mont. at 313, 928 P.2d at 155 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b69 The State\u2019s petition alleged that R.L.S. committed five counts of felony assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA, by purposely or knowingly causing \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon.\u201d Section 45-2-101(76), MCA, defines \u201cweapon\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">any instrument, article, or substance that, regardless of its primary function, is readily capable of being used to produce death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The plain meaning of the word \u201creadily\u201d is \u201ceasily.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 1504 (3rd ed. 1992). \u201cCapable\u201d is defined as \u201cDbjaving capacity or ability... able... [hjaving the ability required for a specific task____\u2019\u2019The American Heritage Dictionary 283 (3rd ed. 1992). Thus, a device is a weapon under the plain meaning of \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, if it is easily able to produce death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b610 Here, the State\u2019s petition alleged that the device R.L.S. placed under the sink \u201cappeared to be a bomb.\u201d Nothing in the petition indicates that the device actually was a bomb capable of detonating or otherwise producing death or serious bodily injury. A device which only \u201cappears to be\u201d a bomb is not easily able to \u2014 or, in the words of the statute, \u201creadily capable of\u201d \u2014 producing death or serious bodily injury. As a result, such a device is not a weapon as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\u00b611 The State concedes that the bomb squad destroyed the device before ascertaining whether it was an actual bomb. The State contends, however, that the Youth Court correctly determined that the definition of \u201cweapon\u201d must be read from the victim\u2019s perspective, pursuant to which a device meets the \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, definition of \u201cweapon\u201d if it appears and is perceived to be capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury, regardless of whether the device is capable of inflicting such injury. Thus, the State argues that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the device at issue here appeared to be a bomb and the people who observed it thought it was a bomb, the device constituted a threat of death or serious bodily injury and was a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b612 The problem with the State\u2019s position is that it is at odds with the plain language of \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA. As discussed above, the statute sets forth an objective standard for determining whether an object is a weapon: if the object is readily capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, it is a weapon. The statutory definition of weapon simply is not susceptible to any reasonable interpretation that would include a victim\u2019s subjective view of the device at issue. To adopt the State\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, would require us to ignore our proper role in interpreting statutes and insert the language \u201cappears to be\u201d before the term \u201creadily capable\u201d in the statute. It is not our function to insert language into a statute which has not been placed there by the Legislature. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b6 13 The State also argues, however, that the statutory definition of weapon must be read in conjunction with the \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA, definition of felony assault applicable in this case. It contends that, because the gravamen of the felony assault statute is the subjective \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of the victim, a device constitutes a weapon if the victim is reasonably apprehensive that the device is a weapon. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b614  The elements of the offense of felony assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA, are (1) purposely or knowingly, (2) causing reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another, (3) by use of a weapon. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ottwell </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 150, 156, 779 P.2d <em>500, 503; State v. Brown </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 453, 456, 781 P.2d 281, 283-84. The reasonable apprehension of the victim pertains to whether the victim reasonably believes he or she will be seriously bodily injured, not whether he or she subjectively believes that the device or instrument used by the assailant is actually a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b615 Furthermore, the cases the State advances in support of its argument in this regard are inapplicable to the issue before us. The State first relies on <em>State v. Herron </em>(1892), 12 Mont. 230, 29 P. 819, for the proposition that the prosecution need not prove the device at issue in a felony assault charge is capable of inflicting injury as long as the victim perceives it to be capable of inflicting injury. <em>In Herron, </em>we held that, where the prosecution established that the defendant pointed a rifle at \u2014 and threatened to shoot \u2014 the victim, the prosecution was not required to introduce evidence that the rifle was actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>loaded with ammunition in order to prove the offense of attempted assault with a deadly weapon. Rather, the fact that the rifle was not loaded was a matter to be raised as a defense to the charge. <em>Herron, </em>12 Mont. at 235, 29 P. at 821. In that regard, we need only observe that <em>Herron </em>did not interpret any statutory definition of \u201cweapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b616 Neither is <em>State v. Weinberger </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 110, 671 P.2d 567, applicable here. In <em>Weinberger, </em>when addressing whether the evidence presented at trial established the elements of aggravated assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA, we assumed that the chain used by the defendant was a weapon because neither party disputed that issue. <em>Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. at 129, 671 P.2d at 577. Again, we did not address or interpret the \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, definition of \u201cweapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b6 17 Similarly, the State\u2019s reliance on federal cases holding that unloaded guns, toy guns and fake bombs are dangerous weapons under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(b) is misplaced. None of the cited cases addressed a statutory definition of \u201cweapon,\u201d much less a definition similar or identical to \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA. <em>See McLaughlin v. United States </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 16, 106 S.Ct. 1677, 90 L.Ed.2d 15; <em>United States v. Hamrick </em>(4th Cir. 1995), 43 F.3d 877; <em>United States v. Perry </em>(6th Cir. 1993), 991 F.2d 304; <em>United States v. Cannon </em>(1st Cir. 1990), 903 F.2d 849; <em>United States v. Spedalieri </em>(10th Cir. 1990), 910 F.2d 707; <em>United States v. Martinez-Jimenez </em>(9th Cir. 1989), 864 F.2d 664; <em>United States v. Marx </em>(10th Cir. 1973), 485 F.2d 1179; <em>United States v. Cooper </em>(5th Cir. 1972), 462 F.2d 1343. As a result, the federal cases also are inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b618  We conclude that the \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, definition of \u201cweapon\u201d clearly and unambiguously requires that the device at issue actually be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. We further conclude that the petition filed against R.L.S. in this case, having alleged only that the device which R.L.S. placed under the sink \u201cappeared to be\u201d a bomb, failed to allege that R.L.S. used a weapon and, thus, failed to state facts constituting the offense of felony assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA. We hold, therefore, that the District Court erred in denying R.L.S.\u2019s motion to dismiss the five felony assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
