We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\n<em>ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err in dismissing Bruce\u2019s petition for postconviction relief on the grounds that Bruce\u2019s assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel did not state a claim entitling him to relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b63 In 1993, the State of Montana (State) charged Bruce with deliberate homicide for the death of Alice Goodrich (Alice) and aggravated assault for the injury of Jim Enger (Jim). The incident which gave rise to the charges occurred at Bruce\u2019s home between Plains and Thompson Falls in Sanders County, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b64 Bruce pled not guilty to the charges and asserted the defenses of justifiable use of force and defense of an occupied structure. The case was tried to a jury in 1994, and Jim, Bruce\u2019s wife Gabby, and Reece Cobeen (Reece), a friend of Jim and Alice who also was present during the incident, were among those who testified. The jury found Bruce guilty of both charges, and the District Court sentenced him to lengthy and consecutive terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b65 Bruce appealed and new counsel was appointed for purposes of the appeal. Two issues were raised on appeal: 1) whether the District Court erred in refusing Bruce\u2019s proposed jury instruction on the justifiable use of force in defense of an occupied structure; and 2) whether Bruce was denied effective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Hagen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 432, 434, 903 P.2d 1381, 1386. The ineffective assistance of counsel issue was predicated on four alleged failings by trial counsel: failure to object to a reference by the prosecution during voir dire; failure to request an instruction on Bruce\u2019s right to rely on appearances when asserting the defense of justifiable use of force; failure to request an instruction on negligent homicide as a lesser offense; and failure to call a witness whose testimony tended to impeach the credibility and accuracy of Reece\u2019s testimony. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440-44, 903 P.2d at 1386-88. We affirmed the District Court on all issues and claims presented on appeal. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 445, 903 P.2d at 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b66 Bruce filed the petition for postconviction relief presently before us in April of 1997. He raised nine claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, asserting that none of them could have been raised on direct appeal and all were properly raised in his petition for postconviction relief because they required an evidentiary hearing. Bruce also contended that appellate counsel was ineffective in raising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>a particular claim on appeal. Finally, Bruce alleged that, in the event some or all of the claims relating to trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance should have been raised on direct appeal and were now barred as a result of not being raised at that time, his appellate counsel had provided ineffective assistance in failing to present significant and obvious issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b67 The State responded that six of Bruce\u2019s claims were procedurally barred under \u00a7 46- 21-105(2), MCA (1995), because they could have been raised on direct appeal. The State also contended that one of the claims was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>because it had been decided adversely to Bruce in his direct appeal. Finally, the State argued that three of Bruce\u2019s claims were not supported by the record or under the law and could be decided on the merits without the need for an evidentiary hearing. Bruce replied to the State\u2019s memorandum opposing his petition and submitted a number of affidavits. He contended, among other things, that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b68 The District Court did not hold a hearing. In its order dismissing Bruce\u2019s petition, the District Court observed that Bruce\u2019s sole claim for relief was ineffective assistance of counsel and determined that \u201c[t]hat issue was raised by Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel and decided by the Montana Supreme Court in a specific holding that Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel.\u201d On that basis, and without further explanation or rationale, the District Court concluded that Bruce\u2019s \u201cadequate remedy of appeal\u201d had been pursued and his postconviction relief petition \u201cfails to state a claim entitling him to relief as a matter of law.\u201d Bruce appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in dismissing Bruce\u2019s petition for postconviction relief on the grounds that Bruce\u2019s assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel did not state a claim entitling him to relief?</p>\n<p id=\"At\">\u00b610 As set forth above, all of the claims contained in Bruce\u2019s petition for postconviction relief are premised on alleged denials of effective assistance of counsel. In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the merits on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, Montana courts apply the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440, 903 P.2d at 1386; Kills <em>on Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 49, 901 P.2d 1368, 1379. Under that test, the petitioner must show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440, 903 P.2d at 1386 (citations omitted). Moreover, the <em>Strickland </em>test applies to claims of alleged ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel. <em>See, e.g., Hans v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 379, 408, 942 P.2d 674, 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b611 Before reaching the merits of ineffective assistance claims in postconviction relief proceedings, however, it often is necessary to determine whether such claims are properly before the court or whether they are procedurally barred. Such claims may be barred by either \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), or the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b612  Section 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), provides that grounds for relief which reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised thereafter in a petition for postconviction relief. In that regard, where ineffective assistance of counsel claims are based on facts of record in the underlying case, they must be raised in the direct appeal; conversely, where the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, those claims must be raised by petition for postconviction relief. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bromgard </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 20, 23, 901 P.2d 611, 613 (citation omitted); <em>Petition of Evans </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 172, 173, 819 P.2d 156, 157 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b613 The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>also may pose a procedural bar to postconviction relief. Under that doctrine, claims which were raised on direct appeal are barred from being raised again in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Baker </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 273, 281, 901 P.2d 54, 59. Furthermore, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is similar in effect to \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), in that it bars postconviction claims which \u201ccould have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Beach v. Day </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 370, 373, 913 P.2d 622, 624 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b614 In the present case, the District Court\u2019s denial of Bruce\u2019s petition for postconviction relief for failure to state a claim apparently was based on the court\u2019s conclusion that Bruce\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims had been raised and resolved on direct appeal and were thereby barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief, we will not overturn the court\u2019s legal conclusions if its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Wagner v. State </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 26, 28, 889 P.2d 1189, 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b6 15  Before turning to the individual claims contained in Bruce\u2019s petition, we conclude that the District Court erred in part by \u201cpaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ing with too broad a brush.\u201d While it is clear that Bruce raised several specific ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims in his direct appeal (see <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440-44, 903 P.2d at 1386-88), it is equally clear that not all of the ineffective assistance claims contained in his postconviction relief petition were raised in \u2014 and resolved during \u2014 the appeal. Raising record-based ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal does not foreclose raising non record-based claims via petition for postconviction relief. Indeed, only those ineffective assistance claims which are essentially record-based can be raised on direct appeal; where allegations of ineffective assistance cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, such claims can only be raised in a postconviction proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Bromgard, </em>273 Mont. at 23, 901 P.2d at <em>613; Evans, </em>250 Mont. at 173, 819 P.2d at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b616  Thus, the District Court erred in concluding that all of Bruce\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>merely because some ineffective assistance claims were raised and resolved on direct appeal. Each claim must be analyzed to determine if it is barred. Therefore, with the controlling principles regarding procedural bars to postconviction relief claims in mind, we turn to the application of those principles in order to determine which, if any, of Bruce\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>Claim B(l)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b617 Bruce contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by moving in open court for a mental health examination of Bruce and, thereafter, in the manner in which counsel disseminated those mental health evaluations to the District Court and the prosecution. In particular, Bruce contends that the procedure employed by trial counsel in obtaining the examinations resulted in the violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as various provisions of the Montana Constitution. The State responds that this claim is procedurally barred because the underlying facts are documented in the record. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b618 The facts surrounding Bruce\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions in requesting and disseminating the results of Bruce\u2019s mental health evaluations are of record. Moreover, Bruce\u2019s contention that trial counsel\u2019s actions were deficient rests on legal precedent which, according to Bruce, required counsel to manage these evaluations in a procedurally differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>ent manner as a matter of law. We conclude, therefore, that Claim B(l) is a claim which could have been raised on direct appeal and is procedurally barred from consideration in Bruce\u2019s postconviction proceeding by both \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), and the doctrine of <em>res judicata. See Beach, </em>275 Mont. at 373, 913 P.2d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\n<em>Claims B(2)(a), B(2)(b), andB(2)(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b619 In Claims (B)(2)(a), (B)(2)(b), and (B)(2)(c), Bruce contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the State\u2019s introduction of medical reports which characterized the cause of death as homicide; failing to object to comments by the prosecution relating to invocation of the spousal privilege by Bruce\u2019s wife; and failing to object to the prosecution\u2019s inappropriate elicitation of opinion testimony from one witness as to the credibility of another witness. He argues that counsel\u2019s failure to object to these matters at trial constitutes an act of omission, and relies on <em>Fitzpatrick v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 310, 638 P.2d 1002, for the proposition that claims involving acts of omission normally require an evidentiary hearing and, as a result, are properly brought in a postconviction proceeding. The State responds that these claims are record-based, could have been raised on direct appeal and, therefore, are procedurally barred. The State is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b620  The absence of an objection by counsel \u2014 that is, a failure to object \u2014 is a fact easily documented by reviewing the record, and we have decided claims of this kind on direct appeal on numerous occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Campbell </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 236, 250, 924 P.2d 1304, 1313; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 194, 197-99, 864 P.2d 787, 789; <em>State v. Schoffner </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 260, 268, 811 P.2d 548, 553; <em>State v. Probert </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 476, 481, 719 P.2d 783, 786. Furthermore, we recently clarified that a claim of ineffective assistance predicated upon trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to matters during trial \u201ccan be decided on the basis of the record\u201d and could have been raised on direct appeal. <em>See Petition of Hans, </em>1998 MT 7, \u00b6 28 and \u00b6 42, 288 Mont. 168, 958 P.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b621 Bruce is correct in arguing that some acts of omission are not record-based, and a claim based on an omission which does not appear of record could not be raised on direct appeal and properly would be brought in a postconviction proceeding. Indeed, <em>Fitzpatrick </em>involved claims that counsel \u201cfailed to adequately investigate and prepare a defense, and was unfamiliar with critical areas of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>194 Mont. at 318, 638 P.2d at 1007. While not addressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>a procedural bar issue regarding those claims, we essentially determined that those acts of omission were not record-based. <em>See Fitzpatrick, </em>194 Mont. at 318, 638 P.2d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b622 It is clear that, in the ordinary case, a review of the record will not establish such matters as whether counsel failed to investigate. It is equally clear that failures to object are, as we determined in <em>Petition of Hans, </em>record-based. Thus, <em>Fitzpatrick </em>is inapplicable here, and Claims B(2)(a), B(2)(b), and B(2)(c) could have been raised on direct appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that these claims are procedurally barred from being raised in Bruce\u2019s petition for postconviction relief under both \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), and the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Claim B(3)(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b623 Bruce contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he elicited testimony from Deputy Sheriff Jonathan Hansen on cross-examination which vouched for the character of one of the State\u2019s primary witnesses. He argues that the vouching testimony \u201copened up the door for the State to bolster [the witness\u2019] character and credibility\u201d and prejudiced the jury\u2019s ability to impartially gauge the credibility of the witness. The State responds that \u201cthe factual basis for this charge comes solely from the trial record. Hagen could have reasonably raised this issue on direct appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b624 Because Deputy Hansen\u2019s cross-examination testimony was fully set forth in the trial transcript and was part of the record on appeal, this claim could have been raised in Bruce\u2019s direct appeal; it was not. Therefore, we conclude that Claim (B)(3)(a) is procedurally barred by both \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), and the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\n<em>Claim B(3)(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b625 Bruce contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by improperly shifting the burden of proof with regard to his affirmative defense during closing argument. The State responds that this claim is record-based and should have been raised on direct appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u00b626 Counsel\u2019s closing argument was incorporated into the record on direct appeal as part of the trial transcript. Moreover, where an affirmative defense is raised in a criminal prosecution, the burden of proof on that issue is allocated as a matter of law. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 23, 290 Mont. 97, \u00b623, 966 P.2d 721, \u00b6 23. Therefore, whether counsel\u2019s closing argument improperly shifted the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>burden of proof could have been determined by applying the law to the record on appeal. As a result, we conclude that Claim B(3)(b) is barred under both \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), and the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\n<em>Claim B(4)(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b627 Bruce contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate or prepare testimony regarding Jim\u2019s reputation for turbulence, violence or trouble-making. The State responds that Claim B(4)(a) \u201ccan be disposed [sic] by referring to the trial record and is therefore procedurally barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b628  It is clear that a claim premised on trial counsel\u2019s failure to present testimony regarding Jim\u2019s reputation for violence surd trouble-making \u2014 like the claims discussed above regarding counsel\u2019s failure to object \u2014 could be determined from the record. However, that is not the question raised by Claim B(4)(a). The thrust of this claim is an alleged failure to investigate. As discussed above, facts surrounding an alleged failure to investigate necessarily do not appear of record in the ordinary case. For that reason, such allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel usually cannot be raised on direct appeal and are appropriately presented in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>See Fitzpatrick, </em>194 Mont. at 318, 638 P.2d at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b629 Here, there is no basis in the record from which to determine whether Bruce\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate \u2014 or present testimony \u2014 regarding Jim\u2019s reputation for violence. As a result, we conclude that Claim B(4)(a) could not have been raised on direct appeal, is not procedurally barred, and is properly raised in Bruce\u2019s postconviction petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\n<em>Claim B(4)(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\u00b630 Bruce contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate or present significant impeaching testimony against both Reece and Jim. We will consider these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\u00b631 With regard to Reece, Bruce argues that counsel failed to investigate and call certain witnesses, including Marvin Geyman and Bruce\u2019s two daughters, who allegedly would have testified that Reece had made prior inconsistent statements indicating he did not actually see the events of the shooting as they transpired. The State argues that trial counsel\u2019s failure to present testimony impeaching Reece was raised and resolved in Bruce\u2019s direct appeal and is barred from consideration in Bruce\u2019s postconviction petition under the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u00b632 We agree with the State that Bruce\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim with regard to counsel\u2019s failure to investigate or present testimony impeaching Reece was raised and resolved during Bruce\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 444, 903 P.2d at 1388. Therefore, this portion of Claim B(4)(b) is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. See Baker, </em>272 Mont. at 281, 901 P.2d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b633 With regard to Jim, Bruce argues that trial counsel failed to investigate or present evidence of Jim\u2019s prior criminal acts, his intoxication at the time of the shootings and the fact that, at the time Jim testified at Bruce\u2019s criminal trial, he had a civil lawsuit pending against Bruce and would have benefitted from Bruce\u2019s conviction. The State responds that the testimony at issue was either admitted at trial or is inadmissible under the rules of evidence and that, as a result, counsel\u2019s omissions did not unfairly prejudice Bruce\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b634 The State\u2019s argument goes to the merits of this claim. As discussed above, however, the District Court did not decide this issue on its merits, as the State implies. The District Court\u2019s sweeping dismissal of Bruce\u2019s postconviction petition was predicated on the application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to all claims, including the failure of trial counsel to investigate or present testimony potentially impeaching Jim. Therefore, we address only whether this claim is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b635 As was the case with Claim B(4)(a), this portion of Claim B(4)(b) \u2014 namely, counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate Jim\u2019s prior criminal acts and other information potentially impacting Jim\u2019s credibility as a witness \u2014 does not appear of record. Because such facts may be gleaned only from evidence outside the record, the issue could not have been raised on direct appeal and is properly the subject of a petition for postconviction relief. <em>See Petition of Hans, </em>\u00b6 28 and \u00b6 42. We conclude, therefore, that this portion of Claim B(4)(b) is not procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), or the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\n<em>Claim B(4)(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b636 Bruce\u2019s petition for postconviction relief also claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to interview and adequately prepare witnesses prior to trial. Specifically, Bruce contends that trial counsel never interviewed Reece, the State\u2019s primary witness, and failed to prepare the testimony of Bruce\u2019s wife, Gabby, and Dr. Paul Overland, an ophthalmologist who testified that Bruce suffered from poor vision as a result of macular degeneration of his retinas. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>State argued in the District Court that this claim was without merit under <em>Strickland </em>as no prejudice to Bruce\u2019s defense could be demonstrated. On appeal, the State argues that the claim is without merit, and additionally, that the claim is procedurally barred. As previously noted, the District Court did not resolve any of Bruce\u2019s claims on the merits; therefore we limit our review to the issue of whether this claim was procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b637 As was the case with Claims B(4)(a) and the portion of Claim B(4)(b) relating to Jim, Bruce\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective in interviewing and preparing witnesses for trial does not appear of record. Therefore, we conclude that Claim B(4)(c) could not have been raised on direct appeal and is not procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), or the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\n<em>Claim B(5)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b638 Bruce\u2019s final numbered claim is that his appellate counsel was ineffective in raising the issue of trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a lesser included offense instruction on direct appeal rather than in the more appropriate posture of a postconviction proceeding. The State responds that the claim regarding the instruction on the lesser offense was raised and resolved on Bruce\u2019s direct appeal and, therefore, is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>The State does not address Bruce\u2019s claim that appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in raising an issue on direct appeal that was more properly raised in a petition for postconviction relief. The District Court did not separately address this claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but merely dismissed it on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b639  Because Claim B(5) asserts the ineffectiveness of appellate, rather than trial, counsel it is a claim which necessarily could not have been raised on direct appeal. As a result, we conclude that Claim B(5) is not barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), or the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b640 We turn, then, to Bruce\u2019s final claim for postconviction relief. There, he asserted that, to the extent any of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims are now procedurally barred because they could have been raised on direct appeal but were not, appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Again, the District Court did not address this claim separately, concluding only that all of the claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u00b641 This claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel could not have been raised on direct appeal, because the procedural bar is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>sues raised and now resolved in this case simply did not exist at the time the appeal was filed. Therefore, we conclude that Bruce\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is not barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA (1995), or the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b642 In summary, we have concluded that Claims B(l), B(2)(a), B(2)(b), B(2)(c), B(3)(a), B(3)(b), and the portion of Claim B(4)(b) dealing with Reece could have been raised on direct appeal and are now procedurally barred. However, Claims B(4)(a), the portion of B(4)(b) dealing with Jim, B(4)(c), B(5), and both claims relating to appellate counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance could not have been raised on direct appeal and are, therefore, not procedurally barred. Accordingly, Claims B(4)(a), the portion of B(4)(b) dealing with Jim, B(4)(c), B(5), and the claims regarding ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are remanded to the District Court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b643 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
