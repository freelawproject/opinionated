Wendell (Appellant) appeals from the judgment entered by the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County, on its order granting summary judgment to State Farm Mutual Automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Insurance Company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Companies, and State Farm Insurance Companies (collectively State Farm). Oral argument was held on June 18, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented for review is whether the District Court erred in holding that Appellant was not entitled to uninsured motorist (UM) benefits because his injuries were not \u201ccaused by an accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an uninsured motor vehicle\u201d as required by the UM provision in Appellant\u2019s policies. We conclude that, in the context of UM coverage, an intentional act may be an \u201caccident,\u201d and that \u201caccident\u201d is to be viewed from the insured victim\u2019s perspective. We also conclude that the causal relationship test to be applied in determining whether the insured\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of an uninsured vehicle is whether the injuries originated from, or grew out of, or flowed from the use of the uninsured vehicle. Whether this required causal connection exists in a particular case is a mixed question of fact and law. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b63 The following facts are undisputed. On the morning of January 19, 1994, Thadius Morehead (Morehead) was driving his vehicle in Butte, Montana with three friends, Joseph Wandler, Eric Blom, and Robert Chenoweth. The men were driving around Butte with the stated purpose of picking fights at random. The men saw a male individual walking on Front Street, exited their vehicle, and chased the individual. The individual, a Safeway employee, managed to get away by running into Safeway. The individual immediately reported the incident and the license plate number of Morehead\u2019s vehicle to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"AFx\">\u00b64 Morehead and his friends returned to their vehicle and left the scene. Soon thereafter, the men came upon Appellant\u2019s vehicle on Harrison Avenue. Appellant was accompanied by a friend and the two were on their way to go fishing. Morehead followed closely behind Appellant and began flashing his lights and honking his horn in an effort to get Appellant\u2019s attention and cause him to pull over his car. Thinking the driver to be an acquaintance, Appellant pulled over into the Albertson\u2019s parking lot and stopped. Morehead followed and pulled up alongside Appellant. Joseph Wandler (Wandler) exited Morehead\u2019s vehicle and approached Appellant. When Appellant rolled down his window, Wandler punched Appellant in the face. When Appellant opened his door, he was dragged out of his vehicle and beaten, punched, and kicked by Wandler and one or more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>other men. The men continued to punch and kick Appellant while he was lying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b65 A bystander who observed the attack called the police, reported the incident, and described Morehead\u2019s vehicle. The police were en route to Safeway when they received the dispatch informing them of a similar incident at Albertson\u2019s involving the same vehicle that had caused trouble at Safeway. When the police arrived at Albertson\u2019s, Eric Blom and Robert Chenoweth started running. Morehead and Wandler were immediately placed under arrest. Blom and Chenoweth were later apprehended by the police and arrested. The four men were charged with violating several criminal laws of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b66 At all times pertinent to this action, Morehead maintained an automobile liability insurance policy with State Farm. Appellant asserted a claim under Morehead\u2019s policy for injuries Appellant suffered during the attack on January 19,1994. State Farm denied Appellant benefits stating that Morehead\u2019s policy did not cover injuries which were not caused by an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of Morehead\u2019s vehicle. Once Appellant was denied coverage under Morehead\u2019s policy, he asserted a claim for UM benefits under his own policies issued by State Farm. State Farm denied Appellant UM benefits for the same reason it denied benefits under Morehead\u2019s policy. State Farm explained that Appellant\u2019s policies did not afford UM coverage for injuries which were not caused by an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an uninsured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b67 Appellant filed a complaint in District Court against the individuals who had assaulted him to recover damages for personal injury, and against State Farm to recover UM benefits. State Farm filed an answer and counterclaim for declaratory relief, praying for a determination that neither Morehead\u2019s liability policy nor the UM provisions of Appellant\u2019s policies afforded Appellant coverage for the injuries he received because the injuries were not caused by an accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of Morehead\u2019s vehicle. State Farm then filed a motion for summary judgment. In its brief supporting the motion for summary judgment, State Farm treated the Morehead vehicle as an uninsured vehicle based on State Farm\u2019s previous denial of coverage under Morehead\u2019s liability policy. Thus, State Farm limited the scope of its argument and prayer for relief to UM benefits only. Appellant opposed the motion for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>and, in response to State Farm\u2019s brief, likewise limited its argument and prayer for relief to UM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b68 The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm holding that Appellant was not entitled to UM benefits because his injuries did not arise out of the operation, maintenance or use of the Morehead vehicle. The court based its holding on the facts that the tortfeasors acted deliberately to harm Appellant, Appellant was injured while both vehicles were parked, and the tortfeasors were not in their vehicle when they assaulted Appellant. Appellant appeals the order granting summary judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b69 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Ruckdaschel v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 395, 398, 948 P.2d 700, 702. When we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we apply the same evaluation, based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P, as the district court. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. In <em>Bruner, </em>we set forth our inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\"><em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264, 900 P.2d at 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u00b610 In this case, the parties agree that the question before us is whether, under the terms of the UM provisions of Appellant\u2019s policies, State Farm was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34. Therefore, we review whether the District Court correctly interpreted the UM provisions of Appellant\u2019s policies. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 377, 945 P.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in holding that Appellant was not entitled to UM benefits because his injuries were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>caused by an accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an uninsured motor vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b6 12 The insuring agreement for UM coverage in Appellant\u2019s policies states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">We [State Farm] will pay damages for bodily injury an insured is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle. The bodily injury must be caused by accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">This provision generally tracks the language of Montana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, which requires that all automobile liability insurance contracts issued for vehicles registered in this state include coverage to the insured for bodily injury \u201ccaused by accident arising out of the operation or use of [an uninsured] vehicle\u201d unless such coverage is affirmatively rejected by the insured. <em>See </em>Section 33-23-201, MCA. The parties do not dispute that Morehead\u2019s vehicle is an uninsured vehicle. The parties dispute only (1) whether Appellant\u2019s injuries were caused by an accident, and (2) whether the accident arose out of the operation, maintenance or use of Morehead\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b613 Appellant notes that the District Court focused its holding on the \u201carising out of...\u201d prong of the analysis, and seemingly disposed of the case on this basis alone. However, Appellant also notes that the District Court predicated its holding on a finding that the tortfeasors acted deliberately, and on the public policy set forth in <em>Mutual Service Cas. Ins. Co. v. McGehee </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 304, 711 P.2d 826, against indemnifying tortfeasors for their own intentional torts. In light of the court\u2019s discussion and reliance on <em>McGehee, </em>Appellant asserts that the court fully addressed the \u201ccaused by accident\u201d prong of the analysis, and indirectly held that because the tortfeasors acted deliberately, Appellant\u2019s injuries were not caused by an accident within the meaning of the UM provision. We agree with Appellant that the \u201ccaused by accident\u201d prong of the analysis was fully addressed by the District Court. We also note that State Farm did not object to a discussion of the meaning of \u201caccident,\u201d and has fully briefed this issue on appeal. Accordingly, we will discuss whether the court correctly interpreted the law with respect to both the \u201ccaused by accident\u201d and the \u201carising out of...\u201d prongs of the UM provision analysis. The meaning of \u201caccident\u201d and \u201carising out of the operation, maintenance, or use of an uninsured motor vehicle\u201d in the context of UM coverage are questions of first impression in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Were <em>Appellant\u2019s Injuries Caused By An Accident?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b614  Neither the uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, nor the insurance contracts in question define the term \u201caccident\u201d or draw a distinction between negligent and intentional acts. In interpreting insurance contracts, we are guided by several well-established principles. This Court is bound to interpret the terms of an insurance contract according to their usual, common-sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34. Further, this Court may not rewrite the contracts at issue, but must enforce them as written if their language is clear and explicit. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34. Ambiguities in the language of the contracts will be construed against the insurer. <em>Farmers Alliance Mutual Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 MT 155, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 312, \u00b625, 961 P.2d 114, \u00b6 25. An ambiguity exists when the contract taken as a whole in its wording or phraseology is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. We examine the question of ambiguity in insurance contract language from the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance business. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b615 With these principles of insurance contract interpretation in mind, we turn to the UM provision at issue. Without specifically alleging ambiguity, Appellant intimates that the term \u201caccident\u201d is ambiguous. Appellant notes that while some courts view \u201caccident\u201d as \u201csimply a happening that is unexpected and unintended,\u201d <em>McIntosh v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(Minn. 1992), 488 N.W.2d 476, 478, other courts have concluded that such a simple definition is unworkable in the context of insurance contracts because it fails to resolve an important question: from whose perspective shall a court determine whether a happening is unexpected or unintended? <em>See e.g. American Protection Ins. Co. v. Parker </em>(Ga. Ct. App. 1979), 258 S.E.2d 540, 542 (the fact that \u201can injury is caused by an intentional act does not preclude it from being caused by \u2018accident\u2019 if in that act something unforeseen, unusual and unexpected occurs which produces the result\u201d); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. McMillan </em>(Colo. 1996), 925 P.2d 785, 792-93 (court determined \u201caccident\u201d to be an ambiguous term). <em>See also Fox v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>(Or. 1998), 964 P.2d 997, 1002 (\u201c[T]he difficulty is in the tendency to think that there is one all-encompassing definition of\u2018accident\u2019 which accommodates all cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cumstances. There is no such thing\u201d) (citation omitted). In a case similar to the one at bar, the Oregon Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">Whether the occurrence is accidental depends entirely upon the point from which the question is viewed. If the occurrence is looked at from the point of view of the person who inflicts the harm..., it is intentional. On the other hand, if [the occurrence] is looked at from the victim\u2019s standpoint, it is unforeseen, unintended, unexpected, and has every aspect of an accident as long as the occurrence was not provoked. Therefore, it is necessary to decide which point of view is the proper one from which to solve the present question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdD\"><em>Davis v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(Or. 1973), 507 P.2d 9, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b6 16 In light of this apparent ambiguity concerning the term \u201caccident,\u201d and the established rule that ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the insured, <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25, Appellant urges this Court to adopt and apply to UM coverage the following definition of \u201caccident\u201d taken from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">An accident... is an event happening without any human agency, or, if happening through such agency, an event which, under circumstances, is unusual and not expected <em>by the person to whom it happens. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Appellant further argues that, in the context of UM coverage, viewing whether an \u201caccident\u201d has occurred from the standpoint of the insured victim is the better reasoned rule as it is in keeping with the nature and purpose of UM coverage, and the reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b617 Appellant distinguishes the nature and purpose of liability coverage from that of UM coverage. Appellant asserts that liability coverage is third party coverage the purpose of which is to indemnify the insured for damages which must be paid to others as a result of the insured\u2019s tortious conduct. In contrast, UM coverage is first party coverage the purpose of which is not indemnification, but rather to compensate the insured for losses produced by uninsured motorists. Appellant notes that this Court has described the compensatory purpose of UM coverage in very broad terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">The purpose of the [UM] statute is to protect completely, those willing to accept its protection, from all harm, whatever their status \u2014 passenger, driver, pedestrian \u2014 at the time of injury, produced by uninsured motorists. The only restrictions are that the plaintiff must be an insured, the defendant motorist uninsured, and that plaintiff be legally entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aex\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Guiberson v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 279, 289, 704 P.2d 68, 74 (citation omitted). Courts in other jurisdictions have also distinguished UM coverage from liability coverage and have pursued a liberal construction of UM coverage. <em>See e.g., Davis, </em>507 P.2d at 11 (\u201cthis portion of the policy [UM coverage] . . . resembles an accident policy for the victim of the uninsured motorist\u201d); <em>Leatherby Ins. Co. v. Willoughby </em>(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975), 315 So.2d 553, 555 (\u201cuninsured motorist protection... was designed for the protection of injured persons, not for the benefit of insurance companies or motorists who cause damage to others . . .\u201d); <em>Britt v. Phoenix Indent. Ins. Co. </em>(N.M. 1995), 907 P.2d 994, 998 (\u201c[T]he uninsured motorist statute was intended to expand insurance coverage and to protect individual members of the public against the hazard of culpable uninsured motorists\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b618 Based on the distinction between UM coverage and liability coverage, and based on this Court\u2019s liberal interpretation of UM coverage as described in <em>Guiberson, </em>Appellant argues that the UM statute should not be interpreted so narrowly as to preclude coverage to insured innocent victims of losses caused by uninsured motorists. Appellant argues that from his standpoint, the tortfeasors\u2019 acts and the injuries produced by those acts were unexpected and unintended and, therefore, constitute an \u201caccident.\u201d He argues that this injury-producing incident is precisely the type of \u201caccident\u201d for which UM coverage was designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b619 Appellant notes that while there exists a split of authority among courts in other jurisdictions which have considered whether an intentional tort may be an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of UM coverage, the majority have answered the question in the affirmative holding that \u201caccident\u201d should be viewed from the insured victim\u2019s perspective. <em>See Alabama Farm Bureau Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Mitchell </em>(Ala. Civ. App. 1979), 373 So.2d 1129; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. McMillan (Colo. </em>1996), 925 P.2d <em>785; Leatherby Ins. Co. v. Willoughby </em>(Fla.

Super. 1982), 443 A.2d 1118, which held that for purposes of UM coverage, accident must be viewed from the insured victim\u2019s perspective, was \u201cno longer respectable authority\u201d); <em>McCarthy v. Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corp. </em>(N.Y. App. Ct. 1962), 188 N.E.2d 405 (where Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation, a quasi-public institution established by the state, was exonerated from payment of liability benefits due to the intentional acts exclusion of the automobile liability policy, insurer was therefore not liable under its UM endorsement for injuries caused by intentional act); <em>Landry v. Dairyland Ins. Co. </em>(Vt. 1997), 701 A.2d 1035, 1036 (same holding but under fact that insured\u2019s UM coverage contained express exclusion for injuries caused by intentional acts); <em>Roller v.

Appellant asserts that a UM policyholder, having paid the premiums for UM coverage, legitimately expects coverage of injuries caused by uninsured motorists regardless of whether the injuries are intentionally or negligently caused. In support of this assertion, Appellant refers to one commentator who writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">[F]rom the perspective of the injured person, unless the tortious conduct of the uninsured or unidentified motorist was provoked by the injured person, the events and the injuries resulting from intentional acts are indistinguishable from those that result from negligent acts. In other words, when injuries are viewed from the vantage point of an injured person, the cause of the injuries is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>less fortuitous than the situation in which a person is injured as a result of the negligent operation of an uninsured vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">Uninsured motorist insurance coverage terms should be structured and interpreted to implement the public\u2019s interest of fostering the public policy, manifested by the uninsured motorist statutes and financial responsibility legislation, of providing indemnification to innocent victims. Moreover, extending coverage for such occurrences almost certainly is in accord with the reasonable and, to the extent they exist for most insurance purchasers, actual expectations that the coverage will provide them with compensation in such cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">1 Alan I. Widiss, Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance \u00a7 10.2, at 512-13 (2d ed. 1990) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b621 Appellant acknowledges the cases cited by State Farm in its argument to the District Court where this Court upheld denials of insurance benefits to victims of intentional torts, but argues that these cases are distinguishable on two grounds. <em>See McGehee, </em>219 Mont. at 306-08, 711 P.2d at 827-28 (affirming denial of general liability insurance benefits to victim of assault pursuant to the express language of the assailant\u2019s contract excluding from coverage injuries resulting from intentional acts of the insured); <em>Burns v. Underwriters Adjusting Co. </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 508, 510, 765 P.2d 712, 713 (affirming denial of general liability insurance benefits to victim of assault where contract contained nearly identical contract exclusion as that contained in <em>McGehee), New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 478, 481-82, 798 P.2d 130, 132 (same result for victim of sexual molestation seeking benefits under general liability insurance contract with similar exclusion); <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. v. Kienenberger </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 107, 109, 847 P.2d 1360, 1361 (affirming denial of coverage under similar facts and policy language as <em>Strecker).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b622 First, Appellant notes that the insurance contracts in the above cases expressly excluded from coverage intentional acts of the insured, whereas the UM provision <em>sub judice </em>contains no such exclusion and fails to otherwise define or clarify the term \u201caccident.\u201d Second, Appellant notes that while it was reasonable for the Court to premise its holding in the above cases on the public policy against indemnifying wrongdoers for their intentional torts, <em>see McGehee, </em>219 Mont. at 308, 711 P.2d at 828, it is not reasonable to do so here. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>lant argues that in a case such as this, where the contract at issue is first party coverage and the insured is the innocent victim rather than the tortfeasor, the danger of a tortfeasor being indemnified for his wrongful act does not exist. Therefore, Appellant argues, the public policy consideration underlying the above decisions is inapplicable to the instant case. <em>See Keeler v. Farmers and Merchants Ins. Co. </em>(Mo. App. Ct. 1987), 724 S.W.2d 307, 309-10; <em>Redden v. Doe </em>(La. App. Ct. 1978), 357 So.2d 632, 633-34; <em>Widiss, supra, </em>at 513. Appellant adds that State Farm\u2019s subrogation against Morehead and his companions would defray any \u201cindirect benefit\u201d that State Farm claims would accrue to the men if Appellant recovers UM benefits. Moreover, Appellant points out that his assailants are being punished for their actions pursuant to penalties provided by the criminal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b623 In response to Appellant\u2019s arguments, State Farm counters that we need not adopt a new or different definition for the term \u201caccident\u201d because the term is unambiguous. State Farm argues that we should reject the application of a subjective perspective to the term \u201caccident\u201d and instead apply the objective, common-sense, plain meaning to the term. State Farm views the common-sense, plain meaning of the term \u201caccident\u201d as encompassing only events that occur without intention or design, \u201c[t]hus, the perspective of the insured as opposed to the tortfeasor is not a relevant inquiry. Either an incident is an accident or it is not.\u201d <em>Roller, </em>801 P.2d at 210. State Farm argues that it should be self-evident that \u201caccident\u201d does not encompass a criminal assault where, by definition, someone has acted intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b624 Further, State Farm refutes Appellant\u2019s claims regarding the nature and purpose of UM coverage. Regarding the nature of UM coverage, State Farm cites <em>McIntosh, </em>488 N.W.2d at 479, and argues that UM coverage is not \u201ctrue\u201d first party coverage, like health insurance or no-fault coverage. State Farm asserts that health insurance and no-fault coverage are true first party coverages because they are triggered solely upon the insured being harmed. State Farm argues that the \u201cfocus\u201d of these coverages is on the insured. State Farm distinguishes these coverages from UM coverage, which is triggered solely upon a determination that the insured was harmed by an uninsured motorist. State Farm argues that, similar to liability coverage, the \u201cfocus\u201d of UM coverage is on the uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b625 Regarding the purpose of UM coverage, State Farm argues that it is not to compensate innocent persons injured by uninsured motorists, but rather to provide \u201ca substitute liability policy which stands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>as proxy for that which the uninsured motorist chose not to carry.\u201d <em>McIntosh, </em>488 N.W.2d at 478. State Farm adheres to the McIntosh&amp; view that \u201cuninsured motorist coverage more closely corresponds to security for tort liability than it does to basic reparation benefits.\u201d <em>McIntosh, </em>488 N.W.2d at 479. In further support of its position, State Farm cites <em>Sullivan v. Doe </em>(1972), 159 Mont. 50, 60, 495 P.2d 193, 198, wherein this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">The legislative purpose behind the enactment of . . . \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d coverage is ... simply to <em>place the injured policyholder in the same position </em>he would have been if the uninsured motorist had liability insurance .... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Likewise, <em>in Hubbel v. Western Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 21, 25, 706 P.2d 111, 113, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">[U]ninsured motorist provisions <em>should not he used to place the injured policyholder in a better position </em>than he would be under the ordinary provisions of an existing insurance policy. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b626 State Farm argues that in a case such as the one at bar, where the tortfeasor was covered by legally adequate automobile liability insurance, but due to the tortfeasor\u2019s commission of an intentional tort he is deemed \u201cuninsured,\u201d recovery of damages under the injured victim\u2019s UM insurance would place the injured victim in a better position than he would be if recovery had been allowed under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. State Farm notes that the Washington Supreme Court reached this same conclusion in the context of underinsured motorist coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">[I]f McKay [the assailant] had carried automobile insurance, Roller would have received no coverage for the injuries he sustained because traditional [liability] policies do not cover intentional acts by the insured. We adopt this reasoning and conclude that to provide underinsured motorist coverage to Roller would effectively place him in a better position than he would have been in if McKay had \u201cadequate liability insurance\u201d coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-9\"><em>Roller, </em>801 P.2d at 210 .</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b627 State Farm also criticizes Appellant\u2019s assertion that the public policy against indemnifying tortfeasors for their wrongful acts is inapplicable to UM coverage. State Farm argues that if UM coverage is extended to victims of criminal assault, the assailants are \u201cindirectly\u201d receiving insurance coverage and are not paying for the victim\u2019s damages. State Farm argues that regardless of the type of insurance un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>der which a victim recovers, the consequences of the assailants\u2019 acts are still muted. State Farm further argues that it is prevented from subrogating against the assailants in this case because, pursuant to <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Bottomly </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 66, 70, 817 P.2d 1162, 1165, an insurer may not subrogate against its own insured.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u00b628 Finally, State Farm refutes Appellant\u2019s claim that applying a subjective standard to the term \u201caccident\u201d comports with the reasonable expectations of the insured. State Farm quotes <em>McIntosh, </em>488 N.W.2d at 479, wherein the Minnesota Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">Indeed, we do not think those who pay premiums into a pool for uninsured motorist coverage reasonably expect those funds to be available to pay compensation for injuries for which, if the uninsured motorist were insured, his insurance company would not have to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Similarly, State Farm argues that the average insured does not reasonably expect that UM coverage equates to general \u201ccrime insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Anh\">\u00b629  Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments and authorities, we conclude that the term \u201caccident\u201d is ambiguous because it is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>See Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. In drawing this conclusion, we find compelling the facts that neither the statute nor the UM provision at issue defines \u201caccident\u201d or excludes from coverage injuries caused by intentional, as opposed to negligent, acts of the uninsured motorist. There exists no legislative history from which to ascertain whether the Montana Legislature, in enacting the UM statute, intended to exclude from coverage injuries caused by intentional acts of the uninsured motorist. In interpreting a statute, this Court can neither insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. The fact that courts are split as to the meaning of \u201caccident\u201d further confirms our belief that the term is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">\u00b630 Like the majority of jurisdictions which have considered the meaning of \u201caccident,\u201d we believe that, when viewed from the standpoint of the insured victim, an injury-producing incident is no less fortuitous simply because the tortfeasor acted intentionally. Like many courts espousing the majority view, we are persuaded by the reasoning articulated in <em>Celina Mut. Ins. Co. v. Saylor </em>(Ohio Misc. 1973), 301 N.E.2d 721, 723, wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">[In this case] we deal with the subject of uninsured motorists coverage. The [insureds] have paid the insurance premiums and have consciously contracted with the [insurer] for protection. The intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>in the mind of the insured at the time of injury should determine whether the acts are accidental or intentional. To look through the eyes of the uninsured rather than the insured in this factual situation would require an unconscionable twisting of the obvious purpose of purchasing insurance coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">All reason and logic would require a construction and interpretation that intent of mind should be taken from the viewpoint of the insured. Since the insured in the instant case was clearly not acting intentionally to warn herself, since the [insured] in the instant case was the party privy to the insurance contract; since the [insured] herein is the party who paid the premium for coverage to protect herself from the risk of injury caused by an uninsured third person it is the court\u2019s belief that the provisions of the insurance policy must be construed most favorably from the insured\u2019s viewpoint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b631 We reject State Farm\u2019s argument that there exists an all-encompassing definition of \u201caccident\u201d suitable for all purposes, and that \u201caccident\u201d includes only events that occur without intention or design. On this point, we find <em>State Farm Mat. Auto. Ins. Co. v. McMillan </em>(Colo. 1996), 925 P.2d 785, particularly instructive. In <em>McMillan, </em>the victim of a criminal assault made a claim for UM benefits with her insurer, State Farm. State Farm argued that because the tortfeasor acted intentionally, the victim\u2019s injuries were not caused by an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the UM provision. In rejecting this argument, the Colorado Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">[Application of State Farm\u2019s theory of uninsured motorist coverage would lead to absurd and unintended results. State Farm\u2019s argument is that only negligent, as opposed to intentional, acts of a tortfeasor are covered under the policy. During oral argument, State Farm conceded that in accordance with its position, if the car driven by an insured was struck by the car of an uninsured motorist who deliberately ignored a traffic signal and drove through a stop sign, the insured would not be covered under the policy because the resulting collision would not be an \u201caccident.\u201d We cannot countenance such an unreasonable result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em>McMillan, </em>925 P.2d at 794 n. 12. We agree with the Colorado Supreme Court that defining \u201caccident\u201d in such a way as to include only negligent acts, or events which occur without intention or design, would lead to absurd results and undermine the purpose of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b632 In the course of arguing the meaning of \u201caccident,\u201d both parties engage in unyielding debate over the nature and purpose of UM coverage, the reasonable expectations of the insured, and whether the public policy against indemnifying tortfeasors for their intentional acts is applicable in the context of UM coverage. We will discuss these topics to the extent they are germane to whether the term \u201caccident\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b633 The major premise underlying State Farm\u2019s argument that \u201caccident\u201d should not include intentional acts is that UM coverage more closely resembles liability insurance than accident or reparation insurance. State Farm argues that UM coverage was intended to be a substitute for the liability policy that the uninsured motorist chose not to carry, <em>McIntosh, </em>488 N.W.2d at 478, and was designed to put the injured policyholder in the same position he would have been if the uninsured motorist had liability insurance. <em>Sullivan, </em>159 Mont. at 60, 495 P.2d at 198; <em>see also Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 25, 706 P.2d at 113. Applying these principles to the instant case, State Farm argues that allowing Appellant to recover UM coverage, when he could not recover under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy, effectively places him in a better position and, therefore, contravenes the purpose of UM coverage. We cannot agree with State Farm\u2019s analysis because <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Hubbel </em>are both distinguishable from the instant case. Moreover, a closer reading of <em>Sullivan </em>reveals that it is inapposite to the position advanced by State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b634 In <em>Sullivan, </em>a passenger police officer was injured when the vehicle in which he was riding collided with an unidentified motorist. The question before the Court concerned the validity of an express provision of the passenger\u2019s policy requiring any recovery of UM benefits to be offset by recovery of worker\u2019s compensation benefits. We held the provision invalid because it was at variance with the purpose of UM coverage. <em>Sullivan, </em>159 Mont. at 60-61, 495 P.2d at 198-99. It is significant that in describing the purpose of UM coverage, this Court stated that it was <em>both </em>\u201cto provide protection for the ... policyholder against the risk of inadequate compensation for injuries or death caused by the negligence of financially irresponsible motorists,\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cto place the injured policyholder in the same position he would have been if the uninsured motorist had liability insurance.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>159 Mont. at 60, 495 P.2d at 198. We infer from the Court\u2019s reasoning and invalidation of the off-set provision that the Court did not believe that the passenger\u2019s recovery of UM benefits, in addition to worker\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>pensation benefits, placed him in a \u201cbetter\u201d position. We fail to see how <em>Sullivan </em>supports State Farm\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b635 In <em>Hubbel, </em>two co-partners of an oil business, Hubbel and Pearson, who were covered by worker\u2019s compensation insurance, were killed in an automobile collision. The issue was whether the spouse of Hubbel was entitled to UM benefits under Mr. Pearson\u2019s insurance policy in addition to worker\u2019s compensation benefits. This Court answered the question in the negative, concluding that Pearson was not an \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d within the meaning of the UM provision. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 25-26, 706 P.2d at 113-14. The Court noted that, due to the exclusivity provision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, Mrs. Hubbel\u2019s exclusive remedy was worker\u2019s compensation benefits and Mr. Pearson\u2019s estate was immune to any cause of action by Mrs. Hubbel. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 25, 706 P.2d at 112. The Court further commented that the insurance company was placed in a \u201ccatch-22\" by the situation of Mr. Pearson carrying adequate auto insurance, yet being deemed \u2019\u2019uninsured\" simply because of the insurance company\u2019s refusal to provide coverage due to the exclusivity provision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 25, 706 P.2d at 113. Citing <em>Sullivan, </em>the Court reasoned that allowing Mrs. Hubbel recovery of both worker\u2019s compensation benefits and UM benefits would place her in a better position than if she recovered only worker\u2019s compensation benefits and, thus, would be contrary to the intent of the legislature in enacting the UM statute. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 25-26, 706 P.2d at 113-14. Based on these considerations, the Court determined that Mr. Pearson was not an uninsured motorist within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b636 <em>Hubbel </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Hubbel, </em>the Court was faced with <em>two </em>possible sources of compensation for Mrs. Hubbel, worker\u2019s compensation benefits and UM benefits, and an exclusivity provision that made one yield to the other. These factors are not present in the instant case. Here, Appellant cannot collect under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy and, thus, has only <em>one </em>source of compensation, UM benefits. We fail to see how Appellant\u2019s recovery of UM benefits would place him in a better position. Rather, he would be receiving the same compensation he would have received had he been entitled to recover under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b637 Aside from being distinguishable, we note that the reasoning of the majority opinion in <em>Hubbel </em>stands on shaky ground. In a dissenting opinion to <em>Hubbel, </em>Justice Sheehy commented that the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>was uninstructed by <em>Sullivan, </em>and essentially turned <em>Sullivan </em>on its head by ignoring \u201cthe legislative policy to provide UM coverage which we have heretofore strongly supported.\u201d <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 27-29, 706 P.2d at 115. Justice Sheehy further commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">The basic fault in the reasoning of the majority... is they have regarded the interpretation of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act and the Uninsured Motorist Coverage Act from the viewpoint of the insurer, and not from the viewpoint of the claimant. To State Farm, Pearson is not uninsured because its policy does provide liability coverage to him. To the Hubbel claimants, however, Pearson is uninsured because, through a legal technicality,... the Hubbel heirs cannot obtain a judgment against Pearson which could be satisfied under the liability portion of the State Farm policy. If State Farm is caught in a catch-22, then the Hubbel heirs are caught in a catch-44, a double whammy. State Farm gets to keep the money for which it collected a premium; the Hubbel heirs do not get to collect anything under the uninsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 29, 706 P.2d at 115-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b638 Based on the weaknesses in its arguments, we reject State Farm\u2019s position that UM coverage more closely resembles liability coverage than accident or reparation coverage, and that Appellant would be placed in a better position by recovery of UM benefits in contravention of the purpose of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b639  Regarding the next topic, the reasonable expectations of the insured, we agree with Appellant\u2019s analysis. We believe the average insured reasonably expects that, so long as an injury-causing event is unforeseen and unprovoked by the insured, injuries caused by uninsured motorists will be covered by UM coverage regardless of whether they were caused negligently or intentionally. State Farm\u2019s argument, that the average insured does not reasonably expect UM coverage to be general \u201ccrime insurance,\u201d is disingenuous in light of the limited scope of our discussion in this first section of the opinion. Here, we are only discussing whether \u201caccident\u201d should be viewed from the insured victim\u2019s perspective. It is illogical to assume that viewing \u201caccident\u201d from the standpoint of the insured victim would make UM coverage equivalent to general crime insurance. It appears State Farm\u2019s remark is more directed to the second section of this opinion which addresses the remoteness question: what degree of causal connection must exist between the accident and the tortfeasors\u2019 use of the uninsured vehicle in order for the accident to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>arisen out of the operation, maintenance or use of the vehicle? We believe the \u201carising out of the use\u201d element is the most formidable obstacle to a victim\u2019s recovery of UM coverage. Once a court has been persuaded that a victim\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of an uninsured vehicle, it should have little difficulty accepting the notion that intentional torts maybe \u201caccidents\u201d and that permitting victims of intentional torts to recover UM benefits does not equate to general crime insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b640 Regarding the last topic, whether the public policy against indemnifying tortfeasors for their own intentional torts is applicable in the context of UM coverage, we agree with Appellant\u2019s analysis. Under UM coverage, the victim of the intentional tort is the insured and the possibility of tortfeasors being indemnified does not exist. Thus, the public policy against indemnifying tortfeasors for their intentional torts, a policy which serves the purpose of punishment and deterrence, is inapplicable in the context of UM coverage. We disagree with State Farm that <em>Continental Ins. Co v. Bottomly </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 66, 817 P.2d 1162, precludes subrogation against the tortfeasors in this case. <em>Bottomly </em>only precludes subrogation by an insurer against its insured <em>under a policy that the insurer has with the insured. See Bottomly, </em>250 Mont. at 69-70, 817 P.2d at 1164-65. Here, if Appellant recovered UM benefits, the policy under which State Farm would have a right of subrogation is the one issued to Appellant. Thus, State Farm could subrogate against the tortfeasors because they would be third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b641  Having determined that the term \u201caccident\u201d is ambiguous, we hold that an intentional act may be an accident for purposes of UM coverage. Absent contract language to the contrary, whether an \u201caccident\u201d has occurred must be viewed from the standpoint of the insured. Not only are we obligated to hold this way, pursuant to the rule that ambiguities in an insurance contract must be construed in favor of the insured, <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25, but we believe our holding is the better-reasoned rule as it is in keeping with the nature and purpose of UM coverage and the reasonable expectations of the insured. The facts are undisputed that Appellant neither provoked, intended, or expected the injuries inflicted by Morehead and his companions. Applying our holding today, it follows that the intentional assault on Appellant was an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\n<em>Did the Accident Arise Out of the Operation, Maintenance, or Use ofMorehead\u2019s Vehicle?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b642 The parties agree that, under the facts of this case, the relevant inquiry centers upon the use ofMorehead\u2019s vehicle, rather than its operation or maintenance. The parties also agree that in order for the accident to have \u201carisen out of the use\u201d of Morehead\u2019s vehicle, there must exist a sufficient nexus, or causal connection, between the tortfeasors\u2019 use ofMorehead\u2019s vehicle and Appellant\u2019s injuries. The parties dispute, however, the legal test to be applied in determining the existence of a sufficient nexus or causal connection in the context of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b643 Similar to his argument in the first section of this opinion, Appellant argues that the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d should be broadly interpreted to effect the remedial purposes of UM coverage. Without advocating a particular test, Appellant urges this Court to adopt an expansive interpretation of \u201carising out of the use\u201d which does not require that the injury be proximately caused by the use of the uninsured vehicle in a strict legal sense, but rather requires a showing that some nexus exists between the injury and the use of the uninsured vehicle. Appellant maintains that the fact that some instrumentality independent of the uninsured vehicle was the direct cause of injury should not, by itself, preclude UM coverage. Appellant cites <em>General Accident Ins. Co. of Am. v. Olivier </em>(R.I. 1990), 574 A.2d 1240; <em>Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser </em>(S.C. 1992), 422 S.E.2d 106; and <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Dorris </em>(Ga. App. Ct. 1982), 288 S.E.2d 856, as both support for his position and examples of expansive tests which this Court may adopt to serve the purposes of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b644 In <em>Olivier, </em>the insured was shot by a motorist, with whom she had previously been involved in a collision, as she stood away from her car waiting to give a statement to the police about the collision. In holding that the insured\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle, the Florida Supreme Court construed the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d as \u201cnot meaning \u2018proximately caused by\u2019 but as having a broader meaning that simply require[s] some nexus between the motor vehicle and the injury.\u201d <em>Olivier, </em>574 A.2d at 1242 (following <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Novak </em>(Fla. 1984), 453 So.2d 1116 (construing the phrase in the context of personal injury protection benefits)). In support of its expansive test, the court reasoned that it was unnecessary for the uninsured vehicle to be the instrumentality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>of the injury because the policy should be interpreted to effect broad coverage. <em>Olivier, </em>574 A.2d at 1242. The court embraced the principle that \u201cthe clause \u2018arising out of the use of the motor vehicle\u2019 is framed in general, comprehensive terms in order to express the intent to effect broad coverage.\u201d <em>Olivier, </em>574 A.2d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b645 In <em>Howser, </em>an insured was injured when she was pursued, threatened, and then shot by an unknown assailant in a car. At the time of the shooting, the insured was driving her vehicle when the unknown motorist began following her and then \u201cbumped\u201d the back of her vehicle with his automobile. The motorist pulled alongside the insured and threatened her with a gun while attempting to get her to pull over. When the insured tried to escape in her vehicle, the motorist fired several shots at her vehicle and she was wounded. <em>Howser, </em>422 S.E.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b646 In resolving whether the insured\u2019s injuries \u201carose out of the use\u201d of the uninsured vehicle, the court stated that the test was \u201csomething less than proximate cause and something more than the vehicle being the mere site of the injury\u201d or, more simply, whether \u201cthe use of the vehicle causally contributed to the claimant\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Howser, </em>422 S.E.2d at 108 (relying on <em>Continental Western Ins. Co. v. Klug </em>(Minn. 1987), 415 N.W.2d 876). In applying this test, the court determined that the uninsured vehicle\u2019s use causally contributed to Howser\u2019s injuries because the vehicle played an indispensable role in the attack on Howser. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">In the case at bar, it is apparent that the unknown vehicle was an active accessory to this assault. This is not a case in which the assailant merely used the vehicle to provide transportation to the situs of the shooting. Nor is it a case where the assailant happened, incidentally, to be sitting in a stationary vehicle at the time of the attack. Only through use of his vehicle was the assailant able to closely pursue Howser, thereby enabling him to carry out the pistol assault. The gunshot was the culmination of an ongoing assault in which the vehicle played an essential and integral part. Additionally, only a motor vehicle could have provided the assailant a quick and successful escape.

The Court concluded there was no act of independent significance which broke the causal link as \u201cthe unknown driver\u2019s use of his vehicle and the shooting were inextricably linked as one continuing assault.\u201d <em>Howser, </em>422 S.E.2d at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b647 In <em>Dorris, </em>the insured was inspecting the mirror of his vehicle after it had been struck by another motorist moving in the opposite direction. The motorist turned his vehicle around and pulled up alongside the insured. An altercation ensued and the motorist pointed a pistol at the insured. The insured dove in his vehicle and sped away. Then the motorist pursued the insured and fired several shots, some of which hit the insured\u2019s vehicle. In the course of pursuit, the insured lost control of his vehicle and sustained injuries when his vehicle veered off the road and overturned. <em>Dorris, </em>288 S.E.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"AtQ\">\u00b648 In determining whether the insured\u2019s injuries \u201carose out of the use\u201d of the uninsured vehicle, the Georgia Court of Appeals employed the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">[T]he term \u201carising out of\u201d does not mean proximate cause in the strict legal sense, nor require [sic] a finding that the injury was directly and proximately caused by the use of the vehicle, nor that the insured vehicle was exerting any physical force upon the instrumentality which was the immediate cause of the injury. . . [Ajlmost any causal connection or relationship will do____Case law indicates that the injury need not be the proximate result of \u201cuse\u201d in the strict sense, but it cannot be extended to something distinctly remote. Each case turns on its precise individual facts. The question to be answered is whether the injury \u201coriginated from\u201d, \u201chad its origin in\u201d, \u201cgrew out of\u201d, or \u201cflowed from\u201d the use of the vehicle.

App. Ct. 1977), 236 S.E.2d 550 (construing the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d in the context of personal injury protection coverage)). In applying this test, the court determined that the insured\u2019s injuries \u201carose from\u201d the motorist\u2019s use of his vehicle to perpetrate an assault on the insured. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">Had it not been for the \u201cuse\u201d of the unidentified truck, the continuing assault would not have happened and, presumably, appellees would not have been injured. As thus viewed, the liability of the unidentified driver for the injuries to appellees \u201carose from\u201d, \u201chad its origins in\u201d, \u201cgrew out of\u201d or \u201cflowed from\u201d his utilization of his vehicle as a means to perpetrate an unwarranted assault upon them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Under the evidence the crash of the [insured\u2019s] truck was the result of the high speed chase during the course of which shooting occurred.

Moreover, State Farm argues, the above tests do not accurately reflect the intent of the parties in contracting for UM coverage. <em>See Ulrich v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n </em>(Wyo. 1992), 839 P.2d 942, 949. Relying on <em>Ulrich, </em>State Farm argues that the \u201carising out of the use\u201d phrase \u201cunambiguously expressed] the parties\u2019 intent that UM coverage exists for injuries that result as a natural consequence from the use of an insured vehicle.\u201d <em>See Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 948. State Farm urges this Court to adopt Wyoming\u2019s \u201cnatural consequences\u201d test, or a similar restrictive test, for determining whether an insured\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b650 In <em>Ulrich, </em>a motorist, who was an acquaintance of the insured, saw the insured putting air into his tire at a gas station. The motorist pulled into the gas station and parked his truck in a manner that blocked the insured\u2019s vehicle. The motorist then began yelling and threatening the insured, attempting to pick a fight. The motorist moved his truck so that it was no longer blocking the insured\u2019s vehicle, and parked it parallel to the insured\u2019s vehicle. The motorist then pointed a gun at the insured. An exchange of gunfire ensued culminating in the motorist shooting the insured while the insured was attempting to escape in his vehicle. <em>Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 944-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b651 In holding that the insured\u2019s injuries did not arise out of the use of the motorist\u2019s truck, the Wyoming Supreme Court applied the \u201cnatural consequences\u201d test to UM coverage. <em>Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 948 (following <em>Worthington v. State </em>(Wyo. 1979), 598 P.2d 796, 807 (construing the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d in the context of liability coverage)). The <em>Worthington </em>court described the natural consequences test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">In determining whether an injury arose out of use, the evidence must demonstrate that it was the natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the use of an insured vehicle, the causal connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tion being reasonably apparent. If the injury was directly caused by some independent or intervening cause wholly disassociated from, independent of, or remote from the use of the automobile, the injury cannot be held to arise out of its use. The resolution of the question necessarily depends to a great degree upon the particular facts presented by each individual case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><em>Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 948. Applying this test to <em>Ulrich, </em>the court concluded that Ulrich\u2019s injuries did not occur as a natural consequence of the use of the motorist\u2019s truck, but rather occurred as a natural consequence of the motorist\u2019s use of a gun. <em>Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 949. The court further commented that the motorist\u2019s intentional act of shooting was an independent, intervening cause of Ulrich\u2019s injuries, rendering the motorist\u2019s use of his truck legally insignificant. <em>Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b652 State Farm cites several cases from courts in other jurisdictions also applying a restrictive interpretation to \u201carising out of the use.\u201d <em>See e.g., Kangas v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(Mich. App. Ct. 1975), 235 N.W.2d 42, 50 (holding that where occupants left uninsured vehicle, assaulted a pedestrian, pedestrian ran into highway and was struck by a truck, no causal connection existed between pedestrian\u2019s injuries and use of the uninsured vehicle because \u201cassaults and fisticuffs are not normal foreseeable occurrences in the use of a vehicle\u201d); <em>Lemmons v. Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(Mo. App. Ct. 1994), 878 S.W.2d 853, 857 (holding that for requisite causal connection to exist, the vehicle must be the instrumentality which caused the injury, not merely a contribution which causes a condition which in turn causes the injury); <em>Doe v. State Farm Mut. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(E.D. Va. 1995), 878 F.Supp. 862, 864-65 (holding that injuries must be connected to the use of the car <em>as a car, </em>i.e. as a means of transportation rather than a situs for the commission of criminal acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b653 In advocating their respective tests, neither party explicitly addressed the issue of whether the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d is ambiguous. State Farm briefly touched on the issue by quoting <em>Ulrich </em>which states that the \u201carising out of the use\u201d phrase \u201cunambiguously expressed] the parties\u2019 intent that UM coverage exists for injuries that result as a natural consequence from the use of an uninsured vehicle.\u201d See <em>Ulrich, </em>839 P.2d at 949. As previously stated, an ambiguity exists when the contract taken as a whole in its wording or phraseology is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. We examine the question of ambiguity in insurance contract lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>guage from the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance business. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. Upon these principles, we determine that the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d is ambiguous because it is reasonably subject to more than one interpretation. In cases where the uninsured vehicle is the instrumentality and, therefore, the legal cause of the insured\u2019s injuries, we are certain the average UM policyholder would think that his or her injuries arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle. However, we cannot agree with State Farm that the average UM policyholder would not think his or her injuries arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle in cases where the uninsured vehicle is not the instrumentality causing the injuries, but is a prime accessory, without which the injury-producing incident or the severity of the injuries would not have occurred. Indeed, we think the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b654  Having concluded that the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d is ambiguous, we resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insured. <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25. We align ourselves with those jurisdictions adopting an expansive, rather than restrictive, interpretation of the phrase. Specifically, we adopt the fact-intensive test articulated in <em>Dorris. </em>We hold that for purposes of UM coverage, an insured\u2019s injuries \u201carise out of the use\u201d of an uninsured vehicle if the injuries originate from, or grow out of, or flow from the use of the uninsured vehicle. <em>Dorris, </em>288 S.E.2d at 858. We agree with <em>Olivier, </em>that the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d should be broadly interpreted to effect the remedial purposes of UM coverage. <em>Olivier, </em>574 A.2d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b655 We are cognizant of State Farm\u2019s slippery slope argument and its concern that applying an expansive interpretation to the phrase \u201carising out of the use\u201d would expand UM coverage to the extent it would function as general crime insurance. However, rather than address this concern by fashioning an unduly restrictive test of causal relationship, as State Farm suggests, we think it better to apply an expansive test and, on a case by case basis, distinguish those cases where the facts suggest a remote or tenuous causal relationship between an insured\u2019s injuries and the use of the uninsured vehicle from cases where the facts demonstrate that the two are inextricably linked.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b656 Moreover, it appears State Farm recognizes that the <em>Dorris </em>test is workable in the context of UM coverage. We note that in analogizing this case to other cases with similar facts where it was held that no causal relationship existed, State Farm cited <em>Cannon v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(N.H. 1994), 639 A.2d 270, a case employing the same expansive test as in <em>Dorris. </em>In <em>Cannon, </em>a motorist engaged the insured in a game of \u201ccat and mouse\u201d on the Interstate and would not let the insured pass. The motorist used \u201chostile hand signals\u201d to indicate that he wanted the insured to pull over. The insured refused and drove closely behind the motorist to ascertain his license plate number. The motorist then slammed his brakes. The insured in turn slammed his brakes causing his vehicle to stall. The two vehicles came to a stop without touching each other. The motorist then exited his vehicle, ran over to the insured\u2019s vehicle, smashed the insured\u2019s driver side window with his fist, and punched the insured in the face. <em>Cannon, </em>639 A.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b657 In resolving the \u201carising out of the use\u201d question, the court employed the \u201coriginating from, or growing out of, or flowing from the use\u201d test of causal relationship. <em>Cannon, </em>639 A.2d at 271. Applying this test, the court reasoned that \u201cthe causal connection between use and injury here is tenuous,\u201d and held that the insured\u2019s injuries did not arise out of the use of the uninsured vehicle. <em>Cannon, </em>639 A.2d at 271. <em>See also Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group </em>(N.H. 1992), 616 A.2d 511, 515-16 (employing same expansive test as <em>Dorris </em>and holding no causal relationship existed). The <em>Cannon </em>and <em>Akerley </em>cases demonstrate that the \u201coriginating from, or growing out of, or flowing from the use\u201d test is workable in the context of UM coverage without expanding the scope of UM coverage so as to make it a surrogate for general crime insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b658 Having decided the proper test to be applied in determining whether an insured\u2019s injuries arose out of the use of an uninsured vehicle, we recognize that a material issue of fact is disputed in this litigation: whether Appellant\u2019s injuries originated from, or grew out of, or flowed from the use of Morehead\u2019s vehicle. Because a material issue of fact exists in this case, we hold that the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b659 We reverse and remand this cause to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-7\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b189-8\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"Av9\">specially concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b660 I specially concur in the portion of the Court\u2019s opinion which discusses and resolves the issue relating to the definition of \u201caccident.\u201d I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dissent, however, from much of the Court\u2019s discussion \u2014 and from its resolution \u2014 of the issue relating to \u201carising out of the use of.\u201d Consequently, I cannot join in the overall result of the Court\u2019s opinion and I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b661 With regard to the Court\u2019s discussion of the definition of \u201caccident,\u201d I do not agree with all that is said therein.

The tortfeasor in this case did not own \u2014 and was not driving \u2014 the uninsured vehicle. He was a passenger who exited from the vehicle and committed an assault on the insured.
