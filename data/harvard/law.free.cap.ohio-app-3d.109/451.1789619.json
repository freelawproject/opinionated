On September 15, 1990, Rudy and Pauline Levario were driving northbound on 1-75 in Oakland County, Michigan, when a metal object which had been struck by a car in front of them flew through their windshield and injured Pauline. The object was later examined and identified as a broken piece of a single leaf spring from a tractor-trailer suspension system. On September 15, 1993, appellants filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in which they sought a determination by the trial court that they are entitled to uninsured motorist coverage for Pauline\u2019s injuries. Appellants alleged that the object which hit Pauline \u201chad [fallen] off a vehicle which was negligently and carelessly maintained.\u201d On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>September 30, 1993, appellee submitted an answer and counterclaim for declaratory judgment in which it alleged that since appellants\u2019 vehicle did not come into contact with an uninsured motor vehicle and the alleged uninsured motor vehicle operator was not negligent, there was no uninsured motor vehicle operator from whom appellants were legally entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On October 5, 1994, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment in which it asserted that (a) appellants had not presented evidence that demonstrated that they would be legally entitled to recover from an unidentified tortfeasor who was the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, and (b) appellants had not demonstrated that there was \u201cactual physical contact\u201d within the meaning of appellants\u2019 policy between Pauline and the vehicle driven by an unidentified or hit and run motorist. On October 21, 1994, appellants voluntarily dismissed their complaint. Appellee\u2019s counterclaim for declaratory judgment remained pending, however, and appellee requested a ruling thereon from the court. On February 15, 1995, appellants refiled their complaint and filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In their memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, appellants responded that (a) they had produced evidence which demonstrated that the metal object was a leaf spring which came off a vehicle while that vehicle was in operation, (b) they had presented evidence that they are legally entitled to recover due to the negligence of the unknown owner or operator of the truck which lost the leaf spring, and (c) under the law of Michigan, the facts of this case demonstrate \u201cphysical contact\u201d sufficient to invoke coverage under the uninsured motorist provision of appellants\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On April 19, 1995, the trial court filed a judgment entry in which it found that (1) appellants had produced no evidence that the leaf spring came from an unidentified moving vehicle or that the object had not exhausted its momentum when the car directly in front of them hit it, (2) that appellants had presented only a \u201cpossible inference\u201d that the leaf spring had just broken off of a passing truck, and (3) that there was \u201cno evidence before this Court that there was a vehicle from which the leaf spring either broke or fell or that the leaf spring was still in motion.\u201d In arriving at its decision, the trial court cited several Ohio cases which analyzed the \u201cphysical contact rule\u201d as it applied to the hit-and-run language of the uninsured motorist provision of insurance policies similar to the one in this case. Accordingly, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellants assert in their first assignment of error that the trial court erred by failing to apply Michigan law to the underlying issue of whether they are, in the language of their policy, \u201clegally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury.\u201d Appellants assert that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>motorist traveling in Michigan accepts the Michigan law as it pertains to accidents occurring in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Under appellants\u2019 first assignment of error, the question before this court is whether the trial court erred when it used Ohio law to determine if there was a tortfeasor from whom appellants were legally entitled to recover for the injuries caused by the metal object that came through their windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201cUninsured motorist coverage is dependent on the uninsured motorist\u2019s legal liability to the injured person.\u201d <em>Kurent v. Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 242, 246, 581 N.E.2d 533, 536, citing <em>York v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 199, 202, 18 O.O.3d 412, 413-414, 414 N.E.2d 423, 425. When, as in this case, an insured Ohio resident is injured in an accident in another state, the question of which state\u2019s law should be applied to determine the existence of any legal liability arises. In <em>Kurent, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court rejected the proposition that, for purposes of determining uninsured motorist coverage under an Ohio contract of insurance, Ohio law should be applied to tortious conduct which occurs in another state. In <em>Kurent, </em>Ohio residents were injured by a Michigan driver while traveling in Michigan. The Michigan driver\u2019s insurance company denied the Ohio residents\u2019 claim for coverage based on Michigan law, which requires that noneconomic damages be established beyond a specific threshold limit before liability attaches to the tortfeasor. The Ohio residents\u2019 insurer then denied uninsured motorist coverage, asserting that Michigan tort law must be used to determine whether the insureds were legally entitled to recover from the tortfeasor. In reaching its decision to apply Michigan tort law to determine if there was a tortfeasor from whom the claimant was legally entitled to recover, the <em>Kurent </em>court cited the approach adopted in <em>Morgan v. Biro Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 339, 341-342, 15 OBR 463, 464-466, 474 N.E.2d 286, 288-289, which was based on 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Conflict of Laws (1971) 430, Section 146, and creates a presumption that the law of the place of the injury controls unless another jurisdiction has a more significant relationship to the lawsuit. The <em>Kurent </em>court referred to Comment <em>d </em>to Section 146, which \u201cemphasizes that the state in which both the conduct and the injury occur has the dominant interest in regulating that conduct, determining whether it is tortious in character, and determining whether the interest is entitled to legal protection.\u201d <em>Kurent, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 246, 581 N.E.2d at 537, citing the Restatement of Conflicts at 431. Under Section 145 of the Restatement, factors to be used to determine whether one state has a more significant relationship to the lawsuit than another include the place of injury, the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, the residence or place of incorporation and/or business of the parties, and the place where any relationship between the parties is located. The <em>Kurent </em>court concluded that Ohio\u2019s interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>were not sufficient to override the presumption that the place where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties and stated that \u201c[a] motorist traveling in Michigan accepts Michigan law as it pertains to accidents occurring in Michigan.\u201d <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 246, 581 N.E.2d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Upon consideration of the foregoing, this court finds that the trial court erred by using Ohio rather than Michigan law to determine whether there was a tortfeasor from whom appellants were legally entitled to recover for the injury caused by the metal object that came through their windshield. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of is error well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In light of this court\u2019s finding that the trial court\u2019s application of Ohio law was in error, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error as to that court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment and their third assignment of error as to the application of Ohio law for the definition of \u201cphysical contact\u201d are found moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice was not done the party complaining and the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This cause is remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment in accordance with this opinion. Costs of this appeal are assessed to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-9\">Melvin L.
