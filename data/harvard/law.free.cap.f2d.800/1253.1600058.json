The Secretary has interpreted the \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d provisions of section 206, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406, in light of the section 1127 offset, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6, and has concluded that \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d under section 206 means \u201cthe total amount of benefits <em>payable </em>under Title II____\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1703 (1985) (emphasis added) (prior versions of regulation read same); <em>see also </em>47 Fed.Reg. 4986 (1982) (Secretary\u2019s comments making it clear that the definition found at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1703 should apply to withholding of attorney\u2019s fees.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-22\">We note initially that where Congress has entrusted an agency with implementation of a statutory scheme, that agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutory terms is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>titled to substantial deference. <em>Blum v. Bacon, </em>457 U.S. 132, 141, 102 S.Ct. 2355, 2361, 72 L.Ed.2d 728 (1982). Courts are free to evaluate, however, whether agency interpretations are arbitrary, capricious, or beyond the agency\u2019s statutory authority. <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 466, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1956, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983); <em>Herweg v. Ray, </em>455 U.S. 265, 275, 102 S.Ct. 1059, 1066, 71 L.Ed.2d 137 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">The district court focused its opinion on the need to \u201cencourage effective legal representation of claimants by ensuring lawyers that they [will] receive reasonable fees,\u201d 605 F.Supp. 88, 91 (W.D.Va.1985), and the absence of any evidence that the \u201cwindfall provision was intended to affect attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406.\u201d 605 F.Supp. at 92. The court\u2019s concerns are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">In section 206 of the Act, Congress has attempted to strike a balance between the need to ensure some measure of collectible attorney\u2019s fees and the desire not to dilute the claimant\u2019s benefits with excessive attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192 (5th Cir.1970) (two congressional goals of section 206(b)), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 830, 91 S.Ct. 60, 27 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>400 U.S. 953, 91 S.Ct. 233, 27 L.Ed.2d 261 (1970). There is no parallel attorney\u2019s fees provision under Title XVI, and thus, the only funds available to the attorney of a claimant under both Title II and Title XVI are the funds withheld by the Secretary pursuant to section 206(a) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the fee limitation created by this statutory absence may not be intended, that limitation is appropriate for the Congress to consider but not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\">A claimant\u2019s attorney has an ethical responsibility to seek all benefits to which his client might be entitled. The attorney can evaluate the potential for a Title XVI award reducing the attorney\u2019s fee withheld before he or she undertakes representation of the claimant. Although the potential for a Title XVI award may discourage attorneys from representing the poorest<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of claimants, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d also ensures that the poorest of claimants keep more of their award insulated from their attorney. If Congress finds the balance struck by the Secretary\u2019s interpretation inappropriate in cases involving Title XVI benefits it may amend the Act, but this court cannot say that the interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or inconsistent with the statutory scheme. To the contrary, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is completely consistent with the language of section 206(b), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b), which describes the past-due benefits as those \u201cto which the claimant is entitled by reason of ... judgment____\u201d <em>See Cuthbert v. Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, </em>784 F.2d 1157, 1160 (4th Cir.1985) (The Secretary\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>interpretation \u201cis a sensible reading of the statute, since the direct payment to the lawyer is to be made out of funds otherwise payable to the client.\u201d); <em>accord Det-son v. Schweiker, </em>788 F.2d 372, 375-76 (6th Cir.1986); <em>Wheeler v. Heckler, </em>787 F.2d 101, 107-08 (3rd Cir.1986); <em>Burnett v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 621 (8th Cir.1985); <em>Cloyd v. Weinberger, </em>527 F.2d 1167 (6th Cir.1975) (same interpretation of section 206(b) in a case involving the offset for workmen\u2019s compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court awarding attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2,556.13 is reversed. Because it is clear that the district court intended to award the maximum allowable amount and the Secretary has no objection to the reasonableness of awarding the full 25 percent of the reduced Title II benefits, we remand this case to the district court for the entry of an award of $1,476.40 as attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">. Receipt of Title XVI benefits, supplemental security income is based in part on financial need. <em>See infra </em>note 3. The Title XVI windfall offset, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6 (1982), provides for a reduction in Title II benefits based on the excess amount or windfall of need-based Title XVI benefits that the claimant receives because of a retroactive award of Title II benefits. If Title II benefits are paid when due rather than retroactively, then no windfall occurs because the claimant\u2019s financial need and resulting entitlement to supplemental security income, Title XVI, is lowered by the timely payment of disability benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1358-13\">. The court\u2019s award of $2,556.13 is 25 percent of $10,224.50 ($10,230.90 less undisputed deductions of $6.40). Appellant\u2019s brief, however, avers that the district court erroneously recited $10,230.90 as the amount of unreduced Title II benefits. Appellant indicates that $11,230.90 is the correct amount of unreduced Title II benefits. Brief for Appellant at 3 n. 3 and accompanying text. Appellant\u2019s correction is consistent with the district court\u2019s recitation of $5,318.90 as the windfall amount of past-due Title XVI benefits, $6.40 as the amount of undisputed deductions, and $5,905.60 as the amount of reduced Title II benefits. <em>See </em>605 F.Supp. 88, 89. The amount of reduced Title II benefits upon which attorney\u2019s fees are properly calculated is $5,905.60 and undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">. Although the Secretary does not withhold funds from an award of Title XVI benefits for the payment of attorney's fees, an attorney <em>may </em>be able to collect a fee for Title XVI representation directly from his or her client pursuant to their fee agreement. Section 206(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) (2), does make it unlawful for an attorney to collect \"any amount in excess of that allowed by the court,\u201d but that admonition applies only to \"services rendered in connection with [Title II proceedings] before a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Secretary does, however, require that any fee for Title XVI services performed at the administrative level be approved prior to collection. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1520 (1985). The appropriateness of collecting Title XVI fees, the validity of the Secretary\u2019s requirement of approval, and the proper amount of Title XVI fees in this case, if any, are not before the court on this appeal; the sole issue raised by the appellant is whether attorney\u2019s fees under section 206 of the Act should be calculated before or after the Title XVI windfall offset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1359-14\">. In addition to a disability requirement similar to that for Title II benefits, <em>compare </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1382(a) and 1382c(a)(3) to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(a) and (d), Title XVI claimants must also demonstrate financial need. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382. Thus, claimants eligible for both Title II and Title XVI benefits are necessarily poorer than those who qualify only for Title II benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
