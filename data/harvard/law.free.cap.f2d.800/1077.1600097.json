We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">On April 1, 1985, Innotron Diagnostics (Innotron) sued Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, No. 85-2207, alleging that Abbott\u2019s marketing activities (contracts tying its reagents to its analyzer, bundling its reagents with other products, and manipulating its analyzer software to exclude Innotron\u2019s reagents) violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (1982). Jurisdiction was based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332, and 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">On April 19, 1985, Abbott sued Innotron in the same court, No. 85-2614, alleging infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 4,492,762 (\u2019762), issued by the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) January 8, 1985, for a method of testing for substances in a patient\u2019s blood. Jurisdiction was based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">Innotron moved to dismiss Abbott\u2019s complaint as stating a compulsory counterclaim to its antitrust action. Without ruling specifically on the motion, the district court ordered consolidation of the cases pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-14\">Abbott moved to stay Innotron\u2019s antitrust claims and for a separate, early trial of its patent infringement claim. Over In-notron\u2019s objection, the district court ordered that the patent issues \u201cwill be severed and tried first before the antitrust issues,\u201d but did not stay discovery in the antitrust case. The court set discovery to close in the patent case in June 1986, and in the antitrust case on August 31, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-15\">Innotron answered Abbott's complaint on July 17, 1985, acknowledging district court jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a), denying infringement, and asserting as affirmative defenses that the \u2019762 patent was invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(b) and 103, and that the \u2019762 patent was unenforceable because of inequitable conduct in the PTO (concealment of adverse tests and misrepresentation of prior art), and because the patent had been misused in an illegal tie-in. Innotron accompanied its answer with an antitrust counterclaim in which it repeated verbatim all those affirmative defenses, adding allegations of relevant market, predatory intent, and that Abbott knew its patent was invalid under \u00a7 103 when it sued for infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-16\">On September 20, 1985, Innotron amended its original antitrust complaint, by adding the same allegations as those in its counterclaim, and demanded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-17\">When Innotron refused Abbott\u2019s suggestion that the antitrust counterclaim and the patent issues be separately tried, Abbott moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b) to \u201csever\u201d and \u201cseparately try\u201d the patent issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>On November 25, 1985, a hearing was held at which the court\u2019s \u201ctentative ruling\u201d to \u201csever\u201d was fully briefed by the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Innotron argued that: (1) its affirmative defenses of patent invalidity and un-enforceability were so factually interwoven with its antitrust counterclaim as to preclude effective separation; (2) separation of interwoven issues would be a denial of a fair trial; and (3) separation would be burdensome because this litigation has placed it in straitened financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">Abbott responded that denying separation would: (1) require extended delay of the patent trial, because discovery on the increasingly broad and complex antitrust issues was not even scheduled to be complete for well over a year; (2) unduly complicate presentation of the patent issues; and (3) reverse the court\u2019s earlier rulings. Abbott also argued that trial of the patent issues would render it unnecessary to try many of Innotron\u2019s antitrust claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">On November 27, 1985, the district court ordered the issues in Innotron\u2019s counterclaim separated for trial, Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b), from the patent issues. It further ordered Innotron\u2019s counterclaim consolidated with Innotron\u2019s original antitrust complaint for trial following trial of the patent issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">On January 2,1986, Innotron filed a petition for writ of mandamus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking that the district court be ordered to reconsolidate the antitrust counterclaim for trial with the patent issues. Saying the Ninth Circuit had exclusive jurisdiction over its petition, Innotron argued that the separation order was issued under the district court\u2019s inherent authority to govern the order of claims and evidence presented, and was therefore within the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201csupervisory authority\u201d over the district courts within its region. On January 17, 1986, Abbott filed a motion to dismiss the petition, saying this court had exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">On March 11, 1986, the Ninth Circuit issued this order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-14\">This request for mandamus relief should be considered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The petition is denied without prejudice to renewal if the Federal Circuit determines that it has no jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295; <em>In re Precision Screen Machines, Inc., </em>729 F.2d 1429 [sic, 1428, 221 USPQ 1034] (Fed.Cir.1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-15\">\n<em>Issues Presented</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-16\">(1) Whether this court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-17\">(2) Whether this court will entertain the present petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-18\">(3) Whether the petition must be granted because the district court abused its discretion in ordering a separate trial of the patent issues and those raised in Innotron\u2019s antitrust counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1183-19\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-20\">(1) <em>Appellate Jurisdiction Over the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-21\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction over Abbott\u2019s patent infringement complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>No. 85-2614, was based \u201cin whole\u201d on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). The district court\u2019s order consolidating that complaint with Innotron\u2019s earlier filed antitrust complaint, No. 85-2207, was entirely procedural, <em>see Cole v. Schenley Industries, Inc., </em>563 F.2d 35, 38 (2d Cir.1977), and in no way ousted the district court of jurisdiction over that complaint under \u00a7 1338(a). At the time the district court issued the separation order, therefore, jurisdiction of the entire consolidated case was based \u201cin part\u201d on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). Hence this court has exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from the final judgment in the case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1); <em>see Interpart Corp. v. Imos Italia, </em>777 F.2d 678, 680-81, 228 U.S.P.Q. 124, 125-26 (Fed.Cir.1985); <em>see also Atari, Inc. v. JS &amp; A Group, Inc., </em>747 F.2d 1422, 1430, 223 U.S.P.Q. 1074, 1080 (Fed.Cir.1984) (in banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">The briefs contain substantial discussion about who-filed-what-first and about labels attachable to particular filings. When the smoke is cleared, however, three facts stand forth: (1) this is one lawsuit; (2) its outcome will be substantially governed by considerations unique to the field of patent law; and (3) the decision on this petition is governed by patent law considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">In <em>Atari, </em>this court left open, because it was not before us, the question of whether the filing and presence of a non-frivolous complaint for patent infringement, and its consolidation with a suit based on a non-patent claim, would create appellate jurisdiction in this court over an appeal from the final judgment in the case. In <em>Inter-part, </em>we closed that door, answering in the affirmative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">Abbott elected to assert patent infringement in a separate complaint, but, as Inno-tron argued, that claim may also have been filed as a counterclaim. The district court's consolidation of the cases produced the same status as that which would have obtained if Abbott had filed its patent claim as a counterclaim. As Innotron now argues before us, the resulting position is the same, and the district court, in consolidating the cases, characterized Abbott\u2019s suit as a \u201ccounterclaim.\u201d It would, of course, be incongruous to hold that consolidation of a separate suit, as in <em>Interpart, </em>is distinct, in relation to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, from the presence of a counterclaim raising the same allegations of patent infringement that are not \u201cimmaterial, inferential, [or] frivolous,\u201d or a \u201cmere joinder.\u201d S.Rep. No. 275, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1981), <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 11, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">Thus, whether allegations of patent infringement be filed and maintained as a viable, non-frivolous counterclaim in a non-patent case, or as a separate complaint which is then consolidated with the non-patent case, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is based \u201cin part\u201d on \u00a7 1338(a) and this court must exercise its exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the entire case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Thus the mere labeling and sequencing of pleadings in the trial tribunal cannot be allowed to control every exercise of this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Nor can the mere presence in a case of \u201cissues\u201d other than those within a substantive field within this court\u2019s exclusive appellate jurisdiction serve to oust this court of the jurisdiction it must and would otherwise exercise in carrying out its mission. <em>See Atari, </em>747 F.2d at 1436, 223 U.S.P.Q. at 1084 (\u201c \u2018cases\u2019 will be within the jurisdiction of this court\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>This court, therefore, has exclusive jurisdiction over any appeal from the final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">(2) <em>Authority to Entertain the Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"axd-dedup-0\">Citing this court\u2019s indications that it lacks \u201csupervisory authority\u201d over the district courts, Innotron says this court has no authority to grant writs of mandamus relating to what it calls \u201cprocedural\u201d orders separating issues for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Arguing that \u201csupervisory authority\u201d accompanies appellate jurisdiction over the final judgment, Abbott says this court has the same supervisory authority as that of the regional circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">We reject both extremes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">The mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, is not an independent statutory grant of jurisdiction. <em>Baker Perkins, Inc. v. Warner &amp; Pfleiderer Corp., </em>710 F.2d 1561, 1565, 218 U.S.P.Q. 577, 579 (Fed.Cir.1983). The statutory grant of jurisdiction to each regional court of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1294, provides appellate jurisdiction over judgments of district courts located within its geographical circuit \u201c[e]xcept as provided in sections 1292(c), 1292(d), and 1295 of this title.\u201d With respect to district courts, the grant to this court is found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1295(a)(1) and 1295(a)(2), which provide appellate jurisdiction of judgments of any district court when the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, (The Little Ticker Act) respectively, and in \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(C) when the action was filed in the district court as authorized in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 145 or 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">Mandamus was traditionally employed \u201cto confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d <em>Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, </em>319 U.S. 21, 26, 63 S.Ct. 938, 941, 87 L.Ed. 1185 (1943); <em>see also Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 382, 74 S.Ct. 145, 147, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953). However, the regional courts of appeals have increasingly employed the writ in implementing their supervision of district courts. <em>See </em>Annot., 57 L.Ed.2d 1203 (1979); Note, <em>Supervisory and Advisory Mandamus Under the All Writs Act, </em>86 Harv.L.Rev. 595 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-14\">Use of mandamus in exercising \u201csupervisory authority\u201d has been approved \u201cin proper circumstances\u201d by the Supreme Court. <em>La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., </em>352 U.S. 249, 255, 77 S.Ct. 309, 313, 1 L.Ed.2d 290 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-15\">In <em>La Buy, </em>however, the Court was dealing with a court having appellate jurisdiction over judgments of district courts whose <em>location </em>is within its circuit, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 41, not with this court, whose appellate jurisdiction over judgments of district courts is determined by the basis for the district court\u2019s <em>jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-16\">Thus the key phrases useful in determining whether this court will entertain petitions to mandamus a district court are \u201cin aid of its jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7 1651 and the Supreme Court\u2019s reference to \u201cin proper circumstances\u201d in <em>La Buy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-17\"><em>(a) \u201cIn Aid of Its Jurisdiction </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-18\">Where this court would have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final judgment, it clearly has power under \u00a7 1651 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>overturn a district court order that would prevent that appeal or would otherwise frustrate this court\u2019s exercise of its proper jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That much is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">More troublesome are petitions seeking to overturn district court orders that would not necessarily frustrate this court's appellate jurisdiction. Such petitions may be categorized as: (1) those implicating responsibilities of regional circuit courts for supervising, administering, overseeing, and managing the courts within the circuit (e.g., assignment of judges, adjustment of calendars, transfer of case to another district, reference to master); (2) those that arise in all types of cases, but do not directly implicate the patent or Little Tucker Ast doctrinal jurisprudence of this court (e.g., disqualification of counsel); and (3) those that do directly implicate, or are intimately bound up with and controlled by, the patent and Tucker Act doctrinal jurisprudential responsibilities of this court (e.g., separate trial of patent issues; refusal to apply 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282; court-ordered tests for utility).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">As discussed below, this court has disavowed \u201csupervisory\u201d authority over the district courts. In so doing, this court also recognized that a writ would not be \u201cin aid of its jurisdiction\u201d if issued on petitions in categories (1) and (2). The court might very well, however, aid its jurisdiction (and its mission as well) when it issues a writ in response to a petition in category (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The present petition challenges an order intimately bound up with and controlled by the law of patents (e.g., the relationship of patent infringement defenses to allegations in \u201cpatent type antitrust\u201d claims). Correct understanding and application of that law are required in the district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. The nature, length, and complexity of the record on appeal can be directly affected by whether the challenged separation order is overturned. The petition is thus within category (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">In sum, this court will entertain petitions for writs in relation to an order separating or refusing to separate patent issues for trial, because such writs could be in aid of this court\u2019s jurisdiction, and Innotron\u2019s argument that this court\u2019s disavowal of \u201csupervisory authority\u201d requires transfer of this petition to the Ninth Circuit is unavailing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">\n<em>(b) \u201cIn Proper Circumstances\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-13\">Similarly unavailing is Abbott\u2019s argument that this court has supervisory authority to issue any writ where, as here, it has appellate jurisdiction, for the court has carved out areas in which, on considerations of policy, comity, and its place in the judicial system, it <em>should not </em>entertain petitions for writs. In so doing, it has limited the exercise of its power to cases involving the \u201cproper circumstances\u201d referred to without detailed description in <em>La Buy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-14\">Though this court has employed different phrases in deciding whether to entertain petitions for mandamus, the cases cited in the accompanying footnote reflect the presence and absence of \u201cproper circumstances\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>This court recognized that <em>administration, supervision, management, </em>and <em>overseeing </em>of the courts within a regional circuit are the sole province of that regional circuit and its Circuit Council. Unlike those bodies, this court is not an \u201cadministrator,\u201d \u201csupervisor,\u201d \u201cmanager,\u201d or \u201coverseer\u201d of the district courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence this court said it lacked the general authority set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 332, and that it lacked \u201cadministrative authority,\u201d \u201cdirect supervisory authority,\u201d and \u201cgeneral authority.\u201d Those phrases were aimed primarily at petitions in category (1), because this court has no congressionally granted authority to inject itself into the businesslike elements of the administration of justice within the regional circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">Those phrases have also been employed in refusing to entertain petitions in category (2), because this court desired to avoid imposition on a district court of guidance that might differ from the guidance provided by that court\u2019s regional circuit in relation to the same procedural rulings in other types of cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">Whether and under what sets of facts patent issues should be separated for trial, though a procedural matter, raises a question that does not fall within the general administrative area of court business that must remain, in all cases, including patent cases, the sole province of the regional circuits. Further, that question arises only in patent cases and not in cases over which the regional circuit courts exercise appellate jurisdiction. Hence no potential exists for burdening the district courts with different guidance on substantive law, and the potential for different guidance on procedure is minimal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">In sum, the \u201cproper circumstances\u201d warranting entertainment by this court of petitions for writs to a district court in a patent case are those, and only those, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>which the patent jurisprudence of this court plays a significant role.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Those circumstances may or may not be present in a future case. They are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">The present petition challenges an order implicating the jurisprudential responsibilities of this court in the field of patent law. \u201cPatent type antitrust\u201d counterclaims are routinely filed in response to patent infringement complaints. If petitions for writs challenging separation for trial orders in such cases were directed to twelve regional circuits, a risk of differing resolutions (and consequent forum shopping) would be created. The provision of uniform guidance on just and expeditious resolution of patent validity and infringement issues, by separation for trial of complex, time-consuming, costly, and potentially moot antitrust issues, is clearly within the congressionally envisioned role of this court, i.e., to contribute to doctrinal stability in the field of patent law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">The challenge presented in the present petition thus constitutes a \u201cproper circumstance\u201d warranting entertainment of the petition by this court. That a petition is appropriately entertained by this court, however, does not mean that it will be granted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">3. <em>Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">It may contribute to the elucidation of the question to note that the present case involves two species of antitrust claims. One may be described as \u201cpure\u201d Sherman Act claims, e.g., those set forth in Innotron\u2019s original complaint. The other may be described as \u201cpatent type antitrust\u201d claims, e.g., those set forth in Inno-tron\u2019s counterclaim and in the amendment of its original complaint, (e.g., enforcement of patent knowingly obtained through inequitable conduct, tie-in with the patent of unpatented products). The present petition concerns only a \u201cpatent type antitrust\u201d counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">Rule 42(b) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-12\">The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">In deciding whether one trial or separate trials will best serve the convenience of the parties and the court, avoid prejudice, and minimize expense and delay, the major consideration is directed toward the choice most likely to result in a just final disposition of the litigation, <em>see </em>9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2388 (1971). In the present instance, the district court followed precisely that guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-14\">The district court noted cases reflecting the now-standard practice of separating for trial patent issues and those raised in an antitrust counterclaim. Abbott has cited twenty-three of those cases from eight regional circuits. Innotron\u2019s sole response is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>the mere assertion that it filed its original antitrust complaint first. The assertion is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">First, Innotron focuses here on separation of its antitrust counterclaim and not at all on separation of its original antitrust claim. Innotron accompanied its one mention of the court\u2019s prior separation of its Sherman Act issues with the specific statement that \u201cthe order from which Innotron seeks relief concerns Innotron\u2019s counterclaims,\u201d in which Innotron says Abbott \u201cfraudulently\u201d procured and in bad faith enforced its patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">Second, of the applicable considerations (expedition, economy, prejudice, convenience, expense, a just final disposition, preservation of the right to jury trial), none is affected in the slightest by the circumstance of Innotron\u2019s having filed its original Sherman Act antitrust complaint first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">Third, Innotron\u2019s \u201cpatent type\u201d antitrust counterclaim filed in response to Abbott\u2019s complaint for patent infringement is indistinguishable from such counterclaims filed in response to complaints for patent infringement in the twenty-three cases cited by Abbott.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">Moreover, it is clear that the present separation order was appropriate for the same reasons listed in the cases Abbott cites: (1) Economy is served because in the trial of the patent issues the validity of the patent and Innotron\u2019s affirmative defenses will be determined and will become law of the case and thus removed from trial on the original antitrust issues; (2) Convenience of all is served in trying the less complex patent issues first; (3) Expedition is served because the patent issues on the present schedule will be ready for trial more than a year before the antitrust issues can be made ready;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (4) Avoidance of prejudice and confusion is served in trying first the patent issues, without injecting the different counterclaim issues which require different proof and different witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">Innotron blows hot and cold, stating at one point (incorrectly) that resolution of the patent issues can affect only a minuscule portion of its antitrust counterclaim, and at another point (correctly) that most of the facts and issues in the patent trial are overwhelmingly intertwined and overlapping with those in its antitrust counterclaim. Innotron put identical charts in each of its two memoranda to illustrate the substantial identity of its affirmative defenses and many of the allegations in its antitrust counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">Indeed, Innotron repeatedly states: <em>\u201cEach of these affirmative defenses also forms the basis of an Innotron antritrust counterclaim filed in the patent case\u201d </em>(emphasis Innotron\u2019s); \u201cThe Innotron antitrust counterclaims ... rest on precisely the same evidence as Innotron\u2019s affirmative defenses;\u201d and \u201cthe antitrust counterclaims separated ... are based on the same facts as the patent issues.\u201d Thus its own statements make clear that Innotron will have in the patent trial a determination on all of the basic evidence and facts on which its claim of \u201cpatent type\u201d antitrust violation is based. If it prevails at the trial on its affirmative defenses it need not again prove the same issues at the antitrust trial. Innotron\u2019s entire and extended argument, insisting on the substantial identity of the facts and evidence supporting its affirmative defenses and its antitrust counterclaim, is thus self-defeating. It clearly cannot serve to require the court to accept the delay and complexification of the patent trial that would result from a grant of its petition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>Innotron devotes major segments of its memoranda to an assertion that the challenged order constitutes a denial of its constitutional right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The argument is without merit. First, it is based on Innotron\u2019s false assumption that the same issues tried in the patent case will be tried again in the antitrust case. Second, separate jury trials are appropriate where the issues to be tried in each are, as here, \u201cdistinct and separable,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>cf. Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., </em>283 U.S. 494, 500, 51 S.Ct. 513, 515, 75 L.Ed. 1188 (1931), and when, as here, separate trials would not constitute a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d infringement of the constitutional right to a fair trial. <em>See Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 148, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953). Third, even in the unlikely event that the same testimony and documents may be placed before two juries, Innotron\u2019s argument would nonetheless fail, for it has been well said that \u201cthe prohibition is not against having two juries review the same <em>evidence, </em>but rather against having two juries <em>decide </em>the same <em>essential issues.\u201d Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis, Inc. v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>587 F.Supp. 1112, 1117, 223 U.S.P.Q. 888, 892 (D.Del.1984) (emphasis in original). Fourth, there is no danger, contrary to Innotron\u2019s assertion, of inconsistent jury verdicts and, as the district court found, the potential for jury confusion would be lessened, not increased, by separate trials on the patent and antitrust issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">In sum, the challenged order will <em>enhance </em>the <em>parties\u2019 </em>right to jury trial by making the issues the jury must consider less complex. The order therefore fully passes muster under the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, and the district court clearly did not deny Innotron\u2019s right to fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">Innotron has failed to show the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d necessary to justify the writ sought and to meet its burden of establishing that its right to the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 96, 88 S.Ct. 269, 274, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967). On the contrary, in issuing the challenged order separating the patent issues for trial, the district court in no manner abused its discretion, acted on ample authority in the cases, and contributed to the potential for the fairest and most expeditious resolution of all claims of both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">Accordingly, it is ordered:</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-11\">That the petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">. The parties consistently, and the district court on occasion, have used \u201csever\u201d and \"separate\u201d as synonyms.
