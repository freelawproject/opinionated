She applied to the BIA for Indian higher education grants, but her application was denied because she does not meet the eligibility criterion under 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1 (1986), which provides that an applicant must possess an Indian blood quantum of at least one-quarter degree to be eligible. After exhausting her administrative remedies, she brought this action in the district court to compel the agency to authorize the grant. Zarr contends that the application of the regulation to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>violates her right to equal protection and that the regulation was invalidly promulgated. The district court granted summary judgment for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">We are confronted with the question of the present validity of an administrative regulation\u2019s eligibility standard, when the statute under which the standard was purportedly promulgated has been amended to provide a more inclusive standard of eligibility. We hold that the BIA\u2019s continued restrictive application of the one-quarter degree Indian blood standard is not in accordance with the law, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-6\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Ashton v. Cory, </em>780 F.2d 816, 818 (9th Cir.1986). The reviewing court must determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the substantive law was correctly applied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1590-7\">\u201cPrior to reaching any constitutional questions, federal courts must consider nonconstitutional ground[s] for decision.\u201d <em>Jean v. Nelson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2992, 2997, 86 L.Ed.2d 664 (1985) (citations omitted). This is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint. <em>Id. </em>at 2998 (citing <em>Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P.C., </em>467 U.S. 138, 104 S.Ct. 2267, 81 L.Ed.2d 113 (1984)). Thus, we first consider Zarr\u2019s challenge to the BIA's promulgation of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-10\">A challenged regulation will be set aside if \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). In determining whether agency action is arbitrary or capricious, the reviewing court must determine whether there has been a clear error of judgment and whether the agency action was based on a consideration of the relevant factors. <em>Nance v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>645 F.2d 701, 705 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1081, 102 S.Ct. 635, 70 L.Ed.2d 615 (1981). In addition, an administrative regulation must fall within the authority conferred by Congress on the administering agency. <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 308, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1720, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). Such grant of authority need not be specific: \u201cWhat is important is that ... the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulation needs to be reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation. <em>California v. Block, </em>663 F.2d 855, 860 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-12\">Administrative agencies are entitled to great deference in interpreting statutes under their authority. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). To sustain the regulation, the court \u201cneed not find that its construction is the only reasonable one, or even that it is the result [the court] would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Unemployment Compensation Commission of Alaska v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S.Ct. 245, 250, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946)). The regulation need only be \u201ca reasonable interpretation\u201d of the relevant statute. <em>Aluminum Co. of America v. Central Lincoln Peoples\u2019 Utility District, </em>467 U.S. 380, 389, 104 S.Ct. 2472, 2479, 81 L.Ed.2d 301 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-13\">On the other hand, in order for an agency interpretation to be granted deference, it must remain consistent with congressional purpose. <em>See Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 232 &amp; 237, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1073 &amp; 1075, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Finally, acts passed for the benefit of Indians must be liberally construed, with doubtful or ambiguous expressions resolved in the Indians\u2019 favor. <em>Bryan v. Itasca County, </em>426 U.S. 373, 392, 96 S.Ct. 2102, 2112, 48 L.Ed.2d 710 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-14\">1. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-15\">Zarr\u2019s application for a higher education grant was denied by the BIA for failure to meet the eligibility requirements of 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>[f]unds appropriated by Congress for the education of Indians may be used for making educational loans and grants to aid students of one-fourth or more degree of Indian blood attending accredited institutions of higher education or other accredited schools offering vocational and technical training who reside within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations under the jurisdiction of the [BIA]....<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-4\">Zarr contends that this regulation was promulgated and is administered without congressional authorization or ratification, and that it is not in accordance with law. The BIA relies on a number of statutes for direct and indirect authority for the promulgation and administration of the one-quarter degree Indian blood restriction. We first look to the administrative regulation and its enabling legislation to determine whether the regulation falls within the authority conferred upon the administering agency, <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. at 302, 99 S.Ct. at 1717, and whether the regulation is reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation. <em>California v. Block, </em>663 F.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-5\">Title 25 C.F.R. Part 40, which includes the challenged regulation, section 40.1, is entitled \u201cADMINISTRATION OF EDUCATIONAL LOANS, GRANTS AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION.\u201d Section 40.1\u2019s predecessor, which contained the identical one-quarter degree Indian blood eligibility requirement, was first promulgated in 1957 as section 32.1 of Title 25. 22 Fed.Reg. 10,533 (1957). An introductory note denominated \u201cAUTHORITY\u201d preceding section 32.1 expressly states that the regulation was promulgated under authority of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Part 40 continues to cite 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471 as its enabling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-10\">Section 471 was enacted by Congress on June 18, 1934 as part of the comprehensive Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 461-479 (1982), and provides simply for the appropriation of a sum of money \u201cfor loans to Indians for the payment of tuition and other expenses in recognized vocational and trade schools.\u201d We observe that section 471 appropriates moneys for loans; nowhere in that section is there an appropriation for or an authorization of expenditure of moneys for grants. Likewise, subsequent acts of amendatory legislation affecting expenditures of moneys under section 471 refer only to loans. <em>See, e.g., </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 (Act of May 7, 1949 \u2014 revolving loan fund); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 (Indian Financing Act \u2014 same). Thus it would seem from the plain language of section 471 that the provision does not confer authority upon the BIA to distribute moneys for higher education grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-12\">Nevertheless, we find congressional authority for the grant program. Even if section 471 does not authorize expenditure of moneys for educational grants, the Snyder Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, provides sufficient authority for the Secretary to spend money for educational programs that would encompass higher education grants. The Snyder Act \u201cprovides the underlying congressional authority for most BIA activities,\u201d <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. at 205-06, 94 S.Ct. at 1059-60, and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>The Bureau of Indian Affairs, under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, shall direct, supervise, and expend such moneys as Congress may ... appropriate, for the benefit, care, and assistance of the Indians throughout the United States for the following purposes: General support and civilization, including education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (enacted Nov. 2, 1921) (emphasis added). Indeed, the Secretary now relies, in part, on the Snyder Act for the promulgation of the one-quarter degree Indian blood requirement. We shall address those arguments in Part 2 of our opinion. For present purposes, we hold that the BIA\u2019s incorrect citation of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471 as authorizing a regulation for a grant program is not fatal to the validity of the regulation where the authority is manifest in another statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-5\">This conclusion does not resolve the question of the one-quarter degree Indian blood requirement, however, for aside from the broadly inclusive \u201cIndians throughout the United States\u201d provision, the Snyder Act contains no additional definition of who is considered an eligible Indian for Snyder Act purposes. Nor does this conclusion make further discussion of section 471 unnecessary. The BIA has twice cited that section for authority in promulgating the challenged regulation, and we believe it did so for a reason. Further, the BIA continues to rely on section 471 in its briefs. Thus, we next examine the history of section 471 to ascertain whether that section now provides authority for the BIA\u2019s requirement of a one-quarter degree Indian blood eligibility restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\">There is no definition in section 471 of who is an Indian, nor is there an eligibility criterion contained in that section. Section 479 of the Indian Reorganization Act does provide a definition, however, and states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-7\">[t]he term \u201cIndian\u201d as used in section[] ... 471 ... of this title shall include all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-10\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 479. As a person of Indian descent who is a member of a recognized tribe, Zarr qualifies under this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-11\">On May 10, 1939, section 480 was added, providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-12\">[o]n and after May 10, 1939 no individual of less than one-quarter degree of Indian blood shall be eligible for a loan from funds made available in accordance with the provisions of section[ ] ... 471____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-13\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 480. Further, in May 1948, Congress created a revolving loan fund, which authorized the Secretary to prescribe regulations to make loans from the funds established under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, \u201cProvided, That no portion of these funds shall be loaned to Indians of less than one-quarter Indian blood.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-14\">Thus, it is clear that until May 1939, an Indian of Zarr\u2019s blood quantum would have been included within Congress\u2019 definition of an eligible Indian for programs administered under section 471. It is also clear that after May 1939, under section 480, an Indian of Vs2d degree blood quantum would be excluded from any program operating under the authority of section 471. Therefore, when the BIA promulgated the predecessor regulation to 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1 in 1957, it was clearly acting within the scope of the authority granted by Congress in restricting loans to Indians of one-quarter or more degree Indian blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-15\">It would also have been reasonable in 1957 for the BIA to rely on congressional approval of a one-quarter degree Indian blood restriction as expressed in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 480 and 482 for restricting grants to Indians of one-quarter blood or more. Although the BIA could not promulgate a grant program under section 471, which only authorizes loans, the grant program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>would survive under the authority granted by the Snyder Act. The BIA could not look to the Snyder Act for a one-quarter degree Indian blood restriction, however, for that act contains no such restriction. Section 471, as amended by sections 480 and 482, does provide authority for a one-quarter degree Indian blood restriction, so the BIA could reasonably rely on section 471 and its amendatory legislation to restrict higher education grants to Indians of one-quarter or more degree Indian blood. The rational is based on the recognition that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a3q-dedup-0\">power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created and funded program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress. In the area of Indian affairs, the Executive has long been empowered to promulgate rules and policies, and the power has been given explicitly to the Secretary and his delegates at the BIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\"><em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. at 231, 94 S.Ct. at 1072 (footnotes omitted); <em>see also </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 2 (1982). The Snyder Act nowhere contains a definition of Indian or any restrictive eligibility standard; therefore, it would have been reasonable for the BIA to look to other expressions of congressional intent in formulating an eligibility standard to \u201cfill the gap.\u201d This does not end the analysis, however, for agency power to make rules carries with it the responsibility to remain consistent with governing legislation, <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. at 232, 94 S.Ct. at 1073, and as we discuss, Congress has since changed the governing legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-6\">In April 1974, Congress enacted the Indian Financing Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1451-1543 (1982). Section 1461 of the Financing Act provides for the administration under a single Indian Revolving Loan fund of a number of separate Indian financing programs, including programs authorized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (which includes 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471). Section 1462 specifically authorizes loans for education purposes. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462. Section 1452 of the Indian Financing Act provides definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-9\">For the purpose of this chapter, the term\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-10\">(b) \u201cIndian\u201d means any person who is a member of any Indian tribe ... which is recognized by the Federal Government ' as eligible for services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-11\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 .1452 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, section 471 Indian loan programs were brought under the single umbrella revolving loan fund, and for purposes of that program, which includes provision for educational loans, the term \u201cIndian\u201d was redefined to mean any person who is a member of a federally recognized tribe. It is clear that after 1974, Congress intended that persons like Zarr, who are enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe, should be eligible to participate in programs promulgated under the authority of the enumerated sections, including section 471. <em>Hughes Air Corp. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>644 F.2d 1334, 1337 (9th Cir.1981) (to determine the intent of Congress, courts must look first to the plain meaning of the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-12\">The legislative history of the 1974 Indian Financing Act supports this conclusion and demonstrates that Congress intended to establish a uniform statutory standard for administering BIA loan funds.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-13\">Title I [of the Indian Financing Act] consolidates the four existing Indian revolving loan funds administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs____ It additionally provides a statutory structure for the programs, most of which is [sic] currently implemented through administrative rules and regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-15\">H.R.Rep. No. 907, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2873, 2875 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-16\">The BIA attempts to dismiss the effect of the Indian Financing Act of 1974<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>asserting that this legislation did not specifically repeal the blood quantum eligibility standards established by sections 480 and 482.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This argument is specious, for the plain meaning and clear intent of the language contained in section 1452 is to redefine who is an \u201cIndian\u201d for purposes of consolidating the administration of numerous funding programs under the Indian Financing Act\u2019s uniform standard. This conclusion is obvious, whether we construe the Indian Financing Act as an amendment to or as an implied repeal of inconsistent provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act. <em>See </em>1A N. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 22.22, 22.30 (C. Sands 4th ed. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\">The BIA also contends that sections 471, 480, and 482 read together remain the source of authority for the blood quantum standard promulgated in 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1. Again, this construction ignores the plain language and intent of the Indian Financing Act, and the agency is not free to ignore the statute and continue to administer the various loan programs under whatever standard it believes is correct or expedient. An agency\u2019s power to make rules that affect substantial individual rights carries with it the responsibility to remain consistent with governing legislation, <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. at 232, 94 S.Ct. at 1073, and the BIA\u2019s eligibility standard is no longer consistent with that of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">The BIA further argues that even if loan eligibility can no longer be based upon one-fourth blood degree pursuant to the Indian Financing Act, it is reasonable to base eligibility for outright grants, which have no payback requirements, on the more restrictive standard. We note, however, that the express language of the BIA\u2019s regulation establishes a one-quarter degree blood quantum eligibility criterion for both \u201ceducational loans and grants.\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1. The BIA was aware of the import of congressional redefinition of an eligible Indian for educational loans, <em>see supra </em>note 5, but the agency did not correct the outmoded eligibility standard for \u201ceducational loans and grants\u201d contained in 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1. Moreover, to the extent that the BIA is relying on 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471, its argument fails because section 471 and its amendatory provisions do not authorize grants. To the extent that the agency relies on the Snyder Act, the Snyder Act itself contains no restrictive eligibility standards, and the BIA has not expressly promulgated a one-quarter degree Indian blood standard for such a Snyder Act program. <em>See infra </em>Part 2. Further, the BIA does not offer any explanation why such a construction is reasonable, or how making distinctions based upon differing degrees of blood quanta among Indians who are members of federally recognized tribes furthers Congress\u2019 intent as expressed in the 1974 Indian Financing Act concerning expenditure of moneys appropriated for the benefit of Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-8\">To summarize, the BIA promulgated the challenged regulation under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471, and that statute comes under the Indian Financing Act\u2019s coverage, including its definition of who is an Indian for purposes of the Act. The BIA\u2019s more restrictive definition of who is an Indian eligible to participate in the higher education grant program, although valid when the regulation was first promulgated in 1957, is now contrary to Congress\u2019 definition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the BIA\u2019s eligibility stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>dard does not fall within the current authority conferred by Congress. To the contrary, the regulation defeats the congressional purpose expressed in the 1974 Indian Financing Act of redefining eligible Indians under a more inclusive standard and establishing a statutory structure for programs previously implemented through administrative rules and regulations. Thus, we hold that the regulation is not in accordance with the governing legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-5\">2. The Snyder Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-6\">The BIA next contends that the Secretary acted within his authority under the Snyder Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, in rejecting Zarr\u2019s application. The BIA argues that the grant program to which Zarr applied is a Snyder Act program. Although we have held that the BIA could have promulgated the grant program under the Snyder Act, we do not necessarily conclude that the BIA in fact relied on the Snyder Act in promulgating the one-quarter degree Indian blood restriction. As discussed in Part 1, <em>supra, </em>the BIA cites the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471, not the Snyder Act, as its source of authority in promulgating 25 C.F.R. Part 40. When the BIA intends to promulgate regulations under the Snyder Act, it knows how to do so. <em>Compare </em>25 C.F.R. Part 20, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAM, which specifically cites the Snyder Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, for its source of authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The BIA\u2019s reliance on the Snyder Act is a post hoc attempt to supply a foundation for the agency\u2019s regulation. Although we give deference to administrative agencies when they interpret statutes and regulations under their authority, <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. at 16, 85 S.Ct. at 801, in this case we must give at least equal, if not controlling, deference to the agency\u2019s express recitation of the source of its authority when it first promulgated the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-10\">In buttressing its Snyder Act argument, the BIA contends that \u201cCongress\u2019 own use of a one-fourth blood degree standard for Indian educational assistance [in] 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 297 demonstrates that the Secretary\u2019s promulgation of the identical standard under the Snyder Act is reasonable.\u201d Section 297 does impose limitations on expenditures to educate children \u201cof less than one-fourth Indian blood,\u201d but it applies only to expenditures in BIA Indian day schools. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 297 (enacted May 25, 1918). In the district court, the BIA argued that section 297 was \u201c[f]oremost among the statutes requiring a one-quarter Indian blood degree,\u201d and that \u201cthis eligibility standard is likewise required by \u00a7 297 to apply to all appropriations \u2018used to educate\u2019 otherwise eligible Indians.\u201d (Emphasis by BIA). On appeal, however, the BIA correctly \u201cdo[es] not contend ... that 25 U.S.C. 297 provides direct authority for promulgation of Indian higher education grant [one-quarter degree] eligibility standards.\u201d It is clear that section 297 is inapplicable to Indian higher education grant programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-11\">Of greater import, on December 28,1985, Pub.L. No. 99-228 was enacted, repealing section 297 and its one-quarter degree Indian blood standard. 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 297 (West Supp.1986). In its stead, Congress amended 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2008(f) to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acj\">In this section \u201celigible Indian student\u201d means a student who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1595-12\">(1) is a member of or is at least a Vi degree Indian blood descendant of a member of an Indian tribe which is eligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>ble for the special programs and services provided ... through the Bureau of Indian Affairs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1596-4\">25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2008(f) (West Supp.1986) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-5\">The legislative history of this repeal and amendment convincingly reveals that Congress now rejects, if it had not done so earlier, a single one-quarter degree Indian blood eligibility restriction. The remarks accompanying the bill\u2019s introduction demonstrate that Congress is concerned that a one-quarter degree blood quantum without more is an impermissible racial classification. The bill\u2019s sponsor made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1596-6\">I introduced this bill for various reasons, including the fact that for all BIA services, except education, membership in a federally recognized tribe is the sole criteria for eligibility. Second, the Congress has passed at least six major acts since 1918 dealing with education or eligibility for services and in each of those tribal membership is the criteria. It simply makes no sense now to change a practice that has continued for- over half a century in a way that will discriminate, by race, against certain children, and to use as justification an old law that has been repealed by implication on at least six occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1596-7\">131 Cong.Rec. 17,649 (1985) (statement by Senator Melcher introducing S. 1621) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 180, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>1985 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2672 (\u201cS. 1621 is intended to bring consistency to the eligibility criteria used for BIA programs.\u201d). Thus, it is clear that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 297 cannot serve to justify continued application of the challenged regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-8\">Even if the Snyder Act, considered broadly, can be construed as additional or alternative authority for the challenged regulation, we believe that it cannot be construed to provide authority for the continued use of the one-quarter degree Indian blood eligibility requirement in this case. Assuming that the BIA relied sub silentio on the Snyder Act to authorize higher education grants when it first promulgated 25 C.F.R. Part 40, it appears that the agency looked to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 471 for authorization of the restrictive one-quarter degree Indian blood standard. As we have discussed, the BIA could not have looked to the Snyder Act for a restrictive definition or eligibility standard, for it contains none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-10\">Where Congress has determined to make Indian blood quantum an eligibility factor in the past, it has expressly so provided. <em>See, e.g., </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7 297. It did not do so in the Snyder Act, and we refuse to construe its general language authorizing appropriations for educational assistance for \u201cthe Indians throughout the United States\u201d as authority to continue restrictive distinctions among members of federally recognized tribes. To make such a construction would be at odds with recent expressions of congressional intent to establish a uniform inclusive standard for BIA funded programs, as manifested by the Indian Financing Act, and particularly with respect to Indian education programs, <em>e.g., </em>Pub.L. No. 99-228. In the absence of express language in the Snyder Act demonstrating that Congress intended to make distinctions among Indians who are tribal members but who have different degrees of Indian blood, it would thwart every indication of congressional intent to permit the BIA to rely on its power to \u201cfill any gap left\u201d by Congress, <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. at 231, 94 S.Ct. at 1072, to support its use of the discredited restrictive standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-11\">Such a construction would also be at odds with the BIA\u2019s other Snyder Act programs. Where the BIA has promulgated regulations expressly on the authority of the Snyder Act, it has used an enrolled membership or alternatively an Indian blood standard. <em>See supra </em>note 8. We observe that the BIA itself, in an analogous context, has recently rejected the limiting one-quarter criterion in favor of a more inclusive eligibility standard, by defining an Indian as a person \u201cwho is an enrolled member ... or a descendant of one-fourth degree or more Indian blood of an enrolled member and any person not a member of the ... tribes who possesses at least one-half degree of Indian blood____\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>25 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.1(i) (1986) (emphasis added) in Part 27, VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR ADULT INDIANS. The BIA explained that \u201cParagraph (i) of sec. 27.1, definition of \u2018Indian\u2019, has been changed to conform to the most recent standard Bureau definition.\u201d 49 Fed.Reg. 2100 (1984) (emphasis added). <em>See also supra </em>notes 1, 7, and 8. There is no logical explanation why an antiquated standard should apply to Zarr.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-4\">Finally, to the extent that there is any ambiguity concerning the interpretation and co-application of the 1921 Snyder Act, the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, the 1974 Indian Financing Act, and the 1985 repeal of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 297 and the amendment of section 2008(f), the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of including all enrolled members of recognized Indian tribes within the grant program. <em>See Bryan v. Itasca County, </em>426 U.S. at 392, 96 S.Ct. at 2112; <em>see also Wilson v. Watt, </em>703 F.2d 395, 402 (9th Cir.1983) (general assistance program under Snyder Act is for \u201cspecial benefit of Indians and must be liberally construed in their favor\u201d). Such a construction is consistent both with other Snyder Act and Indian Reorganization Act programs, and with recent congressional action. We therefore hold that the Snyder Act does not provide authority for the continued application of the one-quarter degree Indian blood quantum eligibility requirement of 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-5\">3. Congressional Ratification</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-6\">The BIA also contends that Congress has ratified the one-quarter degree Indian blood standard through eleven years of appropriation acts based upon Interior Department budget requests which explicitly cited the one-quarter degree standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-7\">This court has held that \u201c[t]he mere appropriation of funds, however, does not constitute congressional ratification____\u201d <em>Rincon Band of Mission Indians v. Harris, </em>618 F.2d 569, 573 (9th Cir.1980). \u201cRatification by appropriation will not be found unless the government has sustained \u2018the heavy burden of demonstrating congressional knowledge of the precise course of action alleged to have been acquiesced in.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>City of Santa Clara v. Andrus, 572 </em>F.2d 660, 672 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 859, 99 S.Ct. 176, 58 L.Ed.2d 167 (1978)). Moreover, the appropriation must plainly show a purpose to bestow the precise authority which is claimed. <em>Id. </em>at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-11\">The government has not shown that Congress was actually aware of the one-quarter degree blood quantum, much less that it intended to approve that quantum. There is no evidence of congressional hearings or findings discussing, approving, or even acquiescing in the promulgation standard; there is no indication that Congress ever discussed that particular regulation or the Department\u2019s budget requests. There is contrary evidence, however, that Congress rejects the one-quarter standard in favor of a membership in a recognized tribe standard. Indian Financing Act of 1974, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452; Pub.L. No. 99-228. We hold that the government has not met its \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing congressional ratification by appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-12\">4. Attorneys Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-13\">Zarr seeks attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (West Supp.1986). Although we hold that the government\u2019s promulgation of the one-quarter degree Indian blood eligibility requirement was beyond the authority conferred by Congress, we do not believe that the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d as would be required in order to award attorneys fees under section 2412(d)(1)(A). Therefore, although we recognize the value of the service that Zarr has rendered to her fellow Indians of less than one-quarter degree blood, we are not free to award attorneys fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-14\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-15\">We hold that neither the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2471, as amended by the Indian Financing Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452, nor the Snyder Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, provides authority for the BIA\u2019s continued application of a one-quarter degree Indian blood quantum eligibility requirement for Indian higher education grants under 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1. In view of the 1974 Indian Financing Act, the regulation makes unauthorized distinctions among Indians who are members of federally recognized tribes and have differing amounts of Indian blood. Nor did Congress ratify the one-quarter degree blood quantum eligibility standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-4\">Because we conclude that the regulation falls outside of the authority conferred on the BIA, and that it is not reasonably related to the purposes of the various congressional enabling acts, we do not reach Zarr\u2019s trust obligation and equal protection arguments. Because the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was predicated upon the validity of the one-quarter degree Indian blood eligibility standard which we hold invalid, we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1589-11\">. As a member of a federally recognized tribe, Zarr satisfies the definition of \"Indian\u201d and is eligible to participate in the vast majority of BIA programs, including, for example, the programs and services provided under the following statutes and regulations: 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450b(a) (Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(c) (Indian Health Care Improvement Act); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452(b) (Indian Financing Act); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(3) (Indian Child Welfare Act); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 479 (Indian Reorganization Act) (as amended by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452, Indian Financing Act of 1974); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.1(a) (Indian Preference in Employment); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.2(m) (Indian Education Policies); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.3(h) (Grants to Tribally Controlled Community Colleges); 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 26.1(g) (Employment Assistance for Adult Indians).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1591-6\">. The regulation continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-7\">Such educational loans and grants may be made also to students of one-fourth or more degree of Indian blood who reside near the reservation when a denial of such loans or grants would have a direct effect upon Bureau programs within the reservation. After students meeting these eligibility requirements are taken care of, Indian students who do not meet the residency requirements but are otherwise eligible may be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-8\">25 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.1 (1986). Thus, an Indian student of one-quarter degree blood quantum living far off the reservation beyond the residency</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-13\">criterion would become eligible for a higher education grant if funding permitted, while an Indian student of 7/32 degree blood quantum living on the reservation could never become eligible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1591-14\">. Section 32.1 was amended in part in 1968, 33 Fed.Reg. 9708 (1968). However, that amendment did not involve the challenged blood quantum requirement, which has continued into the present section 40.1. <em>See </em>47 Fed.Reg. 13,327 (1982) (25 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.1 redesignated section 40.1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1593-7\">. Zarr is clearly an Indian under this definition. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1593-17\">. Although the BIA failed to amend the challenged regulation to account for Congress\u2019 new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>eligibility standards for educational loans to Indians, it is evident that the agency understood that a new, more inclusive standard was required under the Indian Financing Act. The BIA promulgated a new Part 101 under the authority of the 1974 Indian Financing Act, which, in part, authorizes direct educational loans to individual Indians. 25 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 101.-2(b)(3) and (4). The BIA defined an eligible Indian as \"any person who is a member of any Indian tribe ... which is recognized by the Federal Government as eligible for services from the [BIA].\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.1(c). <em>See supra </em>note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">. The BIA fails to note that neither sections 480 nor 482 specifically repealed the more inclusive definition of \u201cIndian\u201d found in section 479.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1594-11\">. The BIA\u2019s definition is also not internally consistent with its own regulations concerning other vocational training programs. <em>Compare </em>25 C.F.R. Part 27, Vocational Training for Adult Indians, which defines an \"Indian\" for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>of that program to mean \"any person of Indian or Alaska native descent who is an enrolled member of any of those tribes listed ... as recognized by and receiving services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or a descendant of one-fourth degree or more Indian blood of an enrolled member____\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 27.1(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1595-13\">. Interestingly, for this Snyder Act program, \" \u2018Indian\u2019 means any person who is a member, or a one-fourth degree or more blood quantum descendant of a member of any Indian tribe.\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1(n) (emphasis added). <em>Accord, </em>25 C.F.R. Part 256, HOUSING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, \u00a7 256.2(e) (another specifically cited Snyder Act program, defining Indian either as an enrolled member or of one-half or more degree Indian ancestry).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
