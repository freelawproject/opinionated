The agreement, however, specifically reserved in the Hospital the right to proceed against any insurance proceeds payable as a result of the medical bills incurred by Emma O\u2019Donnell at the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">General American Life Insurance Co. (\u201cGeneral American\u201d), O\u2019Donnell\u2019s health insurance carrier, intervened and opposed the Hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the settlement agreement, by releasing O\u2019Donnell from liability on her debt to the hospital, also released her insurer from that liability. The district court rejected General American\u2019s argument and granted the Hospital's motion for summary judgment. Judgment was entered in the amount of $111,193.30; General American appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">The fundamental issue on appeal is whether a covenant not to execute a judgment against a party\u2019s personal assets operates as a release of that party\u2019s liability such that the party\u2019s insurer will also be relieved of liability on its insured\u2019s debt. General American argues that the settlement agreement operated as a release of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s liability on the Hospital\u2019s counterclaim for medical expenses. It urges that since General American agreed only to indemnify O\u2019Donnell for certain debts, the Hospital\u2019s release of O\u2019Donnell necessarily releases General American from liability as well. General American further argues that Missouri has no direct action statute nor any other statutory provision which would grant the Hospital the power to proceed directly against General American. Without such authority, General American argues, any attempts by the Hospital to collect the plaintiff\u2019s debt from General American are unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">The Hospital argues that the settlement agreement did not constitute a release, but only specifically insulates from execution O\u2019Donnell\u2019s personal assets. It contends that the provision at issue merely represents a covenant by the Hospital to enforce any judgment it may obtain against O\u2019Donnell only against certain assets. Those assets are O\u2019Donnell\u2019s contractual rights with her insurer, General American, or with any other insurer providing applicable coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">Generally, substantive contractual rights of parties are governed by the law of the state where the contract is made, performed, and where the transactions thereunder occurred. <em>Modine Manufacturing Co. v. Carlock, </em>510 S.W.2d 462, 464 (Mo.1974). Missouri law is clear that the primary rule of construction, whether for a release or any other type of contract, is that the intent of the parties shall govern. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>Williams v. Riley, </em>243 S.W.2d 122, 124 (Mo.App.1951). Accordingly, the court must consider all of the surrounding facts and circumstances under which the parties acted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The parties focus their arguments on two Missouri cases. In <em>Bailey v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>497 S.W.2d 816 (Mo.App.1973), an injured plaintiff executed a general release relieving the tortfeasors of liability for her injuries. The plaintiff then proceeded against her automobile insurance carrier for proceeds under her policy. The insurer argued that the release of the tortfeasors\u2019 liability also operated as a release of its contractual liability. The Missouri Court of Appeals disagreed, observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">Aetna was not a party to the litigation giving rise to the Release nor was it privy to the defendant tortfeasors. Its obligation to pay medical expenses to Jacquelyn Bailey was then in dispute and her claim in the litigation was not only against different persons but was also in tort as distinguished from the present claim on contract asserted against Aetna. It would require a degree of judicial agility, of which we are incapable, to read into this Release any intention on the part of plaintiff to release her claim for medical expenses against Aetna under its policy of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">O\u2019Donnell attempts to distinguish <em>Bailey </em>on the grounds that in this case, the Hospital is also a tortfeasor, whereas in <em>Bailey </em>the hospital was merely a creditor that provided the plaintiff with medical services. Since the hospital in <em>Bailey </em>was not a party to the settlement agreement, the debt for the treatment was not discharged. A close reading of the settlement agreement involved here, however, reveals that this case is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Bailey. </em>The parties in this case intended to settle only the malpractice claim; the hospital\u2019s counterclaim remained viable. The only change made in the status of the counterclaim was as against which assets any judgment thereon could be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The other Missouri case relied on by the parties is <em>Farmers Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Drane, </em>383 S.W.2d 714 (Mo.1964). That case involved the application of Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 537.065 (Supp.1986), which enables an injured party to agree not to execute any judgment obtained against certain specified assets of a tortfeasor while retaining his right to enforce it against the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier. The <em>Drane </em>court held that an agreement made under this statute does not constitute a release because it does not purport to terminate the tortfeasor\u2019s liability, it merely limits the enforceability of a judgment based upon that liability. <em>Id. </em>at 720. Also significant was the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s reservation of rights against the insurer clearly indicated that the parties did not intend that the settlement amount was in full satisfaction of the plaintiff's claims. <em>Id. </em>at 719. St. Luke\u2019s agrees that section 537.065 does , not apply to this case, but it asserts that the <em>Drane </em>court\u2019s reasoning is sound and should be applied here as well. We agree that this reasoning is sound and is persuasive even in the absence of the application of section 537.065. The intent of the contracting parties must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">It is clear that O\u2019Donnell and St. Luke\u2019s had no intention of discharging O\u2019Donnell\u2019s medical bills as part of the settlement of the malpractice claim. O\u2019Donnell, however, wanted to ensure that those bills be satisfied only out of the available insurance proceeds, not out of her personal assets. Therefore, she required St. Luke\u2019s to agree to enforce the judgment on the counterclaim only against those existing contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
