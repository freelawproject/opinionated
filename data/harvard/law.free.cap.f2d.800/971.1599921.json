Subject matter jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1982). The plaintiff class challenges federal and state regulations that the appellants promulgated, claiming the regulations exceed the scope and intent of the enabling statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(39),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> part of the Deficit Reduction Act. This provision changed the conditions of eligibility for benefits under state Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs for certain \u201cthree-generation\u201d families living together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-17\">The statute requires that in evaluating the need of the grandchild in such families, the state must take into account the income of the grandparent when the grandchild\u2019s parent is \u201cunder the age selected by the State pursuant to section 606(a)(2) of this title.\u201d Section 606(a)(2) states the age requirement for dependency under the AFDC program: all children under eighteen are dependent, and states are given the option of extending dependency to eighteen-year-olds who are full-time students expected to complete schooling before nineteen. 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a)(2) (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hawaii has selected this second option. Hawaii Administrative Rule \u00a7 17-640-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">Both the federal government and the state of Hawaii have enacted regulations that construe section 602(a)(39) as applying to parents classified as minors under the regulations implementing section 606(a)(2), \u201cwithout regard to school attendance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The effect is that the grandparent\u2019s income is deemed available to the dependent grandchild in all three-generation families living together in which the intermediate parent is eighteen, rather than only in those families where the eighteen-year-old parent satisfies the school attendance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The plaintiff class consists of eighteen-year-old parents in Hawaii who are either not full-time students or not reasonably expected to complete their school program before reaching nineteen, who live in the same home as their parents, and whose AFDC benefits have been or will be reduced, terminated or denied under these regulations. The class brought an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, challenging the federal and Hawaii regulations as exceeding the scope and intent of section 602(a)(2), (39). The district court granted the class\u2019s motion for summary judgment, declared that the federal regulation was invalid, and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing the federal and the Hawaii regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">We affirm the judgment, adopting the reasoning of the district court in <em>Morrison v. Heckler, </em>602 F.Supp. 1482 (D.Minn.1984), <em>affd, </em>787 F.2d 1285 (8th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"aqk-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">.
