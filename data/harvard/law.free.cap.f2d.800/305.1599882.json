Following our decision, reported at 767 F.2d 1041, the Court granted Freschi\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Randall v. Loftsgaarden, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106, S.Ct. 3143, 92 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986), and <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Company, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). <em>Freschi v. Grand Coal Venture, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3325, 92 L.Ed.2d 731 (1986). <em>Randall </em>held that damages to a defrauded investor in a tax shelter should not be reduced by tax benefits received by the investor. On our original consideration of this appeal, we had ordered the District Court\u2019s remittitur reduced by the amount of the tax benefits resulting from the plaintiff\u2019s investment. 767 F.2d at 1051. In making this ruling, we had adhered to Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>liam Z. Salcer, Panfeld, Edelman v. Envicon Equities Corp., </em>744 F.2d 935 (2d Cir.1984), which the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Randall. Sedima </em>reversed a decision of this Court that had required a civil RICO complaint to allege both \u201cracketeering injury\u201d and conviction of the defendants for the RICO predicate acts. <em>See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>741 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.1984). In the instant litigation, the District Court, anticipating our decision in <em>Sedima, </em>had denied plaintiffs motion to amend to add a civil RICO cause of action for failure to plead \u201cracketeering injury.\u201d <em>Freschi v. Grand Coal Venture, </em>583 F.Supp. 780, 787-88 (S.D.N.Y.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Randall </em>and <em>Sedima, </em>our prior opinion and disposition must be modified. The re-mittitur ordered by the District Court shall stand, without reduction by the amount of the tax benefits resulting from the plaintiff\u2019s investment. Upon remand, the District Court shall afford the plaintiff an opportunity to present a motion to amend the complaint to add a civil RICO claim, the sufficiency of which, if pursued, shall be assessed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sedima. </em>We express no views on whether such a motion, if made, should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our prior opinion, as modified by this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
