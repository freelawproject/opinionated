Because we conclude that no valid agreement to arbitrate this dispute existed, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-19\">In 1975, Felkner opened a securities account with Dean Witter. At that time, he signed Dean Witter\u2019s standard Customer Agreement, which provided, in part, that \u201c[a]ny controversy arising out of or relating to this contract or breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration.\u201d In May 1982, Felkner began trading commodities through Dean Witter. Although these trades were under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Felkner never entered into any additional agreement with Dean Witter concerning this new investment activity. During Felkner\u2019s 13-month venture into the commodity markets, he allegedly lost more than $265,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-20\">On June 24, 1984, Felkner filed a complaint against Dean Witter and certain of its employees. Felkner alleged that his losses resulted from numerous unauthorized trades that Dean Witter had conducted. He charged defendants with violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-26 (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984), and asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, and breach of contract. Felkner further charged all defendants but Saffrow with engaging in a pattern of mail and wire fraud in violation of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-21\">On August 3, 1984, defendants moved to sever the RICO claim and state law claims, compel arbitration of these claims, and stay court proceedings pending arbitration. The district court denied the motion, holding that Felkner\u2019s RICO claim was nonarbi-trable and that the state law claims were \u201cso intertwined with the federal Commodities Act claim, and perhaps the RICO claim\u201d that under current law they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>not severable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Recognizing that the Supreme Court intended to review our decision in <em>Byrd v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 552 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>467 U.S. 1240, 104 S.Ct. 3509, 82 L.Ed.2d 818 (1984), the court noted that it would entertain a motion for reconsideration \u201c[i]f the Supreme Court changes the rule of law\u201d regarding the intertwining doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1572-4\">On March 4, 1985, the Supreme Court reversed this circuit and refused to adopt the intertwining doctrine. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, requesting again that the district court sever Felkner\u2019s RICO claim, order the various claims to arbitration and stay further proceedings pending arbitration. The district court denied the motion, ruling that the arbitration clause relied on by defendants was invalid under CFTC regulations, specifically 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that RICO claims are nonarbitrable. Defendants now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-6\">Interpretations of statutes and regulations are questions of law, reviewed here de novo. <em>United States v. Varbel, </em>780 F.2d 758, 761 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-7\">Section 180.3(b) was originally adopted in 1976. It provides that arbitration agreements in the commodities context must include certain language to ensure that an investor\u2019s agreement to compulsory arbitration is \u201c \u2018truly voluntary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wotkyns v. D.E. Jones Commodities, Inc., </em>791 F.2d 749, 750 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Ames v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 1174, 1178 (2d Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-12\">The parties do not dispute that the arbitration clause in issue here fails to conform to section 180.3(b)\u2019s express requirements. Nor do the parties dispute that, for purposes of claims covered by the CFTC regulations, arbitration agreements that do not conform to section 180.3(b) are void. <em>E.g., Wotkyns, </em>791 F.2d at 750; <em>Smoky Greenhaw Cotton Co. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 1446, 1450-51 (5th Cir.1983). Defendants argue, however, that 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.3 applies only to agreements to arbitrate claims brought under the CEA. Accordingly, defendants maintain that Dean Witter\u2019s arbitration clause remains enforceable insofar as it requires the arbitration of Felkner\u2019s RICO claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-13\">We disagree. The plain language of the relevant regulations and statutes makes clear that the CFTC intended that section 180.3 apply to agreements to arbitrate any dispute arising out of commodity futures trading. Section 180.3(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1572-14\">The procedures [established in \u00a7 180.-3(b)(3)] shall prohibit any agreement or understanding pursuant to which customers of the contract market agree to submit claims or grievances for settlement ... except in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1572-15\">The regulations define \u201cclaim or grievance\u201d as <em>\u201cany </em>dispute which arises out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number><em>any </em>transaction on or subject to the rules of a contract market.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.1 (1985) (emphasis added). The unqualified language of section 180.1 leaves no doubt that the CFTC intended non-CEA claims as well as CEA claims to be subject to the requirements of section 180.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-5\">The regulatory history also supports our conclusion. In its discussion of its proposed regulations, the CFTC stated that, under its proposed rules, it anticipated arbitration of \u201cclaims or grievances that do not involve violations of the [CEA] or rules thereunder.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. 27,527 (July 2, 1976); <em>see also id. </em>n. 5 (giving violation of an exchange rule, not promulgated under CEA, as an example of a claim that could be submitted to arbitration).</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-6\">The central purpose of section 180.3 is \u201cto assure the efficacy of arbitration ... as well as to meet the requirements of [7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7a(ll)], which require that such procedures be available and voluntary.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. 27,526-27 (July 2, 1976). The CFTC wanted to encourage arbitration, but its regulations reflect its concern over the adhesive and overreaching nature of arbitration clauses that had been used by brokers and dealers trading in the contracts markets. <em>Id. </em>at 27,526; <em>see also </em>41 Fed. Reg. 42,944-45 (Sept. 29, 1976) (discussing final rules). These concerns apply equally to CEA claims and non-CEA claims. We conclude that the requirements of section 180.3 apply to regulate agreements to arbitrate all disputes arising out of commodity trading. Accordingly, the arbitration clause included in Felkner\u2019s Customer Agreement is invalid as it applies to claims under RICO or any other state or federal statute or regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1573-7\">Defendants next argue that the CFTC lacks the power to regulate agreements to arbitrate claims that do not arise under the CEA. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AnyB\">Section 180.3 was promulgated pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7a(ll), 12a(5), among other authority. The Supreme Court has recently confirmed the CFTC\u2019s power under section 12a(5) to promulgate regulations concerning alternative resolution of disputes arising out of commodity trading. <em>See Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,---, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 3252-54, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986); <em>see also Ames v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fen-ner &amp; Smith, </em>567 F.2d 1174, 1177-78 (2d Cir.1977) (CFTC may regulate the arbitration of all disputes relating to commodities trading, not just those specifically mentioned in the Act). Congress empowered the CFTC \u201cto make and promulgate such rules and regulations as, in the judgment of the Commission, are reasonably necessary to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes\u201d of the CEA. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 12a(5). As the <em>Schor </em>Court noted, this provision constitutes a \u201cbroad grant of power.\u201d <em>Schor, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 3253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-15\">Beyond the general mandate of section 12a(5), Congress also enacted section 7a(ll), which requires that each contract market</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-16\">provide a fair and equitable procedure through arbitration or otherwise ... for the settlement of customers\u2019 claims and grievances ... <em>Provided, </em>That (i) the use of such procedures shall be voluntary\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1573-17\">The various disclosure and severability requirements that section 180.3(b) establishes for arbitration clauses are intended to ensure the voluntariness of customers\u2019 agreements to arbitrate any dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-18\">The contention by defendants that Congress intended to ensure only the voluntariness of agreements to arbitrate claims brought under the CEA is inconsistent with the \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the CEA to \u201cinsure fair practice and honest dealing on the commodities exchanges____\u201d S.Rep. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>No. 93-1131, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 5843, 5856. To enforce an adhesive arbitration agreement against non-CEA claims offends fairness and honesty as much as enforcing such an agreement against claims brought under the CEA itself. Furthermore, the fact that the CFTC intended section 180.3 to reach agreements to arbitrate non-CEA claims, creates a strong presumption that the CFTC did not exceed its authority in promulgating section 180.3. \u201c[A]s the CFTC\u2019s contemporaneous interpretation of the statute it is entrusted to administer, considerable weight must be accorded the CFTC\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Schor, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 3254; <em>accord State of Hawaii v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1031, 1033 (9th Cir.1985) (courts give \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to agency interpretations of statutes that they are charged with administering and enforcing).</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-5\">Defendants argue that their narrow interpretation of CFTC power is mandated by the strong federal policy favoring arbitration under the Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14 (1982). <em>See, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 3353-54, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). But nothing in the Arbitration Act requires a person to submit a claim to arbitration unless he has so agreed. <em>See Francesco\u2019s B., Inc. v. Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees &amp; Bartenders Union, Local 28, </em>659 F.2d 1383, 1387 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-8\">Moreover, any presumption favoring arbitration may be rebutted by the express or implicit command of a federal statute. <em>Mitsubishi Motors, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3355. In this case, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7a(ll) clearly expresses Congress\u2019s intent to insure the volun-tariness of arbitration agreements in contracts governing commodity-brokerage accounts. Defendants do not challenge the CFTC\u2019s authority to regulate the formation of agreements to arbitrate pure CEA claims. They point to no reason why the presumption favoring arbitrability should not also be overcome when the CFTC acts to insure that customers bringing non-CEA claims or grievances that arise out of a commodity transaction are not unfairly deprived of access to a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-15\">Because the arbitration clause here failed to meet the requirements of 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.3(b), there was no valid agreement to arbitrate Felkner\u2019s claims under RICO or any other provision of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment denying defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1572-8\">. At the time, this circuit adhered to the so-called \"intertwining doctrine.\u201d Under the doctrine, a party could not compel arbitration of normally arbitrable claims if they were factually intertwined with nonarbitrable claims. <em>See Byrd v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 552 (9th Cir.1984), <em>rev'd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1572-9\">. Because it had found defendants\u2019 motion mer-itless on two other grounds, the district court declined at that point to rule on whether the arbitration clause was valid under CFTC regulations. Because of its refusal to compel arbitration, the court held that the motion to stay trial was moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1572-16\">. Under authority granted by various CEA provisions, the CFTC has promulgated detailed regulations concerning the use of arbitration to resolve disputes arising out of commodity futures trading. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 180.1-180.5. Under 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.3(b), enforcement of agreements to arbitrate these disputes is permitted only when certain conditions are met. These include: (1) that signing the agreement not be made a condition of access to the market; (2) that the customer sign separately the clause providing for arbitration; and (3) that there be a warning in bold-face type that the customer is giving up certain rights to assert his claim in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1573-8\">. We categorically reject defendants\u2019 argument that Felkner\u2019s RICO claim does not arise out of a dispute regarding his account. It plainly does. But even were we to accept defendants\u2019 contention, arbitration would still not be mandated because, under the express terms of the arbitration clause relied upon by defendants, arbitration is only required for disputes \"arising out of or relating to\" Felkner\u2019s Dean Witter account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1574-9\">. Because of our determination that no valid arbitration agreement between the parties existed, we need not decide whether claims under RICO are arbitrable. We also need not reach Felkner\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction to decide the RICO arbitrability issue. There is no challenge, nor could there be, to our jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s ruling that the arbitration clause was void under 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.3(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
