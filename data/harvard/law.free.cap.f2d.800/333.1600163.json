Keystone Pretzel Bakery, Inc., </em>696 F.2d 257, 266 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Electrical Products Div. of Midland-Ross Corp. v. NLRB, </em>617 F.2d 977, 989 (3d Cir.1980). However, my views do not command a majority of the members of this court, and my role as an appellate judge requires that I abide by the precedent set by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The arguments made by the employer in his petition for rehearing on the credibility of various witnesses are strong indeed, but our review of the evidence is severely limited by statute. In appeals from the Board we must affirm its findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. We are not free to reweigh the evidence nor are we permitted to decide a case as we might have had we conducted the original hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Because of the limitations imposed by precedent and the restricted scope permitted by statute, I join in the order denying panel rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
