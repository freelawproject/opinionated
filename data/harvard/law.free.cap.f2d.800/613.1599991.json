(the \u201cBoard\u201d). On appeal, Marohnic asserts that material issues of fact exist concerning his claim that Walker made negative statements about him in retaliation for his First Amendment speech. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Marohnic, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see SEC v. Blavin, </em>760 F.2d 706, 710 (6th Cir.1985) (per curiam), the following series of events led to Marohnic\u2019s instituting this action. Marohnic, after obtaining a master\u2019s degree in social work in 1975, began working for the Board and, approximately eighteen months later, was promoted to the position of Associate Director. Marohnic\u2019s career proceeded smoothly until the summer of 1979, when he was approached by the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s office concerning an investigation into alleged medicaid fraud occurring at the Board. Marohnic cooperated with the investigation which culminated in the Board admitting that its employees and agents had fraudulently altered approximately $5,500 in billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Shortly after Marohnic began aiding the investigation, Walker, the Board\u2019s Executive Director, learned of Marohnic\u2019s participation and initiated a pattern of harassment and slander against Marohnic. Unable to work in this hostile environment and faced with the possibility of being fired, Marohnic resigned and brought a civil rights action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), against Walker and the Board contending that Walker\u2019s retaliatory conduct violated his First Amendment rights. This litigation ended with a settlement agreement which provided, among other things, that the Board would supply Marohnic with an \u201cunqualified positive letter of recommendation\u201d and remove all negative matters from Marohnic\u2019s personnel file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marohnic then began looking for employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Marohnic submitted letters of introduction to over seventy prospective employers, twenty-five of whom expressed interest in his application. As Marohnic\u2019s applications proceeded through the screening process, however, interest abruptly declined. Confronted with this situation, Marohnic started contacting the employers who had shown an initial interest in his application to discern if a problem existed with his credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">Jackie. Kwalick of the Comprehensive Mental Health Center in Covington, Kentucky had called Marohnic, informed him of a new program the Center was opening, requested a resume and a list of references, and made tentative plans for an interview. After failing to hear from Ms. Kwal-ick for two to three weeks, Marohnic took the initiative and contacted Ms. Kwalick to determine the status of his application. Ms. Kwalick responded, evasively, that the Center was not hiring at present and pointed out that the Executive Director of Comprehensive Mental Health Center knew Mr. Walker \u201cvery closely.\u201d A similar series of events occurred with David Bell from Mountain Comprehensive Care Center who had called Marohnic, expressed interest, and asked for references. Thereafter, however, Bell never recontacted Marohnic or returned any of Marohnic\u2019s calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">Neal Tillow, representing the Northern Kentucky Alcohol Abuse Program, asked Marohnic for a copy of his resume and, after reviewing it, sent Marohnic a letter stating that he was a \u201ctop applicant.\u201d Nonetheless, Marohnic was not interviewed for a position. Upon Marohnic\u2019s inquiry, Tillow acknowledged that Marohnic\u2019s qualifications were fine, but indicated that some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>problem existed with his past employment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Marohnic\u2019s frustration continued when the Central Kentucky Action Community Agency failed to interview him. Although Robert Tatum had informed Marohnic that he was a \u201cfinalist\u201d for a position prior to the reference check stage, Tatum later told Marohnic that a problem existed with the Board\u2019s recommendation. According to Tatum, although nothing positive or negative was said, it was what the Board wasn\u2019t saying that influenced the decision not to interview Marohnic. Tatum referred Ma-rohnic to Terry Ward for additional information. Ward-, while refusing to be specific for confidentiality reasons, advised Ma-rohnic to cease using the Board\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Marohnic attempted to confirm his suspicion that Walker was giving him bad recommendations by having a friend, Robert Craig, call Walker posing as a prospective employer. Craig, during the telephone conversation, asked Walker a series of prepared questions about Marohnic. Walker informed Craig that Marohnic had mediocre leadership qualities, was not a good administrator, was ineffective in getting along with others, especially with women, and was immature. Moreover, Walker suggested that Craig \u201ccheck around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Marohnic commenced this action alleging that Walker was providing prospective employers with bad recommendations in contravention of the settlement agreement and in violation of the First Amendment. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment holding that Walker and the Board had complied with the plain language of the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court, however, never directly addressed Marohnic\u2019s First Amendment claim except to note that, in any event, Marohnic had failed to establish any damages. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Before considering the merits of Maroh-nic\u2019s First Amendment claim, we must first determine whether Marohnic properly preserved this issue for review. Walker and the Board contend that Marohnic failed to present his First Amendment claim to the district court and, therefore, is precluded from raising it before this Court. <em>See Sigmon Fuel Co. v. TVA, </em>754 F.2d 162, 164-65 (6th Cir.1985) (citing cases); <em>Wiper v. Great Lakes Engineering Works, </em>340 F.2d 727, 731 (6th Cir.) (citing cases), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 812, 86 S.Ct. 28, 15 L.Ed.2d 60 (1965). We find this contention meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The First Amendment claim was clearly pleaded in Marohnic\u2019s complaint and was interposed by him in response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Although Marohnic\u2019s response to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment did not explicitly refer to his First Amendment claim, this omission is unexceptional in light of the failure of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion to mention the First Amendment. Also, Marohnic\u2019s response did address the defendants\u2019 factual argument that Walker never made any negative statements about Marohnic. More importantly, in his motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), Marohnic pointed out that the district court\u2019s opinion never addressed his First Amendment claim and requested, after a detailed discussion of the applicable law, that the claim be reinstated. Marohnic thus presented the district court with his legal and factual arguments pertaining to his First Amendment claim and gave the district court an opportunity to rule on it. Accordingly, we hold that Marohnic is not barred from raising his First Amendment claim before this Court and turn to the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>First Amendment violation, Marohnic had to demonstrate that his protected conduct motivated Walker to give potential employers negative references. <em>See Mount Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <em>Hickman v. Valley Local School District Board of Education, </em>619 F.2d 606, 608 (6th Cir.1980). The first element of Marohnic's claim, and a threshhold legal requirement, <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 150 &amp; n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1692 &amp; n. 10, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), is that he engaged in protected conduct. Marohnic\u2019s speech, in this case, will be deemed protected by the First Amendment if it can be fairly characterized as touching upon a matter of public concern, as determined by the content, form, and context of his speech. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. at 1690. Yet, even if Marohnic's speech touches upon a matter of public concern, its value still must be weighed against its impact upon the efficiency, discipline, and proper administration of the Board. <em>See Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District 205, Will County, </em>391 U.S. 563, 569-70, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1735, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968); <em>Columbus Education Association v. Columbus City School District, </em>623 F.2d 1155, 1160 (6th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Marohnic\u2019s speech to the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s investigators concerned fraudulent billing by the Board. Public interest is near its zenith when ensuring that public organizations are being operated in accordance with the law, <em>see Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 149, 103 S.Ct. at 1691, and seeing that public funds are not purloined, <em>see Czurlanis v. Albanese, </em>721 F.2d 98, 104-05 (3d Cir.1983) (waste of taxpayers\u2019 money a subject of public interest); <em>cf. Pickering, </em>391 U.S. at 571-72, 88 S.Ct. at 1736 (funding of schools of public concern). Thus, the content of Marohnic\u2019s speech indicates that it related to a matter of public interest. In addition, Marohnic\u2019s speech was made in the context of a state investigation. Public policy strongly supports and encourages protecting speech made at the behest of law enforcement officials. This context further reveals that Marohnic\u2019s speech was induced by civic commitment, not by an employment related dispute. <em>See Rowland v. Mad River Local School District, </em>730 F.2d 444, 449 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1009, 105 S.Ct. 1373, 84 L.Ed.2d 392 (1985). We hold, therefore, that Marohnic\u2019s speech which exposed graft and corruption in government touched upon a matter of public concern. <em>See O\u2019Brien v. Town of Caledonia, </em>748 F.2d 403, 407 (7th Cir.1984) (informing public of potential graft and corruption deserves \u201cvigilant protection\u201d); <em>Rookard v. Health and Hospitals Corp., </em>710 F.2d 41, 46 (2d Cir.1983) (exposing of corrupt and wasteful practices \u201cobviously\u201d matter of public concern). Next, Marohnic\u2019s speech in this case in no way hindered the operations of the Board. Rather, Marohnic\u2019s speech increased the Board\u2019s efficiency by helping to disclose the fraudulent altering of bills. Nor does any evidence indicate that the working environment at the Board was so intimate or of such an interpersonal nature that Marohnic\u2019s cooperation with the state investigation rendered him ineffective at performing his duties. <em>See Anderson v. Evans, </em>660 F.2d 153, 158-59 (6th Cir.1981). Moreover, when an employee exposes unscrupulous behavior in the workplace, his interests are co-extensive with those of his employer; both want the organization to function in a proper manner. Since Marohnic\u2019s speech to the Kentucky Attorney General was of significant public concern and did not adversely affect the Board\u2019s operations, we hold that it is entitled to First Amendment protection. Thus, we proceed to consider the second element of Marohnic\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case, namely, whether Walker made negative statements about Marohnic.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">At least one prospective employer indicated to Marohnic that a problem existed with the Board\u2019s recommendation; Terry Ward explicitly advised Marohnic to stop using the Board\u2019s recommendation. Also, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Walker affected Marohnic\u2019s employment opportunity at the Comprehensive Mental Health Center from Ms. Kwalick\u2019s statement that the Executive Director of the Comprehensive Mental Health Center was very close to Walker. Likewise, since the Board was Marohnic\u2019s only past employer, an inference can be drawn from Mr. Til-low\u2019s statement that a problem existed with Marohnic\u2019s employment record that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>was referring to the Board\u2019s recommendation. Finally, a juror could reason that if Walker made negative statements to Robert Craig, who was posing as a prospective employer, Walker gave similar statements to others upon inquiry. In our view, the foregoing evidence is more than sufficient to create an issue of material fact concerning whether Walker made negative statements about Marohnic to prospective employers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, we consider the last element of Marohnic\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case, whether the protected speech was a substantial factor in Walker\u2019s giving of bad references.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We begin our analysis of this matter recognizing that summary judgment is particularly inappropriate when intent is at issue, because evidence of intent must generally be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances. <em>Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., </em>759 F.2d 355, 364 (4th Cir.1985); <em>Ness v. Marshall, </em>660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir.1981). The most probative evidence in this case pertaining to Walker\u2019s intent is a comparison of Marohnic\u2019s last employee evaluation completed by Walker and Walker\u2019s statements to Robert Craig. Walker completed an evaluation of Marohnic shortly before the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s investigation in which he concluded that Marohnic was a \u201cvery capable administrator,\u201d had an analytical mind, thought systematically, worked hard, and \u201cdefinitely\u201d was an asset to the Board. In contrast, Walker informed Robert Craig that Marohnic had mediocre leadership qualities, was not a good administrator, was ineffective at getting along with others, and was immature. Obviously, something occurred between the time of the evaluation and the phone call with Craig to change Walker\u2019s opinion of Marohnic\u2019s abilities. The reason for Walker\u2019s change in attitude is, in our view, a classic question of fact for a jury to determine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that an issue of material fact exists concerning Walker\u2019s motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Since we hold that Marohnic\u2019s speech was protected by the First Amendment and that material issues of fact exist concerning both whether Walker made negative statements about Marohnic\u2019s qualifications and Walker\u2019s motivation for doing so, we reverse and remand this case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">. Neither the interpretation of this settlement agreement or Marohnic\u2019s concomitant release are at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">. Marohnic has not appealed this holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">. Marohnic also sought to introduce the expert testimony of Dr. Seymour Slavin who opined that based upon Marohnic\u2019s qualifications and the social work employment market Walker must have been giving negative feedback about Marohnic. Marohnic, however, did not file a transcript of Dr. Slavin\u2019s deposition until April 22, 1985, three days after the district court rendered its memorandum opinion granting summary judgment. Since Dr. Slavin\u2019s deposition was not properly filed with Marohnic\u2019s response to the summary judgment motion, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), and since the district court in all likelihood did not consider it, we refuse to consider it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b729-21\">. Of course, on remand, Walker and the Board will have an opportunity to establish that Walker would have given the same evaluation of Marohnic regardless of Marohnic's protected conduct. <em>Mount Healthy, </em>429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b729-23\">. The district court\u2019s holding that Marohnic had not established any damages does not provide an alternative basis for affirmance in this case in light of our recent decision in <em>Walje </em>v. <em>City of Winchester, Kentucky, </em>773 F.2d 729, 731-32 (6th Cir.1985), which held that general damages may be presumed from a First Amendment violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
