Cooper and Williams were inmates at Lorton. They each were convicted of assaulting Alton Johnson, another inmate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 113(a) and 2 (1982). Cooper also was convicted of assaulting Shelton Madison, a Washington, D.C. correctional officer, in violation of D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 22-505 (1981). We conclude that defendants\u2019 incriminating statements were properly admitted because they were not due <em>Miranda </em>warnings before being questioned about the assault on Johnson. We also conclude that their other assignments of error are meritless. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">The incident which gave rise to this case occurred one evening near the visitors\u2019 area of the prison. Ostensibly preparing for visitation, defendants and inmate Johnson arrived in the visitors\u2019 area. The correctional officer on duty, Jerome Jones, testified that he discovered defendant Williams stabbing Johnson. The correctional officer told Williams to stop the assault. In response, defendant Williams allegedly stated: \u201cNot yet, I am not finished.\u201d Contemporaneously, defendant Cooper joined Williams in the assault on Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">Government witnesses also testified that two additional correctional officers appeared on the scene and the fight was broken up. Defendants fled, dropping knife-like weapons. One of the officers, Shelton Madison, pursued the defendants. During this chase, defendant Cooper allegedly confronted Madison with a knife-like weapon and threatened him verbally. Defendants were not apprehended immediately, becoming lost in a crowd of prisoners. However, they were identified later by the correctional officers and charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-20\">After this incident but before trial, Adrienne Poteat, a Correctional Treatment Specialist, visited inmates near defendants\u2019 cells. Although she had not intended to visit defendants, they asked to speak with her. Defendants were moved from their cells to a \u201cdisciplinary board room\u201d to facilitate this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-21\">Once in the board room, Poteat asked defendants why they had committed the assault. In response, defendant Cooper allegedly made incriminating statements. Defendant Williams allegedly was nodding in agreement during Cooper\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>At trial, defendants admitted their involvement in the altercation, but denied instigating it. Furthermore, they alleged that .inmate Johnson initiated the assault and that no guards were present. They also denied making incriminating statements to Correctional Treatment Specialist Poteat.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Defendants appeal their convictions on the following grounds: (1) the district court erred in admitting defendants\u2019 incriminating statements made during the conversation in the board room with Poteat because Poteat\u2019s question was not preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings; (2) there was insufficient evidence of assault on Officer Madison by Cooper; (3) the district court erred in admitting defendant Williams\u2019 incriminating statement made to Officer Jones at the scene because the statement was not disclosed pursuant to defendants\u2019 discovery request; and (4) the district court erred in not granting defendants\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Before trial, defendants moved to suppress the testimony of Correctional Treatment Specialist Poteat regarding her conversation with defendants in a disciplinary board room. The motion to suppress was denied by the district court. Defendants appeal that ruling and assert reversible error on the ground that they were not given <em>Miranda </em>warnings before Poteat questioned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings must precede \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The <em>Miranda </em>rule was held applicable in the prison context in <em>Mathis v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 1, 4, 88 S.Ct. 1503, 1504, 20 L.Ed.2d 381 (1968). In <em>United States v. Conley, </em>779 F.2d 970, 972 (4th Cir.1985), however, we \u201cdecline[d] to read <em>Mathis </em>as compelling the use of <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to all prisoner interrogations and [held] that a prison inmate is not automatically always in \u2018custody\u2019 within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>\u201d Instead, the court recognized that \u201ccustody\u201d or \u201crestriction\u201d in the prison context \u201c \u2018necessarily implies a change in the surroundings of the prisoner which results in an added imposition on his freedom of movement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conley, </em>779 F.2d at 973 (quoting <em>Cervantes v. Walker, </em>589 F.2d 424, 428 (9th Cir.1978)). <em>See also Flittie v. Solem, </em>751 F.2d 967, 974 (8th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Scalf, </em>725 F.2d 1272, 1275-76 (10th Cir.1984). Thus, whether an inmate is \u201cin custody\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>depends on the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Conley was deemed not in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>Like Conley, defendants here were taken to a \u201cconference area ... not for the purpose of interrogation\u201d but \u201cprimarily\u201d for another reason. <em>Conley, </em>779 F.2d at 973. Specifically, they were taken to a disciplinary board room to converse with a correctional treatment specialist at their request. Thus, defendants were moved from their cell to an inherently less restrictive area. Furthermore, there was testimony that one of two doors to the room remained unlocked. Although Conley was questioned by correctional officers or guards, defendants were questioned by a correctional treatment specialist, an arguably less intimidating prison representative. Finally, it is significant that defendants were not handcuffed; \u201cConley wore handcuffs and, at some points, full restraints.\u201d <em>Conley, </em>779 F.2d at 973. Overall, we conclude that defendants did not experience \u201can added imposition on [their] freedom of movement,\u201d <em>Conley, </em>779 F.2d at 973, and thus, were not \u201cin custody.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, under the circumstances of this case, their restriction was diminished at the time of the conversation with Poteat. Furthermore, by comparison, defendants stand in an even less persuasive posture than Conley for compelling a conclusion that they were \u201cin custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Defendants attempt to distinguish themselves from Conley by arguing that Conley was the subject of \u201con-the-scene\u201d interrogation, but defendants were not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court noted that: \u201cOur decision is not intended to hamper the traditional function of police officers in investigating crime____ General on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding.\u201d 384 U.S. at 477, 86 S.Ct. at 1629. Thus, on-the-scene questioning does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Cervantes, </em>589 F.2d at 427. If the questioning is not on the scene but occurs subsequently, then as already stated, whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings are due depends on whether the person interrogated was the subject of \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Conley, </em>we followed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Cervantes v. Walker, supra. </em>The <em>Cervantes </em>court found that the inmate defendant was not due <em>Miranda </em>warnings because he was not subjected to custodial interrogation. The court also noted that Cervantes\u2019 interrogation \u201cwas an instance of on-the-scene questioning,\u201d 589 F.2d at 429, and reserved the question of the applicability of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in cases which \u201cpresent an instance of questioning about prison crime which does not immediately follow its discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Like Cervantes, Conley also was arguably the subject of on-the-scene questioning; he was questioned shortly after the crime occurred. In contrast, defendants were questioned by Poteat ten days after the assault. Thus, this case is arguably factually distinguishable from <em>Cervantes </em>and <em>Conley. </em>On that basis, defendants assert that our rule in <em>Conley </em>is not applicable. The distinction advanced by defendants, however, is without significance under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">It is true that if a defendant is not questioned on the scene, then we must consider whether he was the subject of custodial interrogation. That is, we cannot dispense with <em>Miranda </em>warnings in such a case on the basis that the defendant was questioned on the scene. However, regardless of whether Conley was questioned on the scene, we proceeded to consider whether he was in custody under <em>Miranda </em>and found that he was not. <em>See Conley, </em>779 F.2d at 973. Likewise, we have determined that defendants were not \u201cin custody,\u201d and thus, not under \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d Therefore, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not warranted. Accordingly, it makes no difference in the result of this case that defendants were not questioned on the scene. That circumstance only affects the focus of our inquiry, not our conclusion. We hold, therefore, that the district court properly denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress the incriminating statements made to Poteat.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Defendants raise three additional issues on appeal. First, defendant Cooper argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for assaulting Correctional Officer Madison. Specifically, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove (i) that Cooper knew or should have known that Madison was a correctional officer, and (ii) that Cooper possessed the apparent present ability to accomplish his threat toward Madison \u2014 both of which are requirements of the Washington, D.C. statute under which Cooper was convicted. We have reviewed the record and find that there was substantial evidence that Cooper and Madison were familiar with one another, tending to prove that Cooper knew or should have known Madison\u2019s official iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>tity. Also, there was evidence that Cooper wielded a twelve to fifteen-inch knife-like weapon at the time of the assault, tending to prove Cooper\u2019s ability to make good his threat. Overall, there was more than sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Second, defendant Williams argues that the district court erred in admitting his incriminating statement made at the scene in response to Officer Jones\u2019 command that Williams stop the assault. Williams stated: \u201cNot yet, I\u2019m not finished.\u201d Because this statement was not divulged before trial pursuant to defendants\u2019 discovery request under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A), Williams asserts that it was reversible error to admit it into evidence. For an oral statement to be within the purview of Rule 16(a)(1)(A), it must be made \u201cin response to interrogation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>757 F.2d 1486, 1491 (4th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 407, 88 L.Ed.2d 358 (1985); 8 J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 16.05[1], at 16-72 to -74 (1986). Williams\u2019 statement does not meet this requirement. Thus, it is not covered by the rule and the government was not required to disclose it before trial. Accordingly, the district court did not err in admitting the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Third, defendants argue that \u201cthe inconsistencies in the government\u2019s case were such as to render it inherently incredible and insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Therefore, urge defendants, the district court erred in denying their motion for judgment of acquittal. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient for a rational jury to find defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Tres-vant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Under <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>\"custodial interrogation\u201d test, the government argues that defendants were neither \"in custody\u201d nor the subject of \u201cinterrogation.\u201d For purposes of this opinion, we assume without deciding that defendants were interrogated. However, because we conclude that they were not \"in custody,\u201d they were not under \"custodial interrogation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\"><em>. </em>Defendants also attempt to distinguish themselves from Conley by arguing that defendants were questioned as suspects, while Conley was questioned as a witness. In <em>Conley, </em>we noted that the officers \"testified that they questioned him as a witness to, rather than a suspect in, the ... murder.\" 779 F.2d at 974. However, the facts of the case clearly reveal that Conley was removed from his cell not only for medical treatment but also for questioning as a suspect. While being questioned, he attempted to exonerate himself by claiming that he was merely a witness to the murder. <em>See id. </em>at 971.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
