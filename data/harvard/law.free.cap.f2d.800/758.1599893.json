The City of St. Louis, pursuant to such a regulation, notified the United Black Community Fund, Inc., that payroll deductions on the Fund\u2019s behalf would be discontinued. The Fund sought to enjoin enforcement of the regulation and obtained a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>restraining order; but the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after a consolidated hearing on preliminary and permanent relief, held for the City. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">The Supreme Court since <em>Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>444 U.S. 620, 100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980), has recognized that charitable solicitations \u201care so intertwined with speech that they are entitled to the protections of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Secretary of State v. Joseph H. Munson Co., </em>467 U.S. 947, 959, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 2848, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984). Governmental regulation of fundraising activities thus will be upheld only to the degree that the restrictions serve \u201csufficiently strong, subordinating interest[s]\u201d and are \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d to avoid unnecessary interference with first amendment freedoms. <em>Schaumburg, </em>444 U.S. at 636-37, 100 S.Ct. at 835-36. The Court has twice struck down statutes or ordinances limiting solicitation by organizations that spent more than twenty-five percent of their receipts on fundraising, salaries, and overhead. <em>Munson, supra; Schaumburg, supra. </em>Such percentage limitations, the Court has concluded, are not sufficiently tailored to the commonly asserted governmental purpose of preventing fraud because high administrative costs also characterize organizations which engage to a greater degree than traditional welfare charities in research, advocacy, and public education. <em>Schaumburg, </em>444 U.S. at 636-37, 100 S.Ct. at 835-36. The Fund asserts that it is such an information-oriented organization and that the limitation on its access to the City\u2019s payroll deduction process is, in light of <em>Schaumburg </em>and <em>Munson, </em>unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The district court, however, observed that <em>Schaumburg </em>and <em>Munson </em>involved regulations affecting door-to-door, on-street, or other public forms of solicitation and concluded, \u201cThere is * * * a constitutional difference between the type of regulations allowed on the City\u2019s payroll and those permitted on the City\u2019s streets.\u201d <em>United Black Community Fund v. City of St. Louis, </em>613 F.Supp. 739, 742 (E.D.Mo. 1985). This conclusion correctly anticipated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985), a case involving access to the Combined Federal Campaign, an annual structured program for the solicitation during working hours of charitable contributions from federal employees. The government had limited participation in the Campaign to health and welfare charities providing direct assistance to individuals, in contrast to nonprofit organizations engaged in lobbying or public interest litigation. The Supreme Court recognized that in the context of the workplace, charitable solicitation implicates not just the first amendment but also the government\u2019s interest as a property owner in limiting its property to the intended uses. <em>Id. </em>at 3448. The Court thus applied \u201cforum analysis\u201d \u2014 i.e., the previously developed doctrine embodying the proper balance between speech and government property interests \u2014 to determine the appropriate standard of scrutiny by which the limitations on solicitation were to be measured. <em>Id; see Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Association, </em>460 U.S. 37, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983); <em>Hubbard Broadcasting v. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, </em>797 F.2d 552 (8th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">The St. Louis payroll deduction program, the district court concluded, is a nonpublic forum, <em>United Black Community Fund, </em>613 F.Supp. at 744; and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s similar conclusion with regard to the forum in <em>Cornelius, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3450-51, we cannot disagree. In both instances the governmental unit opened a portion of its workplace \u2014 a setting basically incompatible with general public expression \u2014 on a limited basis to only those charitable organizations which met certain requirements. The circumstances under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>which the respective regulations were developed each suggested more a concern with minimizing disruption than an intent to designate a public forum open to all charities. Furthermore, prior access to the forum (an element which was present in <em>Cornelius </em>but was not discussed) is irrelevant because, as the district court pointed out, a governmental unit which opens a nonpublic forum to the public is not required to maintain the open character of the forum indefinitely. 613 F.Supp. at 744 (citing <em>Perry, </em>460 S.Ct. at 45-46, 103 S.Ct.at 954-955).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Restrictions on access to nonpublic forums are permissible \u201cso long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3451. The Fund challenges only the district court\u2019s conclusion that the St. Louis regulation was reasonable, arguing that the court in fact applied a weaker \u201crational basis\u201d test like that used in equal protection analysis when no fundamental rights are involved. The Supreme Court in <em>Cornelius, </em>however, emphasized that a governmental restriction on access to a nonpublic forum does not have to be the \u201cmost reasonable\u201d or \u201conly reasonable\u201d limitation possible and does not have to be \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d or enacted in aid of a \u201ccompelling\u201d governmental interest. <em>Id. </em>at 3453. The Court particularly noted that the Combined Federal Campaign could reasonably be limited on the premise that a dollar spent directly providing food or shelter to a needy person was more certain of doing benefit than a dollar spent on litigation. <em>Id. </em>The St. Louis regulation achieves the same purpose of limiting participation in the payroll deduction program to those charities most certain of doing the most benefit to the needy, regardless of whether the excluded charities exceed the twenty-five percent administrative expenses cap because of inefficiency or fraud or because they at least in part distribute their benefits more indirectly through educational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Finally, the Supreme Court in <em>Cornelius </em>made clear that a restriction on access to a nonpublic forum does not run afoul of the first amendment \u201cmerely because use of that forum may be the most efficient means of delivering the speaker\u2019s message.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fund has not suggested that it does not have access to St. Louis city employees through mail or in-person solicitation outside the workplace. Accordingly, we conclude that the City\u2019s twenty-five percent administrative expenses cap for participation in the payroll deduction process is consistent with the demands of the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">We have carefully considered the Fund\u2019s additional contentions that the St. Louis regulation is overbroad and void for vagueness and delegates excessive discretion to the administering official; and in light of our conclusions above, we must reject these arguments also. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">. The Honorable Edward L. Filippine, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
