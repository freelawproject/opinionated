Adhering to the established law of this circuit, we hold that a pre-claim agreement to arbitrate such claims is not enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-21\">Appellees Frederick and Heather Wolfe and Joseph Gorman brought separate suits in their respective district courts in Florida claiming that their respective brokers, E.F. Hutton and Merrill Lynch,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were liable under 10b-5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and state law for illegally \u201cchurning\u201d their accounts \u2014 engaging in excessive trading to generate high commissions. In both cases, appellants had signed agreements upon setting up their accounts which included clauses providing that disputes over the accounts would be submitted to arbitration. The brokers, appellants here, sought to enforce the agreements with respect to both the 10b-5 claims and those arising under state law. The district court in <em>Wolfe, </em>No. 85-3352, denied appellant E.F. Hutton\u2019s motion to compel arbitration in its entirety. The district court in <em>Gorman, </em>No. 85-5419, granted appellant Merrill Lynch\u2019s similar motion with respect to the state claims, but denied arbitration of Gorman\u2019s 10b-5 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-22\">On appeal, a panel of this court held that the district courts had properly denied arbitration of the 10b-5 claims but that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number><em>Wolfe </em>court should have granted the motion to compel arbitration of the Wolfes\u2019 state claims. <em>Wolfe v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>780 F.2d 1032 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Gorman v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>780 F.2d 1032 (11th Cir.1985) (consolidated appeals). The panel noted that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, </em>470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985), the arbitration agreement between E.F. Hutton and the Wolfes was enforceable with respect to claims arising under state law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also noted, however, that under <em>Belke v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>693 F.2d 1023, 1025-26 (11th Cir.1982), an agreement to submit a 10b-5 claim to arbitration cannot be enforced. Holding <em>Belke </em>to be binding precedent, the court rejected appellants\u2019 contention that <em>Belke </em>and an earlier case from the former fifth circuit, <em>Sibley v. Tandy Corp., </em>543 F.2d 540, 543 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 824, 98 S.Ct. 71, 54 L.Ed.2d 82 (1977), had been undermined by dicta in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Byrd </em>decision and by Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Doubt cast by <em>Byrd </em>on the continuing validity of <em>Sibley </em>and <em>Belke </em>has led us to consider the issue of 10b-5 arbitration en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">The holding of <em>Belke </em>and <em>Sibley </em>that 10b-5 claims are not arbitrable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision more than thirty years ago in <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953). In that case the Court held that claims arising under section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>111(2), </em>are not subject to arbitration under an agreement otherwise enforceable under the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">The Supreme Court has not extended <em>Wilko </em>to 10b-5 actions. In fact, in <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974), the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-11\">a colorable argument could be made that even the semantic reasoning of the <em>Wil-ko </em>opinion does not control [in a 10b-5 case]. <em>Wilko </em>concerned a suit brought under \u00a7 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, which provides a defrauded purchaser with the \u201cspecial right\u201d of a private remedy for civil liability____ There is no statutory counterpart of \u00a7 12(2) in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and neither \u00a7 10(b) of that Act nor Rule 10b-5 speaks of a private remedy to redress violations____ While federal case law has established that \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 create an implied private cause of action ... the Act itself does not establish the \u201cspecial right\u201d that the Court in <em>Wilko </em>found significant. Furthermore, while both the [1933 and 1934 Acts] contain sections barring waiver of compliance with any \u201cprovision\u201d of the respective Acts, certain of the \u201cprovisions\u201d of the 1933 Act that the Court held could not be waived by Wilko\u2019s agreement to arbitrate find no counterpart in the 1934 Act. In particular, the Court in <em>Wilko </em>noted that the jurisdictional provision of the 1933 Act ... allowed a plaintiff to bring suit \u201cin any court of competent jurisdiction \u2014 federal or state \u2014 and removal from a state court is prohibited.\u201d ____ The analogous provision of the 1934 Act, by contrast, provides for suit only in the federal district courts ... thus significantly restricting the plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 94 S.Ct. at 2454-55. Despite this statement, however, the Court did not actually decide the issue of 10b-5 arbitration in <em>Scherk; </em>the case was instead decided on another, narrower ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">It was after <em>Scherk </em>that the former fifth circuit decided <em>Sibley. </em>The court noted the \u201ccolorable argument\u201d suggested in <em>Scherk </em>but nevertheless affirmed the rulings of several lower courts which had held 10b-5 claims non-arbitrable. The court reasoned that \u201cthe similarities between the [1933 and 1934 Acts] far outweigh any differences which might exist____\u201d 543 F.2d at 543 n. 3. The <em>Belke </em>court merely cited and followed <em>Sibley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">Then came <em>Byrd. </em>The Court in a footnote reiterated the \u201ccolorable argument\u201d from <em>Scherk, </em>and added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-9\">The Court [in <em>Scherk </em>] did not ... hold that <em>Wilko </em>would not apply in the context of a \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim, and <em>Wilko </em>has retained considerable vitality in the lower federal courts. Indeed, numerous District Courts and Courts of Appeals have held that the <em>Wilko </em>analysis applies to claims arising under \u00a7 10(b) ... and that agreements to arbitrate such claims are therefore unenforceable....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-10\">Dean Witter and <em>amici </em>representing the securities industry urge us to resolve the applicability of <em>Wilko </em>to claims under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. We decline to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-11\">470 U.S. at 215 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. at 1240 n. 1. In a concurring opinion, Justice White reemphasized that whether 10b-5 claims are arbitrable was \u201ca matter of substantial doubt,\u201d and expanded on Scherk\u2019s reasoning as to why the <em>Wilko </em>analysis might be inappropriate in the 10b-5 context. <em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 1244 (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-14\">The differences noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Scherk </em>and <em>Byrd </em>between the section 12(2) action held non-arbitrable in <em>Wilko </em>and the 10b-5 action at issue here are significant enough to merit discussion. Indeed, in light of <em>Scherk </em>and <em>Byrd </em>we are inclined to agree with appellants that <em>Wil-ko </em>is distinguishable from this case and hence is not \u201ccontrolling\u201d in the narrow sense of the term. That <em>Wilko </em>may be distinguished, however, does not necessarily mean that <em>Wilko </em>should not be followed. Our task is to determine whether, despite the differences, the similarities between the section 12(2) and 10b-5 causes of action are such that under the circumstances it makes sense to follow <em>Wilko </em>and thus to hold that 10b-5 claims, like those arising under section 12(2), are not subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-17\">Although not discussing the issue in detail, the panel in <em>Sibley </em>concluded that the holding of <em>Wilko </em>is applicable to 10b-5 cases because the similarities between section 12(2) and 10b-5 actions outweigh the differences. We too find the similarities more compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-18\">The purpose of the 1933 and 1934 Acts is the same: \u201cto protect investors\u201d by requiring \u201cfull and fair disclosure\u201d in connection with securities transactions. <em>See Wilko, </em>346 U.S. at 431, 74 S.Ct. at 184; <em>Rudolph v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>800 F.2d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir.1986). One act concerns itself with the issuance of securities and the other with post-issuance transactions, but that does not suggest that they should be treated differently with respect to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-19\">Both section 12(2) and 10b-5 \u201ccreate[ ] a special right to recover for misrepresentation which differs substantially from the common-law action.\u201d <em>Wilko, </em>346 U.S. at 431, 74 S.Ct. at 184. In finding section 12(2) to create a \u201cspecial right\u201d the <em>Wilko </em>Court focused on the fact that under section 12(2) the defendant \u201cis made to assume the burden of proving lack of scien-ter.\u201d <em>Wilko, </em>346 U.S. at 431, 74 S.Ct. at 184. This is not so under 10b-5. <em>See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 193, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1380, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976) (under 10b-5 plaintiff must plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>and prove defendant\u2019s scienter). Nevertheless, the 10b-5 action is also a special one unknown at common law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-4\">Together the section and the rule aim at reaching \u201cmisleading or deceptive activities, whether or not they are precisely and technically sufficient to sustain a common law action____\u201d They are ... designed to encompass the infinite variety of devices that are alien to the \u201cclimate of fair dealing\u201d ... that Congress sought to create and maintain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\"><em>Herpich v. Wallace, </em>430 F.2d 792, 802 (5th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\"><em>Scherk </em>and <em>Byrd </em>correctly point out that the section 12(2) action is expressly provided for, while the 10b-5 action is merely implied. To our knowledge the only suggestion as to how the express/implied distinction makes any difference was by Justice White in his concurrence in <em>Byrd. </em>Justice White observed that the <em>Wilko </em>Court found significance in the fact that a section 12(2) plaintiff was given the right to choose either a state or federal forum. <em>Byrd, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1244 (White, J., concurring). Noting that the 1933 Act declares \u201cvoid\u201d any attempt to \u201cwaive compliance\u201d with the Act, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77n, the Court in <em>Wilko </em>found that a provision compelling arbitration amounts to an agreement by the securities buyer to waive his right to select the forum and hence is void. <em>Wilko, </em>346 U.S. at 434-35, 74 S.Ct. at 186-87. Justice White in <em>Byrd </em>noted the existence of a similar prohibition in the 1934 Act against \u201cwaiv[ing] compliance with any provision of this chapter,\u201d but found it inapplicable since the 10b-5 action was merely implied and hence literally not a \u201cprovision of this chapter.\u201d <em>See </em>470 U.S. at 224, 105 S.Ct. at 1244 (White, J., concurring) (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78cc(a)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmjJ\">We respectfully disagree. The 1934 Act provides that the federal courts are to have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa. This sweeping language applies to all actions brought under the 1934 Act, including implied actions such as the 10b-5 action. <em>See Clark v. Watchie, </em>513 F.2d 994, 997 (9th Cir.) (citing <em>Abramson v. Pennwood Investment Corp., </em>392 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir.1968)), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 841, 96 S.Ct. 72, 46 L.Ed.2d 60 (1975). Regardless of whether the 10b-5 action itself is considered a \u201cprovision of this chapter,\u201d the exclusive jurisdiction provision is undisputably such a \u201cprovision,\u201d which, under the <em>Wilko </em>rationale, should not be considered waivable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">The <em>Wilko </em>Court did not rest its decision solely on the statutory prohibition against waiver. It also noted policy reasons for protecting a potential plaintiff's right to select the forum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-12\">When the security buyer, prior to any violation of the Securities Act, waives his right to sue in courts, he gives up more than would a participant in other business transactions. The security buyer has a wider choice of courts and venue. He thus surrenders one of the advantages the Act gives him and surrenders it at a time when he is less able to judge the weight of the handicap the Securities Act places upon his adversary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-13\">346 U.S. at 435, 74 S.Ct. at 187. This reasoning is not precisely applicable in the 10b-5 context, since federal jurisdiction over 10b-5 claims is exclusive, but the Court\u2019s concern with a security buyer surrendering his advantage nevertheless ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>plies with nearly equal force. Although 10b-5 does not give a plaintiff the right to choose either federal or state court, it does permit a plaintiff to obtain a federal forum without having to meet the requirements of diversity jurisdiction \u2014 something which, for one reason or another, plaintiffs often find advantageous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">The <em>Wilko </em>Court also expressed some doubts about the effectiveness of arbitration in protecting the rights of the plaintiff. The Court noted that in a section 12(2) case the arbitrators\u2019 determinations as to the legal meaning of such key terms as \u201cmaterial fact\u201d could not be examined, and concluded that \u201c[a]s the protective provisions of the Securities Act require the exercise of judicial discretion to fairly assure their effectiveness, it seems to us that Congress must have intended [the anti-waiver provision] to apply to waiver of judicial trial and review.\u201d 346 U.S. at 436-37, 74 S.Ct. at 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">This particular rationale for <em>Wilko </em>may be less compelling today in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s belief that \u201cwe are well past the time when judicial suspicion of the desirability of arbitration and of the competence of arbitral tribunals inhibited the development of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 3354, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). Be that as it may, to our knowledge the Supreme Court has not suggested that <em>Wilko </em>should no longer be applied in its own context of section 12(2) cases. The Court may have concluded, and in any event it is our belief, that the <em>Wilko </em>Court\u2019s other justifications for its decision are sufficient to give <em>Wilko </em>continuing force even though the Court\u2019s attitude toward arbitration has changed since <em>Wilko </em>was decided. It is those other justifications, considered at length above, which we find persuasive in convincing us that there is no principled ground for distinguishing between sections 12(2) and 10(b) with respect to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">Congress\u2019 1975 amendments to the securities laws reinforce our determination that 10b-5 claims are not arbitrable. The 1975 amendments enacted the \u201cmost substantial and significant revision of this country\u2019s federal securities laws since the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\u201d <em>Securities Acts Amendments of 1975: Hearings on S. 249 Before the Subcomm. on Securities of the Senate Comm, on Banking, Housing &amp; Urban Affairs, </em>94th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1975). As part of that revision Congress enacted a provision, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(b), which had the effect of specifically permitting compulsory arbitration of securities claims between securities professionals. The conference report accompanying the legislation stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai9\">[i]t was the clear understanding of the conferees that this amendment did not change existing law, as articulated in <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, [74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168] (1953), concerning the effect of arbitration proceeding provisions in agreements entered into by [other] persons dealing with members and participants of self-regulatory organizations [i.e., securities professionals].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZf\">H.R.Rep. No. 229, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 91, 111 (1975), <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 179, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">This is not a particularly clear statement of congressional intent. Indeed, both sides in the controversy before us rely on this language to support their positions. Ap-pellees contend that Congress meant to endorse <em>Wilko </em>and the line of lower court cases extending <em>Wilko </em>to 10b-5 cases. Appellants, noting that few lower courts had yet considered the applicability of <em>Wilko </em>to 10b-5 claims, argue that Congress was aware of the then-recent <em>Scherk </em>decision and meant to confirm that <em>Wilko </em>did <em>not </em>extend to 10b-5 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">We are inclined to reject both of these interpretations and instead take the statement at face value, as an endorsement of <em>Wilko </em>itself and nothing more. Yet we note that Congress, in enacting a provision which it recognized would permit arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>tion between securities professionals, declined to take further action. Congress was presumably aware that courts had begun to extend <em>Wilko </em>to 10b-5 claims, <em>see, e.g., Greater Continental Corp. v. Schechter, </em>422 F.2d 1100, 1103 (2d Cir.1970), and that the Supreme Court\u2019s only response had been to note in <em>Scherk </em>that there was a \u201ccolorable argument\u201d that <em>Wilko </em>was \u201cnot controlling\u201d in such cases. Yet Congress passed up a clear opportunity to disavow this trend. We recognize that an inference from congressional silence is of somewhat limited value, and we would reach the same result without taking the 1975 amendments into account. Nevertheless, Congress\u2019s failure to halt the application of <em>Wilko </em>to 10b-5 in 1975, or at any point since then,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is at least some evidence that Congress \u201chas been satisfied with, and adopted, the construction given to its enactment by the courts.\u201d <em>Electric Storage Battery Co. v. Shimadzu, </em>307 U.S. 5, 14, 59 S.Ct. 675, 681, 83 L.Ed. 1071 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Since <em>Sibley </em>was decided, a number of other circuits have considered whether 10b-5 claims are arbitrable. Each was aware of the \u201ccolorable argument\u201d set forth in <em>Scherk </em>that 10b-5 claims are arbi-trable. Nevertheless, with but one exception <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> each court has held that they are not. <em>See McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1986); <em>De Lancie v. Birr, Wilson &amp; Co., </em>648 F.2d 1255, 1258-59 (9th Cir.1981) (unspecified \u201cchurning\u201d case); <em>Mansbach v. Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, </em>598 F.2d 1017, 1030 (6th Cir.1979); <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Moore, </em>590 F.2d 823-29 (10th Cir.1978); <em>Weissbuch v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>558 F.2d 831, 833-36 (7th Cir.1977); <em>Ayres v.

Only one of these decisions, holding 10b-5 claims non-arbitrable, <em>McMahon, </em>was also handed down after the Supreme Court\u2019s repetition of the <em>Scherk </em>argument in <em>Byrd, </em>but <em>Byrd </em>added nothing to <em>Scherk. </em>The majority decision in <em>Byrd </em>simply cited <em>Scherk, </em>noted the lower court precedent and reiterated that for the Court, whether 10b-5 claims are arbitrable is an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">We are aware that a number of district courts in this circuit have determined that pre-claim agreements to arbitrate 10b-5 claims are enforceable. They were mistaken in doing so. <em>Sibley </em>was the law in the former fifth circuit since 1976 and in this circuit since its formation. <em>Sibley </em>cited <em>Scherk </em>and declined to adopt its \u201ccolorable argument.\u201d <em>Byrd, </em>again, added nothing new. We recognize that the Supreme Court considers the issue open and may at some point expressly limit or overrule <em>Wil-ko, </em>but we agree with the second circuit that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this Circuit based on mere speculation. We think that the orderly administration of justice will be best served if we as one of the inferior courts follow Supreme Court precedent and adhere to the settled law of this Circuit, and a fortiori the district courts should do likewise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\"><em>McMahon, </em>788 F.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">The district court\u2019s judgment in No. 85-3352 is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part with directions that the district court grant the motion to arbitrate the state law claims.

We use the term \u201carbitrable\" to refer to the enforceability of a pre-claim agreement to arbitrate by a securities professional as against a non-professional. The arbitrability of 10b-5 claims pursuant to a post-claim agreement, or without either parties' objection, or between securities professionals, <em>see infra </em>p. 1037, is not at issue here and is hence beyond the scope of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">. The same provision also prohibits waiver of compliance with \"any rule or regulation\" promulgated under the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78cc(a). Under Justice White\u2019s reasoning, however, the provision is still not violated by an agreement to arbitrate 10b-5 claims since such an agreement does not waive compliance with the actual rule, but only bars resort to the implied judicial remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1140-14\">.

The court essentially adopted the \"colorable argument\u201d set forth in <em>Scherk </em>and <em>Byrd </em>and Justice White\u2019s argument in his <em>Byrd </em>concurrence.

In light of our holding on the <em>Wilko </em>issue, however, we need not reach the issue today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, concurring in which HILL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahmx\">joins:</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Section 14 of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) provides as follows: \u201cAny condition, stipulation, or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of this sub-chapter or of the rules and regulations of the Commission shall be void.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77n (1982). In <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953), the Supreme Court held that this provision rendered unenforceable an agreement to arbitrate a future controversy arising under section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>111 </em>(2) (1982). Absent section 14, the agreement to arbitrate would have been enforceable pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14 (1982). The issue before the en banc court is whether an agreement to arbitrate a future controversy arising under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1982), is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The 1934 Act contains a provision that is nearly identical to section 14 of the 1933 Act. Section 29 of the 1934 Act contains the following language: \u201cAny condition, stipulation, or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder, or of any rule of an exchange required thereby shall be void.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78cc(a) (1982). The Supreme Court in <em>Wilko </em>held that section 14 of the 1933 Act took precedence over the policies underlying the Federal Arbitration Act and prevented enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate a 1933 Act dispute. Section 29 of the 1934 Act essentially replicates section 14 of the 1933 Act. Under the teaching of <em>Wilko, </em>therefore, we must conclude that section 29 of the 1934 Act overrides the Federal Arbitration Act and renders unenforceable agreements to arbitrate 1934 Act disputes. There is no principled means of arriving at a contrary interpretation regarding the 1933 and 1934 Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">It is of no avail to attempt to draw the distinction that a section 12(2) private cause of action is expressly provided for in the statute whereas a section 10(b) private action is implied. To say that a private cause of action is implied is to say that Congress intended such an action to exist. <em>See, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. Curran, </em>456 U.S. 353, 377-78, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 1838-39, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982); <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 15-16, 100 S.Ct. 242, 245, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979). It is as if Congress explicitly provided for the cause of action. Because Congress intended to create a section 10(b) cause of action, it also intended section 29 to be applicable to it, and the inquiry before us is no different than the one before the Court in <em>Wilko.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">Were I writing on a clean slate, I might well be inclined to reach a result contrary to the <em>Wilko </em>Court. Section 14 of the 1933 Act renders void any provision binding a security purchaser to \u201cwaive compliance with any provision of this subchapter\u201d or the relevant rules and regulations thereunder. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77n (1982). A fair reading of this statute would prevent a purchaser from waiving a seller\u2019s compliance with the substantive provisions of the Act, i.e., its reporting and disclosure requirements. By agreeing to arbitrate, the purchaser does not waive the Act\u2019s protections, but merely agrees to enforce the Act\u2019s provisions in a forum other than the courts. We must follow <em>Wilko, </em>however, and I accordingly concur fully in the court\u2019s holding that section 10(b) claims are not subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">. In addition to the constraints imposed by the <em>Wilko </em>decision, I also recognize that in the years following <em>Wilko, </em>the Congress may have indicated its satisfaction with the state of the law in this area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
