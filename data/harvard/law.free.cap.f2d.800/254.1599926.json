McLean petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Docket No. SE831L8510211, affirming the decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to terminate his disability retirement annuity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-26\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b368-27\">McLean, retired from his position as a Firefighter (Structural), GS-5, Step 5, in Hawaii on December 12, 1974, and began receiving a disability annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-28\">Such an annuity is subject to termination under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(d) if the annuitant, before becoming sixty years of age, has earnings from wages and/or self-employment equal to 80% or more of the \u201ccurrent rate of pay\u201d for the position occupied before retirement. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.502(e)(1) (1984), McLean filed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>OPM a statement of his income from wages or self-employment for the year 1983 showing an income of $15,600.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The 1983 annual salary rate of a Firefighter (Structural), GS-5/5, was $15,-153.00. A firefighter was also entitled to receive premium \u201cstandby\u201d pay at a rate of 25% of basic pay. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5545(c)(1). Government employees, including firefighters, stationed in Hawaii were additionally provided a 20% cost-of-living (COLA) allowance under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">OPM determined in accordance with the regulations <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the \u201ccurrent rate of pay\u201d of a firefighter for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(d) means basic salary plus premium \u201cstandby\u201d pay, but does not include the COLA allowance. McLean\u2019s income for 1983 ($15,600) exceeded 80% of current rate of pay ($15,153) computed in this manner ($15,153 + 3,788 X 80%) and, accordingly, OPM terminated McLean\u2019s annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">After MSPB affirmed OPM\u2019s decision, McLean filed this appeal and contends that \u201ccurrent rate of pay\u201d for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(d) should include the COLA allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Judicial review of disability determinations of OPM and MSPB by this court is limited to determining whether \u201cthere has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error \u2018going to the heart of the administrative process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 1622, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985); <em>Scroggins v. United States, </em>397 F.2d 295, 297 (Ct.Cl.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 952, 89 S.Ct. 376, 21 L.Ed.2d 363 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">At issue is whether OPM\u2019s regulations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> misconstrue the governing legislation, 5 U.S.C. 8337(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by interpreting the phrase \u201ccurrent rate of pay\u201d therein to mean current rate of <em>basic </em>pay. The regulations promulgated by OPM, the agency charged with administration of the civil service retirement laws, are entitled to great deference and should be sustained if consistent with the statute. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>454 U.S. 555, 102 S.Ct. 805, 70 L.Ed.2d 768 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">We find OPM\u2019s interpretation to be consistent with the language and purpose of the statutory provisions dealing with civil service retirement benefits and to be supported by relevant authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">Section 8331(3) of Title 5 defines \u201cbasic pay\u201d and provides that it includes certain enumerated additions to basic salary, including <em>inter alia </em>the premium pay for firefighters, but that all other bonuses and allowances are excluded. In pertinent part, Section 8331(3) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-19\">\u201cbasic pay\u201d includes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-21\">(C) premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) of this title; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-22\">but does not include bonuses, <em>allowances, </em>overtime pay, military pay, pay given in addition to the base pay of the position as fixed by law or regulation except as provided by subparagraphs (B), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>(C), and (D) of this paragraph____ (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u201cBasic pay\u201d as so defined is used to compute \u201caverage pay\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(4). Average pay, in turn, serves as the basis for computing civil service retirement annuities and survivor annuities payable to surviving spouses and minor children. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8339, 8341(b), (d), (e). Thus, OPM\u2019s reference to basic pay in applying the disability retirement annuity provisions is entirely consistent with express statutory provisions governing other types of civil service annuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 8331(3) speaks in terms of the current rate of pay of the \u201cposition occupied\u201d before retirement. The definition of \u201cbasic pay,\u201d with certain specifically enumerated exceptions, does not include \u201callowances ... given in addition to the <em>base pay of the position </em>as fixed by law or regulation____\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Hawaii COLA allowance was provided to government employees because of the high cost of the place of their duty station. It is the pay for McLean\u2019s position which is relevant for purposes of determining McLean\u2019s continued entitlement to a disability annuity, not other allowances provided because of the location at which employment in that position might be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">OPM\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccurrent rate of pay\u201d also has the express or implicit support of the case law. <em>See Lancellotti v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>704 F.2d 91, 99 (3d Cir.1983) (\u201ccurrent rate of pay\u201d referred to in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(d) is derived from the applicable government pay scale, promulgated pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5305 and 5332); <em>Kalv v. United States, </em>124 F.Supp. 654, 128 Ct.Cl. 207 (1954) (an employee illegally removed was entitled to back pay at his base compensation rate only, without additional twenty-five percent overseas differential); and <em>Curlott v. Campbell, </em>598 F.2d 1175, 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.1979) (the cost-of-living allowance under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5941 supplements the basic pay of federal employees).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.502(e)(3) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">When, in any calendar year, a disability annuitant under age 60 has received income from wages and/or self-employment, equall-ing at least 80 percent of the current rate of <em>basic </em>pay of the position from which he or she retired, the annuitant\u2019s earning capacity is deemed restored. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-12\">. <em>Supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(d) (1982) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\">. In <em>Famulary v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>12 M.S.P.B. 166, 13 M.S.P.R. 166 (1982), a Postal Service COLA was included in determining the \u201ccurrent rate of pay\" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(d). MSPB found that COLA to be an across-the-board, cost-of-living adjustment applicable to all employees. It was in the nature of a negotiated wage increase for postal workers which would become part of their base pay on its effective date. We do not find this to be inconsistent with our decision herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
