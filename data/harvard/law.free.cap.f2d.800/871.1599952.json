Part A of the Medicare Act covers institutional health costs, such as hospital expenses, and is financed by mandatory payroll deductions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c-1395i-2. Part B of the Act is an optional insurance program for supplementary medical services, including physician services, medical supplies, and laboratory tests. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395j-1395w.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-29\">Appellants Delmacio Linoz and Julian Velez<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were denied reimbursement under Part B of the Act for the cost of air and ground ambulance services incurred when they were transferred from outlying hospitals in Hawaii to better equipped urban facilities to be treated by medical specialists. Denial of their claims was based on section 2120.3F of the Carrier\u2019s Manual,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>publication of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d) that sets forth rules made binding in Part B benefit determinations by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.860 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this consolidated action, appellants, Julian Velez and Delmacio Linoz\u2019s surviving widow, seek a judicial declaration invalidating section 2120.3F of the Carrier\u2019s Manual on the ground that the Secretary issued it without rulemaking proceedings or publication in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982), and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants also claim that the enforcement of section 2120.3F against them violates provisions of the Medicare Act authorizing the Secretary to promulgate regulations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh, and entitling claimants to a fair hearing, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(C), as well as constitutional due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The Secretary has delegated the administration of Medicare Part B claims to private insurance carriers. <em>See Schweiker v. McClure, </em>456 U.S. 188, 190-91, 102 S.Ct. 1665, 1667-68, 72 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). Part B claimants submit their bills directly to the carrier, and the carrier reimburses claimants according to whether their claims meet detailed coverage criteria. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.801, .803. Claimants dissatisfied by delayed or insufficient payment have limited rights of appeal. They are entitled to a de novo written review before a carrier employee other than the initial decision-maker. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.807-.809. If still dissatisfied, and if the claim is $100 or more, the claimant may request a hearing before a disinterested hearing officer employed by the carrier. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(b)(3)(C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.820. The hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal and binding upon all parties to the hearing.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.835. Unlike a Part A claimant, a Part B claimant has no right to judicial review of the amount of a hearing officer\u2019s benefit award. <em>See United States v. Erika, Inc., </em>456 U.S. 201, 208, 102 S.Ct. 1650, 1654, 72 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982); <em>Schweiker v.

Heckler, </em>No. CV 82-0390 (D.Hawaii 1984)). The carrier\u2019s hearing officer upheld the carrier\u2019s denial of benefits on the basis of section 2120.3F of the Carrier\u2019s Manual, rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>soning that its plain meaning compelled the conclusion that the unavailability of an urologist at the initiating hospital \u201cis not a consideration in determining if the [destination] hospital has appropriate facilities to care for the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Appellant Velez suffered from emphysema and asthma, with further respiratory complications. Velez\u2019s physician, Dr. Morin, ordered Velez transferred by air ambulance from Honokaa Hospital on Hawaii to Straub Hospital in Honolulu to \u201csee if there were any further therapeutic or management approaches which might improve or at least stabilize\u201d Velez\u2019s \u201csevere, far advanced, incapacitating chronic obstructive lung disease.\u201d Exhibit D of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint at 4 (filed July 21, 1982) <em>(Linoz v. Heckler, </em>No. CV 82-0390 (D.Hawaii 1984)). Dr. Morin testified that there was \u201cno pulmonary specialist in the Big Island at that time,\u201d and that \u201cthe nurses [were] not competent in reading a monitor or treating arrythmias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The hearing officer upheld the carrier\u2019s denial of benefits on the basis of section 2120.3F, quoting the Manual verbatim that \u201cAmbulance service to a more distant hospital solely to avail the patient of the services of ... a physician in a specific specialty does not make that hospital the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Appellants filed suit in district court to enjoin enforcement of the ambulance rule embodied in section 2120.3F and to obtain new hearings under revised regulations. First, they asserted that the Secretary\u2019s issuance of unpublished binding rules through the Carrier\u2019s Manual violated the APA and FOIA. Second, appellants claimed that the Secretary violated the Medicare Act\u2019s provision that the Secretary administer the program through regulations by issuing informal binding rules through the Carrier\u2019s Manual. Finally, appellants asserted a due process right to individualized case-by-case determinations of fact and applications of law in Part B hearings. After ruling in an unpublished order that it had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1361, <em>Linoz v. Schweiker, </em>No. 82 0390 (D.Hawaii, order filed July 5, 1983), the district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the manual provision was an interpretive rule that conformed with the statute and did not require notice and comment rulemaking. <em>Linoz v. Heckler, </em>598 F.Supp. 486, 490 (D.Hawaii 1984). Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">The legal questions presented by this appeal are reviewable de novo. <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied </em>469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984); <em>Clayton v. Republic Airlines, Inc., </em>716 F.2d 729, 730 (9th Cir.1983) (subject matter jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">As a preliminary matter, the Secretary argues that Congress precluded judicial review of Part B benefit determinations, and that appellants\u2019 challenge to the Secretary\u2019s informal issuance of binding rules is accordingly barred from review because it is either essentially a claim for benefits or \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with such a claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>602, 614, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 2021, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984). The Secretary\u2019s argument has been foreclosed by <em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (U.S. 1986). In <em>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>the Supreme Court held that the exhaustion and judicial review provisions of the Social Security Act, incorporated by reference in the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395ff, 1395ii, do not insulate from review Part B regulations and instructions promulgated by the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2137-38. The Court distinguished between individual Part B benefit determinations \u2014 which are \u201cfinally and exclusively\u201d delegated to carrier hearing officers, <em>id. </em>at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2138-40 \u2014 and the validity of the Secretary\u2019s procedures for computing Part B claims, which the Carrier\u2019s Manual expressly removes from the carriers\u2019 jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at-&amp; n. 5, 106 S.Ct. at 2137-38 &amp; n. 5. While the Court reaffirmed its prior holdings that Congress deliberately foreclosed judicial review with respect to typically \u201ctrivial\u201d Part B reimbursement amounts, <em>id. </em>at---, 106 S.Ct. at 2137-40, <em>see also Erika, </em>456 U.S. at 208, 102 S.Ct. at 1654, the Court held that neither the legislative history nor the statutory framework gives \u201c \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 \u201d that Congress \u201cintended no review at all of substantial statutory and constitutional challenges to the Secretary\u2019s administration of Part B of the Medicare program.\u201d <em>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 2141 <em>(quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511-12, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)). Thus, the Court held that federal question jurisdiction was available to review Part B regulations asserted to be inconsistent with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-17\"><em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians </em>is controlling authority for the district court\u2019s exercise of federal question jurisdiction in this case. Having determined that the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, we need not reach the separate question whether jurisdiction lay under the mandamus statute. We now consider the merits of appellants\u2019 claim that application of section 2120.3F of the Carrier\u2019s Manual to deny reimbursement of their ambulance costs violated the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-18\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">In 1971, the Secretary promulgated regulations providing coverage for ambulance services from a hospital which \u201clacks appropriate facilities\u201d to \u201cthe nearest institution having appropriate facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.232(i) (1972). In 1975, the Secretary included section 2120.3F in the Carrier\u2019s Manual, which provided that transportation to another hospital \u201csolely to avail a patient of the service of ... a physician in a specific speciality\u201d did not make the hospital where that physician was located the \u201cnearest hospital with appropriate facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-21\">Appellants contend that by making section 2120.3F of the Carrier\u2019s Manual binding on Part B hearing officers through 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.860, the Secretary unlawfully circumvented the advance public notice and comment requirements of section 553 of the APA. Section 553 requires publication of proposed agency rules to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>followed by a period for public consideration and comment. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b), (c). Agency rules which are merely interpretive are exempt from the notice and comment requirements. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cInterpretive rules are those which merely clarify or explain existing law or regulations.\u201d <em>Powderly v. Schweiker, </em>704 F.2d 1092, 1098 (9th Cir.1983); <em>see also Vance v. Hegstrom, </em>793 F.2d 1018 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Cubanski v. Heckler, </em>781 F.2d 1421, 1426 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Alcaraz v. Block, </em>746 F.2d 593 (9th Cir.1984). They are \u201cnon-binding\u201d and do not \u201cforeclose alternate courses of action or conclusively affect rights of private parties.\u201d <em>Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 F.2d 694, 702 (D.C.Cir.1980). Only substantive rules are subject to the APA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Powderly, </em>704 F.2d at 1098 (9th Cir.1983). \u201cSubstantive rules are those which effect a change in existing law or policy,\u201d or remove previously existing rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Section 2120.3F of the Carriers Manual excluded payment for ambulance service to another hospital \u201csolely to obtain the services ... of a physician in a specific specialty\u201d on the ground that it did not constitute the \u201cnearest hospital with appropriate facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pursuant to this provision, Linoz was denied coverage for the cost of ambulance services when he was rushed to a Honolulu hospital so that a resident specialist in urology could care for his hemorrhaged urinary condition. Likewise, when Velez was denied benefits for the cost of transportation to receive treatment from a pulmonary specialist, the hearing officer relied exclusively on the same blanket provision making the cost of transportation to be treated by a specialist non-reimbursable. Thus, instead of simply clarifying a pre-existing regulation, section 2120.3F carved out a per se exception to the rule that ambulance service to the \u201cnearest institution with appropriate facilities,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.232(i), was covered under Part B of the Medicare program. The provision withdrew coverage previously provided and thus \u201ceffect[ed] a change in existing law or policy.\u201d <em>Powderly, </em>at 1098. We therefore find that it was substantive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">Since the ambulance rule embodied in section 2120.3F is substantive and neither required nor specifically authorized by the enabling legislation,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Secretary-</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>was required to conform with the notice and comment procedure of section 553 of the APA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Agency rules are invalid if the agency fails to comply with APA requirements. <em>Buschmann v. Schweiker, </em>676 F.2d 352, 355-56 (9th Cir.1982); <em>cf. Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 313, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1723, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979) (\u201c[c]ertainly regulations subject to the APA cannot be afforded the \u2018force and effect of law\u2019 if not promulgated pursuant to the statutory procedural minimum found in that Act\u201d). We therefore hold that section 2120.3F of the Carrier\u2019s Manual was invalid at the time it was applied to deny appellants\u2019 Part B claims. We reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Secretary and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-20\">. Feliza Gallardo Linoz was substituted by stipulation as a party plaintiff upon the death of her husband while this action was pending before the district court. For the sake of simplicity, this opinion will continue to refer to her deceased husband as an appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b985-31\">. The Carrier\u2019s Manual is a compilation of instructions prepared and periodically revised by the Secretary for circulation to private insurance carriers charged with computing and pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>ing Part B claims in conformity with the Act. Although carrier-appointed hearing officers are required to rule in strict conformity with manual provisions, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.860, the Carrier\u2019s Manual is not published in the Federal Register or the Code of Federal Regulations. At the time that appellants' benefits were denied, section 2120.3F provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aaf-dedup-1\">The individual physician who practices in a hospital is not a consideration in determining whether the hospital has appropriate facilities. Thus, ambulance service to a more distant hospital solely to avail a patient of the service of a specific physician or a physician in a specific specialty does not make the hospital in which the physician has staff privileges the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azx\">It has since been revised. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b986-9\">. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.860 provides that carrier hearing officers charged with reviewing Part B claims must \u201ccomply with all the provisions of title XVIII of the Act and regulations issued thereunder, as well as with policy statements, instructions and other guides issued by the Health Care Financing Administration in accordance with the Secretary\u2019s agreement with the carriers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b986-13\">. In their prayer for relief, plaintiffs also sought (1) an order of mandamus compelling the Secretary to grant them a new hearing under revised regulations that do not make unpublished manual provisions binding in Part B hearings; and (2) certification of a nationwide class of similarly aggrieved Part B beneficiaries. The district court declined to certify the requested class because it held plaintiffs\u2019 substantive claims to be meritless. The denial of class certification is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\">. Section 405(g) of the Social Security Act authorizes judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions but conditions such review on the claimant\u2019s exhaustion of administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) bars claimants from invoking federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and jurisdiction predicated on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 \"to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h); <em>see Wein-berger v.

Thus, to obtain judicial review of the \"findings and decisions of the Secretary,\" 42 U.S.C. 405(h), claimants must exhaust the administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary. <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. at 617, 104 S.Ct. at 2023.</p>\n<p id=\"Alui\">The Medicare Act incorporates section 405(h) into its framework. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ii. Thus judicial review is not available for \"findings of fact or decisions of the Secretary\u201d under the Medicare Act \u201cexcept as herein provided.\u201d 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Part A claimants are specifically granted access to federal district court through section 405(g). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b). There is no similar provision for Part B claimants. The Secretary thus correctly asserts that Congress foreclosed judicial review of Part B benefit determinations. <em>See generally United States v.

However, in 1971, the Secretary elected to waive the \"benefits\u201d exception to the APA, 39 Fed.Reg. 2532, so that regulations promulgated thereafter would be subjected to public scrutiny and comment in advance of implementation. <em>See Holy Cross Hospital-Mission Hills </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 1340, 1346 (9th Cir.1984).

Block, </em>746 F.2d 593 (9th Cir.1984), a statutory revision required applicants for children\u2019s food programs to supply the Social Security numbers of all adult household members. <em>Id. </em>at 599. We ruled that collection requirements promulgated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>by the Secretary to enforce the revision were interpretive, not substantive, because they \"merely tracked\u201d statutory requirements and \"simply explained something the statute already required.\" <em>Id. </em>at 613. Here, by contrast, the statute neither requires nor specifically authorizes the Secretary to deny reimbursement for ambulance transportation based on the availability of a specialist at the receiving hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b990-8\">. Alternatively, the Secretary should have published the manual provisions pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(1)(D). Under FOIA, agency rules must be published in the Federal Register if they are \"statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability.\" However, \"interpretations that have been adopted by the agency\u201d need only be made available for public inspection. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2). In <em>Anderson v. Butz, </em>550 F.2d 459, 463 (9th Cir.1977), this court held that agency rules need not be published if they are (1) only a clarification or explanation of existing laws or regulations and (2) have no significant impact on any segment of the public. <em>See also Lewis v. Weinberger, </em>415 F.Supp. 652, 659 (D.N.M.1976). Here, even if section 2120.-3F were deemed only a clarification or explanation of \"appropriate facilities,\u201d it had a significant impact on a segment of the public, in particular claimants who lack easy access to specialists. <em>See Anderson, </em>550 F.2d at 463 (unpublished instruction that required housing subsidies paid by HUD to be treated as income for food stamp purposes voided under FOIA because of \"significant impact on food stamp recipients\u201d); <em>see also Lewis v. Weinberger, </em>415 F.Supp. 652 (D.N.M.1976) (unpublished Indian Health Service policy that denied contract health care to off-reservation Indians voided under FOIA.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b990-18\">.
