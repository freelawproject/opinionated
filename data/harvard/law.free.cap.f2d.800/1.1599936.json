After plaintiff presented his case, the federal court for the District of Puerto Rico granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendant Colon then brought this suit against plaintiff for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The district court declined to assess attorney\u2019s fees against plaintiff under \u00a7 1988 and instead imposed fees on plaintiff\u2019s counsel under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendant appeals the district court\u2019s decision not to assess fees against plaintiff under \u00a7 1988. Because the court acted within its statutory discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-22\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 provides that \u201cthe court, in its discretion may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that when the prevailing party is a defendant, the district court may assess fees against the plaintiff under \u00a7 1988 only upon a finding \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number><em>EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The district court cannot be faulted for determining that plaintiff\u2019s first amendment claim \u2014 that he was unlawfully removed from the bank\u2019s board of directors because of his political affiliation \u2014 required close judicial scrutiny. Only after the court heard plaintiff\u2019s evidence was it able to conclude that the board position was one which fell within the <em>Elrod-Branti </em>exception to first amendment protection and that political affiliation thus was an appropriate basis for plaintiff\u2019s removal. <em>See Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976). Therefore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s first amendment claim did not meet the standard articulated in <em>Hughes </em>for the imposition of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Although the district court did not explicitly find that the plaintiff\u2019s due process claims met the <em>Hughes </em>test, we read the court\u2019s finding that there was \u201cno possible excuse for having included the due process claims as part of the complaint under the facts of this case\u201d as a finding that the standard was met. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to assess fees under \u00a7 1988. The statutory language \u2014 \u201cthe court, in its discretion, <em>may </em>allow\u201d fees to prevailing parties \u2014 is permissive; we believe that it invests the district court with a reasonable measure of discretion to withold fees in cases where there are good reasons for doing so. We think there were adequate reasons here for the court to resolve the fees issue as it did.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Here the complaint contained both non-frivolous and frivolous claims. We are reluctant to adopt a rule requiring a court to engage in such fine tuning that it must award fees as to an insubstantial claim even though another claim was more substantial and perhaps even prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">While we recognize the principle that the parties are ultimately responsible for the conduct of their lawsuits, we do not want to deprive the trial court of flexibility in the myriad of situations in which attorney\u2019s fees or other sanctions may be assessed.. The district court presided over all of the proceedings and is uniquely qualified to \u201cperform the balancing of equities that is an integral part of the proceedings for award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>P. Mastrippoli-to and Sons, Inc. v. Joseph, </em>692 F.2d 1384 (3rd Cir.1982) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The district court here noted that plaintiff\u2019s counsel had vast experience in litigation involving political discrimination and thus should have known that the due process claims were groundless. Accordingly, it did as we have done on appeal \u2014 assessed fees against counsel as opposed to client, <em>See, e.g., Villafane v. Segarra, </em>797 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1986) (assessing fees for frivolous appeal against plaintiff-appellant\u2019s attorney personally since the attorney drew the complaint and wrote the brief); <em>cf. Gi-anfriddo v. The Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>787 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir.1986) (assessing attorney's fees and double costs against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>appellant with the proviso that \u201c[i]f appellant\u2019s counsel did not advise against the propriety of taking this appeal ... then in good conscience he should reimburse appellant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">While two circuits have held that a district court\u2019s conclusion that counsel was primarily at fault in filing a frivolous claim is an inadequate ground for refusing to assess fees against plaintiff in a Title VII case, <em>Durrett v. Jenkins Brickyard, Inc., </em>678 F.2d 911, 916 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Prate v. Freedman, </em>583 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. 1978), in these cases the district court had not already assessed defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees against plaintiff\u2019s counsel under a separate provision. The district court\u2019s Rule 11 award in this case serves to sanction and deter the filing of meritless claims and to compensate those forced to defend against them. Under these circumstances we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the district court\u2019s decision to decline to award defendant fees under \u00a7 1988 as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\">. <em>See Cloutier v. Town of Epping, </em>714 F.2d 1184, 1193 (1st Cir.1983) (affirming fee denial under 1988 reasoning that \"[ajlthough lacking in merit, we cannot say plaintiffs' claims, when brought, were so patently frivolous as to have required the district court to award fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">On pages 12-13 of his brief, appellant cites eighteen cases supposedly \"analogous\" to the case before us in support of the proposition that the district court decision should be reversed as an abuse of discretion. Four of these cases are district court decisions awarding fees; eleven are simply affirmances of decisions allowing fees; one is actually a reversal of a decision awarding fees which appellant has irresponsibly mischaracterized as a decision granting fees. Only two cases reverse district court denials of fee awards, and they reverse not for abuse of discretion, but for error. <em>Davidson v. Keenan, </em>740 F.2d 129 (2d Cir.1984), the Second Circuit reversed a fee denial and remanded the case because the district court had applied a \u201cgood faith\u201d standard instead of the <em>Hughes </em>test. In <em>Prochaska v. Marcoux, 632 </em>F.2d 848 (10th Cir.1980), the Tenth Circuit held clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs claim was nonfrivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
