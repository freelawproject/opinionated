Des. 258,100 (the \u2019100 patent)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Des. 258,101 (the \u2019101 patent)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> enforceable and not invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, and willfully and deliberately infringed by appellants, Preview Furniture Corporation, Furniture Marketing Specialists, Inc. (FMS),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Eli J. Ehrlich,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (collectively called Preview). The court also awarded to Pacific Furniture Manufacturing Co. (Pacific), owner of both patents by assignment, treble compensatory damages under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, and attorney fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-18\">Both patents in suit are directed to upholstered armchairs comprising several essential elements: arms, a back and a seat cushion. The chairs also embody a swivel base platform upon which the chair can pivot and which is invisible to the viewer of the chair, and a box member upon which the seat cushion rests and which conceals the swivel base from view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-19\">Appellant Preview\u2019s accused devices, Style No. 806 (which was found to infringe the \u2019100 patent) and Style No. 807 (which was found to infringe the \u2019101 patent), were designed by Ehrlich in January or February 1980. He was assisted by his sample manufacturer, Thomas B. Kennedy, and his furniture frame manufacturer, Roy E. White. Using Ehrlich\u2019s designs, Preview commenced marketing the accused chairs in April 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-20\">On September 16, 1980, Pacific, through its California patent counsel, wrote a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>to Ehrlich at Preview informing him that Pacific had filed applications for design patent protection of its Model 120 (the design for which became the \u2019100 patent) and Model 150 (leading to the \u2019101 patent) chairs. Pacific was informed that the patents were going to issue on February 3, 1981. On January 30,1981, Pacific wrote a second letter to Ehrlich and Preview renewing its demand that the infringing activities cease forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">On March 12, 1981, Pacific filed a complaint<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for infringement of the \u2019100 and \u2019101 patents by Preview Furniture Corporation. Preview answered, denying the charges and asserting a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that the \u2019100 and \u2019101 patents were invalid, unenforceable and not infringed by any of their products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">On or about May 17, 1983, Pacific filed a counterclaim (apparently in response to Preview\u2019s earlier counterclaim) against Preview, alleging willful and deliberate infringement of both patents and requesting treble damages and attorney fees. Preview answered denying all the allegations. After a bench trial, the District Court entered judgment on November 27, 1985,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> holding both patents not proven invalid or unenforceable, but willfully and deliberately infringed. The District Court ordered Preview to pay a treble amount of compensatory damages owing for such infringement, plus attorney fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">On this appeal, Preview concedes the validity and enforceability of the \u2019100 patent. However, appellants challenge as erroneous the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the \u2019101 patent was not proven invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Preview also contends that the District Court erred in failing to find the \u2019101 patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. Lastly, Preview argues that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding treble damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">Preview first contends that the District Court erred in failing to invalidate the \u2019101 patent for obviousness over the combination of Pacific\u2019s prior art chair designs, Style No. 120 (which was embodied in the \u2019100 patent) and Style No. 1536. The District Court, in its opinion, detailed numerous specific design differences between the 120 and 1536 prior art designs, respectively, and the design disclosed in the '101 patent. These findings were not disputed by Preview and are certainly not clearly erroneous. Further, at least four of the differences as found by the District Court were common to both prior art designs. That is, both the 120 chair design and the 1536 chair design differed from the \u2019101 patent claim in that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-11\">(1) the seat in the '101 patent design chair had distinctive sewn seams which were not present in the prior art designs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-12\">(2) the '101 patent design chair, unlike the prior art designs, had distinctive overhangs at the top of the back of the chair;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-13\">(3) the \u2019101 patent design chair, unlike the prior art designs, had an overhang extending outwardly from the top of the arm of the chair; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-14\">(4) the \u2019101 patent design chair had a unique and distinctive combination of complementary pleats which appear on the arm, the back, and the seat cushion and which were not found in either of the prior art designs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-15\"> To prove the invalidity of the \u2019101 patent claim, Preview must overcome the presumed validity of the patent by submitting evidence which has proved \u2014 by clear and convincing evidence \u2014 facts which would have permitted the District Court to determine that the designs would have been obvious to one skilled in the art of designing upholstery furniture at the time the invention was made. <em>Gardner v. TEC Systems, </em>725 F.2d 1338, 1345, 220 USPQ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>777, 782-83, (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 830, 105 S.Ct. 116, 83 L.Ed.2d 60 (1984); <em>see also Shelcore, Inc. v. Durham Industries, </em>745 F.2d 621, 624, 223 USPQ 584, 586 (Fed.Cir.1984). Considering all the evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom, we cannot say that the District Court erred in deciding that Preview failed to meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. Preview argues that the admission of Blowers, designer of both prior art chair designs, establishing that the \u2019101 patent design was the result of an effort to give a \u201cloose-look\u201d to the Style 120 chair design, was strong evidence of obviousness. However, the District Court, in its proper discretion, was free to accord such weight to this evidence as it deemed proper in light of other credible evidence of record favoring Pacific. In short, we see no error in the court\u2019s determination that the \u2019101 patent was not proven invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">Preview\u2019s second major contention is that Pacific\u2019s failure to disclose the prior art of the 120 and 1536 chair designs, during the prosecution of the \u2019101 patent, violated the duty of disclosure since there was a substantial likelihood that the examiner would not have allowed the patent to issue had he been aware of these prior art designs. Consequently, Preview asserts error in the District Court\u2019s failure to hold the \u2019101 patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">\u201c \u2018Inequitable conduct\u2019 requires proof by clear and convincing evidence of a threshold degree of materiality of the nondis-closed or false information.\u201d <em>J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. v. Lex Tex, Ltd., </em>747 F.2d 1553, 1559, 223 USPQ 1089, 1094 (Fed.Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 73, 88 L.Ed.2d 60 (1985). The District Court concluded that Preview failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"Ate2\">Preview has correctly relied on the Patent and Trademark Office standard test to show materiality. Under that test, nondisclosed references are material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would have considered the omitted references important in deciding whether to allow the application for the \u2019101 patent to issue. <em>J.P. Stevens, </em>747 F.2d at 1559, 223 USPQ at 1094. At trial, Preview presented no direct evidence of materiality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Preview urges, however, that inferences of materiality can be drawn from the record which shows that the 120 chair design was the starting point for designing the \u2019101 chair and that both Pacific and its attorney were aware of the 120 and 1536 chair designs. The knowledge of Pacific and its attorney with respect to the prior art designs goes to intent not to materiality. That the designer created the design of the \u2019101 patent in an attempt to \u201cloosen\u201d the look of the 120 chair design may be some evidence of materiality, but we do not think that this evidence established clearly and convincingly that a reasonable patent examiner would have considered the 120 chair design important in deciding to issue the \u2019101 patent. Moreover, we are not persuaded that the mere examination of the 120 and 1536 designs provided the required proof of materiality because, as stated <em>supra, </em>there exist significant unobvious differences between the prior art designs and the design of the \u2019101 patent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Court did not err in finding a lack of inequitable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">Finally, on the basis of the detailed and well-reasoned opinion of the District Court, 626 F.Supp at 676-78, 228 USPQ at 241-42, we agree that the willful and deliberate infringement of the \u2019100 and \u2019101 patents entitles Pacific to tripled compensatory damages under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Also, on the basis of that opinion, 626 F.Supp. at 679-80, 228 USPQ at 243-44, we agree that this is an exceptional case warranting reasonable attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">.
