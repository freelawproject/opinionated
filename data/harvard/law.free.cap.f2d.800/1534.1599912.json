Board of Governors, </em>760 F.2d 1135 (11th Cir.1985), and remanded the case for further consideration in light of its recent decision in <em>Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial Corp., </em>474 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 681, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986). The <em>Dimension </em>decision squarely rejects the reasoning behind our vacated opinion and, consequently, we affirm the order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) approving the application of U.S. Trust Corporation to expand the nonbanking activity of its wholly owned \u201cnonbank bank\u201d Florida subsidiary,</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-4\">\n<em>What We Said</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-14\">The facts of this case are laid out in detail in our earlier opinion, 760 F.2d at 1136-38, and we shall not repeat them here. Suffice it here to say that we reversed the Board\u2019s approval of U.S. Trust\u2019s application on the grounds that the Board should have used its rulemaking power under \u00a7 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act (the Act), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1844(b), to prevent U.S. Trust\u2019s evasion of the Douglas Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We based our decision on a lengthy review of the legislative history of the term \u201cbank\u201d as used in the Act. We concluded that Congress twice amended the definition of \u201cbank,\u201d once in 1966 and once in 1970, with the intention of exempting first, a small class of savings and industrial banks, and second, one specific institution, the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But without evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>that Congress in its amendments intended to weaken the stricture against interstate banking contained in the Douglas Amendment, we ordered the Board to preserve congressional intent as expressed in the Douglas Amendment and deny U.S. Trust\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-4\">\n<em>What They Said</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-5\">In <em>Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial Corp., </em>474 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 681, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986), the Supreme Court held that the Federal Reserve Board exceeded its delegated authority when it expanded the definition of \u201cbank\u201d contained in the Bank Holding Company Act. The Board had enacted \u201cRegulation Y,\u201d to bring so-called \u201cnonbank banks\u201d within its regulatory fold by expanding the statutory definition of \u201cbank\u201d to include institutions that offered the functional equivalent of traditional banking services. The Board defined \u201cdemand deposits\u201d to include deposits, like NOW accounts, which are \u201cas a matter of practice\u201d payable on demand, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 225.2(a)(1)(A) (1985), and it defined the \u201cmaking of a commercial loan\u201d to include \u201cthe purchase of retail installment loans or commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019 acceptances, and similar money market instruments.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 225.2(a)(1)(B) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-8\">The Supreme Court affirmed the Tenth Circuit\u2019s invalidation of the Board\u2019s amended regulations. It rejected the Board\u2019s expanded definition of \u201cdemand deposit\u201d as contrary to the Act\u2019s express language.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It also rejected the Board\u2019s expanded definition of \u201ccommercial loan\u201d as unsupported by the Act\u2019s legislative history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, and most significantly for us, the Court rejected the Board\u2019s contention that the amended definitions were necessary to preserve the \u201cplain purpose\u201d of the Act. The Court held that the Board\u2019s perception of Congress\u2019 legislative will must yield to the unambiguous language of the Act. \u201cThe statute may be imperfect, but the Board has no power to correct flaws that it perceives in the statute it is empowered to administer.\u201d 474 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 689, 88 L.Ed.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-15\">\n<em>What We Now Say</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-16\">As we read <em>Dimension, </em>our earlier result cannot stand. It is an elementary precept of statutory construction that the definition of a term in the definitional section of a statute controls the construction of that term wherever it appears throughout the statute. 1A Sutherland, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 20.08 at 88 (4th ed. 1985). Thus, a depository institution which is not a bank as defined in \u00a7 1841(c) is similarly not a bank for purposes of the Douglas Amendment, \u00a7 1842(d)(1). If it were a bank, we would be faced with the anomaly of \u201cbank\u201d meaning one thing in one section of the Act and another thing in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-17\">Because U.S. Trust\u2019s Florida subsidiary will not make commercial loans, it is not a \u201cbank\u201d within the meaning of the Act. If, as <em>Dimension </em>holds, the Federal Reserve Board is without regulatory jurisdiction to regulate nonbank banks as \u201cbanks\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>the Act, then it is without regulatory jurisdiction to prevent the interstate proliferation of nonbank banks under the Douglas Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-5\">We recognize that, by our holding today, we sanction a result that clearly frustrates the congressional purpose expressed in the Douglas Amendment. <em>Dimension, </em>however, ties our hands. When Congress progressively fine-tuned the definition of \u201cbank\u201d in its 1966 and 1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act, it inadvertently created the opportunity for non-bank banks to spring to life. It is Congress, therefore, that must now decide whether it wishes to shepherd the nonbank banks inside the regulatory pale. \u201cIf the Bank Holding Company [Act] falls short of providing safeguards desirable or necessary to protect the public interest, that is a problem for Congress, and not the Board or the courts to address.\u201d <em>Dimension, </em>474 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 689, 88 L.Ed.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-8\">The petitioners\u2019 challenge to Federal Reserve Board approval of U.S. Trust Corporation\u2019s application to charter U.S. Trust Company of Florida is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1639-11\">. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no application (except an application filed as a result of a transaction authorized under section 1823(f) of this title) shall be approved under this section which will permit any bank holding company or any subsidiary thereof to acquire, directly or indirectly, any voting shares of, interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of any additional bank located outside of the State in which the operations of such bank holding company\u2019s banking subsidiaries were principally conducted on July 1, 1966, or the date on which such company became a bank holding company, whichever is later, unless the acquisition of such shares or assets of a State bank of an out-of-State bank holding company is specifically authorized by the statute laws of the State in which such bank is located, by language to that effect and not merely by implication. For the purposes of this section, the State in which the operations of a bank holding company\u2019s subsidiaries are principally conducted is that State in which total deposits of all such banking subsidiaries are largest.</p>\n<p id=\"ais-dedup-0\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1639-13\">. The original 1956 Act defined \"bank\u201d to include any institution that could obtain a bank charter. Chapter 240, \u00a7 2(c), 70 Stat. 133 (\"any national banking association or any State bank, savings bank, or trust company\u201d). In 1966, Congress amended the definition to include only those institutions offering \"deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand,\u201d i.e., checking accounts. 1966 Amendments, Pub.L. No. 89-485, \u00a7 3, 80 Stat. 236, 237. In 1970, Congress further amended the Act to remove from the \u201cbank\u201d definition institutions that did not make commercial loans. 1970 Amendments, Pub.L. No. 91-607, \u00a7 101(c), 84 Stat. 1760, 1762 (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"asd-dedup-1\">The legislative history of these amendments indicates that in 1966, Congress intended to maintain the traditional separation between banking and the industrial and securities sectors of the economy. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1179, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 7, <em>reprinted in </em>1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2385, 2391 (\"the bill redefines \u2018bank\u2019 as an institution that accepts deposits payable on demand (checking accounts), the commonly accepted test of whether an institution is a commercial bank so as to exclude institutions like industrial banks and nondeposit trust companies\u201d). In 1970, Congress again intended to keep separate banking and commerce by eliminating the so-called \"one bank loophole.\u201d <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. 794, 835 (1984). When the 1970 amendments were enacted, the Federal Reserve Chairman testified that the modified definition of bank would have only limited effect, possibly confined to a single institution. <em>See id. </em>at 834 (letter of Federal Reserve Chairman Burns to Chairman Sparkman of the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee).</p>\n<p id=\"ask-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>Nowhere in the legislative history of the Act\u2019s changing definition of \"bank\u201d is there the slightest hint that Congress considered the effect of the amendments on the Douglas Amendment, nor is there a hint that Congress conceived that a bank holding company could gain an interstate bank charter without state approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1640-10\">. The Act defines \"bank\u201d to include institutions which \"accept[ ] deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841(c). The Board redefined demand deposits to include deposits that were \"as a matter of practice\u201d payable on demand. Since the Board\u2019s definition conflicted with the statutory language, the Court concluded that the definition was an unreasonable interpretation of the Act. 474 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 685-86, 88 L.Ed.2d at 698-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1640-21\">. The Court declared that \u201ccommercial loan substitutes,\u201d such as the purchase of retail installment loans, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers\u2019 acceptances, and similar money market instruments, do not fall within the commonly accepted definition of commercial loans. 474 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 686-88, 88 L.Ed.2d at 699-702. The Board\u2019s argument to the contrary was undercut by earlier Board decisions distinguishing money market transactions from commercial loans.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
