Siegel, J.], entered July 2, 2015) to review a determination of respondents. The determination found after a tier III hearing that petitioner had violated various inmate rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">It is hereby ordered that the determination is unanimously confirmed without costs and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">Memorandum: Petitioner commenced this proceeding seeking to annul a determination finding him guilty, following a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>tier III hearing, of violating various inmate rules, and imposing a penalty. At the outset, we note that, \u201c \u2018[b]ecause the petition did not raise a substantial evidence issue, Supreme Court erred in transferring the proceeding to this Court\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Wearen v Deputy Supt. Bish, </em>2 AD3d 1361, 1362 [2003]). In the interest of judicial economy, we nevertheless address petitioner\u2019s contention that he was denied his right to contact his attorney <em>(see id.). </em>Nothing in the record indicates that petitioner sought to contact his attorney prior to the hearing <em>(cf. Matter of Jeckel v New York State Dept. of Corn, </em>111 AD3d 1180, 1181 [2013]). Rather, the record establishes that petitioner asked to consult with his attorney after the tier III hearing commenced, and it is well established that an inmate does not have a right to counsel at that hearing <em>(see Wolff v McDonnell, </em>418 US 539, 570 [1974]; <em>Matter of Laureano v Kuhlmann, </em>75 NY2d 141, 146 [1990]). We therefore confirm the determination and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"afr-dedup-0\">Present \u2014 Centra, J.P., Peradotto, Carni and Lindley, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
