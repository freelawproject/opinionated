If a fiduciary relationship exists between two such individuals and the non-contributing party withdraws the funds during the lifetime of the other, he is liable to return the funds to the estate of the other, upon the subsequent death of the contributing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">3. \u201cWhere the amount of a purported joint and survivorship account is certain and the only issue is whether the estate or the \u2018survivor\u2019 is entitled to the funds, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable interest on the funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As to appellant\u2019s first proposition of law and appellee\u2019s first cross-proposition of law, <em>In re Estate of Thompson </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 433 [20 O.O.3d 371], paragraph one of the syllabus, holds:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201cA joint and survivorship account belongs, during the lifetime of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by each to the sums on deposit, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Thompson </em>was decided after the trial court\u2019s judgment, but prior to the appellate court\u2019s decision. Hence, the appellate court relied on <em>Thompson </em>in finding that Louis and John had contributed sixty percent and forty percent, respectively, to the funds on deposit. This determination, however, conflicts directly with the trial court\u2019s finding \u201c[t]hat there was no evidence that the sum of $300,893.09 or any part thereof belonged to the * * * [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The referee and the trial court, which adopted the referee\u2019s report, determined appellant\u2019s credibility. Thus, it appears that the appellate court substituted its judgment for that of the trier of fact despite <em>C. E. Morris Co. </em>v. <em>Foley Construction Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 279 [8 O.O.3d 261].</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Appellant contends that if <em>Thompson </em>applies, then due process demands that he is entitled to a new trial, since <em>Thompson </em>reallocated the burden of proof concerning intent and, thus, he did not have the opportunity to meet that burden. The record, however, in this case, shows a new trial would be futile since appellant testified he could not show the source of the funds and had kept no records. Moreover, the record shows that the contribution to the account came from Louis Gillota. We find that although <em>Thompson </em>reallocated to the joint survivor the burden of proof of intent and the joint survivor would have no opportunity to meet that burden without a remand for a new trial, it is permissible and proper to deny a remand when the record clearly demonstrates a new trial would be futile because the joint survivor could not reasonably meet his burden of proof. Therefore, appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is not well-taken, and appellee\u2019s first cross-proposition of law is well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">As to appellant\u2019s second proposition of law, assuming that there was error in this aspect of the case, such error certainly would not have been prejudicial considering that the bank\u2019s records resolved most of the conflicting evidence in appellee\u2019s favor, along with the fact that the trial court, as the trier of fact, determined appellant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Hence, appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is not well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Concerning appellee\u2019s second cross-proposition of law, the trial court made a factual determination that appellant did not contribute to the funds involved. Further, the record supports the contention that the sources of the funds in the accounts were originally held in the names of Louis Gillota and/or Daisy Gillota. Therefore, when appellant withdrew the funds, he held them in a fiduciary capacity for his brother Louis. Consequently, appellant had a fiduciary duty to deliver the funds to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Although the appellate court held that this fiduciary duty existed, it disregarded the trial court\u2019s factual finding and held that appellant contributed forty percent of the funds. If the appellate court had not substituted its judgment for that of the trial court, as the trier of fact, it would have correctly held that, under <em>Thompson, </em>the trial court should still properly award the entire amount to the estate within the facts of this case. This is so, notwithstanding the fact that <em>Thompson, </em>which shifted the burden of proof to appellant, was not decided until after the hearing before the trial court. Accordingly, appellee\u2019s second cross-proposition of law is well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">As to appellee\u2019s third cross-proposition of law, the amount that appellant withdrew on May 8, 1978, $300,893.09, is certain and it is clear he invested the funds for his own benefit. Since the trial court correctly awarded the funds, the estate is entitled to the entire sum, plus a reasonable amount of interest from May 8, 1978. Thus, appellee\u2019s third cross-proposition of law is well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, the trial court\u2019s judgment is reinstated, and appellee is awarded reasonable interest thereon from May 8, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-10\">W.

The holding in <em>In re Estate of Thompson </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 433 [20 O.O.3d 371], stands for the proposition that during the lifetime of the parties who have established a joint and survivorship account, such account belongs to the parties in the proportion each put into it, <em>unless there can be shown a different intent. Thompson, </em>decided after the trial of this matter, shifted the burden upon the survivor to prove by clear and convincing evidence the intent of the parties as to the ownership of such funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">The appellant here argues that he proceeded at trial to present his evidence based only upon the law that prevailed prior to <em>Thompson, </em>and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>not go forward on the basis of having the burden to present evidence of the proportionate contributions of each, or the burden of showing the intent of the parties. The trial court concluded that the evidence supported a finding that Louis Gillota had placed the sums into the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">I am in agreement with the majority that the court of appeals erred in determining the percentage of the account which was owned by each of the parties, but disagree as to the question of remand. I am in agreement with the majority that a remand may well be futile insofar as proof of thte source of the funds; however, it does not necessarily follow that it would be futile to remand such matter in order to provide the appellant the opportunity to meet the burden of proving that there might have been a different intent of the parties than appeared from the facts pertaining to the contributions to this fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Therefore, I would remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-7\">Locher and C. Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
