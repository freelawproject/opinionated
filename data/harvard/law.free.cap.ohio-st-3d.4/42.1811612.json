This contention was rejected in <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Nebraska Penal Inmates </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 1, with the exception of where the state statute itself creates an expectancy of release. The Nebraska statute before the court in <em>Greenholtz </em>required release by the parole authority unless any one of four conditions negating parole was found to exist. The court stated that the expectancy of release provided by the Nebraska statute \u201cis entitled to some measure of constitutional protection,\u201d but emphasized that \u201c* * * whether any other state statute provides a protectible entitlement must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">R.C. 2967.03 provides the Ohio Adult Parole Authority may grant parole to a prisoner \u201c* * * if in its judgment there is a reasonable ground to believe that if * * * the prisoner is paroled, such action would further the interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>justice and be consistent -with the welfare and security of society.\u201d This statute is a grant, of discretion; it does not create any presumption that parole will be issued and does not create an expectancy of parole upon which appellant can base his due process claim. See <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Gilligan </em>(C.A. 6, 1979), 609 F. 2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Appellant also makes a claim that he was not provided written reasons for the ten-year extension of his next parole hearing as required by appellees\u2019 administrative regulations. This factual question was resolved against appellant by the court of appeals and this court is not persuaded to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
