She testified that on March 29th, 1941, there was controversy respecting conflicting work assignments given her by' defendant\u2019s manager and another waitress, in the course of which the latter \u201cgave\u201d her \u201ca shove,\u201d and as a result her head came into contact with a condiment cabinet, and she \u201cstarted getting dizzy;\u201d and that she then undertook to wipe the bottom of a table, and when she \u201ctried to raise\u201d herself, her head \u201cstruck the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>side of the table.\u201d The manager called a physician, Dr. Bendix, who was then in the restaurant. The physician testified that prosecutrix was \u201cvery excited\u201d and complained of a \u201csevere headache.\u201d She told him that she had had \u201can argument in the service department,\u201d and that it was followed by \u201ca very sharp headache.\u201d He examined her, but found no indication of a head injury. She did not tell him that her head had struck the cabinet and table; there was no complaint of external violence. Indeed, she did not tell of the alleged physical impact until the fall of 1941, although meanwhile she had undergone two head operations by a neurosurgical and brain specialist, Dr. Davidoff. The first examination by this physician was made on April oth, 1941; and he found no evidence of an external head injury. It is explained that the patient, although \u201cfairly alert and co-operative,\u201d was then \u201csuffering from mixed aphasia, more motor than sensory.\u201d This condition affected expression and articulation more than memory and power of recollection. But, as will be seen presently, the brain ailment was a severe one, and it is by no means clear that her memory was not seriously affected, although it is significant she told of the \u201cargument\u201d at the outset without mentioning the subsequently asserted head blows. If her memory had been impaired by disease, what she related of the occurrence must needs be carefully scrutinized and accepted with caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Prosecutrix manifested symptoms of subarachnoid bleeding and encephalomalacia, <em>i. e., </em>softening of the brain. The surgical operations \u2014 the first performed on April 7th, 1941, and the second on the ensuing April 21st \u2014 revealed \u201ca brain tissue which was yellowish, discolored and extremely soft.\u201d Dr. Davidoff said this \u201cmight have represented either a degen-' erated tumor or degenerated brain tissue, which has become swollen, secondary to a blood vessel disturbance, such as a hemorrhage.\u201d The X-rays disclosed a \u201cdisplacement of the brain toward the right;\u201d and this is indicative of a tumor, since it does not ordinarily result from softening of the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">A finding that prosecutrix suffered a head injury from external force, as she testified, and that this resulted in degeneration of the brain substance, would plainly be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>trary to tlie weight of the evidence. The witnesses of the occurrence all agree there was no such happening. There was uncontradicted evidence that the cabinet was so constructed as to render this a physical impossibility, and that the cleaning under the tables was done by male porters. And it is inconceivable that mere emotional stress arising from the conflicting orders could possibly have produced such grave consequences; certainly, that inference is not a reasonable one. The surgeon\u2019s theory that \u201cexcitement in a person who had a propensity toward blood vessel disease of the brain might have produced this\u201d is purely speculative. And he conceded that \u201cthe history of a blow was a more logical precedent to the type of lesion she had in the brain.\u201d The evidence adduced in support o\u00a3 these hypotheses does not satisfy the legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">It is fairly inferable that the controversy adverted to was in no small part due to prosecutrix\u2019 irritability, eoncededly an accompaniment of the brain disease from which she then suffered. Tier own surgeon\u2019s testimony suggests that this morbid condition pre-existed the altercation, and that the encounter may have produced aggravation or acceleration of the disease. But there is no tangible basis for such a finding. That would be the merest conjecture. The witness assumed there had been \u201ca violent argument;\u201d but the proofs do not preponderate in favor of that theory. Ills conclusion would be otherwise if the assumption were not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The presumption is that this brain condition is idiopathic and not traumatic as regards both origin and development; and the burden is on the injured employee to establish an industrial accident as a <em>causa sine qua non. </em>The evidence must bring this hypothesis within the realm of probability. <em>Schlegel </em>v. <em>H. Baron &amp; Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>611. It is axiomatic that disability suffered in the course of his employment, arising from natural causes unrelated to an industrial mishap, is not compensable. To merit that classification, it must be the proximate result of an accident within the statutory sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
