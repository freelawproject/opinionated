The narrow issue requiring decision is whether a reasonably debatable question of fact or law is made to appear by the employer who seeks to review only the <em>quantum </em>of the award of 33-1/3% of total permanent disability which was awarded to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>It is free from reasonable debate that respondent while working for the prosecutor on April 10th, 1940 (regulating the temperature of a tank on the roof of prosecutor\u2019s hog house) ran up and.down two and a half flights of stairs several times and that as a result of the unusual effort and strain thus expended \u201cprecipitated\u201d the heart disability (\u201ccoronary occlusion\u201d or \u201ccoronary thrombosis\u201d) which he suffered. Thus prosecutor concedes, and correctly so, that respondent suffered a compensable accident. <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>354; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>500; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>832; <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Janssen Dairy Corp., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>494; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>409.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is also free from reasonable debate, although respondent had (unknown to himself) an arterio-selerotic condition of his heart, that prior to the date of the accident respondent did prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmillwright\u201d and \u201cmaintenance\u201d work. It was \u201cpretty hard work.\u201d He was obliged to and did, among other things, \u201ctake care of the machinery and repair same.\u201d He also did the \u201cpipe fitting\u201d and a \u201clittle of the electrical work.\u201d . Three months after the date of the accident, when he returned to work, respondent was unable .to do the laborious work which he had been doing for the prosecutor. He was thereupon given a lighter type of work. He started as a watchman at the gate. After a few months, he was taken off that work and was set to washing dishes in prosecutor\u2019s restaurant. After a few weeks bn that job, he was assigned to \u201csweep the floor\u201d in the dressing room where \u201che could take things easy.\u201d Thereafter, he - was given a six month leave of absence and subjected himself, about every two weeks, to a physical examination by prosecutor\u2019s physician. At the end of the six month period, he was told that his condition had not improved sufficiently \u201cto return to his work\u201d and that prosecutor \u201cdid not have any-job light enough\u201d for him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The medical proofs for both parties are substantially in factual accord as to the cause of the accident. They differ only as to the <em>quantum </em>of the percentage of permanent disability suffered by respondent. The doctor for respondent fixed it at 35% of total wflile the doctor for prosecutor fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>it at 15% of total, but made clear that-respondent \u201cshould be advised not to undertake prolonged heavy exertion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR4\">The deputy commissioner in the Bureau determined, in light of all the proofs, that one who is handicapped in life, as respondent here, by his loss of \u201cefficiency,\u201d by the fact that lie must he \u201cguarded in his efforts,\u201d and by the fact that he must seek such employment as will not oblige him to \u201cundertake prolonged effort or heavy exertion,\u201d is suffering from a \u201csubstantial disability.\u201d lie fixed it at 33-1/3% of permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Hudson County, the award in the Bureau -was affirmed save as to an additional credit allowed prosecutor for payment which it had made to respondent and not here in issue. On re-argument, the Pleas adhered to its determination of affirmance. Prosecutor then applied to Mr. Justice Colie for a writ of <em>certiorari: </em>It was denied. Hence this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We see nothing reasonably debatable in the argument made here, as below, that the coronary occlusion suffered by respondent in one of the many blood vessels of his heart \u201chas healed and is circumvented by collateral circulation so that the disability [suffered] as a result of the healed occlusion is minimal.\u201d The proofs do not support the argument. They are, as we have pointed out, to the contrary. For do we see anything reasonably debatable in the further argument that respondent\u2019s guarded prognosis is due to the arterio-sclerosis of the various vessels of respondent\u2019s heart and not to the \u201cocclusion\u201d Or \u201cthrombosis\u201d which,he, in fact, suffered. Eor it is firmly established that our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act extends its \u201cbeneficent provisions\u201d alike to the \u201cweak and sick\u201d as to the \u201cstrong and able\u201d so long as those of either class come under its provisions and sustain a compensable accident. <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>500, 504; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>554. And \u201c* * * an accidental strain of the heart, even though the heart was previously weakened by disease, may be, a compensable injury under out statute when, as in this case, the accident arose out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Bernstein Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>500, 501 ; 6 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>409.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Apart from the fact that we clo not lightly disturb a finding, in the Bureau, affirmed by the Pleas, plus a discretionary refusal by a single justice of this court to review such a finding <em>(Davies </em>v. <em>Onyx Oil and Resin Co., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>381, 382; 33 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>357), our independent study of the proofs and arguments urged in support of this application <em>(Lazzio </em>v. <em>Primo Silk Co., </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>450; 177 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>251; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>506; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>881), leads \u25a0us to the conclusion that a correct result was reached and that no reasonably debatable question of fact or law is made to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Accordingly, the application for a writ is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
