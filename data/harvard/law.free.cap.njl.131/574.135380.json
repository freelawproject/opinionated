The charge was that prosecutor, on August 25th, 1943, did at a stated address in Kearny \u201coperate machinery in a noisy, offensive, annoying and injurious manner, endangering the comfort, repose, health and safety of other persons, at all hours of the day and night,\u201d in violation of the ordinance. The trial was without jury. The court found the defendant \u201cguilty as charged\u201d and imposed a line of $25. This the, present writ brings up for I review.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The premises in question are what is commonly known as a machine shop, and have been operated as such since 1919, when the neighborhood was sparsely inhabited, if at all. As a result of the war, prosecutor has taken contracts calling for a greater and to a certain extent a different output, and increasing the. noise emanating from ids plant, and this seems to have prompted the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Generally speaking, we consider that the situation is decidedly one for resort to the Court of Chancery, by bill to restrain an alleged nuisance, and for ascertainment by that court in a particular case, and after hearing the parties, whether an actionable nuisance exists, rather than for municipal legislation framed in the general language appropriate for a statute but quite obviously, as it seems to us, aimed at an individual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The language descriptive of the noise may be taken either conjunctively, reading the word \u201cor\u201d as equivalent to \u201cand\u201d <em>(Standard Underground Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>46 N. <em>J. Eq. </em>270 (at <em>pp. </em>272. 274)) or disjunctively. The former seems indicated by the phrase \u201cloud <em>and </em>unnecessary noises\u201d in the title. On that theory, the evidence does not support the conviction. The noises of a machine shop are doubtless loud ; but it cannot be said that they are intrinsically unnecessary, improper, or offensive, and the proof fails to indicate any of these characteristics. On the other band, if the language be construed disjunctively, a \u201cloud\u201d noise without more, would fall under the ban, though it were the; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>whistle of a train, the noise of an automobile horn, or the gong of a trolley car: and it is worthy of note that these every-day noises are specifically mentioned in the ordinance. So construed, it is plainly unreasonable and ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In either aspect, therefore, the conviction was illegal, and accordingly will he set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
