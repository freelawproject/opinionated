S. </em>39:5-33), Mr. Justice Parker, oil June 12th, 1943, set aside prosecutor\u2019s conviction, in the Mayor\u2019s Court of the Borough of Caldwell, apparently for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The ground upon which that conviction Avas set aside was that the \u201crecord of conviction\u201d failed, contrary to the statute, to include the \u201cstatement of the evidence adduced at the\u00bbtrial.\u201d Pursuant to that disposition, he ordered that the \u201cfine\u201d of $200 and \u201ccosts\u201d of $25 imposed \u201cbe remitted\u201d to prosecutor and that he \u201cbe restored\u201d in all \u201cthings\u201d which he \u201chad lost\u201d by reason of the \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d and the \u201csentence rendered therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u25a0 Thereafter, on August 20th, 1943, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (hereafter referred to as Commissioner) notified prosecutor, in writing, of his proposed revocation of prosecutor\u2019s driver\u2019s license bjr virtue of the provisions of <em>B. S. </em>39 :5-30. The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d set down, pursuant to that statute, are that <em>on</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cFebruary 22d, 1943, at 10 :00 i&gt;. m.\u201d prosecutor \u201cdrove a -motor vehicle in Bloomfield, North Caldwell, NeAv Jersey, in a careless and incompetent manner, thereby causing an accident, after which [he] left the scene of such accident without identifying [himself] as required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Prosecutor desired a hearing. Such a hearing Avas afforded him on September 17th, 1943. He Avas represented at the hearing by counsel. No purpose is to be served in detailing the proofs; they are not questioned. It should suffice, therefore, to observe that the deputy commissioner who heard the proofs, concluded that prosecutor did operate his automobile in the manner charged thus \u201cjeopardizing the safety of the users of said highway,\u201d and accordingly \u201crevoked\u201d prosecutor\u2019s license for \u201can indefinite period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">On September 17th, 1943, the Commissioner entered an order by the terms of which he made the same factual finding that his deputy commissioner made, and accordingly revoked prosecutor\u2019s license to drive a motor vehicle in this state. Prosecutor was allowed a writ of <em>certiorari </em>challenging the propriety of that revocation. That challenge is clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">For prosecutor it is argued here, as it Avas below, that the proceedings upon which the challenged result was reached do not comply with the provisions of <em>B. </em>39:5 \u2014 3. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>is correct. But the answer is that this is not the statute which was invoked. The statute invoked, as already pointed out, was <em>R. S. </em>39 :5 \u2014 30. A mere reading of the two clearly indicates their distinct substantive and procedural differences. These differences are not altogether ol recent origin. <em>Cf. Pamph. L. </em>.1931, <em>ch. </em>308, <em>p. </em>648, \u00a7 6, and <em>p. </em>676, \u00a7 34. Although it is not mentioned, we have not overlooked the ease of <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>538; 186 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>444. That case, is clearly distinguishable. In that ease, the recorder set aside the conviction on substantive grounds and not as in the case at bar on a procedural ground. Thus we held that when the judgment fell the resultant penalty (including revocation of relator\u2019s driver\u2019s license) fell with it. The relator was then tried on the merits and was acquitted. Moreover, in the Fredericks case, unlike in the case at bar, the Commissioner of Motor Yehicles did not revoke relator\u2019s license \u201cafter due notice in writing\u201d of the proposed revocation and of the grounds thereof. The challenged order of the Commissioner is not, under the circumstances, rendered nugatory because prosecutor\u2019s conviction had been set aside by Mr. Justice Parker on a procedural ground. The order under review here is a valid and proper order fully supported substantively and procedurally. We so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Notwithstanding the stated single point raised and argued by prosecutor below, it is here argued, for the first time, that the deputy commissioner had no authority to hear the matter and that he did not make a recommendation, in writing, to the Commissioner that prosecutor\u2019s license be revoked. The argument is without merit. The deputy commissioner had jurisdiction of the subject-matter <em>(R. 8. </em>39:3-4; <em>R. 8. </em>39 :o \u2014 30), and of the parties. Without objection, save as first indicated, prosecutor appeared before the deputy commissioner, he had the benefit of counsel, he offered his proofs and otherwise participated in the hearing on the merits. Under these circumstances, the [joints made are not of the character that merit consideration when raised here for the first time. <em>Kluczek </em>v. <em>State, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>105; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>632; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>48, 50; 181 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>706; <em>affirmed, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>466: 5 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>697.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Nor is the hearing by the deputy commissioner to be set aside because he characterized the result thereof as \u201cconclusions\u201d rather than \u201crecommendations\u201d as prescribed b3r <em>R. 8. </em>39:5-30. To do so would be merely to juggle words. We treat his conclusions as recommendations. So did the Commissioner. His challenged order so indicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
