J. L. </em>562, for error in striking the second count of the counter-claim for the alleged value of used automobile tires claimed to have been returned. The cause accordingly went back for a new trial, and the issue of fact with regard to the counter-claim, the only matter in dispute, was whether the defendant was entitled to credit for three used tires as \u201creturned.\u201d It was undisputed that six used tires had been delivered to the plaintiff for \u201cadjustment,\u201d that three had been \u201cadjusted,\u201d and that plaintiff\u2019s claim was for the cost of adjusting them. It was further undisputed that the other three tires had not been cither adjusted or returned, nor had defendant credited any allowance for them. The evidence for defendant, however, was, that plaintiff\u2019s agent in charge of the matter advised defendant\u2019s agent that they were so worn as to be worthless, asked whether they should be returned, and was told to \u201cjunk\u201d them as without value; and that this was done. The issue was one of fact ; whether there was an agreement to make an allowance for used tires, or an instruction to discard them as junk. The District Court found that \u201cdefendant had failed to prove his -counter-claimand that finding is impregnable here. <em>Marten </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>80 <em>N. J.
