The action is brought under the Federal Employers Liability Act. The deceased was defendant\u2019s employee and performed laborious work in a section crew removing worn railroad ties along the defendant\u2019s right of way and replacing them with others. It is not disputed that he died from heat stroke which came upon him on July 2d, 1941, while he was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">The first count of the complaint charged that it became the duty of the employer under the circumstances to supply \u201cimmediate attention and first aid;\u201d the second count, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the defendant undertook to care for Szabo and did so in a negligent manner as a result of which he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">A motion for nonsuit and for a directed verdict was denied, the case submitted to the jury, and the learned trial judge instructed them that they must determine whether the defendant was negligent in failing to give proper emergency care to Szabo in his extremity, and whether that omission, if negligent, was the proximate cause of decedent\u2019s death; and, further, that if the jury found that the defendant company voluntarily assumed to assist Szabo and failed to exercise reasonable care in so doing and that such negligence was the proximate cause of his death then the jury might find a verdict for the plaintiff and against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On the day when Szabo was stricken the weather was described as \u201cheavy and very muggy\u201d with \u201cno direct sunshine,\u201d a humid day. The maximum temperature was 9G degrees Eahrenheit, the minimum 74 degrees; at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon the thermometer stood at 83 degrees. Mr. Szabo stopped work at about 2:30 that afternoon. Plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, fellow employees, testified that Szabo had performed his share of the work, which was laborious; that after the noon hour Szabo \u201clooked sick,\u201d \u201chad a white color;\u201d that he drank an unusual amount of cold water and, when advised against so doing, replied that he was \u201cvery thirsty.\u201d A fellow employee told Szabo that if he didn\u2019t feel well he should go home to which Szabo, apparently a faithful employee, answered that he was \u201cashamed\u201d to go home. Later the foreman, Michael Curiam, requested Louis Bolla, a fellow employee, to take Szabo home. This witness testified that he didn\u2019t know what was the matter with Szabo except that he was sick, lie, accompanied by another employee who had an automobile, took Szabo home. They helped him into the house, found no one at home, and left him seated in the kitchen. Asked to describe Szabo\u2019s appearance, the witness said he was red in the face. Before they left Bolla asked Szabo how he felt and the witness said Szabo \u201cmotioned with his hands\u201d that they should leave. The decedent\u2019s son, William, testified that he reached home that afternoon at about ten minutes before four and found his father lying on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>bedroom floor. A motion for nonsuit was made at this juncture on the ground that the employer had no duty in the premises and was guilty of no negligence. The motion was overruled, appropriate exception was entered and the defendant went to its proof. Two fellow employees testified, one that Szabo was \u201call right\u201d during the morning working hours; that he did not see him after lunch; and that he stopped to see him on his way home at 3:45 p. m. Another, that Szabo was in \u201cvery bad shape\u201d at about 1:45 p. m. on the day in question. The foreman, Curran, said that he first noticed that Szabo was not .well at about 2 p. m. ; that his hands \u201cwere shaking a bit\u201d and that he cautioned him against drinking any more water; he also advised him to sit down for a while and that he would be all right; that Szabo did so and after a short time returned to his work. The foreman again told him to rest but again Szabo wanted to resume work, whereupon the foreman told him to sit down, saying, \u201cYou stay there until I tell you to come back.\u201d At that time it was getting on to three o\u2019clock. The foreman further testified that he did not think Szabo ought to walk to the tool shed in the heat, so he got one of the men who had an automobile to take him home. This concluded the defendant\u2019s case. A motion'for direction of verdict for the defendant was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In this state the law seems to be that in the absence of contract there is no duty upon the part of an employer to provide medical assistance or other means of being cured to an ill and diseased employee even though the illness or disease arose from the negligence of the employer. <em>Koviacs </em>v. <em>Edison Portland Cement Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>368, 369, citing 18 <em>R. C. L. </em>506; 26 <em>Cyc. </em>1049. A careful appraisal of the testimony in the case persuades us that there was no evidence upon which it can be fairly said that the employer, having assumed the duty of caring for the decedent, performed that duty negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The testimony of Curran stands undisputed. He noticed that Szabo was not well. He believed his distress was caused by the heat of the day; he told him to cease working and take a rest and yet Szabo returned to work not once but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>twice until Curran determined that it would be better to send him home. The fact that there was no one at home to call a doctor is a circumstance that may not he charged against the employer. An employer may not turn away from an employee who had been perhaps mortally injured and leave him unprovided for. But such is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">We think the motion for nonsuit should have been granted at tlie end o\u00ed the plaintiff\u2019s case and at the end of the whole case the motion for directed verdict for the defendant should likewise have prevailed because there was no proof that the death of the decedent was caused by any act of the employer which had been negligently performed. No evidence in the case leads io the fair assumption that the employer had knowledge, or should have had, that the employee was mortally stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The rale enunciated in <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Baltimore Insular Line, </em>287 <em>U. S. </em>370, relied upon by the court and plaintiff\u2019s counsel, is not a pertinent or apt principle for the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The judgment is accordingly reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
