Lordi.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The opinion of the. court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b488-8\">Case, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgF\">The suit was to recover under the Federal Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 <em>Stat. </em>23 (1942), for penalties incident to rental charges above the ceiling fixed by the Administrator of the Office of Price Administration. Judgment went for the tenant and the landlord appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Appellant presents two points; first, that the District Court is without jurisdiction of the subject-matter for the reason that the action was one to recover a penalty not imposed or authorized by the laws of the State of New Jersey; second, that the Emergency Price Control Act upon which the action was based is unconstitutional in that it is a delegation of legislative power by the Congress of the United States to an administrative agency. We are concluded as to the first point by our decisions- in <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>131 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>117, and <em>Bendit </em>v. <em>H. L. R. Holding Co., </em>131 <em>Id. </em>91, and as to the second point by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court handed down on March 27th, 1944, in the cases of <em>Yakus </em>v. <em>The United States of America, </em>321 <em>U. S. </em>414; <em>Rottenberg et al. </em>v. <em>The United States of America, </em>321 <em>U. S. </em>414, and <em>Bowles, as Administrator of the Office of Price Administration </em>v. <em>Willingham and Hicks, </em>321 <em>U. S. </em>503, numbered 374, 375 and 464, respectively, of the October term, 1943, United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The judgment below will he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
