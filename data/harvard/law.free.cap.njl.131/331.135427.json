The evidence was that she slipped on the inside of a banana which was on the step. There was no evidence that the presence of the banana had been, in fact, brought to defendant\u2019s previous notice or that its presence on the step had existed for such space of time before the occurrence as would have afforded the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ant sufficient opportunity to make proper inspection of the stairway and remove it. In the absence of such proof, it was error to submit the case to the jury. <em>Schnatterer </em>v. <em>Bamberger, </em>81 <em>N. J.
