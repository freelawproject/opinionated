The same evening, December 2d, Mr. Sena drove to an address as directed by his wife. There he rang the bell, which was answered by Helen Jaworski\u2019s daughter. The ensuing conversation had best be related in the words of the witness: \u201cI told Mrs. Jaworski that someone had given my wife her address and that she performed abortions, and that my wife wanted her to take care of her. So she told me she couldn\u2019t take care of it that night, but that I could bring my wife back the following night. I asked her how much the fee would be. She told me $25. I left then. I told her I would be back the following night.\u201d The next evening the Senas returned and sat down at the dining room table with Mrs. Jaworski. There was some conversation as to Mrs. Sena\u2019s condition and about money, resulting in her paying Mrs. Jaworski $25. Thereafter, Mrs. Jaworski asked Mrs. Sena to go into the bathroom where they remained for ten minutes or so when Mrs. Jaworski screamed. The husband ran to the door which was opened by Mrs. Jaworski with one hand while she held Mrs. Sena on the toilet seat with her free hand. Mrs. Sena was semi-conscious and moaning. When Mr. Sena told the plaintiff in error to call a doctor, she demurred, saying that \u201cif she called a doctor she would get in trouble1.\u201d When a doctor did arrive, Mrs. Sena was in convulsions. He administered a hypodermic to the patient and on his return at two o\u2019clock in the morning, found alongside of the patient a foetus and the usual indicia that one would expect under such circumstances. Mrs. Sena was taken to Newark Memorial Hospital where she died on December 12th.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The county medical examiner who performed an autopsy gave the cause of death as blood poisoning from an infected womb and acute Bright\u2019s disease, in turn brought on by septicemia. When asked to give his opinion as to the cause of the convulsions, the medical examiner attributed them to the introduction of air bubbles or fat droplets in the womb during an attempted abortion and that the air bubbles or fat droplets entered the large veins in the womb, and were pumped by the heart action to the brain and produced the convulsions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The defense was a categorical denial of the criminal act charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">It is urged that the court erred in denying a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal when first made. The situation at the time of the motion was that the state requested permission to recall the medical examiner who had left the witness box, if the state felt it necessary to do so. The court made no ruling on the request, although when the trial was resumed and the state recalled the medical examiner, the court then, for the first time, said that it had allowed the prosecutor to reserve that right. Counsel for plaintiff in error said \u201cthat is all right with me.\u201d In the face of this acquiescence, it does not now lie in the mouth of the plaintiff in error to allege reversible error in a course of conduct expressly assented to.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Error is also urged in the denial of motions to direct a verdict of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case and at the close of the entire case. Prom an examination of the record, there was ample evidence from which the jury could find that Mrs. Sena was pregnant; that plaintiff in error had the intent to bring about an abortion and that an instrument of some kind had been introduced into the body of decedent for that purpose. There being legal evidence from which an inference of guilt could be legitimately drawn, the denial of the motions to direct an acquittal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The next assignment alleges error \u201cin permitting the witness Martland to give opinion evidence.\u201d This broad language brings up no question to be passed upon. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>330 (at <em>p. </em>337).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">We have examined the charge of the court particularly with reference to the parts thereof in which error is asserted to lie and find that in each instance the parts complained of correctly state the law or are within the proper scope of the trial court\u2019s clear right to comment upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The judgment of the Essex County Court of Quarter Sessions is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
