Plaintiff-appellant, Prentiss M. Brown, OPA Administrator, was permitted to intervene as party plaintiff. The trial judge held \"that this suit was in fad; a proceeding to collect penalties not imposed or authorized by any statute of the State of New Jersey; that this court had no jurisdiction and dismissed the suit.\u201d Plaintiff Brown thereupon took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Although the plaintiff Brown was permitted to intervene as a party plaintiff, he filed no state of demand and made no claim to any recovery on behalf of the agency he represents. We assume in this proceeding that his intervention, as stated in the notice of motion for leave to intervene, was solely for the purpose of assisting the plaintiff Bendit to enforce his right to recovery and to assert his. Bendit\u2019s, right to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>in. the District Court. In this situation, the right of -the OPA administrator to proceed in the District Court for recovery in his own behalf under the federal statute is not raised by the pleadings, is not presented for determination and is not passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We conclude that this appeal is controlled by the recent opinion of this court in <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>117, which leads to a reversal of the judgment in this case. Costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
