The prosecutor conducts a public automobile garage and service station in his building at 277-285 Garside Street, Newark. The premises are in what is called in the zoning ordinance a \u201cthird residential zone\u201d in which public garages and warehouses are prohibited uses. On or about January 6th, 1927, on application of the owner a variance from the residential zoning restriction was granted for the construction of a public garage, which has ever since been operated there. Por economic reasons the prosecutor-now desires to discontinue the garage business and lease the premises for use as a warehouse for the storage of groceries and canned food products and fifteen one and one-half ton automobile trucks to be operated from there in the distribution of said food products. His appeal for a variance from the terms of the zoning ordinance so as to permit the use of the premises as a warehouse was refused hv the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>department and on appeal to tlie Board of Adjustment was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Sueli approval or recommendation to bo effective must be approved by the Board of Commissioners. <em>R.

It held two public hearings at which it heard reasons botli in favor of and against approving the recommendation of the Board of Adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Tlie prosecutor has the burden of showing that the Board\u2019s refusal to grant the permission was either illegal in law or unreasonable in fact. The exercise of its power may not be set aside except upon adequate grounds. We. perceive none. We find nothing in the record to indicate that the judgment of the Board was arrived at in an unfair, capricious or arbitran\u2019 manner. <em>Cf. Shaiman </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Newark, </em>15 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>431; <em>Essex Investment Co. v.
