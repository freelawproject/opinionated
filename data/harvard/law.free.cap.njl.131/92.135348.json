The trial judge held \u201cthat this suit was in fact a proceeding to collect penalties not imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>or authorized by any statute of the State of New Jersey; that this court had no jurisdiction and dismissed the suit.\u201d Plaintiff thereupon took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We conclude that this appeal is controlled by the recent opinion of this court in <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>117, which leads to a reversal of the judgment in this ease. Costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
