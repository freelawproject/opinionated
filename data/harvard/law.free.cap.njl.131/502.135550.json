The narrow question for decision is whether prosecutrix is entitled, as claimed for the state, onhr to the payment of the \u201caccumulated deductions\u201d standing to the credit of her deceased hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>band in the ..Vnnuity Savings Eund <em>(R. S. </em>43:14 \u2014 29), or whether, as claimed for the prosecutrix, she is additional^ entitled to an allowance of one-half of the \u201cfinal compensation\u201d <em>(R. 8. </em>43:14-l.e) of her deceased husband, as a \u201cpension\u201d to her \u201cto continue (luring her widowhood.\u201d <em>B. 8. </em>43:14-37\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Martin R. O\u2019Keefe was a practicing member of the bar and was employed as the Morris County district supervisor of the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Department. He had been employed by the state since 1917\u2019, he was a member of its retirement system <em>(B. S'. </em>43 :14-2), and deductions were made from his salary, for approximately twenty years, in accordance with the provisions of <em>B. 8. </em>43:14^1, <em>c.i seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Mr. O\u2019Keefe was required to maintain an office, at his own expense, for the carrying on of his tax work for the state, \u201cto he on duty to take care of matters that might come up in connection with the office during the hours of 9 a. <em>m. </em>to 5 <em>p. </em>ar. weekdays, and 9 A. ar. to 12 o\u2019clock on Saturdays.\u201d It was not necessary that he be \u201cin his office\u201d at all times so long as lie was \u201cavailable.\u201d He was a \u201cpart time\u201d employee. He was not obliged to and did not give up his practice of the law. He conducted his private legal practice and did the office work, relating to his state position, at his offices on the second floor of the Park Square Building, Morristown. New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">On July 26th, 1941, while going to his offices, between 9:00 a. if., and 10:00 A. <em>m., </em>he reached the inside of the office building, walked up the stairs leading from the first to the second floor, and as he arrived at the head of the stairs he was seen to pause and then topple over and fall to the bottom of the stairway, sustaining injuries which resulted in his death on August 2d, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Upon these proofs, adduced on hearing, the State Board of Trustees of the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System of New Jersey denied the claim of the prosecutrix for a pension. In other words, it sustained the position taken for the state as indicated in the posed question requiring decision. Me think that the, denial of prosecutrix\u2019 claim is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>So far as is here pertinent, <em>B. S. </em>43:14^37, as amended <em>Pamph. L. </em>1939, <em>ch. </em>149, <em>p. </em>491, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">\u201cUpon the death of a member in active service in the <em>actual </em>performance of duty and not the result of his willful negligence, an accident death benefit shall be payable, * * * provided evidence is submitted to the board of trustees proving that .the natural and proximate cause of his death was the performance of duty on his part at some definite time and place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Ho terms of art are employed in this statute. The words employed are plain, simple, clear and unambiguous. To words so employed we give their natural and ordinary meaning, significance and import. <em>Cf. Hackensack Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hackensack, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>343, 346; 184 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>408; <em>Fedi </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>516, 517; 193 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>801; <em>Antonelli </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>531, 532; 27 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>12; <em>In re Act Concerning Alcoholic Beverages, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>123, 128; 31 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>837. There is no reason or need for judicial construction. <em>Of. Herod </em>v. <em>Mutual Chemical Co., </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>369, 372; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>432; <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>97, 103; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>550; <em>Ott </em>v. <em>Braddock, </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>507, 510; 197 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>271.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">There is not a scintilla of proof that decedent was at the time of his fall \u201cin the <em>actual </em>performance of his duty,\u201d and that the \u201cnatural and proximate cause of his death was the performance of duty on his part.\u201d Admittedly, he had not even reached his offices where he did his work. Hor was he returning to his offices from the \u201cactual\u201d performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The workmen\u2019s compensation cases of which <em>McAnney </em>v. <em>Galloway Township, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>311; 199 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>369, and <em>Paterson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>571, 573; 20 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>323, are typical and urged, bjr way of analogy, in support of prosecutrix\u2019 claim, are clearly without application. In those cases the phrase \u201cin line of duty,\u201d contained in the supplement to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act <em>(B. S. </em>34:15-43), was construed not to have been intended by the legislature \u201cto qualify the basic relationship of the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>to the employment.\u201d But in the statute here invoked, the legislature in language \u201cadmitting of no doubt of its intention\u201d <em>(McAnney </em>v. <em>Galloway Township, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>313), did qualify the basic relationship of the injury to the employment. It provided that the accidental death benefit (pension) shall be payable upon the death of a member in active service in the \u201cactual\u201d performance of duty. The proofs utterly fail to satisfy the statute. Liberal construction is no judicial substitute for proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The writ is dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
