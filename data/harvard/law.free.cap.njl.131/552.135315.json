At petitioner\u2019s request the said fellow worker wiped the liquid from his back with a rag handed to him by petitioner. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the liquid came in contact with petitioner\u2019s hack, a burning sensation was felt which continued for the balance of the day. When he reached home that evening, ho bathed his back and his wife observed a red spot on it. There followed a skin irritation or infection on his back which spread and became worse, interfering with his ability to properly attend to his work, and at the end of two weeks his condition became such that he was obliged to discontinue work. lie has been unable since to resume work, being totally and permanently disabled. These facts are not controverted. However, there is a sharp dispute as to the nature of the disability and its cause. Petitioner sa}rs that prior to this accident he enjoyed good health, worked steadily and was free from any skin disease. There was no proof to the contrary. Erom the date of the accident he has been afflicted with a skin condition or disease which has affected his entire body and has now made necessary constant hospitalization. The petitioner claims that his condition was occasioned by the accidental striking of his back by the bottle and by the irritation or infection caused by the contents of the bottle spilling on his back and its removal by a rag immediately afterwards. He also claims that the condition was aggravated by the administration by tbe doctors of arsenic preparations given him on a mistaken diagnosis of his condition. The respondent contends that petitioner\u2019s condition was not caused nor aggravated by the accident nor by any treatment administered by the doctors. It says that his condition is due to a rare skin disease, generally fatal, known as pemphigus and probably caused by a toxic condition. Fifteen physicians testified, many of them specialists in diseases of the skin. \u25a0 Their opinions concerning the nature and cause of petitioner\u2019s condition were sharply divided. The question presented turns on this medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">A careful examination of the proofs leads us to the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment and that the clear weight of the testimony establishes that his total and permanent disability is due to the injury received in the accident. We so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
