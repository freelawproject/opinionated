Mead).</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-10\">For the respondent, <em>Raymond L.

These judgments were reversed in the Court of Common Pleas. <em>Certiorari </em>was denied by a single justice to whom application for the writ was made. The matters are now before us on application for such a writ which must 'also be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">The petitioner Max Melniek ivas production manager for the defendant company. Thomas Salemi, for whose minor children a petition was also filed, was killed on the morning of December 7th, 1940, on his way to work being driven by Melniek in the latter\u2019s wife\u2019s automobile. He was also employed at the respondent\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">The claim is made that Melniek was driving the car and carrying Salemi to the plant as part of his employment. The claim is not sustained by the weight of evidence. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>though Melnick occasionally procured parts for plant machinery in his wife\u2019s car, the proofs are clear that on the day in question and at the time of his injury he was using the car for his own purposes in order to get to work. That Salemi occasionally rode with him, as he was doing on the day in question, seems to have been because of Melnick\u2019s courtesy and concern for Salemi\u2019s convenience. The employer paid none of the tube fares or the cost of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The testimony that one of the employer\u2019s officers requested the transportation is not credible. That he knew that the men sometimes arrived together signified nothing. Workers have been requested by government agencies to share transportation when possible, and long before such request was made it was common practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Melnick is not to be believed when he testified that it was part of his duty to transport employees to and from work. The proofs show that many employees lived in Brooklyn and used train and tube. Melnick sometimes took his old friend Salemi to work, and perhaps others, hut the few he brought were hut a small proportion of the total of the employees. The claims were not filed until more than a year and a half after the accident. Melnick\u2019s testimony at the hearing was diametrically opposed to sworn statements he made shortly after the occurrence,. His testimony indicates that he desired, after iris discharge, to fix a liability upon his former employer which, we think, had no foundation in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas will be affirmed and the application for the writ will be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
