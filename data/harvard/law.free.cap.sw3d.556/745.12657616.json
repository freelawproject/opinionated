Steven Stafford, P.J., W.S.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves the appeal of an action for possession of property initially filed in general sessions court. On appeal to the circuit court, the trial court dismissed the appellant's counterclaims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The circuit court thereafter determined that the appeal from general sessions court was not timely. We reverse the circuit court's dismissal of the general sessions appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but affirm the dismissal of the appellant's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case originated with the filing of a detainer warrant by Plaintiff/Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") in Shelby County General Sessions Court (\"general sessions court\") against Defendant/Appellant Marcus Dorris (\"Appellant\"). The warrant sought only possession of the property. At the scheduled June 20, 2016 hearing, Appellant did not appear and the general sessions court awarded possession of the property in question to Wells Fargo. The following day, Appellant filed a motion to set aside the judgment and attached, as exhibits, motions to transfer to circuit court and to dismiss, as well as an answer and three counterclaims. In these filings, Appellant sought to (1) transfer the action to circuit court; (2) dismiss the eviction action; and (3) assert counterclaims for wrongful foreclosure, violation\n   of the federal Truth in Lending Act, and fraudulent suppression of the transfer of the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 6, 2016, the general sessions court clerk's office issued a writ of possession regarding the subject property. On July 8, 2016, while the post-judgment motion was pending, Appellant filed a notice of appeal to circuit court. On August 9, 2016, the general sessions court entered its order denying the motion to set aside, stating, in relevant part, that the notice of appeal divested the general sessions court of jurisdiction and the parties should proceed with the appeal in circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The case was transferred to the Shelby County Circuit Court (\"trial court\") and on October 5, 2016, Wells Fargo filed a motion to dismiss Appellant's counterclaims. The motion did not address whether Appellant's counterclaims were timely raised during the detainer proceeding in general sessions court but instead addressed the substance of Appellant's arguments. On December 9, 2016, the trial court granted Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss Appellant's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties then engaged in a period of discovery. On February 13, 2017, however, Wells Fargo filed a motion to enforce the June 20, 2016 judgment of the general sessions court, arguing for the first time that Appellant's appeal was untimely where no notice of appeal had been filed in the ten days following the August 9, 2016 order denying the motion to set aside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 7, 2017, the trial court issued an order enforcing the judgment of the general sessions court. The trial court ruled that Appellant failed to file a notice of appeal in the ten days following the general sessions court's denial of the motion to set aside, as required for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction. By this order, all of the claims raised by the parties had been adjudicated and Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant raises two issues on appeal, which are taken, and slightly restated, from his brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Whether the July 8, 2016 notice of appeal transferred subject matter jurisdiction to the trial court from the general sessions court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Whether the trial court erred in dismissing Appellant's counterclaims against Wells Fargo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As an initial matter, we must first determine whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider Appellant's appeal from the general sessions court. Subject matter jurisdiction concerns \"a court's lawful authority to adjudicate a controversy brought before it[,]\" is dependent on the nature of the action and the relief sought, and is determined by reference to the authority granted to the court by the constitution or the General Assembly.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Chapman v.

R. Civ. P. 60.01, regarding clerical mistakes, shall apply to all courts of general sessions.

Once filed, the motion shall\n   toll the ten-day period for seeking de novo review in the circuit court until the determination of the motion is concluded.

R. Civ. P. 60.02.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, a party dissatisfied with the judgment of the general sessions court may seek to set aside that judgment by the timely filing of a motion under section 16-15-727(b). When such a motion is timely filed, the time for perfecting a de novo appeal to the circuit court is tolled until such time as the motion to set aside is adjudicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In this case, the timeline is not in dispute. Here, the general sessions court entered its judgment for possession on June 20, 2015. The very next day, Appellant filed his motion to set aside pursuant to section 16-15-727(b). Thus, Appellant's motion was timely filed and tolled the time for perfecting a de novo appeal to the circuit court. Had Appellant waited to file his notice of appeal until the ten days following the general sessions court's ruling on his motion to set aside, there would be no question that the circuit court obtained jurisdiction to consider Appellant's de novo appeal. Rather than wait to file his notice of appeal, however, Appellant chose to prematurely file his notice of appeal on July 8, 2016, prior to the general sessions court's ruling on the motion to set aside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wells Fargo essentially argues that because the general sessions court had not adjudicated Appellant's motion to set aside, Appellant's July 8, 2016 notice of appeal was of no effect. Under Wells Fargo's interpretation of section 16-15-727, Appellant was therefore required to file a second notice of appeal in the ten days following the general sessions court's denial of the motion to set aside. In the absence of a notice of appeal filed within this ten-day window, Wells Fargo asserts that Appellant failed to timely perfect his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In contrast, Appellant argues that the filing of his notice of appeal was timely due to the tolling provision of section 16-15-727 and that his July 8, 2016 notice of appeal, while premature, immediately vested the circuit court with jurisdiction to consider his appeal. Respectfully, we cannot agree. In support for this argument, Appellant cites this Court's decision in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Born Again Church &amp; Christian Outreach Ministries, Inc. v.

App. P. 4(b) (noting that where one of the above motions is filed, \"the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying a new trial or granting or denying any other such motion\"). As such, while a motion under section 16-15-727(b) may only succeed when a movant can show grounds under Rule 60.02, the procedure of a\n   section 16-15-727(b) motion is not identical to a Rule 60.02 motion. Procedural rules that are applicable to a Rule 60.02 motion are therefore not necessarily applicable to motions filed pursuant to section 16-15-727(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because a motion under section 16-15-727 is filed prior to the general sessions court's judgment becoming final, we find caselaw interpreting Rule 59.04 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure instructive. Like section 16-15-727 motions, Rule 59.04 motions are filed prior to the date a judgment becomes final and have the effect of tolling the time period for filing an appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04 (\"A motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be filed and served within thirty (30) days after the entry of the judgment.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.01 (stating that Rule 59.04 motions are among the motions that toll the time for taking an appeal); Tenn. R. Civ. P. 62.01 (\"Except as otherwise provided in this Rule, no execution shall issue upon a judgment, nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 30 days after its entry.\"). Thus, while a section 16-15-727(b) motion may be granted only on grounds as specified in Rule 60.02, the procedure is more akin to that under Rule 59.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Consequently, while\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Born Again Church\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and other caselaw surrounding Rule 60.02 indicate the result had this case actually involved a Rule 60.02 motion, caselaw is equally clear as to the proper result had this case actually involved a Rule 59.04 motion filed in circuit or chancery court. Under that circumstance, the premature filing of a notice of appeal prior to the adjudication of a timely filed Rule 59.04 does not immediately divest the trial court of jurisdiction to adjudicate the pending motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Waters v.

This holding is required by the plain language of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure, which state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court retains jurisdiction over the case pending the court's ruling on any timely filed motion specified in subdivision (b) or (c) of this rule [i.e., A Rule 59.04 motion].

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the plaintiff took an appeal of the trial court's judgment within thirty days as required by statute.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 473. Before thirty days had elapsed from the judgment, however, the plaintiffs also filed a petition to rehear.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The defendants argued on appeal that the initial appeal deprived the trial court of the jurisdiction to consider the petition to rehear.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the judgment remained within the trial court's jurisdiction for the entire thirty day period following the judgment in which time the parties were permitted to appeal or file petitions to rehear.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 474-76.

Like the court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , we must conclude that a party cannot deprive the general sessions court of its statutory authority to adjudicate a timely filed section 16-15-727(b) motion by filing an intervening notice of appeal. To so hold would be to improperly limit the general sessions court's authority, which has been conferred by the Tennessee General Assembly. As such, we conclude that the filing of the July 8, 2016 notice of appeal did not immediately divest the general sessions court of jurisdiction to consider the pending section 16-15-727(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Our determination that the general sessions court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the pending section 16-15-727(b) motion, however, does not end the inquiry because we must next determine whether the filing of the notice of appeal prior to the adjudication of this motion was fatal to Appellant's\n   appeal. Again, it is well-settled that premature notices of appeal to this Court are valid and timely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. R. App. P. 4(d) (\"A prematurely filed notice of appeal shall be treated as filed after the entry of the judgment from which the appeal is taken and on the day thereof.\").

Importantly, the rule allowing premature notices of appeal to this Court is well-settled. Given that no statute expressly disallows this practice, we see no benefit in treating cases differently in general sessions courts where the result would be to dismiss otherwise appropriately perfected appeals.

Because Appellant's motion to set aside was timely, his premature notice of appeal was sufficient to perfect his appeal to the circuit court.

Appellant alleged,\n   however, that \"[n]o such letter was transmitted prior to Wells Fargo accelerating the debt, declaring [Appellant] in default or the initiating of foreclosure proceedings.\" The trial court dismissed this claim on two bases: (1) that Wells Fargo had no responsibility to send an acceleration letter; and (2) that Appellant failed to plead any damages related to the failure to send a valid acceleration letter. On appeal, Appellant's argument has changed somewhat. Rather than asserting that \"no ... letter\" was sent by Wells Fargo, Appellant now asserts that the letter sent by Wells Fargo was not timely. Indeed, in his brief, Appellant indicates that a letter was sent by Wells Fargo on June 16, 2014, which timing did not comply with federal law because Appellant was not yet one-hundred days delinquent on his debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024.41\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) (\"A servicer shall not make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process unless: ...

Rather, because Appellant's counterclaim contains no factual allegations that Appellant suffered actual damages as a result of the RESPA violation now alleged, the trial court did not err in dismissing this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The judgment of the Shelby County Circuit Court is reversed in part and affirmed in part. This cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Costs of this appeal are taxed one-half to Appellant Marcus Dorris, and his surety, and one-half to Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., for all of which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Wells Fargo also argued that Appellant's bond filed in connection with his appeal from the general sessions court was not sufficient to comply with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-18-130(b)(1). The trial court did not rely on this argument in later dismissing Appellant's de novo appeal, and it has not been raised as an issue in this appeal. We therefore express no opinion as to the necessity or appropriateness of a possession bond in this case.\n    <em>\n     C.f.,\n    </em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Gallatin Hous. Auth. v.
