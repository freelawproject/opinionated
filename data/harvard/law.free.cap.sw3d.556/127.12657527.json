He complains on appeal that the trial court plainly erred in applying sentence enhancement factors that elevated his conviction from a misdemeanor to a felony. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
