Ackman (\"Ackman\") appeals from the order and judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Union Pacific Railroad Company (\"Union Pacific\"). In the underlying case, Ackman brought suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\") against Union Pacific for injuries arising out of Union Pacific's alleged negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Union Pacific on the grounds that Ackman failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the element of causation.

App. E.D. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ackman brought suit against Union Pacific under FELA for cumulative injuries\n   he suffered while working within the scope of his duties as a machine operator. Ackman alleged he was \"exposed to repetitive traumas to his back and the structures therein\" due to the repeated stress of riding on Union Pacific's equipment. Ackman alleged riding long distances on Union Pacific's backhoes caused Ackman \"to develop a degenerative and/or trauma condition of his spine and the structures therein, including the nerves to his legs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties entered into an agreed upon Scheduling Order in which Ackman was required to disclose expert witnesses and produce the experts for deposition. In compliance with the Scheduling Order, Ackman disclosed two of his treating physicians, Dr. Crooks and Dr. Silvers, as non-retained expert witnesses who \"may\" be called to testify at trial. However, Ackman never deposed Dr. Crooks or Dr. Silvers. Ackman did not disclose any other medical experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Union Pacific subsequently moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Ackman failed to produce evidence from a medical causation expert establishing his injuries were caused by the work he performed for Union Pacific. Union Pacific asserted the only expert witnesses identified to establish causation, Dr. Crooks and Dr. Silvers, failed to disclose any such opinion. Union Pacific also asserted the medical records of Ackman's other treating physicians-Drs. Albano, McGarry, and Doll-do not link Ackman's alleged injuries to his work for Union Pacific. As such, Union Pacific argued it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Ackman could not establish the causation element of his FELA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its statement of uncontroverted material facts, Union Pacific made the following factual allegations relevant to this appeal: (1) Dr. Albano's medical records do not state that Ackman's alleged back problems were caused by his work for Union Pacific; (2) Dr. McGarry's medical records do not state that Ackman's alleged back problems were caused by his work for Union Pacific; (3) Dr. Doll's medical records do not state that Ackman's alleged back problems were caused by his work for Union Pacific; (4) None of these doctors' records link Ackman's alleged back problems to his work for Union Pacific in any way; (5) No doctor has ever told Ackman that his work on the railroad caused or contributed to his back pain; (6) Dr. Crooks' medical records do not state that Ackman's alleged back condition was caused by his work for Union Pacific; and (7) Dr. Silvers' medical records do not state that Ackman's alleged back condition was caused by his work for Union Pacific. In support, Union Pacific attached copies of each doctor's medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ackman filed a response to Union Pacific's statement of uncontroverted material facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ackman admitted the medical records of the five doctors listed above do not state his back problems were caused by his work for Union Pacific. Ackman also admitted the medical records do not link his alleged back problems to his work for Union Pacific in any way. However, Ackman denied that no doctor had ever told him his work on the railroad caused or contributed to his back pain. In support of the denial, Ackman attached a copy of his own Affidavit in which he stated, \"At no time did a doctor ever tell me that any of my back problem symptoms were caused by work on the railroad, until approximately 2013.\" The Affidavit did not identify the doctor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following a hearing, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Union Pacific, concluding Ackman failed to\n   demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the element of causation. Ackman now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Point Relied On\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his sole point on appeal, Ackman argues the trial court erred in granting Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on the issue of medical causation evidence because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether or not Ackman had medical evidence linking Union Pacific's negligence and Ackman's injuries. Specifically, Ackman argues summary judgment was inappropriate because (1) the medical report of Dr. Doll supported a causal connection between operating a backhoe for many years and the development of severe back pain, and (2) the medical record of Dr. Crooks supported that Ackman's back pain began many years ago due to operating heavy equipment for his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review the entry of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ITT Commercial Fin.

Vitek Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904924,6904837\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/445/90/\">\n    445 S.W.3d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014). Here, Ackman's vague reference to an unidentified doctor's medical opinion, without any supporting testimony or specific evidence, is entirely speculative and does not create a genuine issue of material fact to overcome summary judgment. Therefore, Ackman's failure to produce testimony from a medical causation expert to support his FELA claim was grounds for granting summary judgment in favor of Union Pacific.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078200\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/639/#p643\">\n    629 F.3d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant on FELA claim because the cumulative nature of plaintiff's injuries required expert testimony establishing specific causation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ackman argues summary judgment was inappropriate because the medical report of Dr. Doll supported a causal connection between operating a backhoe for many years and the development of severe back pain, and the medical record of Dr. Crooks supported that Ackman's back pain began many years ago due to operating heavy equipment for his job. We find Ackman's argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Ackman\n   <em>\n    admitted\n   </em>\n   in his response to Union Pacific's statement of uncontroverted material facts that the medical records of his doctors, including Dr. Doll and Dr. Crooks, do not state his back problems were caused by his work for Union Pacific. Further, Ackman\n   <em>\n    admitted\n   </em>\n   the medical records do not link his alleged back problems to his work for Union Pacific in any way. Accordingly, these material facts are not in dispute. On appeal, Ackman is essentially asking this Court to disregard his admissions and review the summary judgment record as if he denied these material facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We decline to do so. A trial court grants or denies a motion for summary judgment on the basis of what is contained in the summary judgment motion and the responses thereto.\n   <em>\n    Holzhausen v. Bi-State Dev. Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7088233\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/414/488/#p494\">\n    414 S.W.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (Mo. App. E.D. 2013). Here, the trial court granted Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment, in part, on the basis of Ackman's admissions that the medical records do not establish a causal connection between his injuries and his work for Union Pacific. As an appellate court, we are confined to considering the same information the trial court considered in rending its decision on the motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Mothershead v. Greenbriar Country Club, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11660901\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/994/80/#p85\">\n    994 S.W.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (Mo. App. E.D. 1999). As such, we cannot ignore Ackman's admissions as they were part of the summary judgment record before the trial court and considered by the court in granting summary judgment in favor of Union Pacific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, even if Ackman had not admitted the medical records do not establish causation, courts have made it clear that where a plaintiff brings suit under FELA for a cumulative injury, expert\n   <em>\n    testimony\n   </em>\n   is required to establish causation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7090685\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/1/#p5\">\n    405 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   5 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782685\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/896/#p899\">\n    620 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   899 ;\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078200\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/639/#p643\">\n    629 F.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ackman has not cited,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we have not found, any FELA cases involving a cumulative injury where a court has held medical records are sufficient evidence to establish causation and create a genuine issue of material fact to overcome a motion for summary judgment. Moreover, neither Dr. Doll nor Dr. Crooks opines in their medical records that Ackman's injuries were caused by the specific work he performed for Union Pacific. In\n   <em>\n    Payton v. Union Pacific R.R. Co.\n   </em>\n   , this Court affirmed a directed verdict in favor of Union Pacific because the plaintiff's medical causation expert failed to specifically testify that the loose cab seats on Union Pacific's locomotives caused, in whole or in part, the plaintiff's degenerative disk disease.\n   <em>\n    Payton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7090685\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/1/#p5\">\n    405 S.W.3d at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have found insufficient evidence to make a submissible case of causation when the medical expert fails to testify that the specific work activity at issue caused the plaintiff's injury.\"). Here, setting aside the fact that there is no expert testimony in this case, Ackman has not pointed us to any medical opinion in the doctors' records that specifically states riding on Union Pacific's equipment caused, in whole or in part, Ackman's degenerative back and spine injuries. Likewise, Ackman's recitation of his symptoms in the medical records does not establish the requisite causal connection to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in granting Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment because Ackman failed to produce testimony from an expert witness as required to establish the causation element of his FELA claim. Additionally, the medical records of Ackman's doctors do not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact because Ackman admitted the records do not establish a causal connection between his injuries and his work for Union Pacific, medical records are insufficient evidence to establish causation and overcome summary judgment in a cumulative injury FELA case, and, furthermore, Ackman's medical records do not specifically state his injuries were caused by his work for Union Pacific. Point denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Ackman is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Gary M.

App. E.D. 1979), for the proposition that hospital records may be relied on to establish the element of causation. However,\n    <em>\n     Pruneau\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable from the present case. In\n    <em>\n     Pruneau\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff sought to recover damages for injuries sustained in an automobile collision. During trial, the plaintiff's hospital records were admitted into evidence to establish her symptoms were related to the accident.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9931585\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/585/252/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9931585\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/585/252/\">\n     at 255\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . On appeal, the defendant argued the plaintiff failed to make a submissible case on the issue of damages due to the absence of medical testimony establishing the causal relationship between the accident and the injuries sustained. However, this Court concluded causation may be established in the absence of medical testimony if the injury suffered may be categorized as one of \"sudden onset.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9931585\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/585/252/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because the plaintiff's symptoms-headache, back pain, visual impairment, and nausea-appeared three or four days after the accident, they were sudden onset and not the result of a gradual chronic disorder.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9931585\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/585/252/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9931585\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/585/252/\">\n     at 256\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In the present case, by contrast, Ackman's injuries are not sudden onset but rather are cumulative as they are the result of repetitive trauma to his back and spine during the years he worked for Union Pacific. Therefore, expert testimony was required to establish the causal relationship between Ackman's injuries and his work for Union Pacific.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
