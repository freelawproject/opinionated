On appeal, Boston argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he operated the vehicle at issue \"without the consent of the owner thereof\" insofar as there was no evidence that the vehicle's title-holder did not provide consent. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
