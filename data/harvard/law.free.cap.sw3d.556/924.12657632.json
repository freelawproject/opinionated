WRIGHT, SENIOR CHIEF JUSTICE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The question in this appeal is whether double jeopardy bars prosecution for the offense of aggravated assault of a public servant when the accused has already been convicted of the same offense in an adjacent county; here, the accused discharged a firearm toward two troopers during a pursuit that spanned both counties. The answer to the question depends upon the allowable unit of prosecution. Prior to trial in Ector County, Appellant, Cameron Anthony Marson, entered a special plea of double jeopardy based upon his convictions in Andrews County. The trial court in Ector County denied Appellant's special plea, and the jury convicted Appellant of two counts of aggravated assault of a public servant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.02(a)(2), (b)(2)(B) (West 2011). For each count, the jury assessed Appellant's punishment at confinement for life and a $10,000 fine. Because Appellant's prosecution in Ector County was barred by double jeopardy, we vacate the judgments that stem from that prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant argues in his first issue that he was prosecuted twice for the same two offenses in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Appellant's four convictions arise from a police chase that began in Ector County and continued into Andrews County. On October 25, 2013, Appellant was the passenger in a stolen vehicle. The complainants-Trooper William Alston (Count I) and Trooper Marco Caro (Count II)-gave chase in a marked DPS patrol unit. During the pursuit, Appellant leaned out the window, pointed a firearm at the troopers, and shot at them. Appellant fired numerous shots at the troopers, both in Ector County and in Andrews County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An Andrews County grand jury quickly returned two indictments against Appellant: one for the offense of aggravated assault of a public servant for threatening\n   Trooper Alston by shooting in his direction and one for the offense of aggravated assault of a public servant for threatening Trooper Caro by shooting in his direction. A few months later, Appellant was indicted in Ector County for the offense of aggravated assault of a public servant for threatening Trooper Alston by shooting at him (Count I) and for the offense of aggravated assault of a public servant for threatening Trooper Caro by shooting at him (Count II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2015, Appellant entered into a plea agreement with respect to the Andrews County indictments. Pursuant to that agreement, Appellant pleaded guilty, was convicted as charged in the indictments, and was sentenced to confinement for twenty-five years in each cause. The district attorney in Ector County was of the opinion that a sentence of twenty-five years was \"just not enough\" and proceeded with the counts against Appellant in Ector County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After being finally convicted in Andrews County, but prior to the beginning of the trial in Ector County, Appellant filed a special plea of double jeopardy in the Ector County cause, objected to proceeding to trial, and asked that the Ector County indictment be dismissed. The trial court in Ector County conducted two pretrial hearings on the matter but ultimately permitted the State to proceed to trial. During the trial, evidence of the entire criminal episode was introduced. This appeal stems from the Ector County convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State acknowledges that \"relevant Texas case law is largely against the State.\" Nevertheless, the State argues that double jeopardy did not bar Appellant's prosecution in Ector County because Appellant committed multiple offenses of aggravated assault of each complainant because he fired numerous shots in their direction and each shot \"was the result of a separate impulse.\" The State urges this court to hold that \"each time Appellant pulled the trigger, he was committing a separate criminal act, requiring a separate culpable mental state.\" We respectfully disagree with the State's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is well settled that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.
