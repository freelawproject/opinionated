Williams wanted the court to declare that DOC's regulation regarding eligibility was inconsistent with its statutory authority and, therefore, was invalid. Because the original sentencing court directed DOC to consider Williams for long-term treatment in its sentence and judgment, his declaratory judgment petition sought relief in the form of mandating his placement in the program.\n   </opinion>\n   <judges id=\"p-17\">\n    Mark D. Pfeiffer and Cynthia L. Martin, Judges, concur.\n   </judges>\n   <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <p id=\"p-8\">\n     Karen King Mitchell, Chief Judge\n     Michael Williams appeals the dismissal of his petition for declaratory judgment for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Williams, who was convicted and sentenced upon a guilty plea for felony driving while intoxicated, sought a declaration that the Department of Corrections (DOC) was required to place him in the long-term treatment program for chronic non-violent offenders. When he filed the declaratory judgment action at issue, he had a pending appeal in the Eastern District of this court regarding the denial of his Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief. The State sought dismissal of Williams's declaratory judgment petition on two grounds: (1) he failed to identify a legally protectable interest and (2) he had an available adequate remedy at law through his post-conviction action. The trial court agreed and dismissed Williams's petition for declaratory judgment. Williams raises two points on appeal; he claims that his petition did identify a protectable interest and that he had no adequate remedy at law. After the briefs in this case were filed, the Eastern District handed down its opinion in Williams's post-conviction appeal, reversing the motion court's denial of his post-conviction motion on the ground that Williams's plea counsel provided ineffective assistance, rendering his plea involuntary. Based upon the disposition of Williams's post-conviction relief appeal, we find this case to be moot.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     <strong>\n      Analysis\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     \"In any appellate review of a controversy, a threshold question is the mootness of the controversy.\"\n     <em>\n      Grzybinski v.

He further argued that, \"because his plea rested upon the guarantee that he was being sentenced to [the long-term treatment program], the actions of the trial court and plea counsel rendered his plea involuntary.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202306687\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     The Eastern District of this court agreed with Williams and granted him relief:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n     Movant's claim that his guilty plea was involuntary based on the fact that he was misinformed about his eligibility for long-term treatment is supported by the record. Plea counsel failed to verify that Movant was eligible for [the long-term treatment program] in advising him to accept the plea agreement and enter a plea of guilty; therefore, Movant received ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, because Movant's plea rested upon the guarantee that he was being sentenced to long-term treatment, his plea was unknowing and involuntary. The motion court clearly erred in denying Movant's Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202306687\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202306687\">\n      2018 WL 2306687\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , at *5.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     As a result of the Eastern District's opinion in the appeal in Williams's post-conviction case, Williams's conviction and sentence have been vacated. Thus, the ultimate relief he seeks in his declaratory judgment action (placement in DOC's long-term treatment program) is no longer applicable as he has neither a conviction nor a sentence. \"A cause of action is moot when the question presented for decision seeks a judgment upon some matter which, if the judgment was rendered, would not have any practical effect upon any then existing controversy.\"\n     <em>\n      Humane Soc'y of U.S. v.
