Gibson, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After a lengthy hearing, the trial court granted an order of protection to the appellee based upon its finding that the appellant was stalking and harassing her. The trial court denied the appellant's counter-petition for an order of protection. The appellant raises ten issues on appeal. For the following reasons, we affirm and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties to this appeal have been involved in three separate lawsuits. Shayla Purifoy worked as a staff attorney at Memphis Area Legal Services and represents victims of domestic violence. Devine Mafa is an occupational therapist who came to the United States from Zimbabwe around 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2013, Ms. Purifoy testified at an order of protection hearing involving Dr. Mafa. The petitioner in that proceeding was a student Ms. Purifoy knew from coaching a mock trial team. The student had previously dated Dr. Mafa and was seeking to extend an order of protection against him; Dr. Mafa was also seeking an order of protection against the student. Ms. Purifoy testified very briefly, for approximately five minutes, about factual matters. She testified regarding the mock trial team's cell phone policy and whether the student would have had access to her phone at a time when she allegedly sent messages to Dr. Mafa. Ms. Purifoy was also asked if she had seen Dr. Mafa outside of court, and she described an incident in which she had observed him being detained by police outside a bar called the Silly Goose. The proceeding was eventually dismissed, with no order of protection being entered in favor of either the student or Dr. Mafa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Approximately eight months later, in early December 2013, Ms. Purifoy received a \"friend request\" from Dr. Mafa on Facebook. Dr. Mafa's Facebook page was not titled with his own name but was under the alias \"Steele Balz.\" However, Ms. Purifoy recognized that the page belonged to Dr. Mafa because some of her mock trial students had showed her the page in the past. Ms. Purifoy did not accept Dr. Mafa's friend request. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Purifoy was contacted by some of her colleagues who alerted her to the fact that Dr. Mafa was posting videos about her publicly on Facebook. One video contained the written title: \"Arrest this BLACK MAN BECAUSE HE'S BLACK. MY PROSECUTION BY AN # ANGRYBLACKWOMAN - ESQ SHAYLA NICOLE PURIFOY.\" The other video contained a caption stating that Ms. Purifoy lied and \"used Racial Codes on the stand\" that would make the KKK smile and honor her as the grand wizard. In the lengthy videos, Dr. Mafa \"ranted\" about his experience with Ms. Purifoy and spoke directly to her, stating things like,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   For you as a black woman, you should know better. You should have your mind\n   checked out. You should know that you don't do that.... [Y]ou are a shame. Shayla Nicole, you are a shame. You should be ashamed of yourself. Anyway, I had to rant to you a little bit....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   .... You should be ashamed of yourself, Shayla Nicole. I didn't know your name then. I know it now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Mafa stated in the video that Ms. Purifoy could get disbarred for her actions and mentioned calling \"the Board\" but said that he was not going to do that to another black professional. However, he said, \"that hurt me. It crushed my heart.\" Dr. Mafa said in the video he initially thought that Ms. Purifoy was beautiful and elegant but that he no longer did. In the second video, Dr. Mafa called Ms. Purifoy \"a racist lawyer\" and said that her actions rose \"to a level of impropriety when it comes to the Board of Professional Responsibility.\" He said he hoped that one day he could forgive her, but he also compared her actions to someone going to war with chemical weapons and said, \"that's not acceptable, you'll be held responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 14, 2013, Ms. Purifoy contacted Dr. Mafa by sending him a private message on Facebook. She asked Dr. Mafa to remove her photographs from his posts and to discuss any issues with her directly rather than posting in a public forum. She explained that she testified truthfully under oath and asked him not to tarnish her reputation in the community. Dr. Mafa did not respond to this message or remove the posts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 19, 2013, Ms. Purifoy filed a complaint in circuit court against Dr. Mafa alleging defamation in the form of libel and negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress. She sought an immediate temporary restraining order and also permanent injunctive relief regarding the public posts and video statements. That same day, the circuit court entered a temporary restraining order enjoining Dr. Mafa from posting Ms. Purifoy's name or pictures online or in any format; contacting Ms. Purifoy, her family, or her employer directly or indirectly; entering the building where she worked for any purpose; being present in any location where she was located; or speaking publicly about the case. Dr. Mafa was also ordered to remove all posts about Ms. Purifoy immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The complaint and temporary restraining order both contain a certificate of service indicating that they were mailed to Dr. Mafa's residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Service on Dr. Mafa was attempted by the sheriff's office and a private process server, but their attempts were unsuccessful. However, Dr. Mafa apparently became aware of the lawsuit because another lengthy message was posted on his Facebook page later in December, with the following statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF TENNESSEE FOR THE THIRTIETH JUDICIAL DISTRICT AT MEMPHIS SHELBY COUNTY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   _____________________________________________\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   SHAYLA NICOLE PURIFOYplaintiffVsTHE GREAT Steele Balz AKA # GOD\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs complaint\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   _____________________________________________\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Hey Yee Lord, Judge in the chamber wearing the black hood looking all important, comes he before yee this scholarly defendant named Steele Balz.

Your judgement for her would change American law and warn you. [W]e are watching you judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Around Christmas, Dr. Mafa continued to post additional pictures of Ms. Purifoy, apparently obtained from a Young Lawyers Division bulletin, juxtaposed beside pictures of his ex-girlfriend (the student from the mock trial team).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 31, 2013, Ms. Purifoy and Dr. Mafa had an encounter at the Silly Goose bar. Ms. Purifoy had previously informed the bouncer that she was trying to obtain service of process on Dr. Mafa. When she arrived with a friend on New Year's Eve, the bouncer told them that Dr. Mafa was inside. Ms. Purifoy called the private process server then proceeded inside. The private process server never came. Ms. Purifoy and Dr. Mafa had a brief encounter at the bar, but their versions of what occurred vary tremendously. According to Ms. Purifoy, she approached Dr. Mafa and said something along the lines of \"Don't you think you shouldn't be here?\", but Dr. Mafa acted like he did not know Ms. Purifoy, so she turned and walked away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The next day, Dr. Mafa's Facebook page contained another photograph of Ms. Purifoy and a lengthy post about the New Year's Eve encounter, stating that \"2014 started with WAR for me.\" According to Dr. Mafa's post, he was near the bar and saw Ms. Purifoy approaching him and pointing at him, then she cursed at him and told him that he had better leave. Dr. Mafa's post said that Ms. Purifoy \"looked kinda cute last night and my heart softened.\" He continued to describe her body and appearance and said she \"was turning me on\" by making wild gestures. The post stated that Ms. Purifoy \"was almost close to punch me last night. i would have liked it.\" The next day, on January 2, Dr. Mafa contacted the Memphis Police Department and reported that Ms. Purifoy had assaulted him on New Year's Eve. According to Dr. Mafa's later testimony about the events, Ms. Purifoy approached him from behind and hit him in the back of the head then started punching him in the forehead and chest. Dr. Mafa said he became so scared that he almost lost consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After a hearing in the defamation suit, the circuit court entered a permanent injunction on January 13, 2014, prohibiting Dr. Mafa from doing the acts previously enjoined by the temporary restraining order. Dr. Mafa did not appear at the injunction hearing, but the circuit court's order states that Ms. Purifoy testified under oath. The circuit court's order references testimony that notice had been sent to Dr. Mafa via certified mail and that attempts were made to serve him by the sheriff's office and a private process server. The order states that \"Defendant [h]as indicated through his own communications that he is aware of this filing (see attachment).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The permanent injunction enjoined Dr. Mafa from posting Ms. Purifoy's picture or name online or in any format; contacting Ms. Purifoy or her family or\n   employer; entering the buildings where she worked for any purpose; or being in any location where she was present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ten days later, on January 23, Dr. Mafa went to the Family Safety Center in Memphis. Ms. Purifoy maintains an office at the Family Safety Center, and she had previously provided pictures of Dr. Mafa to the security personnel at the Family Safety Center's security checkpoint. As a result, Dr. Mafa was not permitted to enter the building. According to Dr. Mafa, he went to the Family Safety Center in order to obtain an order of protection against Ms. Purifoy based on the alleged attack at the Silly Goose on New Year's Eve. Dr. Mafa claimed no knowledge of the fact that Ms. Purifoy maintained an office there. Despite the \"motion to dismiss\" posted on his Facebook page in December 2013, Dr. Mafa also claimed that this incident at the Family Safety Center on January 23, 2014, first made him aware of the defamation suit filed by Ms. Purifoy, as the security personnel informed him that there was a court order against him. On February 12, 2014, Dr. Mafa made his first appearance in the defamation suit, filing a motion to set aside the permanent injunction order on the basis that he had no notice of the proceeding before the entry of the injunction. Rather than seeking dismissal, however, Dr. Mafa's motion asked the court \"to set aside the previous order of default entered in this matter and to reinstate the temporary injunction, and set a new hearing date that will give Defendant time to investigate and answer this complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 20, 2014, Ms. Purifoy's identical twin sister allegedly saw Dr. Mafa in the employee parking lot of the Family Safety Center as she left the building after-hours, shortly after 6:00 p.m. Dr. Mafa was allegedly parked right across from her car, where he was leaning against his vehicle smoking a cigar. She drove away without incident but informed Ms. Purifoy of the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On February 26, 2014, Ms. Purifoy instituted this action by filing a petition for order of protection in circuit court, alleging that Dr. Mafa was stalking her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day the petition was filed, the circuit court entered an ex parte order of protection pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-605(a) upon finding that Ms. Purifoy was under an immediate and present danger of abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ex parte order of protection prohibited Dr. Mafa from contacting, stalking, threatening, abusing, or coming about Ms. Purifoy for any purpose. The ex parte order of protection provided that a hearing would be held two days later on February 28, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A hearing was held on February 28, 2014. We do not have a transcript of the hearing in the record before us, but the written orders entered after the hearing address matters from both the defamation case and the order of protection case. The circuit court entered a \"Transfer and Joinder Order,\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Comes now the Plaintiff, Shayla Purifoy, by and through her attorney of record, Marty McAfee and makes an oral\n   motion to transfer the Petition for Order of Protection and Hearing from Division III to Division 1, due to a related matter, CT-005435-13, being heard in Division I. Plaintiff also requests that such matter be joined with docket number CT-005435-13, as a separate cause of action, due to judicial efficiency. This does not preclude Plaintiff from receiving separate remedies available through each cause of action but allows related matters to be heard simultaneously as the Court deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Transfer and Joinder Order was signed by the judge approving the transfer, Judge Karen Williams, and also by the judge accepting the transfer, Judge John McCarroll. Judge McCarroll also signed a \"Continuance Order\" on February 28 stating that the motion to set aside the permanent injunction (filed in the defamation case) came before the court and was continued until a later date when the petition for order of protection would also be heard. The order states that \"[t]he Petition for Order of Protection, [and] Ex Parte Order of Protection ... were filed by Plaintiff and hand-delivered to\n   <em>\n    Defendant Devine Mafa/Defendant's Attorney (circle)\n   </em>\n   in court on February 28, 2014 at 11 AM.\" The court entered another ex parte order of protection and set a hearing for April 4, 2014. On April 4, however, a continuance order was entered continuing the hearing on both matters \"at the request of [Dr. Mafa].\" The order provided that the ex parte order of protection and permanent injunction would remain in place until the next hearing on May 30. On May 30, the matter was continued again until July 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On July 17 and 18, Judge McCarroll heard testimony regarding the petition for an order of protection. The executive director of Memphis Area Legal Services was called to testify as the last witness, which led Judge McCarroll to advise the parties that he had solicited contributions for Memphis Area Legal Services in connection with a \"Campaign for Equal Justice.\" Dr. Mafa requested recusal, and Judge McCarroll entered an order recusing himself that same day. Also on July 17, Judge Gina Higgins signed another ex parte order of protection by interchange and set the matter for hearing on August 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Judge Donna Fields signed an additional ex parte order of protection on August 29 and set the matter for hearing on September 26. A flurry of activity occurred in the case in September before the hearing. Dr. Mafa sought to depose Ms. Purifoy. Because he had also recently filed a pro se motion to dismiss the defamation case that included outrageous allegations against Ms. Purifoy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   she filed a motion for a protective order precluding her deposition and a motion to seal the case. Days before the hearing set for September 26, Dr. Mafa filed a counter-petition seeking an order of protection against Ms. Purifoy, alleging that she was stalking him. Thereafter, his attorney moved to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At the hearing before Judge Fields on September 26, 2014, she granted the motion to withdraw filed by Dr. Mafa's attorney and entered an order sealing the record. Judge Fields indicated that her priority was to have a hearing on the petition for order of protection prior to resolving the defamation case. She asked Dr. Mafa to retain another attorney as soon as possible and set the final hearing in the order of protection case for October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Mafa filed a request for a thirty to ninety day continuance to allow him to conduct discovery and retain another attorney. He also requested an interpreter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At a hearing on October 10, 2014, Judge Fields denied Dr. Mafa's request for an interpreter, observing that he has two PhD's from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in England and \"speaks perfect English.\" Judge Fields also ruled against Dr. Mafa on some other matters and stated that the ex parte order of protection would be extended once again, until the date of the final hearing on October 27. After the hearing, Dr. Mafa filed a motion to recuse Judge Fields. He alleged that Judge Fields was biased against Facebook users and that she did not have the patience to allow him to articulate his speech. He also argued that recusal was warranted because Ms. Purifoy was a lawyer who had practiced in Judge Fields' courtroom. He claimed that Judge Fields had demonstrated bias by ruling in Ms. Purifoy's favor on various issues. In an amended motion for recusal, Dr. Mafa further alleged that he had been \"regularly threatened with the bailiff.\" He asserted that Judge Fields was biased against foreigners, Facebook users, and non-attorneys. Ms. Purifoy filed a response to the recusal motion arguing that recusal was not warranted. She also represented that Dr. Mafa did not confer with her attorney before selecting Friday, October 24, 2014, as the hearing date for the recusal motion. In the response, Ms. Purifoy's counsel represented that he had a prior court date set on Friday, October 24, which could take considerable time and cause him to miss the hearing on the recusal motion. Counsel argued that no hearing was necessary for the recusal motion and suggested that \"this decision can be made,\n   <em>\n    subject to the approval of the Court\n   </em>\n   , at the beginning of the hearing set on Monday, October 27, 2014 or prior to this hearing.\" (Emphasis added.) The record contains no action by the court in response to this request for the court to decide the matter without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On Friday, October 24, 2014, counsel for Ms. Purifoy appeared at the hearing set by Dr. Mafa for his recusal motion. Dr. Mafa did not appear. The transcript of the October 24 hearing is in the record before us, and it indicates that the \"hearing\" lasted two minutes, from 9:32 to 9:34 a.m. The transcript of the exchange between Judge Fields and Ms. Purifoy's counsel spans only three pages. At the outset, Judge Fields asked Ms. Purifoy's counsel if he had received a copy of an email she had just received that morning from Dr. Mafa, in which he stated that he was \"scared to come to [her] court\" and \"will not be present for the motion\" but demanded that Judge Fields recuse herself or else he would file a board complaint against her. When counsel answered in the negative, Judge Fields replied that she was going to reset the recusal matter for the beginning of the previously scheduled final hearing on Monday. Because Dr. Mafa's proposed board complaint indicated that a tape would be provided to support his allegations, she asked counsel if there was a transcript of the previous two court appearances and said she would like to review those. Judge Fields also instructed counsel for Ms. Purifoy to send a letter to Dr. Mafa telling him that if he was recording the proceedings, he was to bring the tape and the person who was making the recording to the next hearing. Counsel for Ms. Purifoy then informed the court that he had also received a message from Dr. Mafa, the night before the hearing, which stated that Dr. Mafa had hired a private investigator to conduct extensive research about Ms. Purifoy and her attorney. Counsel for Ms. Purifoy informed the court that it gave him \"great pause\" and \"quite a bit of concern\" that Dr. Mafa had hired a private investigator in the midst of an order of protection proceeding. Judge Fields directed him to take the message to\n   the district attorney, stating, \"This is getting out of control.\" Judge Fields added, \"I will not be intimidated by some litigant who is representing himself pro se, and if he's afraid of me, that's his problem. But I suspect he's not afraid of me or you or anybody else.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On Monday, October 27, 2014, Dr. Mafa appeared at the final hearing on the order of protection matter with a newly retained attorney. At the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Purifoy's counsel mentioned his appearance at the Friday hearing. Dr. Mafa's new attorney apologized on his behalf for the fact that he did not appear. After a lengthy discussion, Dr. Mafa's attorney announced that he was not pursuing the board complaint against Judge Fields. A written order was entered stating that Dr. Mafa had decided to proceed and withdrew his motion for recusal upon representations by the court that she could fairly and impartially decide the matter. The trial court heard extensive testimony over the course of two days regarding the petition for order of protection filed by Ms. Purifoy and the counter-petition for order of protection filed by Dr. Mafa. The court heard testimony from Ms. Purifoy, Dr. Mafa, and nine other witnesses. Several written posts and videos from Dr. Mafa's Facebook page were entered into evidence. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court announced her ruling in favor of Ms. Purifoy. The trial court found that Dr. Mafa was stalking and harassing Ms. Purifoy. The trial court referenced the Facebook videos and written posts by Dr. Mafa and concluded that they would give any reasonable person reason to be afraid of what he might do. Aside from the Facebook posts, the trial court found that Dr. Mafa was also seen in the parking lot of Ms. Purifoy's place of employment, at the Family Safety Center. The court also noted that Dr. Mafa sent an email to Ms. Purifoy's attorney stating that he had hired a private investigator to conduct extensive research on her, despite the existence of the ex parte order of protection and permanent injunction. The trial court found that Dr. Mafa's email \"was sent for intimidation\" and \"can't be called anything but harassment or intimidation.\" The trial court also referenced proof introduced by Ms. Purifoy to suggest that Dr. Mafa had experienced many \"incidents in the legal system\" with numerous other individuals. The trial court concluded that \"Mr. Mafa is a man who deals in drama. He's paranoid. He truly believes there's a conspiracy, that everyone's out there to get him.\" Based upon the court's conclusion that Ms. Purifoy was rightfully afraid of Dr. Mafa, the trial court granted Ms. Purifoy an order of protection against him for one year. The trial court concluded that Dr. Mafa was not afraid of Ms. Purifoy, and it found his testimony that Ms. Purifoy struck him on New Year's Eve was not credible. The trial court denied his request for an order of protection. The trial court signed a standard form order of protection for Ms. Purifoy at the conclusion of the hearing, and it also entered a separate order with additional written findings thereafter and incorporated by reference its lengthy oral ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On December 11, 2014, approximately six weeks after the conclusion of the final hearing, Dr. Mafa filed a \"Request for Designation of Extra-County Judge Pursuant to Shelby County Circuit Court Local Rule Twenty-One.\" Dr. Mafa asked for an extra-county judge to hear the proceedings going forward, including his motion to reconsider or alter or amend or for new trial and Ms. Purifoy's pending request for attorney's fees, due to the fact that Ms. Purifoy practices as an attorney in Shelby County. The following day, the trial court entered an order partially granting Ms. Purifoy's request for attorney's fees pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 36-3-617.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dr. Mafa filed a notice of appeal under the docket number of the order of protection case and a separate notice of appeal under the docket number of the defamation case, even though that case had not yet been tried. The notice of appeal for the order of protection case was also filed prematurely, after the conclusion of the final hearing but before the trial court entered its orders containing its factual findings and resolving the pending post-trial motions. On March 25, 2015, the trial court entered its orders granting Ms. Purifoy's petition for order of protection, denying Dr. Mafa's petition for order of protection, denying Dr. Mafa's request for an extra-county judge, and denying Dr. Mafa's motion to reconsider, alter or amend, or for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ms. Purifoy filed an additional post-trial motion in the trial court seeking to correct a \"clerical error\" on the judgment awarding her attorney's fees due to the fact that it listed the docket number for the defamation case rather than the docket number for the order of protection case. Ms. Purifoy also filed a motion in the Court of Appeals seeking a remand for correction of this \"clerical mistake.\" On October 5, 2015, this Court entered an order granting Ms. Purifoy's motion for a remand \"for the limited purpose of correcting a clerical mistake on an order contained in the appellate record.\" This Court's order directed the circuit court clerk to transmit a supplemental record to this Court after entry of the corrected order. We denied a motion to reconsider or vacate this order, filed by Dr. Mafa, explaining that any differences regarding whether the record accurately discloses what occurred in the trial court are to be submitted to and settled by the trial court pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(e). On December 22, 2015, we entered an order dismissing the appeal that Dr. Mafa filed in the defamation case, as it was apparent that there was no final judgment resolving that matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   While the appeal of the order of protection case was on remand for correction of the record, the parties discovered that a great deal of the filings from the order of protection case had been mistakenly filed in the record for the defamation case. At a hearing before Judge Fields on April 1, 2016, the parties' attorneys conceded that both parties had filed various documents listing the wrong docket number. Later in this same hearing, Dr. Mafa's counsel indicated that she had \"briefed in the Court of Appeals\" an argument suggesting that Judge Fields should be recused based on an ex parte communication that allegedly occurred prior to the final hearing. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Is there a motion for recusal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Dr. Mafa's attorney:] No. I don't have a motion before the court today. I don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judge Fields directed counsel to file a motion to recuse along with a transcript of\n   the allegedly improper statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, regarding the motion to correct the record, Judge Fields directed the parties and their attorneys to meet with the clerk, sort through the files for both of the cases, and divide the filings between the two records based on their substantive content, not the docket number originally listed on the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Two months later, on June 1, 2016, Dr. Mafa filed a written \"Memorandum of Law in support of the Motion for Recusal of Judge Fields.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claimed that while reviewing the appellate record, he and his counsel \"learned for the first time that the Court had an ex parte communication with opposing counsel [ ] on October 24, 2014.\" (This was the date of the two-minute Friday morning recusal hearing, when Dr. Mafa did not appear, before the final hearing commenced on Monday, October 27, 2014.) Dr. Mafa referenced the fact that Judge Fields directed counsel to take Dr. Mafa's message about the private investigator to the district attorney. Dr. Mafa alleged that this action \"appeared to form an inappropriate pact\" between Judge Fields and counsel for Ms. Purifoy and that he would not have withdrawn his recusal motion the following Monday if he had known about this instruction. Dr. Mafa argued that this statement, combined with other statements and rulings made by Judge Fields throughout the proceeding, entitled him to a new trial before a different trial judge. Ms. Purifoy filed a response, arguing that Dr. Mafa's recusal motion was untimely and also lacked substantive merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On July 29, 2016, the trial court entered an \"Order to Correct the Record\" in both the defamation case and the order of protection case. The court found that numerous documents were filed by both parties with the wrong docket number, resulting in each of the court files containing filings clearly meant for the other case. The court found that the substance of the motions and transcripts was not affected by the erroneous numbering. As such, the court designated 63 separate filings and transcripts to be moved to the appropriate\n   court file pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also entered into a \"stipulation order\" providing that all documents from the defamation case would be included in the record in this appeal as well. Because Dr. Mafa had already filed his appellant's brief on appeal, he sought and was granted permission to file a new brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Judge Fields entered an order addressing Dr. Mafa's recusal motion. Judge Fields found that Dr. Mafa's recusal motion was \"replete with untrue, misstated and mischaracterized statements (by lack of context) which are carelessly presented, without proper investigation.\" The court discussed numerous statements and rulings that Dr. Mafa claimed showed bias and explained why each claim was meritless. As for the allegedly newly-discovered \"ex parte communication\" at the October 24, 2014 hearing, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Mafa has repeatedly complained that [Ms. Purifoy's counsel] Mr. McAfee had an ex parte communication with the Court, when in reality it was Mafa who sent an email to the Court without sending a copy to opposing counsel, which counsel appeared on a date Mafa had set that motion. The email was not only an ex parte communication, but was an outright threat that if this Court did not recuse itself that he (Mafa) would file a complaint to the Board of Judicial Conduct, which Mafa did and which was dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   On the Motion date, Mr. McAfee, on behalf of Purifoy, attempted to call to the Court's attention an allegation of some sort of criminal behavior. This Court dismissed him and told him to go report that to the District Attorney, Amy [Weirich], who has criminal jurisdiction, because Circuit Court does not. Mafa felt that was an attempt on the part of the Court to get him into trouble in Criminal Court, and thus shows bias. It merely shows lack of Jurisdiction, and Mafa's paranoia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Paragraph lettering omitted.) In sum, the trial court found that Dr. Mafa's allegations were \"terribly distorted and many untrue.\" The August 30, 2016 order concluded, though, with the following paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   However, in light of this Court's retirement date of August 31, 2016, and not because of anything mentioned herein, this Court has chosen to recuse herself and leave Mafa and Purifoy to the next computer chosen judge. It is this Court's fervent hope that she will be in a distant state or country when this matter goes to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Judge Donna M. Fields is recusing herself and refers this matter to the clerk for a randomly selected judge to hear the remainder of this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On December 23, 2016, Dr. Mafa filed a motion to consider post-judgment facts in this Court, asking us to consider the fact\n   that Judge Fields had recused herself from both cases on August 30, 2016. This Court denied the motion to consider post-judgment facts on January 20, 2017. However, the circuit court clerk supplemented the record on appeal with an additional volume containing the order of recusal and related filings, so they now appear in the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The August 30, 2016 Order of Recusal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   At the outset, we consider Dr. Mafa's argument that the order of protection and judgment entered after the two-day hearing in October 2014 must be set aside due to the order of recusal entered by Judge Fields on August 30, 2016. His brief on appeal relies on Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 10, Canon 2, Rule 2.11 Comment [2], which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A judge is obligated not to hear or decide matters in which disqualification is required, even though a motion to disqualify is not filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We discern no merit in Dr. Mafa's argument. The order entered by Judge Fields on August 30, 2016, makes clear that she did not consider\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the allegations in Dr. Mafa's recusal motion as having substantive merit. She found that the motion was \"replete with untrue, misstated and mischaracterized statements\" that were \"carelessly presented, without proper investigation.\" Based on these findings, disqualification was not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   either on August 30, 2016, or, more importantly, at the time of the final hearing in October 2014. For whatever reason, Judge Fields curiously decided to recuse herself because of her retirement the very next day \"and not because of anything mentioned herein.\" However, this fact does not mean that she was disqualified from hearing the matter in 2014, and, given the unique circumstances of this case, it is not necessary to set aside the 2014 orders and remand for a new hearing due to her recusal nearly two years later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whack v. Seminole Mem'l Hosp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7616018\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/456/561/#p564\">\n    456 So.2d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 (Fla. Ct. App. 1984) (\"Entering the order of recusal did not absolve the court of jurisdiction for those acts taken prior to recusal, nor did recusal result in making those orders previously entered void.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Request for Designation of Extra-County Judge pursuant to Local Rule\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On December 11, 2014, approximately six weeks after the final hearing, Dr. Mafa filed a request for designation of an extra-county judge pursuant to Shelby County Circuit Court Local Rule 21. Local Rule 21 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   In any action in which a Shelby County attorney is a real, rather than a nominal party, the parties must file a written notice of that fact with the Court within thirty (30) days after the first responsive pleading in Circuit Court, or the docketing of the case in Circuit Court (whichever is sooner). The written notice must\n   include: a description of the nature of the case, whether a jury has been demanded, and whether or not the attorney-party intends to testify. The Court will then forthwith decide whether or not to request that a Judge from outside Shelby County be designated to hear the case, and will notify counsel for the parties of the decision. Nothing herein shall prevent counsel for either party from requesting that the Court obtain designation of an extra-county judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Tenn. R. 30th Dist. Cir. Ct. Rule 21. Here, counsel did not request designation of an extra-county judge until six weeks after the trial court had held a two-day hearing and ruled against her client. The local rule clearly states that upon request, the trial court will ultimately decide whether or not to request the designation of an extra-county judge and will notify the parties of its decision. In other words, designation of an extra-county judge is not mandatory on demand of a party. We discern no reversible error with regard to this issue due to the late timing of Dr. Mafa's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Service of the Petition for Order of Protection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Dr. Mafa also contends that reversal is required due to Ms. Purifoy's failure to comply with the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-605 regarding service of the petition for order of protection. The statute provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (a) Upon the filing of a petition under this part, the courts may immediately, for good cause shown, issue an ex parte order of protection. An immediate and present danger of abuse to the petitioner shall constitute good cause for purposes of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (b) Within fifteen (15) days of service of such order on the respondent under this part, a hearing shall be held....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    The court shall cause a copy of the petition and notice of the date set for the hearing on such petition, as well as a copy of any ex parte order of protection, to be served upon the respondent\n   </em>\n   at least five (5) days prior to such hearing. An ex parte order issued pursuant to this part shall be personally served upon the respondent....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-605\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, Ms. Purifoy filed her petition for order of protection on February 26, 2014, after Dr. Mafa was allegedly seen in the employee parking lot outside the Family Safety Center. On the same day the petition was filed, the circuit court entered an ex parte order of protection pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-605(a) upon finding that Ms. Purifoy was under an immediate and present danger of abuse. The ex parte order of protection provided that a hearing would be held two days later on February 28, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing was held on February 28, and Dr. Mafa appeared with his counsel. Although we do not have a transcript, Judge McCarroll's written order entered that day states that \"[t]he Petition for Order of Protection, [and] Ex Parte Order of Protection ... were filed by Plaintiff and hand-delivered to\n   <em>\n    Defendant Devine Mafa/Defendant's Attorney (circle)\n   </em>\n   in court on February 28, 2014 at 11 AM.\" Dr. Mafa later filed a response to the petition for order of protection reciting that \"[o]n February 28, 2014, Mafa was officially served an Ex Parte Order of Protection, while in Court.\" At the final hearing, Dr. Mafa's attorney stated that Dr. Mafa \"was served with a notice of a hearing for an order of\n   protection\" in court on February 28. Dr. Mafa also testified that when he appeared in court on February 28, \"that's when I was first served.\" In Dr. Mafa's post-trial motion to alter or amend, he stated, \"Mr. Mafa was personally served outside of court with his lawyer present on February 28, 2014.\" Considering all of these statements in the record, we find no merit in Dr. Mafa's assertion on appeal that he was never served with the petition for order of protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Dr. Mafa appears to argue, perhaps alternatively, that \"[t]he ex parte orders of protection served upon Dr. Mafa\" that erroneously listed the docket number for the defamation case \"did not comply with the service requirements of the statute.\" Again, this argument has no merit. Dr. Mafa was served with the petition for order of protection and the February 28 ex parte order of protection, which both listed the correct docket number. We recognize that Dr. Mafa's response to the petition for order of protection and some later ex parte orders of protection incorrectly listed the docket number for the defamation case. However, the trial court entered an order correcting the record, which placed those original documents in the correct file for the order of protection case rather than the defamation case. The trial court found that the substance of the documents was not affected by the erroneous numbering, and we agree. When Dr. Mafa was served with the various ex parte orders of protection, he knew that they were entered in the context of the case involving the petition for an order of protection because he proceeded accordingly, and no one challenged the incorrect numbering until after the final hearing. Therefore, Dr. Mafa is not entitled to relief based on this technicality regarding the docket numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Stalking\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Dr. Mafa also argues that the trial court erred in finding that he stalked Ms. Purifoy. Again, the trial court concluded that Dr. Mafa was stalking Ms. Purifoy and that her fear of him was reasonable due to his actions. The court found that Ms. Purifoy viewed the videos that Dr. Mafa posted about her and was scared of him as a result. The court found that Ms. Purifoy had \"a right to be afraid\" due to Dr. Mafa's video \"rant at her\" in which he called her by name. The court found that Dr. Mafa also posted pictures of Ms. Purifoy on his Facebook page multiple times, and on these posts, he referred to himself as the Messiah, which caused her reasonable fear. The court found that Ms. Purifoy was terrified and disturbed by the side-by-side photographs Dr. Mafa posted of Ms. Purifoy next to his ex-girlfriend. The court noted Dr. Mafa's statement in his posts that he had stared at Ms. Purifoy's picture for hours. The trial court found that Dr. Mafa's Facebook posts were \"part of his stalking.\" Although the court found no proof to establish that Dr. Mafa knew that Ms. Purifoy worked at the Family Safety Center when he went there the first time, the court found that he was seen in the employee parking lot of the Family Safety Center on a subsequent occasion in February 2014. The court found that Dr. Mafa also sent a message to Ms. Purifoy during this proceeding stating that he had hired a private investigator and that she could lose her law license, which, the court found, \"can't be called anything but harassment or intimidation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On appeal, Dr. Mafa argues that the Facebook videos he posted on his own Facebook page do not constitute \"contact\" within the meaning of the statutory definition of stalking. He argues that his videos or postings cannot constitute contact because they were never posted on Ms. Purifoy's Facebook page. We disagree. Pursuant to the relevant statutes, a \" '[s]talking\n   victim' means any person, regardless of the relationship with the perpetrator, who has been subjected to, threatened with, or placed in fear of the offense of stalking, as defined in \u00a7 39-17-315[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-601\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-3-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11). In turn, the offense of \"stalking\" is defined as \"a willful course of conduct involving repeated or continuing harassment of another individual that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested, and that actually causes the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-315\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (emphasis added). At the time of the acts and proceedings below, the statute further defined \"unconsented contact\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   any contact with another person that is initiated or continued without that person's consent, or in disregard of that person's expressed desire that the contact be avoided or discontinued. Unconsented contact includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (A) Following or appearing within the sight of that person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (B) Approaching or confronting that person in a public place or on private property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (C) Appearing at that person's workplace or residence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (D) Entering onto or remaining on property owned, leased, or occupied by that person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (E) Contacting that person by telephone;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (F) Sending mail or electronic communications to that person;\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (G) Placing an object on, or delivering an object to, property owned, leased, or occupied by that person[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-315\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). We conclude that Dr. Mafa's Facebook \"rants\" to Ms. Purifoy fall within the definition of \"unconsented contact,\" in the form of \"electronic communications\" to her that were initiated without her consent and continued in disregard of her expressed desire that the contact be discontinued. In his video posts, Dr. Mafa spoke\n   <em>\n    directly to\n   </em>\n   Ms. Purifoy, stating things like,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   For you as a black woman, you should know better. You should have your mind checked out. You should know that you don't do that.... [Y]ou are a shame. Shayla Nicole, you are a shame. You should be ashamed of yourself. Anyway, I had to rant to you a little bit....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   .... You should be ashamed of yourself, Shayla Nicole. I didn't know your name then. I know it now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In another instance, he spoke about seeing Ms. Purifoy at a bar and said \"I saw you.\" In another, he mentioned, \"you'll be held responsible.\" Dr. Mafa's posts were publicly available, and Ms. Purifoy viewed them, as Dr. Mafa intended. It does not matter that Dr. Mafa posted the messages publicly\n   <em>\n    to his own page\n   </em>\n   rather than on Ms. Purifoy's page. The fact remains that it was \"unconsented contact\" within the meaning of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Although the statutory definition of \"stalking\" varies from state to state, electronic communication like that occurring in this case has been held to qualify as contact or communication.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, we conclude that this act can be considered as another instance of unconsented contact within the meaning of the statute, even though he did not have a direct encounter with Ms. Purifoy on this occasion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-315\">\n    Tenn.

At the final hearing, Ms. Purifoy testified that she became concerned by the level of attention that Dr. Mafa attributed to her in December and January 2014 and felt that Dr. Mafa had \"become obsessed\" with her. She testified, \"It was scary to me.\" She described his postings as \"creepy\" and said she did not know why he suddenly showed renewed interest in her nearly a year after her trial testimony. Ms. Purifoy said, \"I considered what he was doing threatening.\" Ms. Purifoy explained that in the videos, Dr. Mafa was looking directly into the camera and calling her name in a manner that she interpreted as yelling. She noted that he not only referenced what happened in court but also made repeated and continued references to her appearance, even describing the angles of her face and stating that he had stared at her picture for hours. She was concerned by the pictures of herself placed next to Dr. Mafa's ex-girlfriend. Ms. Purifoy testified that she did not know what Dr. Mafa \"might be capable of.\" Ms. Purifoy explained that she initially sought an injunction requiring Dr. Mafa to stay away from her. However, when she learned about Dr. Mafa being present in the employee parking lot of her place of employment, she became alarmed and afraid. She explained that when \"all of that came together\" with the various postings and his appearance at the Family Safety Center, she decided she also needed to seek an order of protection. Considering this testimony, we conclude that Dr. Mafa's unconsented contact caused Ms. Purifoy to subjectively experience significant distress within the meaning of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Finally, Dr. Mafa argues this his Facebook postings were merely \"ranting\" and that they are constitutionally protected free speech. He notes that the statutory definition of harassment \"does not include constitutionally protected activity or conduct that serves a legitimate purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-315\">\n    Tenn.

However, his precise arguments regarding \"due process\" are difficult to determine from his brief. His brief on appeal lists as a separate issue, \"Was Dr. Mafa Denied Due Process?\" Aside from the apparent vagueness of this issue, his brief fails to properly develop a legal argument with supporting authority regarding due process. His brief includes a lengthy section entitled, \"Dr. Mafa Was Denied Due Process.\" Immediately underneath this broad heading, however, he simply includes five subsections addressing some of the issues that he listed separately in his brief (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , his post-trial request for extra-county judge; and service of the petition for order of protection) and other issues that were not listed separately in his brief (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , validity of service in the defamation case; timeliness of the hearing; denial of access to the Family Safety Center; and right to a jury trial). This \"due process\" section of his brief spans a total of seventeen pages, but the only legal authority he cites\n   <em>\n    about due process\n   </em>\n   is the due process clause itself, which he quotes on one page.

Having carefully reviewed Dr. Mafa's brief on appeal in light of the voluminous record, we conclude that he has waived any issue on appeal regarding the violation of his due process rights for failure\n   to construct an appropriate argument in his brief. We will proceed to consider the substantive legal arguments contained within the five subsections regarding alleged violations of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure and various statutes, but we will not address whether Dr. Mafa's due process rights were violated in connection with those subsections (with the exception of his issue regarding the Family Safety Center).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

He claims that the posting of his photographs at the behest of Ms. Purifoy interfered with his right to access the courts to file his own petition for order of protection and also interfered with \"his liberty protected by the due process clause.\" He claims that the denial of his right to enter the Family Safety Center violated his constitutional rights \"and merits a reversal.\" In response, Ms. Purifoy argues that no due process violation occurred because Dr. Mafa was still able to seek an order of protection, and he was given a full hearing on his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Dr. Mafa does cite some limited legal authority to support this argument, as his brief states, \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

Dr. Mafa argues on appeal that he was never served with the complaint in the defamation case and that he did not have notice of the injunction hearing before the permanent injunction was issued, and therefore, the trial court erred by referencing the injunction in its decision in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Mafa\n   asks this Court to consider the record from the defamation case, which was included in the appellate record on appeal pursuant to the parties' stipulation order, and to determine whether service was properly accomplished in the defamation case pursuant to the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. He claims that no personal service was accomplished, and therefore, the permanent injunction should be held void, and the defamation case should be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We decline to extend our review on appeal to the lengths urged by Dr. Mafa. It is important to keep in mind that\n   <em>\n    this appeal\n   </em>\n   arises out of the parties' order of protection case. Regardless of the fact that the parties entered into a stipulation order designating all documents from the defamation case to be included in this record, we must bear in mind that this Court dismissed Dr. Mafa's separate appeal from the defamation case due to the lack of a final judgment. Here, we are concerned with the issues raised and errors allegedly committed by the trial court in the context of the order of protection case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   At the final hearing, Dr. Mafa testified that he first learned about the injunction entered in the defamation case on January 23, 2014, when he went to the Family Safety Center to obtain an order of protection against Ms. Purifoy based on the alleged assault at the Silly Goose bar on New Year's Eve. He testified that security personnel would not allow him to enter and that they informed him that a lawsuit had been filed and a court order had been entered against him. Dr. Mafa said he contacted his lawyer, and upon investigation, they learned of the entry of the injunction. He filed his motion to set aside the injunction on February 12, 2014. Dr. Mafa testified that he never returned to the Family Safety Center, but Ms. Purifoy's twin sister testified that she saw him in the parking lot after hours on February 20, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In its order granting Ms. Purifoy's petition for order of protection, the trial court found that the injunction requested by Ms. Purifoy in the defamation case was granted in January 2014 and that Dr. Mafa admittedly became aware of the injunction on January 23, 2014, when he went to the Family Safety Center and was denied entry by security. The court noted Ms. Purifoy's position that Dr. Mafa was \"aware of the injunction and in spite of that [ ] he came about her workplace.\" The trial court found that Dr. Mafa was in fact spotted in the parking lot of the Family Safety Center in February 2014, after the injunction was granted. However, we cannot agree with Dr. Mafa's assertion that these findings warrant reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The issue before the Court\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   was whether Dr. Mafa engaged in a willful\n   course of conduct involving repeated or continuing harassment that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested, and that actually caused Ms. Purifoy to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-17-315\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). The trial court found that he did, in part because he appeared at Ms. Purifoy's workplace even after he was denied entry once and notified of the defamation suit and the entry of the injunction against him. Dr. Mafa's arguments regarding service in the defamation case do not negate the fact that he appeared at her workplace as part of a willful course of conduct involving continuing harassment within the meaning of the stalking statute. In other words, his appearance at her workplace was unconsented contact regardless of whether it also violated an injunction in a separate case. We find no basis for reversal of the order of protection based on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Timeliness of the Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Next, Dr. Mafa complains about the fact that the petition for an order of protection was filed on February 26, 2014, and the final hearing did not commence until October 27, 2014. He cites Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-605, which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   (a) Upon the filing of a petition under this part, the courts may immediately, for good cause shown, issue an ex parte order of protection....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Within fifteen (15) days of service of such order on the respondent\n   </em>\n   under this part,\n   <em>\n    a hearing shall be held\n   </em>\n   , at which time the court shall either dissolve any ex parte order that has been issued, or shall, if the petitioner has proved the allegation of domestic abuse, stalking or sexual assault by a preponderance of the evidence, extend the order of protection for a definite period of time....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Because of the delay in this case, Dr. Mafa contends that the order of protection ultimately entered against him must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Purifoy argues that Dr. Mafa waived his right to complain about the delay because Dr. Mafa or his counsel sought every continuance entered by the court, with the exception of one occasion, when Ms. Purifoy did not subpoena her witnesses due to the withdrawal of Dr. Mafa's attorney. Unfortunately, the record on appeal simply does not reveal the reason for\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   of the continuances entered in this case. After the petition was filed on February 26, 2014, Judge Karen Williams signed the initial ex parte order of protection. A hearing was held just two days later, on February 28, and Dr. Mafa was present with his counsel. Judge Williams entered an order transferring the matter to another division due to the pending defamation suit there, and the hearing was continued until April 4, 2014, to be heard at the same time as a motion previously filed in the pending defamation suit. Judge McCarroll entered a second ex parte order of protection after the hearing on February 28. The pre-printed order of protection form used by the court states that \"You must obey these orders until the date of the hearing or until changes are made by the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the record contains no indication as to whether Dr. Mafa consented\n   or objected to this initial continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   However, the order entered at the next hearing, on April 4, states that the petition for order of protection came before the court and the matter was \"continued at the request of Defendant to 5/30/14[.]\" The order of continuance provided that the ex parte order of protection would remain in place, but a third ex parte order of protection was entered that day. On May 30, another ex parte order was entered, without explanation, directing Dr. Mafa to appear for a hearing on July 17. The petition for order of protection was finally heard before Judge McCarroll on July 17 and 18, but Dr. Mafa requested recusal of Judge McCarroll when the executive director for Memphis Area Legal Services was called to testify as the last witness. As a result, on July 18, 2014, Judge Higgins entered yet another ex parte order of protection by interchange directing Dr. Mafa to return to court on August 29. On August 29, Judge Fields entered an ex parte order of protection requiring the parties to return to court on September 26, 2014. Dr. Mafa's attorney moved to withdraw shortly before the hearing, and Judge Fields granted that request at the beginning of the September 26 hearing. Judge Fields advised the parties that she intended to hold the final hearing within fifteen days, but the attorney who was withdrawing from representing Dr. Mafa indicated that Judge Fields' plan presented a problem for Dr. Mafa due to his attorney's withdrawal. Judge Fields directed Dr. Mafa to obtain a new attorney as soon as possible and prepare for the final hearing on October 13, insisting, \"This thing is going forward on the 13th.\" On October 7, however, Dr. Mafa filed a motion to continue the final hearing for thirty to ninety days to enable him to retain an attorney and conduct discovery. A hearing was held on October 10, 2014, but it was erroneously set on the motion docket, so the case was continued again until October 27. The trial court entered another ex parte order of protection in the meantime. In a motion to recuse that Dr. Mafa filed on October 10, 2014, Dr. Mafa complained, among other things, that Judge Fields \"wants to rush the trial\" without allowing Dr. Mafa to obtain discovery. The final hearing commenced on October 27, as set by Judge Fields, without the thirty to ninety day continuance requested by Dr. Mafa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Obviously, the proceedings in this case were convoluted and not a model for practice. On the other hand, however, Dr. Mafa clearly substantially contributed to the delay by requesting continuances, and he even sought an additional continuance of up to 90 days just before the final hearing. Accordingly, we find it somewhat disingenuous for Dr. Mafa to now complain about the trial court's delay in holding the final hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court considered the order of protection statute's time requirements for such hearings in\n   <em>\n    Kite v.

The legislature apparently inserted this requirement to insure a prompt hearing to determine the validity and necessity of the ex parte relief.\n   <em>\n    When a trial court fails to set a hearing within ten days, the ex parte order expires\n   </em>\n   and the case assumes the posture of a case where no ex parte order of protection has been issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   We think the legislature neither envisioned nor intended the prompt hearing requirement to bar procedurally a domestic abuse victim's access to judicial protection. The prompt hearing requirement limits the potential for abuse by protecting respondents from possible ongoing frivolous or retaliatory ex parte protective orders. The ten day hearing requirement is, therefore,\n   <em>\n    merely a limitation on the duration of an ex parte protective order.\n   </em>\n   Had the legislature intended a complete procedural bar, it could have specifically drafted one.

However, he asserts that this was \"a confidential settlement communication\" that was privileged and inadmissible pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Evidence 408, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   Evidence of (1) furnishing or offering to furnish or (2) accepting or offering to accept a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim, whether in the present litigation or related litigation, which claim was disputed or was reasonably expected to be disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of a civil claim or its amount or a criminal charge or its punishment. Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence actually obtained during discovery merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution; however, a party may not be impeached by a prior inconsistent statement made in compromise negotiations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Tenn. R. Evid. 408. We agree with the trial court's conclusion that Dr. Mafa's demand does not constitute an offer to compromise in the context of a settlement negotiation. Furthermore, the message was not introduced\n   \"to prove liability\" for a claim or charge. It was offered for another purpose - to demonstrate continued harassment and intimidation of Ms. Purifoy within the meaning of the stalking statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   At trial, Dr. Mafa backtracked on the language used in his demand and testified that he did not in fact hire a private investigator to follow Ms. Purifoy. Instead, he testified that he simply directed someone to conduct online research about her. On appeal, he argues that he had a valid right to do this in order to prepare for trial. However, the issue is not whether Dr. Mafa had a legitimate right to conduct online research. The issue, once again, is whether he engaged in a course of conduct of continuing harassment and unconsented contact within the meaning of the stalking statute. The trial court found that Dr. Mafa's message was yet another instance of unconsented contact in an attempt to intimidate and threaten her. We cannot say that the trial court erred in this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     H. Evidence Regarding Police Reports\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   At trial, Dr. Mafa was asked how many times other people had complained that he had made harassing and threatening telephone calls to them. Dr. Mafa responded \"one, maybe two.\" Counsel for Ms. Purifoy then asked Dr. Mafa if he wanted to review the file he had obtained containing numerous police incident reports involving Dr. Mafa and various other individuals. The trial court asked about the extent of the file, and counsel said that he had obtained 36 incident reports involving complaints made by and against Dr. Mafa. The trial judge permitted counsel to ask Dr. Mafa about some of these incidents. With regard to each, Dr. Mafa either said that he did not recall the incident or presented his side of the story. The actual incident reports were not entered into evidence. The trial judge directed counsel to stop his questioning after about twenty incidents. Ultimately, the trial court found that Dr. Mafa had \"extensive contact with the justice system,\" demonstrated by at least 21 past incidents involving police reports. The trial judge observed, \"Basically, he said all these people made all of this up. Everybody makes up everything against him.\" The trial judge ultimately concluded that Dr. Mafa \"is a man who deals in drama. He's paranoid. He truly believes there's a conspiracy, that everyone's out there to get him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   On appeal, Dr. Mafa argues that \"[s]uch impeachment evidence was highly prejudicial, irrelevant to these proceedings and in violation of Tenn. R. Evid. 402, 403, 404, 405 and 608.\" Again, this skeletal argument is insufficient to lead this Court to analyze all of these simply listed Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   However, Dr. Mafa also argues that \"if the evidence is merely that the plaintiff is a chronic litigant with respect to all sorts [of] claims, the courts consider the slight probative value overborne by the countervailing factors. This evidence they usually exclude.\" Dr. Mafa cites only\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Christian Bros.

The easy cases are those in which one of these considerations clearly predominates. If the evidence reveals that a party has made previous, very similar claims and that these claims were fraudulent, then almost universally the evidence will be admissible despite the dangers of distraction and time-consumption with regard to the quality of these other claims, and despite the general prohibition on using evidence of bad character solely to show conduct on a given occasion. At the other pole, if the evidence is merely that the plaintiff is a chronic litigant with respect to all sorts of claims, the courts consider the slight probative value overborne by the countervailing factors.

It is not a vehicle for raising new issues.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    As previously noted, the permanent injunction entered on January 13, 2014, referenced \"testimony of Plaintiff's attorney that notice was sent to Defendant via certified mail and attempts were made via the Sheriff's Office, a private process server, and Defendant [h]as indicated through his own communications that he is aware of this filing (see attachment).\" Dr. Mafa later filed a motion to set aside the injunction order due to lack of service, but his motion sought reinstatement of the temporary injunction rather than dismissal. Before the trial court, Dr. Mafa admitted that he was served with \"the injunction\" in court on February 28, but he claimed that he was never served with \"the original injunction paperwork,\" presumably referring to the defamation complaint. However, Ms. Purifoy testified at the final hearing in this case that Dr. Mafa was served with the defamation complaint on February 28 at court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    To illustrate our earlier point, we note that Dr. Mafa's brief on appeal does not contain any \"due process\" analysis with regard to this issue. After discussing several cases and rules regarding service of process, he simply asserts, \"Because of [Ms.] Purifoy's failure to comply with the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, the Appellant has been denied due process.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-3-604 directs the administrative office of the courts to develop an ex parte order of protection form and provides, \"These forms shall be used exclusively in all courts exercising jurisdiction over orders of protection.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-3-604\">\n     Tenn.
