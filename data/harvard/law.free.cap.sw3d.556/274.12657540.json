The trial court concluded that a homeowner violated the restrictions by operating a business on a residential tract and engaging in multi-family, short-term rentals. The court of appeals affirmed, agreeing with the trial court that the rental agreements contradict the residential-purpose limitation because the renters' stays are merely temporary. We hold that the unambiguous restrictive covenants impose no such limitation and decline to inject restrictions into covenants under the guise of judicial interpretation. Accordingly, summary judgment for the homeowner's association was improper. We reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2012, Kenneth Tarr purchased a single-family home in San Antonio's Timberwood Park subdivision. Two years later, after his employer transferred him to Houston, Tarr began advertising the home for rent on websites such as VRBO (short for Vacation Rentals by Owner).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santa Monica Beach Prop. Owners Ass'n v. Acord\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12363781,12363775\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/219/111/\">\n    219 So.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 n.2 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017) (describing VRBO as \"a website on which owners can advertise their houses and other properties for rent\"). He also formed a limited-liability company called \"Linda's Hill Country Home LLC\" to manage the rental of the home. Between June and October of 2014, Tarr entered into thirty-one short-term rental agreements, ranging from one to seven days each. In the aggregate, the home was rented for 102 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tarr's short-term rental contracts permit various-sized rental parties but limit the guest count to no more than ten people. And the home was indeed leased to parties of all sizes. For example, the home was booked by parties consisting of three adults and three children, four adults and five children, six adults and four children, seven adults and one child, and nine adults and no children. Nearly one quarter of the rentals were to two adults accompanied by as many as six children. The agreement does not mandate that the guests be members of a single family, and the record contains no evidence of the familial relationships of the individuals to whom the home was leased. These rental groups came from towns throughout Texas, as well as other states, such as Washington and Indiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The short-term rental agreement that Tarr employed leased the entire home, rather than individual rooms, to these various groups. So unlike what one might expect at a hotel, rental groups were alone in Tarr's house, unaccompanied by employees and without services a hotel stay might provide, such as cooked meals or housekeeping. In addition, no business office, leasing office, signage, or other business\n   activity exists at the home. But Tarr does remit hotel taxes applicable to home rentals of less than thirty days. Specifically, he pays the Texas Hotel Tax, which applies to such rentals statewide,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE ch. 156, and the San Antonio/Bexar County Hotel/Motel Occupancy Tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The dispute that led to this case arose late in 2014. As reflected in a plat recorded in the Bexar County plat records in 1979, Timberwood Park Unit III, which includes Tarr's property, is subject to certain \"easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions.\" In July and September of 2014, the Timberwood Park Owners Association notified Tarr that the rental of his home violated two deed restrictions: (1) the residential-purpose covenant, and (2) the single-family-residence covenant. The residential-purpose covenant provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All tracts shall be used solely for residential purposes, except tracts designated ... for business purposes, provided, however, no business shall be conducted on any of these tracts which is noxious or harmful by reason of odor, dust, smoke, gas, fumes, noise or vibration ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   No one disputes that Tarr's tract is not designated for business purposes. A separate paragraph sets forth the single-family-residence restriction, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   No building, other than a single family residence containing not less than 1,750 square feet, exclusive of open porches, breezeways, carports and garages, and having not less than 75% of its exterior ground floor walls constructed of masonry, i.e., brick, rock, concrete, or concrete products shall be erected or constructed on any residential tract in Timberwood Park Unit III and no garage may be erected except simultaneously with or subsequent to erection of residence.... All buildings must be completed not later than six (6) months after laying foundations and no structures or house trailers of any kind may be moved on to the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because the leases of Tarr's home were temporary, the association determined short-term rentals did not adhere to the \"single family residence\" restriction and, instead, rendered the tract \"a commercial rental property.\" So the association sent Tarr a violation notification requesting his compliance. The notification further indicated that the violation would remain in effect until the online advertisements were taken down and the home was no longer used for commercial purposes. Should he not comply within fourteen days, the notification letter warned, the association would assess a fine of $25 per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Tarr did not heed the association's warnings. And throughout the dispute, neither the association nor Tarr attempted to amend the deed restrictions to specify a minimum duration for leasing-an option available to both of them under the deed's amendment provisions. Instead, the fines against Tarr mounted steadily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tarr appealed the imposition of the fines to the association's board. The board heard and denied the appeal in September 2014, stating it would continue imposing the fines so long as the violations persisted. Five days after the board sent a letter denying his appeal, Tarr sued for a declaratory judgment and claimed breach of the restrictive covenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Tarr sought a declaration that the deed restrictions do not impose a minimum duration on occupancy or leasing. Nor, Tarr contended, do they permit the association to police home-rental advertisements or impose penalties in the form of fines. The\n   association filed a general denial; both parties sought attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court soon faced competing traditional summary-judgment motions. It granted the association's and denied Tarr's, concluding that Tarr operated a business on his residential lot and engaged in \"multi-family,\" short-term rentals in violation of the unambiguous deed restrictions. In doing so, the trial court noted that it must ascertain the drafters' intent by \"balancing the statutory requirement to liberally construe language within restrictive covenants with the common law mandate to strictly construe restrictive clauses in real estate instruments resolving all doubt in favor of the free use of real estate.\" It reasoned that one's use of a home is not residential unless the occupant is physically present and has an existing intent to physically remain there for a sufficient duration. The trial court also permanently enjoined Tarr from \"operating a business on his residential lot\" and from engaging in short-term rentals to \"multi-family parties.\" In a separate order, the trial court awarded attorney's fees to the association. Tarr appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Fourth Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that the deed restrictions prevented Tarr from leasing the home for short periods of time to individuals who did not possess an intent to remain in the house.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/725/#p730\">\n    510 S.W.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2016). First, the court noted that the intent underlying the covenant at issue must be afforded a liberal construction as it is unambiguous, and thus the rule disfavoring restrictions on the free use of property did not apply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/725/#p730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/725/#p730\">\n    at 729-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court of appeals relied on its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Munson v. Milton\n   </em>\n   , in which it noted that though \"residence\" welcomes a variety of connotations, the term usually mandates both a \"physical presence and an intention to remain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373400\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/725/#p730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373400\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/725/#p730\">\n    at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Munson v.

Accordingly, it distinguished between \"transient\" and \"residential\" purposes on property subject to such restrictive covenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 730-31. And under the facts of this case, especially in light of the short-term rental agreements and Tarr's creation of an LLC to manage the property, as well as his payment of hotel taxes, the court of appeals held the leasing agreements to be in direct contradiction with its residential-purpose test-that the renter intend to remain at the home with a contemporaneous physical presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tarr sought our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A trial court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Joe v.

To prevail on a traditional motion for summary judgment, the movant must show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV.

Lakes of Somerset Homeowners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257399\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/294/#p297\">\n    133 S.W.3d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 2004, pet. denied). Before this Court, Tarr argues that if a deed restriction does not expressly address or restrict a certain property use, that usage must be permitted. Accordingly, short-term rentals must be permitted because the Timberwood Park Unit III's deeds remain silent as to short-term rentals. Tarr further contends that a deed restriction forbidding business purposes and permitting only residential purposes does not alter the permissibility of renting property in Timberwood for short durations of time. Meanwhile, the association interprets the restrictive covenants as prohibiting owners from using their tracts for any purpose other than single-family, residential use, which does not encompass Tarr's short-term rentals as that is a business, transient, multi-family use. It employs a \"liberal\" reading of the covenants and reasons that short-term rentals are not residential because the individuals occupying the home do not satisfy the definition of \"residence\" that it advances: physical presence for a substantial period of time coupled with an intent to remain. Both parties, however, maintain that the restrictive covenants they rely on are unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties arrive at their divergent interpretations of the restrictive covenants by employing different mechanisms to give effect to the drafters' intent. In Tarr's view, restrictive covenants must be strictly construed as they historically were at common law. The association contends, on the other hand, that the legislature superseded the common-law rule when it adopted Texas Property Code section 202.003(a), calling for restrictive covenants to be liberally construed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"A 'restrictive covenant' is a negative covenant that limits permissible uses of land.\" RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF PROP.: SERVITUDES \u00a7 1.3(3) ( AM.

H.B. 356, 70th Leg., R.S. (1987). Among its provisions was a rule of construction, now codified at Texas Property Code section 202.003 : \"A restrictive covenant shall be liberally construed to give effect to its purposes and intent.\" Act\n   of June 1, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch. 712, \u00a7 1, 1987 Gen.

CODE \u00a7 202.002(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With Texas Property Code section 202.003(a)'s promulgation, courts suddenly had extreme \"difficulty in ascertaining and declaring the controlling general principles of the law,\"\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8270760\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw/171/270/#p272\">\n    171 S.W. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because they began to question whether this legislative enactment was an attempt to contravene our long-adhered-to common-law standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnson,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 368, 372. And, unfortunately, \"the legislature provided no explanation as to the motivations or necessity for ... change\" to help guide our courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 370. As a result, Texas' courts of appeals have grappled \"with the varying standards established by the passage of section 202.003 and the historical common-law rules of construction\" but \"have been unable to determine any uniform standard for interpreting ambiguous restrictive covenants.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 371-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thirty-one years after the statute's enactment, our courts remain immersed in this debate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And as in those courts, the parties here dispute what standard controls our analysis. Unsurprisingly, Tarr contends that section 202.003(a) did not alter the judicial restraint courts have historically exercised when interpreting covenants, so he advances that the common-law strict-construction requirement still governs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, the association argues\n   that the statute trumps the common-law approach and that section 202.003(a) should be applied to covenants that succumb to the pitfalls of ambiguity. So, although the association contends that the deed restrictions are unambiguous, it argues in the alternative that even if they are ambiguous, section 202.003(a) should still govern this Court's review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We have not yet deliberated section 202.003(a)'s effect, if any, on the construction principles we have long employed to interpret restrictive covenants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor do we\n   reach that decision today. We don't have to reconcile any potential conflict between section 202.003(a) and the common-law principles-or whether those common-law standards can ever again be appropriately employed-because our conclusion today would be the same regardless of which interpretative standard prevails. As explained below, the covenants at issue unambiguously fail to address the property use complained of in this case. No construction, no matter how liberal, can construe a property restriction into existence when the covenant is silent as to that limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A day may come when we must choose between strictly or liberally construing restrictive covenants. But it is not this day. So we proceed to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Pertaining to the trial court's \"multi-family\" use holding, the association argues that the covenants prohibit the use of tracts in the subdivision for any purpose other than single-family residences and for residential purposes. And it maintains the trial court properly concluded that Tarr's use violated the \"single-family, residential purpose\" restriction because he has leased to parties who are not members of a single family. In response, Tarr argues that the single-family restriction simply limits the type of structure allowed rather than restricting use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In arguing that the deeds impose a single-family, residential-use restriction, the association has combined two separate covenants. Paragraph one of the Timberwood Park Unit III subdivision's deeds provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   1. All tracts shall be used solely for residential purposes, except tracts designated on the above mentioned plat for business purposes, provided, however, no business shall be conducted on any of these tracts which is noxious or harmful\n   by reason of odor, dust, smoke, gas fumes, noise or vibration ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That covenant does not set forth any provisions pertaining to single-family uses or residences. Instead, that limitation is imposed by paragraph three:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   3. No building, other than a single family residence containing not less than 1,750 square feet, exclusive of open porches, breezeways, carports and garages, and having not less than 75% of its exterior ground floor walls constructed of masonry, i.e., brick, rock, concrete, or concrete products shall be erected or constructed on any residential tract ... and no garage may be erected except simultaneously with or subsequent to erection of residence. No less than a 300 lb. per square asphalt or fiberglass shingle shall be used in any construction in Timberwood Park Unit III.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although the association is correct that the deeds mention both single-family residences and mandate a residential purpose, to combine those provisions into one mega-restriction is a bit of a stretch. Both the context in which those provisions arise and the case law construing similar covenants demonstrate that those restrictions must be read as separate and distinct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In discerning the drafters' intent, courts must \"consider whether the covenant's restrictions apply to the use of the building or to the nature of the physical structure\" to be erected on the property. Thomas F. Guernsey,\n   <em>\n    The Mentally Retarded and Private Restrictive Covenants\n   </em>\n   , 25 WM. &amp; MARY L. REV. 421, 426 (1984). Accordingly, courts have often distinguished between\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   restrictions and\n   <em>\n    structural\n   </em>\n   restrictions and have declined to conflate the two.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    1733 Estates\n   </em>\n   , 485 N.W.2d at 340-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Stephenson v.

So, we continued, where tracts are limited to residential uses, the covenants require merely that the property be used for \"living purposes\"; they did not also impart a prohibition against duplex or apartment housing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 955 (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   's holding is particularly relevant in this case as it came just three years before the Timberwood deeds were recorded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pilarcik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833909\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/966/474/#p478\">\n    966 S.W.2d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring courts to \"examine the covenants as a whole in light of the circumstances present when the parties entered the agreement\");\n   <em>\n    Wilmoth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9983220\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/734/656/#p658\">\n    734 S.W.2d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (giving \"words used in the restrictive covenant ... the meaning which they commonly held as of the date the covenant was written, and not as of some subsequent date\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Permian Basin Centers for Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation v.

In that case, the court of appeals interpreted separate covenants, one of which provided the tracts \"shall be known and described as residential lots, except[ ] ... [those] designated as commercial lots.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 775. The second paragraph provided: \"No structures shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any residential building plot other than one detached single-family dwelling, not to exceed two stories in height[ ] ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court held that \"single-family dwelling\" referred \"only to the type of structure that may be built on the property,\" which was the interpretation that was \"more reasonable and more in keeping with what was intended by the original grantor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776. It analyzed the two different paragraphs as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The paragraph in which the term \"single-family dwelling\" appears deals with the character of structures that may be\n   \"erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any residential building plot.\" There is no mention in this or any other paragraph of the covenant that seeks to impose a single-family occupancy requirement. The only \"use\" provisions in the covenant distinguish between commercial and residential use and prohibit the use of outbuildings as residences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded the restrictive covenant \"limits the use of the property to residential purposes, and the term 'single-family dwelling' limits the residential use to single-family structures-that is, homes designed for single families as opposed to duplexes or apartment buildings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 777.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Likewise, the limitations in Tarr's deeds are set forth in separate paragraphs that speak to distinct restrictions. Like the covenants in\n   <em>\n    Permian Basin\n   </em>\n   , paragraph three of the Timberwood deed describes structural or architectural limitations by specifying that the building \"erected or constructed\" upon a tract must be a \"single family residence,\" specifying the minimum square footage of such a building, and the materials of which it shall be constructed. The only instance in which the deed imposes the single-family restriction is in this structural limitation. Conversely, paragraph one speaks to how owners in the subdivision may permissibly use their property. It limits their use to \"residential purposes\" as contradistinguished from \"business purposes.\" It remains silent as to whether so-called \"multi-family\" use is permitted. Other use provisions in the deed-which speak to dumping garbage and breeding animals on tracts, for example-also fail to restrict owners' use to single-family purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We cannot ignore the context in which these limitations are imposed and conflate the two paragraphs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boatner v.

So Tarr juxtaposes activities such as eating, sleeping, praying, and watching TV with activities such as blacksmithing, shop-tending, event-hosting, and automobile repair. In addition, Tarr refutes that duration of use can be considered in conjunction with the character of the use; \"residential purposes\" does not in and of itself differentiate between owner occupancy and tenant occupancy or imply duration limits on either. As for the \"business purpose\" prohibition in the covenant, Tarr contends that merely renting one's property or realizing a profit therefrom does not convert a homeowner's use into a business use. And if it did, he argues, then long-term leasing arrangements would likewise be forbidden. Because these covenants often remain silent as to the minimum amount of time one must use a home for it to qualify as a residential use, Tarr questions the soundness of cases that impose ninety-day limitations, require physical, permanent occupancy, or examine an intent to remain. Instead, Tarr urges this Court to conclude that because the covenants are silent as to leasing arrangements or minimum-duration-of-use requirements, such activities are permissible-as what is not expressly proscribed is allowed. This construction, Tarr insists, best effectuates the original grantor's purpose and intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The association, on the other hand, focuses on the transient and temporary nature of Tarr's renters' use of the property. Because the tenants have no intent to remain beyond the short term for which they have leased the property, their use is merely transient as opposed to residential. To support this definition of \"residential,\" the association relies upon various Texas and federal regulatory definitions of \"residence.\" So the association not only contrasts \"residential purpose[s]\" with \"business purposes,\" but also with \"transient purposes.\" And as proof that Tarr's use is a business use, the association notes that he pays hotel taxes and that he formed an LLC to manage the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As noted above, when interpreting a restrictive covenant, courts must first determine whether the covenant is ambiguous by looking to the \"covenant[ ] as a whole in light of the circumstances present when\n   the parties entered the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Pilarcik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833909\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/966/474/#p478\">\n    966 S.W.2d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But one must inquire whether the covenant's language focuses upon the owner's use of the property or upon the activity that actually takes place on the land. If the suitable probe is how the owner is using the property, Tarr could be said to have violated the provision by establishing an LLC and generating income from his property. We note, however, the covenant here provides that the tract \"shall be used solely for residential purposes, except tracts designated ... for business purposes, provided, however, no business shall be conducted on any of these tracts which is noxious or harmful.\" By referring to the activities \"conducted\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   \" the tracts, the covenant expressly makes the relevant inquiry the conduct taking place on the physical property itself (as opposed to how the owner is using the property).

In fact, the courts seem to have had no special difficulty in ascertaining and declaring the controlling general principles of the law, but, in their application to concrete facts, it may well be said that the decisions are in hopeless conflict and confusion, and individual cases are without value as precedents, except as general principles are recognized and declared.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    One court described the hesitation in electing which standard to utilize as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    Some courts of appeals have recognized that the common-law requirement of construing restrictions strictly and section 202.003(a)'s requirement of construing residential covenants liberally to effectuate their purposes and intent might appear contradictory.

In contrast, other courts of appeals, including ours, have concluded that there is no discernable conflict between the common law and section 202.003(a).

Some of these courts, including ours, have simply continued to apply the common-law rule without a precise explanation of how to reconcile it with section 202.003(a). Other courts of appeals have held that the common-law rule applies only when there is an ambiguity concerning the drafter's intent, but to determine if such an ambiguity exists, these courts first apply section 202.003(a)'s liberal-construction mandate.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    Finally, ... some courts of appeals since 1987 have simply continued applying the common-law strict-construction rule without referring to section 202.003(a) at all.

In addition, he raises concerns pertaining to ambiguity, constitutionality, and homeowners' autonomy. First, Tarr notes that none of the appellate decisions \"explain what 'liberal' means.\" Thus, he argues the statute's use of that term is ambiguous. And he posits that the statute may be unconstitutionally vague as it may violate due process if and when it subjects property owners to unfair enforcement actions. This is so because what constitutes a \"liberal\" reading of a covenant is too subjective and can potentially deprive an owner of their freedom to make certain uses of their property. In an attempt to illustrate this point, Tarr notes that when purchasing a parcel subject to a residential-use limitation, the buyer would not be able to discern restrictions on their ability to rent the property and the applicable minimum duration of that lease. But he concedes the constitutionality issue may not be ripe for review, so we do not analyze that contention.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     San Antonio Gen.

Finally, Tarr argues that any questions about how restrictions are to be applied should be left to the members of homeowners' associations who can amend their property restrictions. To liberally construe deed restrictions in a way that expands the restrictions' reach and that impairs the free use of property would usurp the property owners' power to self-govern. Such a usurpation, Tarr argues, diminishes both the owners' property rights and their freedom to contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Notably, this contravenes many courts' approaches.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Highlands Mgmt.

Holding otherwise, the court recognized, would mean that unless property owners use their property \"as their primary residences,\" they would be violating similar covenants, even where the owners themselves use the residence as a vacation home.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Consequently, the court decided that \"the term 'residential purposes' does not mean only 'occupying of a premises for the purpose of making it one's usual place of abode.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Moreover, although Tarr did generate revenue off his property in Timberwood, we also agree with our sister courts nationwide and hold that Tarr did not violate the covenants solely by receiving income from using his property to facilitate his short-term-rental endeavor. However, because the relevant inquiry, under this specific covenant, is the activity taking place on the lot itself, this decision might differ if Tarr furthered his profit-generating-venture on the Timberwood tract itself. As the Alabama court explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n    [N]o mercantile or similar activity occurs at the cabin. The actual renting of the cabin, and any financial transactions associated therewith, occurs off-site. The [owners] do not solicit renters on-site, but do so through the Internet, where potential tenants can view the premises without actually going there. While occupying the cabin, the tenants must cook and clean for themselves and they do not receive any services from the [owners.] Although the [owners] remit a lodging tax, ... that fact does not detract from the conclusion that no commercial activity takes place on the premises.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <em>\n     Slaby\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013145\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/100/569/#p579\">\n     100 So.3d at 580\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Other state courts have measured the commercial or business purposes, when defined in contradistinction to residential purposes, by examining whether the use involved employees or other indicia of business on the tract itself.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Santa Monica\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12363781,12363775\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/219/111/\">\n     219 So.3d at 115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (distinguishing another case that involved an inn that \"had a number of indicia of a business, such [as] a manager to 'control the guests,' signs located on the property advertising it as a 'Bed and Breakfast Inn,' and five bedrooms each with a separate entrance to the outside of the structure\"). Here, there is no evidence that Tarr makes any commercial use upon the tracts themselves, and he concedes that were he to establish a leasing office or similar indicia of business, his property use would then violate the Timberwood covenants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
