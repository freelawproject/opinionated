(\"Rescue Concepts\"), to produce to real party in interest Jones Lang LaSalle Texas, Inc. (\"JLL\") communications between Rescue Concepts' representatives and Jacqueline Lucci Smith, a licensed attorney who negotiated the sale on Rescue Concepts' behalf. In its petition for writ of mandamus, Rescue Concepts asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in \"ruling that email correspondence between an attorney, Jacqueline Lucci Smith, and her client, Rescue Concepts, Inc., was not privileged and ordering all emails produced without redactions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   JLL, the firm that provided brokerage services to the attempted buyer of the Property, HouReal Corporation (\"HouReal\"), through JLL's agent James Peacock, argues in part that: (1) the trial court's determination regarding whether the attorney-client privilege applied is entitled to deference because it presented \" 'conflicting evidence' if not conclusive evidence\n   that no attorney-client relationship existed\" between Smith and Rescue Concepts; and (2) the trial court properly exercised its discretion in reviewing the communications in camera and refusing to apply the attorney-client privilege. Because we conclude that, as a matter of law, an attorney-client relationship existed between Smith and Rescue Concepts and the communications in question were confidential communications made to facilitate the rendition of professional legal services, we conditionally grant the writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rescue Concepts provides emergency response training to military personnel and other first responders. It conducts its business, including firearms training, on a parcel of real property in Liberty County (the \"Property\"). Due to increased development in the area, the Property was no longer ideal for Rescue Concepts' business purposes, and it received unsolicited offers to purchase the Property. Rescue Concepts decided to retain the services of Jacqueline Lucci Smith, an attorney who had previously represented Rescue Concepts in other matters, to help it negotiate a sale of the Property and to provide advice regarding various legal concerns relevant to such a transaction. Smith is not a real estate broker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rescue Concepts and Smith executed a letter of engagement \"for legal representation related to the negotiation and sale of property owned by Rescue Concepts, Inc.\" paying Smith a \"contingency of 3% of the gross sales price,\" as an unqualified promise to pay. Under the \"Scope of Employment\" section, Smith's representation was limited to \"the negotiation and sale of the property\" as Rescue Concepts' \"exclusive and only agent regarding the property.\" Under the \"Withdrawal or Termination\" section, Smith's \"representation in this matter\" is described as \"an exclusive listing agreement.\" The letter also contained boilerplate language: Smith's firm expressed opinions, not guarantees, including \"the value of the property\"; Smith would determine fees \"in accordance with the American Bar Association and the Texas Rules of Professional Conduct\"; Smith would notify Rescue Concepts of the \"Texas State Bar Grievance Process\"; Smith would retain client files; and Smith thanked Rescue Concepts \"for the opportunity to provide [it] legal services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Among other services provided pursuant to this engagement letter, Smith represented Rescue Concepts in its negotiations with HouReal for the purchase of the Property. HouReal was represented by Stephen Peacock, its president and a real estate broker employed by JLL, a real estate brokerage and advice firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Eventually, Rescue Concepts and HouReal entered into a contract for the sale of the Property in which HouReal was to buy the Property from Rescue Concepts for $12 million by the closing date of January 7, 2015. The parties used the \"Commercial Contract-Unimproved Property\" form issued by the Texas Association of Realtors as a contract template, although Smith made some modifications to this form. Under the \"Brokers\" designation of the form contract, Smith's law firm, Lucci Smith Law, PLLC, was listed as Rescue Concepts' \"Principal Broker\" and Smith was listed as Rescue Concepts' \"Agent.\" JLL was listed as HouReal's \"Cooperating Broker\" and Peacock was listed as HouReal's \"Agent.\" Rescue Concepts' vice president and part owner, Melanie Liska, signed the contract for Rescue Concepts. Peacock signed the contract for HouReal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached\n   to the contract was an addendum of eight new provisions, including a confidentiality agreement and permitted exceptions to encumbrances and easements, which Smith drafted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The sale never closed. HouReal sued Rescue Concepts for breach of contract. Relevant here, Rescue Concepts counterclaimed for breach of contract and fraud, and it sued JLL and Peacock for fraud as well. Rescue Concepts alleged that HouReal breached the contract by failing to tender the balance of the earnest money and that HouReal, Peacock, and JLL knowingly misrepresented HouReal's ability to purchase the Property during the negotiation of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Smith continued to represent Rescue Concepts as the parties proceeded to mediation and later stages of the litigation. During the discovery period, JLL made two requests for production relevant here. It requested \"[a]ll communications between Jacqueline Lucci Smith and [Rescue Concepts] regarding the Property\" and \"[a]ll communications between Jacqueline Lucci Smith and [Rescue Concepts] regarding negotiations with Peacock.\" JLL asserted that it needed the requested communications to defend against Rescue Concepts' fraud claim because Peacock's representations were communicated to Rescue Concepts only through Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties understood these emails to include those sent both during the negotiation period for the sale of the Property-during which Smith sent numerous emails relaying information regarding the negotiations and addressing issues regarding the proposed financial and contractual terms-and after negotiations for the sale of the Property had ceased and litigation for breach of contract and fraud was imminent. During that time, Rescue Concepts and Smith discussed retention of counsel for litigation, injunctive relief, and mediation. Rescue Concepts objected to JLL's requests for production on the basis of attorney-client and work product privilege, and it later served a privilege log detailing the \"To,\" \"From,\" \"Subject,\" and \"Received Date\" fields along with the privilege asserted for each disputed email. JLL did not challenge Rescue Concepts' assertion of privilege at this time, and discovery continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the close of discovery and less than three weeks before the case's trial setting, JLL moved to compel production of the requested communications between Rescue Concepts and Smith. JLL argued that the requested communications were not privileged because they were made while Smith was performing services as a real estate broker, not as a lawyer. JLL supported its motion with a copy of the contract between Rescue Concepts and HouReal, which, JLL noted, identified Smith as Rescue Concepts' broker. In a subsequent motion, JLL further claimed that Rescue Concepts had waived the privilege under the offensive-use doctrine by asserting fraud claims based on Peacock's allegedly fraudulent statements. JLL requested that the trial court inspect the withheld communications in camera to determine whether they were privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rescue Concepts responded by amending its objections and responses, and it re-asserted its attorney-client privilege. Rescue Concepts attached to its response its engagement letter agreement with Smith's law firm; affidavits from Smith and Rescue Concepts' vice president, Melanie Liska; and various emails between and among Smith, Peacock, and third parties, including an email in which Peacock introduced Smith to a third party as Rescue Concepts' attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In her affidavit regarding the nature of the relationship between her and Rescue Concepts, Smith averred that she was hired as Rescue Concepts' attorney both because of her prior representation of the company in other matters and \"ongoing legal issues involved in re-platting [the Property], rumors of additional pipelines in the area and other legal issues impacting its Property and business.\" Smith averred that she negotiated contract terms and advised Rescue Concepts as to the legal ramifications of various contract provisions or conditions during the negotiations. Smith also averred that she identified herself as Rescue Concepts' attorney throughout her negotiations with Peacock, that Peacock had introduced Smith to a third party as Rescue Concepts' attorney, and that Peacock had on at least one occasion sought legal advice from her-advice that she refused to give on the basis of her attorney-client relationship with Rescue Concepts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Liska averred that Rescue Concepts retained Smith because she had regularly represented Rescue Concepts in other matters and was familiar with both the Property and Rescue Concepts' business generally. Because of Smith's prior representation of Rescue Concepts, Liska stated that Smith's \"specialized legal knowledge and skill\" allowed her to \"analyze negotiations from both a legal and commercial perspective.\" For those reasons, Liska said in her affidavit that Smith was hired \"not as a real estate broker, but as a lawyer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on the motion to compel and determined that Smith was \"wearing more than one hat\" or rendering \"hybrid\" representation by providing both legal and non-legal services. The trial court opined that only those communications \"between the lawyer and the client for the purpose of rendering legal services\" were protected by attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the trial court ordered Rescue Concepts to produce the communications for an in camera inspection: \"The only way I know how to sort that out is for me to look at them. I don't know any other way to do that. So that's what I'm going to order. Produce them in camera.\" Additionally, Smith offered and delivered to JLL some redacted emails responsive to its request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After inspecting the communications in camera, the trial court found that none of the communications were privileged and ordered that they be produced. Rescue Concepts moved for reconsideration and for leave to provide additional evidence in support of the privilege assertion. This evidence included a survey of the Property, the Certificate of Formation of Lucci Smith Law, PLLC, excerpts from the Texas Board of Legal Specialization Standard for Attorney Certification in the area of real estate law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a second affidavit\n   from Smith describing the legal tasks she undertook on behalf of Rescue Concepts. The trial court granted both the motion for reconsideration and the motion to supplement evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, Smith detailed legal tasks she performed during her representation and related her fear that, during her impending deposition, she could not assert privilege on oral communications with Rescue Concepts. Smith asserted that, as additional legal tasks, she prepared a 1031 IRS exchange document, was clearing the Property of invalid liens, as required by the contract, and was replatting the Property to expand the pipeline corridor at HouReal's request. Smith suggested the disputed emails related to this work. And, Smith asserted, the post-negotiation communications included Smith's preparations for mediation, which were also legal services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court responded to Smith's concerns by indicating that only the reviewed documents were not protected by privilege: \"The only thing I've done and the only thing it was my intention to do was to determine that as to the documents that were produced in camera, in my view, are not protected by privilege.\" While the trial court did not vacate its prior privilege ruling, the trial court stayed the effect of the ruling so that Rescue Concepts could file a petition for writ of mandamus. Rescue Concepts timely filed this petition seeking to vacate the order compelling the production of disputed emails between Smith and Rescue Concepts concerning the real estate transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, available only when the relator can show both that: (1) the trial court clearly abused its discretion or violated a duty imposed by law; and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319355\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/341/360/#p364\">\n    341 S.W.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364 (Tex. 2011) (orig. proceeding).

Specifically, it presented its letter of engagement in which it retained Smith \"for legal representation related to the negotiation and sale\" of the Property in exchange for a \"contingency [fee] of 3% of the gross sales price.\" Under the \"Scope of Employment\" section, Smith's representation was limited to \"the negotiation and sale of the property\" as Rescue Concepts' \"exclusive and only agent regarding the property.\" The letter of engagement also included language indicating the Smith's fees were determined \"in accordance with the American Bar Association and the Texas Rules of Professional Conduct\"; notifying Rescue Concepts of the \"Texas State Bar Grievance Process\"; and thanking Rescue Concepts \"for the opportunity to provide [it] legal services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rescue Concepts also presented the affidavits of both Smith and Liska. Liska averred that Rescue Concepts had retained Smith to perform legal services on other occasions and that it retained her because of her legal expertise and prior knowledge of Rescue Concepts' business needs. Liska stated that Rescue Concepts had relied on Smith throughout its attempts to sell the Property, not as a real estate broker, but as a lawyer. Liska further stated that if Rescue Concepts had wanted a real estate broker and not a lawyer to handle the sale of the Property, Rescue Concepts would not have hired Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Smith averred that she was a licensed attorney, but she was not licensed as a real estate broker or agent. Rescue Concepts retained her in her capacity as an attorney to negotiate on its behalf and to advise it of the legal ramifications involved in transferring and developing the Property. Specifically, Smith averred that she had previously provided legal services to Rescue Concepts \"in relation to pipeline condemnation matters, to re-plat the Property for a pipeline corridor, and to negotiate the lease of an aerial easement for a security monitoring camera, to name a few.\" Smith further stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   While in the process of re-platting the Property, [Rescue Concepts] began receiving unsolicited offers to purchase the 300-acre tract. Due to ongoing legal issues involved in re-platting, rumors of additional pipelines in the area and other legal issues impacting its Property and business, [Rescue Concepts] requested [that Smith's firm] represent it in all matters relating to the sale of the Property. [Rescue Concepts] received calls from brokers offering to list the property, but [Rescue Concepts] chose to retain [Smith's firm] as its lawyer because of my knowledge of the business and property, to assist in legal issues relating to the sale and act as counselor for [Rescue Concepts] in connection with the sale. I prepared an engagement letter which complied with the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and understood that I was retained to provide legal services in\n   relation to the sale of the Property. I did not agree to act as a broker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As part of her representation of Rescue Concepts, Smith averred that she \"negotiated the terms of a contract for sale of the property\"; that she \"regularly communicated with [her] client regarding the legal implications of the ongoing negotiations\"; and that she provided \"legal analysis of certain provisions or conditions being negotiated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to both Smith's and Liska's affidavits setting out their intent to have formed an attorney-client relationship, Rescue Concepts presented evidence in the form of emails, including one sent by Peacock, in which Smith was referred to as Rescue Concepts' attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Thus, looking objectively at what the parties said and did, Rescue Concepts presented evidence that Smith agreed to render professional legal services to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314394\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/365/70/#p79\">\n    365 S.W.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

JLL argues that Smith's emails regarding the negotiation and the sale of the Property did not constitute \"the rendition of professional legal services when no actual legal advice is given.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Contrary to its assertion, JLL has failed to identify any evidence controverting the existence of an attorney-client relationship between Smith and Rescue Concepts. It has presented no evidence that Smith acted only as a real estate broker. It presented no evidence rebutting the statements of both Smith and Rescue Concepts' representatives that they had formed an attorney client relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, JLL points to statements within Smith's engagement letter indicating that the \"scope of employment\" included the \"negotiation\" of a sale in exchange for a fee of 3% of the gross sales price, arguing that brokers may negotiate the sale of property. JLL also points to language in the engagement contract indicating Smith was hired as \"an\n   exclusive listing agent for the subject real property,\" not as an attorney. For example, the engagement contract stated that Smith's firm was the \"exclusive and only agent regarding the property\" and that the firm's \"representation in this matter is an exclusive listing agreement.\" Finally, JLL points to the fact that the sale contract between HouReal and Rescue Concepts listed Smith as Rescue Concepts' \"broker\" under the section addressing the payment of fees pursuant to the sale of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   These arguments by JLL ignore the nature of the services that Smith provided to Rescue Concepts. Specifically, they ignore the distinction between an attorney-who is authorized as a licensed attorney to perform virtually all of the services a broker can perform-and a real estate broker-who may not perform any of the services that require a licensed attorney. As demonstrated by the affidavits and the documents themselves, Smith provided advice regarding contract terms and matters related to litigation that fall within the scope of professional duties of attorneys but outside the scope of work that brokers are authorized to perform. As JLL argues, attorney-client privilege does not apply to communications between a client and an attorney if an attorney is employed in a non-legal capacity.\n   <em>\n    Harlandale Indep. Sch.

Smith and Rescue Concepts consistently represented that Smith was acting as Rescue Concepts' attorney and other parties, including Peacock-a broker working for JLL and a principal of HouReal, the potential buyer-understood that Smith was acting as Rescue Concepts' attorney. The fact that the sale agreement listed Smith as Rescue Concepts' \"broker\" for purposes of collecting the fee provided for by their engagement letter does not change the general nature of the relationship between Smith and Rescue Concepts.

The documents that the trial court reviewed in camera and determined were not privileged included messages to Smith from third parties that Smith then forwarded to representatives of Rescue Concepts with minimal commentary. These documents were labeled as RESCUE CONCEPTS INC. (PRIV. FORWARD)-000001-112. The record indicates that Rescue Concepts produced these documents to JLL with Smith's comments redacted. To the extent that the trial court's order requires Rescue Concepts to provide unredacted copies of these emails disclosing Smith's comments to her client, the order violates Rescue Concept's attorney-client privilege. Smith's comments were made directly to her client, were not intended to be disclosed to third parties, and were made for the purpose of facilitating her rendition of professional legal services to Rescue Concepts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

(PRIV. REDACTED BUYERS)-000001-10, and privileged documents that contain other sensitive information for which Rescue Concepts proposed additional redaction, referred to as RESCUE CONCEPTS INC. (PRIV. REDACT OTHER)-000001-11. Finally the documents reviewed in camera and ordered produced by the trial court include communications between Smith and Rescue Concepts that Rescue Concepts asserts fall under the attorney-client relationship in their entirety. These documents are referred to as RESCUE CONCEPTS INC. (PRIV. IN CAMERA)-000001-133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   These various communications took place during ongoing negotiations between Rescue Concepts and HouReal, which was represented by Peacock. In them, Smith discussed and forwarded contract terms and figures, while signing emails with her firm's signature block. Smith sent other emails concerning Rescue Concepts' options in adding specific provisions to its contract with HouReal. After negotiations had broken down and litigation was imminent, representatives of Rescue Concepts and Smith discussed retention of counsel for litigation, injunctive relief, and mediation. Thus, following our own in camera review, we conclude that the disputed emails were communications that were intended to be confidential and that were made between an attorney and her client for the purposes of providing professional legal services related the negotiation and sale of the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
