Lee, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a direct appeal of a disciplinary proceeding involving a Memphis attorney who filed motions to recuse containing pejorative statements about three appellate judges. A hearing panel of the Board of Professional Responsibility found that the attorney had violated multiple Rules of Professional Conduct and that his sanction should be a public censure. The trial court agreed that the attorney was guilty of misconduct but modified the hearing panel's decision, determining that the appropriate sanction was a six-month suspension, with thirty days served on active suspension and the remainder on probation. We hold that the attorney's pejorative statements in the motions to recuse were not protected by the First Amendment and there was material and substantial evidence of noncompliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct. In addition, we hold that the hearing panel acted arbitrarily\n   and capriciously in determining that the attorney should receive a public censure rather than suspension. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This disciplinary action arises from pejorative statements made by attorney Larry E. Parrish in motions to recuse three judges on the Tennessee Court of Appeals after an adverse decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Parrish represented David Morrow and Judy Wright, the nephew and niece of Helen Goza, regarding a trust Ms. Goza had established for her son, John Goza. Under the terms of the trust, any assets remaining in the trust after the death of Mr. Goza were to be disbursed to various charities. After Mr. Goza's death, Mr. Parrish, on behalf of Mr. Morrow and Ms. Wright, filed an action in the Shelby County Chancery Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the trust was not valid and that they were entitled to the trust's remaining assets. The chancery court granted summary judgment, finding that the trust was valid. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Morrow v.

Mr. Parrish, representing the Estate and Mr. Morrow as administrator, filed a petition in probate court to require SunTrust Bank to turn over to the Estate the assets of the trust based on the asserted invalidity of the trust. Soon after, the Court of Appeals issued its ruling in\n   <em>\n    Goza I\n   </em>\n   , affirming the validity of the trust. SunTrust Bank then asserted that the probate case was barred by res judicata. The probate court denied the petition on that basis, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Goza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093834\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/397/564/\">\n    397 S.W.3d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn.

The circuit court dismissed that action, finding that the validity of the trust was res judicata and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court in a memorandum opinion\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   authored by Judge David Farmer and joined by Judge Steven Stafford and (then)-Judge Holly Kirby. The Court of Appeals also determined the appeal was frivolous and awarded SunTrust Bank its attorney's fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Goza v.

I, Section 17 (open courts), thereby, engaging in judicial misconduct which requires Judge Farmer's recusal. The same judicial misconduct violates the procedural and substantive due process rights of Estate and the heirs guaranteed by the\n   <em>\n    United States Constitution\n   </em>\n   , Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 There is absolutely no way under the sun for Estate to fail to prevail in the instant appeal, except by judges deciding the appeal to turn a deaf ear and blind eye to the clearest possible provisions of \u00a7 35-15-203.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Judge Farmer has victimized Estate by saying of a statute, i.e.\n   <em>\n    Tennessee Code Annotated\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35-15-203, that it divests circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction, even though a person minimally literate in the English language could very easily read the statute and know, without hesitation, that the statute does exactly the opposite.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 This is an aberrant misstatement of clear law known to Judge Farmer....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Placing the subject erroneous\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   in Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion, in practical effect, is a prejudgment designed to prejudice Estate in cases not before Judge Farmer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Additionally, the erroneous\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   in Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion is a setup, i.e., the point is to forewarn Estate not to exercise its right to an appeal in the case where the erroneous\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   is dispositive and, if Estate exercises Estate's right to appeal, Judge Farmer is poised to punish Estate for not heeding Judge Farmer's forewarnings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Though it takes slightly more acumen than minimal literacy in the English Language, any person trained in the law and minimally versed in how the law treats\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    obiter dictum\n   </em>\n   , at once, can see that the court of appeals never before has \"held\" or \"decided\" that the putative trust exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The repeated statements in Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion that the court of appeals, twice before, \"held\" or \"decided\" that the putative trust exists, for Judge Farmer, is a convenient and illegitimately purposeful fabrication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 In an effort to provide a fa\u00e7ade of legitimacy to Judge Farmer's inclusion about the putative trust, Judge Farmer builds a construct on the false presupposition that \u00a7 35-15-203 divests circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction, if the putative trust exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The illegitimate purpose for Judge Farmer injecting commentary into Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion on the subject of the putative trust is to prejudge, erroneously, if (which is certain to occur) the issue is presented to the court of appeals in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 By use of a memorandum opinion, Judge Farmer insulates his manipulation/rigging of the legal system from review by the Tennessee Supreme Court, i.e., the Supreme Court, even moreso [sic] than in the past, reiterates that it is not an error-correcting court. Therefore, a memorandum opinion, which has zero effect on Tennessee law, has zero chance of being reviewed by the Supreme Court. Knowing this, Judge Farmer is confident that Judge Farmer's patent error and abuse of Judge Farmer's judicial power will remain effective to accomplish Judge Farmer's illegitimate objectives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Judge Farmer has done a masterful job of covering up the fact that Judge Farmer has stepped out of Judge Farmer's role as an even-handed Judge and into the role of adversary of the Estate, willing to abuse the power of his judicial office to deny Estate's access to unexceptional organic law of Tennessee well-known to Judge Farmer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Many authors, among them Alfred Lord Tennyson, have observed that the half-truth is the most sinister of all deception. The point is that sprinkling into deception particles of truth, misused and taken out of context, makes it much harder to detect deception than a straight out misstatement of objective fact. Judge Farmer has used the half-truth in constructing Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion. Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion is a patchwork of snippets of truth glued together by adhesive design to close to Estate access to controlling organic law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 It is the contention of appellant, the Estate of John J. Goza, Deceased (hereinafter \"Estate\"), as a litigant in the instant appeal and in related proceedings, has been and continues to be denied access to the benefit of\n   the organic law of Tennessee by a demonstrated bias and/or appearance of bias, seemingly anchored in Judge Farmer's personal sympathies/sensitivities that dictate an outcome inconsistent with Tennessee's organic law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Let it be clear that Estate finds no fault with Judge Farmer's personal sympathies/sensitivities. The fault Estate finds is in Judge Farmer permitting his personal sympathies/sensitivities to prejudice him in exercise of his undeviating\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   to apply organic law, even if doing so produces a judgment that offends Judge Farmer's personal sympathies/sensitivities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 [T]he personal sympathies/sensitivities are visceral, i.e., based on pure assumptions and presumptions without a scintilla of evidence on which to base a finding of fact consistent with Judge Farmer's personal sympathies/sensitivities. Maybe Judge Farmer's [sic] excuses the lack of evidence with what reasonably would be described as a \"Come on now, you know and I know\" approach appropriate for common parlance and unknown to the legal system and legal process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 [T]he rights of heirs to receive their inheritance from a predeceased ancestor has been part of the organic law of Tennessee, uninterruptedly, since 1796 and part of Anglo-American jurisprudence since time\n   <em>\n    in memoriam\n   </em>\n   [sic], the personal sympathies/sensitivities of Judge Farmer to the contrary notwithstanding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 [F]or Judge Farmer to be influenced to ignore organic law by his personal sympathies/sensitivities in order to manipulate an outcome to deny the heirs of John J. Goza their inheritance and get the Cash to charities is usurpation of the value judgment of the General Assembly and violates separation of powers guaranteed by\n   <em>\n    Tennessee Constitution\n   </em>\n   , Art. I, Section 17 (constraints on the judiciary) and Art. VI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Judge Farmer knows the ropes as well as anybody. These characteristics make Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion in this case stand out as uncharacteristic. Only the most simpleminded person would conclude that, in this case, Judge Farmer made inadvertent mistakes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 To all of the undebatable propositions of law and fact, Judge Farmer effectively turns a deaf ear fixated on making a result that satiates Judge Farmer's sympathies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Estate does not wish to create the impression that there is naivet\u00e9 which keeps Estate from reading between the lines of Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion; indeed, Estate perceives that Judge Farmer intended the non-subtle message between the lines be received and headed [sic] as a shot over the bow. The loud message that bleeds through comes [sic] from between the lines is unmistakable and threatening to Estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 In a nutshell, what rings clear, on reading Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion's commentary, concerning what is tagged\n   <em>\n    Goza I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Goza II\n   </em>\n   , is that Judge Farmer does not feel Estate's case, insofar as it seeks distribution of the residue of Mrs. Goza's revocable trust to John Goza's heirs, is \"right\" or \"just,\" and Judge Farmer does not intend, no matter what, ever to render a decision that mandates what Judge Farmer feels is \"wrong\" or \"unjust.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Added to this feeling, what rings true from what is on the lines of Judge Farmer's Memorandum Opinion is that, if Estate can prove the fraud and the conversion by the individuals who are defendants in the instant case, collecting damages from the individuals would deplete neither the fee income to SunTrust or the amount to be dribbled out, presumably, to charity, does not offend the [sic] Judge Farmer's feelings about what is \"right\" and \"just.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 What role does a judge's oath, practically speaking, play in the day-to-day functioning of a judge? Are there times when it is permissible for judges to lay aside their oath to render a judgment that, though not what the law dictates, is what the judge feels is the \"right\" thing to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 From the outset, Estate makes it clear that Estate has no evidence, has looked for no evidence and makes no accusation that Judge Farmer has taken a bribe; this is completely out of the question. By this, Estate means that there is no evidence that Judge Farmer, in exchange for cash or any other thing of value, has agreed with another person to do what Estate accuses Judge Farmer of having done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Having said that, Estate takes note of the fact that money received by a bribe-taking judge is not the harm such a bribe wreaks on the legal system, on legal process and on the litigants who are victimized by a bribe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 The harm a bribe wreaks on the legal system and the litigant-victims is what happens when a judge abandons his/her oath of office, surrenders up the impartiality that is essential to a judge functioning in an adjudicative role evenhandedly applying law to facts found from evidence adduced according to rules of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 While Estate has sought no evidence and has no evidence that Judge Farmer sold his oath and surrendered his impartiality in exchange for money, Estate respectfully suggests that Judge Farmer, in order to victimize Estate as a litigant, has abandoned the loyalty to his oath of office, has surrendered his impartiality and has abused the power entrusted to him by the judicial office he holds and has switched from his role as a judge to become an adversary of Estate. This, in Estate's opinion, is official action of the kind referenced in Rule 8 (RPC), Preamble, section 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 Otherwise stated, although there is no evidence that Judge Farmer received a bribe to do what he is doing, Judge Farmer is doing what a bribe-taking judge would do to victimize a litigant who was targeted by a bribe. To a litigant who is targeted, it is totally immaterial what caused the judge to victimize the litigant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on Mr. Parrish's statements in the recusal motions, the Board filed a Petition for Discipline against Mr. Parrish alleging violations of Rules of Professional Conduct 3.5(e),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   8.2(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   8.4(a), 8.4(c), and\n   8.4(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2015 after an evidentiary hearing, a Board hearing panel issued a written decision finding that Mr. Parrish had violated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Rule 3.5(e) by including statements in the motions to recuse that \"constituted abusive and obstreperous conduct intended to disrupt the Tennessee Court of Appeals proceedings involving [Mr. Parrish's] client\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Rule 8.2(a)(1) by making \"statements about the integrity of Judges Farmer, Kirby and Stafford that a reasonable attorney would believe were false\" and making those statements \"with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Rule 8.4(d) by making statements in the motions to recuse that \"were prejudicial to the administration of justice\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 Rule 8.4(a) by violating Rules 3.5(e), 8.2(a)(1), and 8.4(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After a subsequent evidentiary hearing in January 2016, the hearing panel issued a written decision stating that it \"considered the applicable provisions of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,\" and therefore had considered \"the duty violated; [Mr. Parrish's] mental state, the injury caused by [Mr. Parrish's] misconduct, and the existence of aggravating and mitigating factors.\" Without identifying which of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (\"ABA Standards\") it had applied, the hearing panel concluded that a public censure was the appropriate sanction for Mr. Parrish's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Board appealed by filing a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the Shelby County Circuit Court. Following a hearing, the trial court affirmed the hearing panel's findings that Mr. Parrish had violated Rules 3.5(e), 8.2(a)(1), 8.4(a), and 8.4(d). The trial court also determined that although the hearing panel did not articulate the particular ABA Standard(s) on which it had relied, ABA Standards section 6.0-Violations of Duty Owed to the Legal System-applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Under section 6.0, ABA Standard 6.13 provides that \"[r]eprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent either in determining whether statements or documents are false ... and ... causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal proceeding.\" Under ABA Standard 6.12, \"[s]uspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows that false statements or documents are being submitted to the court ... and takes no remedial action, and ... causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After reviewing the record, the trial court found that ABA Standard 6.12 (suspension) applied because Mr. Parrish knew the statements in the motions to recuse were false. The trial court also found that ABA Standard 6.32 applied because Mr. Parrish's statements were \"prejudicial to the administration of justice and significantly undermine[d] the integrity and public confidence in the administration of justice.\" ABA Standard 6.32 provides that \"suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in communication with an individual in the legal system when the\n   lawyer knows that such communication is improper, and ... causes interference or potential interference with the outcome of the legal proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court then identified the mitigating and aggravating factors that it considered in determining the appropriate sanction for Mr. Parrish's misconduct. The trial court cited Mr. Parrish's positive reputation in the community and the lack of prior discipline as mitigating factors. As aggravating factors, the trial court considered Mr. Parrish's substantial experience in the practice of law and his refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Based on ABA Standards 6.12 and 6.32 and the mitigating and aggravating factors, the trial court held that Mr. Parrish should be suspended for six months, with one month to be served on active suspension and the remaining five months on probation. Mr. Parrish appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Supreme Court of Tennessee, as the source of authority for the Board of Professional Responsibility and all of its functions, bears the ultimate responsibility for enforcing the Rules of Professional Responsibility and the ultimate disciplinary responsibility for violations of the ethical rules governing attorneys practicing in Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    Garland v.

The trial court affirmed the findings of fact made by the hearing panel regarding the violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The trial court then looked to ABA Standard 6.0 applicable to violation of duties owed to the legal system to determine what level of sanction was warranted. \"Generally speaking, '[t]he ABA Standards suggest the appropriate baseline sanction, and aggravating and mitigating factors may justify an increase or reduction in the degree of punishment to be imposed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Prof'l Responsibility v.

The trial court then noted that the ABA Standards that recommend a reprimand are conditioned upon a finding that the attorney was negligent, and that the hearing panel \"at the very least\" had found Mr. Parrish to be \"reckless\" with regard to the truth or falsity of the statements made in the motions to recuse. The trial court concurred with the finding of the hearing panel that Mr. Parrish made false statements that the appellate judges had \"purposefully ignored binding law, purposefully fabricated facts, manipulated and rigged the legal system, acted in a manner that indicated they had taken bribes, abused their judicial power, surrendered their impartiality, and ruled against his clients due to personal sympathies and bias.\" The trial court found that there was no factual basis for such statements and that the only \"fact\" Mr. Parrish had was that the Court of Appeals had ruled against his client. Because the trial court determined that the pleadings and the proof submitted to the hearing panel showed that Mr. Parrish acted knowingly, it found that a suspension was appropriate under ABA Standards 6.12 and 6.32, applicable when a lawyer knows that false statements are being submitted to the court and when a lawyer engages in communication with an individual in the legal system that the lawyer knows to be improper. The trial court further looked to the definition of \"injury\" in the ABA Standards,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and stated that \"it goes without saying that statements of this nature by an attorney which falsely accuse a judge of this type of misconduct are prejudicial to the administration of justice and serve to significantly undermine the integrity and public confidence in the administration of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The trial court next considered the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors that it had identified-Mr. Parrish's substantial experience in the practice of law and his refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct as aggravating factors; the absence of prior discipline and Mr. Parrish's positive reputation in the community as mitigating factors. After deciding that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, the trial court determined that a six-month suspension was the appropriate sanction, with one month to be served on active suspension and the remaining five months to be served on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We conclude that the hearing panel acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that a public censure was warranted. Mr. Parrish made the statements in the recusal motion knowingly, not negligently. Therefore, ABA Standard 6.12 applies, not ABA Standard 6.13. Under ABA Standard 6.12, the presumptive sanction is suspension, not a reprimand. The hearing panel offered no explanation as to why it did not apply ABA Standard 6.12 and no reason is apparent from the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656315\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/408/#p422\">\n    545 S.W.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the hearing panel's decision to impose suspension instead of the presumptive sanction of disbarment under the ABA Standards, in the absence of mitigating factors, was arbitrary\n   or capricious).

To determine the appropriate sanction, it is helpful to consider sanctions we have imposed in cases with similar facts. \"This Court 'evaluate[s] each instance of attorney discipline in light of its particular facts and circumstances,' even as it 'consider[s] the sanctions that have been imposed in prior cases that present similar circumstances so as to maintain consistency and uniformity in disciplinary proceedings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908304\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/223/\">\n    441 S.W.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Prof'l Responsibility v.

And, like the attorney in\n   <em>\n    Gardner\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Parrish accused the Court of Appeals judges of being dishonest and ignoring established law, skewing and ignoring the facts, and violating their oaths to decide cases fairly and impartially.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n    793 N.E.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Although Mr. Parrish claims that his statements were justified by his steadfast belief in judicial reform, attorneys who cross the line from tolerable criticism to unacceptable speech \"may not avoid punishment\n   by claiming that their misconduct served the greater good or the interest of their clients, as such exceptions would overwhelm the rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908304\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/223/\">\n    441 S.W.3d at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Slavin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149359\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/145/538/\">\n    145 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   551 ). Mr. Parrish's argument in that regard is much like the defense raised by John J. Hooker who was disciplined for filing \"frivolous lawsuits using the most baseless invectives.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hooker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319819\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/340/389/#p392\">\n    340 S.W.3d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (Tenn. 2011). According to the trial court, Mr. Hooker considered himself a \"constitutional warrior for the people\" and believed that his lawsuits could not be frivolous for that reason. We noted that Mr. Hooker completely missed the point-the disciplinary proceeding concerned only the question of whether the attorney in fulfilling his perceived role as \"constitutional warrior\" was subject to the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319819\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/340/389/#p392\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319819\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/340/389/#p392\">\n    at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Likewise, Mr. Parrish's attempt to justify his conduct by claiming that he is on a crusade for judicial reform misses the point. This case is not about Mr. Parish's beliefs in judicial reform. Rather, this case involves Mr. Parrish's in-court derogatory statements about the integrity of three appellate court judges in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We hold that Mr. Parrish's pejorative statements in the motions to recuse were not protected by the First Amendment. The hearing panel's decision that Mr. Parrish violated Rules of Professional Conduct 3.5(e), 8.2(a)(1), 8.4(a), and 8.4(d) is supported by material and substantial evidence. The hearing panel, however, acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that the appropriate sanction for Mr. Parrish's misconduct was a public censure rather than suspension. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the trial court imposing a six-month suspension, with one month served on active suspension and the remaining five months on probation. We tax the costs of this appeal to Larry E. Parrish, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Rule 10 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals of Tennessee provides that the Court of Appeals\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    with the concurrence of all judges participating in the case, may affirm, reverse or modify the actions of the trial court by memorandum opinion when a formal opinion would have no precedential value.
