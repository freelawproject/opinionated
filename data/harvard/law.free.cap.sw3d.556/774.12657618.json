Steven Stafford, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this parental termination case, maternal Grandparents sought termination of both Mother's and Father's rights on the grounds of: (1) abandonment by willful failure to support and (2) abandonment by willful failure to visit. The trial court found no grounds for termination as to Mother and only one ground-failure to support-as to Father. The trial court however found that it was not in the child's best interest to terminate Father's rights. We affirm the trial court's judgment in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Addalyne S. (\"Addy\" or \"the child\") was born in February 2013 to unmarried parents John S. (\"Father\") and Kathryn O. (\"Mother\") (together with Father, \"Parents\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother and Father engaged in a long-term, tumultuous relationship that included abundant drug abuse and criminal charges for both. After Addy was born, she and Mother resided with Mother's parents, Anthony and Bethany O. (\"Grandparents\"), for a short time because Mother needed assistance with Addy's care. Shortly thereafter, Mother moved out of Grandparents' home, leaving Addy to be cared for by Grandparents. Addy continues to reside with Grandparents, who support Addy financially and provide her with a stable and loving home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Grandparents filed a dependency and neglect petition on March 21, 2014, in the Coffee County Juvenile Court (\"juvenile court\"). The petition detailed Father's multiple failures in providing for and raising Addy and Mother's agreement that Grandparents should be temporary legal guardians of Addy due to both Mother's and Father's inability to provide for Addy's needs. The parties participated in mediation, and on November 13, 2014, Grandparents obtained temporary custody of Addy through an agreed order. The order granted Grandparents legal and physical custody of Addy and outlined different steps Mother and Father must complete to regain custody of the child. These steps included hair follicle drug screening, urine drug screens, and rehabilitation meetings. Upon completion of each step, Mother and Father could increase their visitation time with Addy, with the opportunity to eventually regain full custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mother and Father continued to exercise their visitation with Addy after the agreed order was entered. Visitation was, however, essentially the extent of their compliance with the order. Mother and Father both took only one hair follicle drug screen as the court ordered, and both parents failed their hair follicle test by testing positive for an assortment of different substances. After failing their respective drug tests, Parents did not take any urine tests or attend rehabilitation meetings pursuant to the agreed order. Parents took additional drug tests after the petition for termination was filed, which is discussed in more detail,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   Mother and Father have both struggled with drug addiction throughout Addy's life. Eventually, their drug abuse resulted in criminal charges. Father has been convicted of drug possession and driving under the influence. Mother has also been convicted of driving under the influence. Mother and Father were also arrested together in 2015 for drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2015, Grandfather initiated a child support action through the State of Tennessee seeking support from Mother. On February 4, 2015, however, Grandfather voluntarily dismissed the pending child support action due to Mother's medical issues, which prevented her from working.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order stated that the matter was \"dismissed due to [Grandfather] no longer wanting to pursue child support from [Mother].\" On April 22, 2015, Grandparents initiated a second child support case using a private attorney. Grandparents' attorney personally served both Mother and Father with summonses to the juvenile court while Mother and Father were at the Coffee County Justice Center facing criminal charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The summonses specified that the hearing regarding child support would occur on June 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Neither Mother nor Father appeared for the child support hearing. The juvenile court entered a default judgment against Mother and Father on June 17, 2015, ordering each parent to pay $308.00 in support per month. The June 17 judgement was mailed to Mother and Father at Mother's paternal grandmother's home. It is disputed as to whether Grandparents believed this was where Mother was actually residing. Mother claims that she did not receive the default order at that time, and was unaware of the order requiring her to pay the monthly child support until after the termination petition was filed. Father also claims he was unaware of the order. Both parents later testified, however, that they were aware of their duty to financially support Addy. Father paid $20.00 per week of support in July 2015, totaling $80.00. Mother paid no support prior to the filing of the termination petition, but provided Addy with doughnuts, an outfit, and tomatoes. Mother paid a total of $95.00 in support after the petition was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Despite Parents' ongoing drug abuse problems to this point, both were able to secure employment prior to the filing of the termination petition. Father worked in construction, and testified that he made approximately $100.00 per day. Mother was unable to work from late 2014 into\n   early 2015 due to major surgeries. Mother resumed work in October 2015 at Aspen Technologies Inc. (\"Aspen Technologies\"), a factory located in Manchester, Tennessee. Mother, however, only worked at Aspen Technologies for approximately three weeks, ending her employment in early November 2015. According to Mother, her issues with maintaining employment related to her inability to secure reliable transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 11, 2015, Grandparents filed a petition to terminate both Mother's and Father's parental rights in the Coffee County Chancery Court (\"trial court\"). Grandparents relied on three separate grounds in their petition: (1) abandonment by willful failure to support, (2) abandonment by willful failure to visit, and (3) persistence of conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A trial was conducted on March 21, March 24, and March 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, Mother testified candidly about her struggle with drug addiction. She also testified that she had not used any drugs for almost one year, and passed multiple drug tests. Mother also stated that she had a steady job at Speedway Market in Tullahoma, Tennessee, and was expecting a promotion. Mother testified that, at the time of trial, she had a stable home and had been living with her boyfriend since the summer of 2016. She also stated that she has consistently visited Addy, who calls her \"Mommy,\" once a week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding Mother's visitation with Addy, Grandparents testified that Mother visited only a minimal amount of times from August to December 2015, including missing over fifteen visits from November 2015 to February 2016. Grandparents introduced Grandmother's written log of Mother's visits into the record, which detailed each of Mother's visits. These logs detailed only six visits in the period relevant to this appeal, as discussed,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grandparents also stated that during Mother's visits with Addy she was often disengaged, smoking, playing on her phone, or under the influence of illegal drugs. Grandparents noted that Mother usually did not stay the full six hours allotted to her for her visits. Mother, however, testified that she visited Addy more than the dates logged by Grandmother and that she was engaged during the visitation. Mother testified that her failure to attend every visitation with Addy resulted from a combination of unreliable transportation and disagreements with Grandparents. Mother described her visits with Addy as \"great\" and that the two enjoyed doing activities, such as going swimming and doing hair and make-up together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Father also testified at trial. He, too, was candid about his drug abuse problems. Father explained that he was incarcerated from September 29, 2015, to December 1, 2015, apparently as the result of a probation violation stemming from previous drug convictions. Father stated that he has not had any more arrests or drug charges since the beginning of 2016. From Father's testimony, it appears that he has taken three drug screens since the petition was filed, one on August 19, 2016, which tested positive for THC (marijuana) only; one in December 2016, which tested positive for methamphetamine, amphetamine, and marijuana; and the third on the day of the trial, when he tested negative for all substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following his December 2016 drug test, Father testified that he participated in and completed a three-week rehabilitation program at Mirror Lake Recovery Center in early 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Like Mother, Father stated that he also was living with his significant other and her six year old son in a stable, drug-free household. There was also no dispute that Father held a stable job. Furthermore, Father stated that he has not missed one visitation with Addy in 2016. He also testified that Addy has a strong bond with Father's niece, Bella, along with Father's mother and sisters. Father's visitations also generally take place on his mother's twenty-five acre farm, where Addy has a horse named August with whom she also has a strong bond. Father testified that Addy is comfortable with him during their visitations and she also calls him \"Daddy\" when they are together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 25, 2017, the trial court issued its findings of facts and conclusions of law, finding that Grandparents failed to present clear and convincing evidence as to any ground to terminate Mother's parental rights. The trial court found that Grandparents did establish by clear and convincing evidence that Father willfully failed to support his child. The trial court further concluded that it was not in Addy's best interest to terminate Father's rights, in large part due to the guardian ad litem's recommendation against termination of Father's parental rights if Mother's rights were not terminated. The trial court entered its final order denying termination and remanded the matter to juvenile court for any further custody issues on May 9, 2017. From this order, Grandparents timely appealed on May 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Grandparents present four issues on appeal, which we have taken from their appellate brief, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1.

This Court has explained the concept of willfulness in parental termination cases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The concept of \"willfulness\" is at the core of the statutory definition of abandonment. A parent cannot be found to have abandoned a child under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-102\">\n    Tenn.

Nor does it require malevolence or ill will. Willful conduct consists of acts or failures to act that are intentional or voluntary rather than accidental or inadvertent. Conduct is \"willful\" if it is the product of free will rather than coercion. Thus, a person acts \"willfully\" if he or she is a free agent, knows what he or she is doing, and intends to do what he or she is doing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Failure to visit or support a child is \"willful\" when a person is aware of his or her duty to visit or support, has the capacity to do so, makes no attempt to do so, and has no justifiable excuse for not doing so. Failure to visit or to support is not excused by another person's conduct unless the conduct actually prevents the person with the obligation from performing his or her duty[ ] or amounts to a significant restraint of or\n   interference with the parent's efforts to support or develop a relationship with the child[.] The parental duty of visitation is separate and distinct from the parental duty of support. Thus, attempts by others to frustrate or impede a parent's visitation do not provide justification for the parent's failure to support the child financially.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The willfulness of particular conduct depends upon the actor's intent. Intent is seldom capable of direct proof, and triers-of-fact lack the ability to peer into a person's mind to assess intentions or motivations. Accordingly, triers-of-fact must infer intent from the circumstantial evidence, including a person's actions or conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Audrey S.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994255\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/182/838/#p863\">\n    182 S.W.3d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 863-64 (Tenn.

The trial court found, and there is no dispute on appeal, that Mother exercised eight of twenty-two, or approximately 36% of, potential visits with Addy during the relevant time period. Further, Mother testified that Addy calls her \"Mommy.\" Additionally, there is evidence that Mother and Addy like to do many activities together during Mother's visitation such as playing outside together or doing makeup and hair, and that they are affectionate towards one another during visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mother's amount of visitation certainly borders on being token. Indeed, at least one Tennessee court has held that a mother who completed 37.5% of her potential visits during the relevant time period only engaged in token visitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re L.J.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , No. E2014-02042-COA-R3-PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205121111\">\n    2015 WL 5121111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-*6 (Tenn.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re L.J.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , mother attended three of her eight, or 37.5% of her scheduled visits with her child.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4. The mother argued that attending 37.5% of visits amounts to more than token visitation, but the trial court disagreed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In affirming the trial court's decision, the court considered a multitude of factors in determining whether the mother's visitation was, in fact, token.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4-*6. These factors included the quality of the visits, the relationship between the parent and child before the four-month period, the quantity of visits, and whether the visits were sufficient to create and maintain a bond between parent and child.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4-*5. Reviewing the evidence, the Court concluded that the mother's visits were generally of poor frequency and mediocre quality, that the mother and child had little relationship even prior to the four-month period; the court therefore likened the mother's situation to a case wherein a parent's perfunctory visits were insufficient to establish any meaningful relationship with the child.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State Dep't of Children's Services v.

Indeed, Mother attended a similar, but even lesser amount, of visitation over the relevant time period, had problems with reliable transportation, and Mother and Addy's relationship was also built during her scheduled, supervised visits.

Here, unlike the mother in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re L.J.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the trial court found that Mother was able to maintain a meaningful relationship with Addy through the somewhat meager visitation that she attended. This Court has previously considered whether a parent's visitation was sufficient to \"establish a meaningful relationship or bond between [the parent] and the children\" in determining whether visitation was token.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Kaylee F.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , No. M2012-00850-COA-R3PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201097791\">\n    2013 WL 1097791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Tenn.

In this case, the trial court explicitly found that the visitation was sufficient to continue the bond with the child, and the evidence in the record does not preponderate against this finding. In reaching this result, it appears that the trial court generally credited Mother's testimony rather than the testimony of Grandparents regarding the quality of the visitation between Mother and the child. Findings based on credibility are afforded great weight by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Estate of\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     Walton v.

Lastly, we are unable to determine Mother's relationship with Addy prior to the relevant four-month period because the record contains only vague statements regarding Mother's visitation before August 2015. Accordingly, under these particular circumstances, Mother's visits were more than perfunctory and were frequent enough to establish more than minimum or insubstantial contact with Addy; thus, Mother's visitation does not meet the definition of token visitation under our termination statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-102\">\n    Tenn.

Under Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-1-102(1)(A)(i), courts must look to \"the period of four (4) months immediately preceding the filing of a proceeding or pleading to terminate the parental rights\" when analyzing whether a child was abandoned. In this case, the petition for termination was filed on December 11, 2015; therefore, the relevant four-month period for reviewing Mother's conduct is August 11, 2015 to December 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is undisputed that Mother did not provide any support for Addy until after the termination petition was filed, with the exception of some gifts during her visits within the relevant four-month period. This Court is therefore tasked with determining whether Mother's failure to provide support from August 11, 2015, to December 10, 2015, was willful. As mentioned above, determining whether a parent's abandonment is willful is a question of law which we review de novo.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Adoption of Angela E.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 402 S.W.3d at 640 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Adoption of A.M.H.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8333798\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/793/#p809\">\n    215 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   810 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court made the following findings relevant to the alleged ground of Mother's abandonment by failure to support:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [Mother] admits that she failed to pay child support during this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   In her deposition on November 11, 2016, [Mother] admitted [she] did work at Aspen Technologies, Inc., for a portion of the relevant four (4)-month period and provided small amounts of purchased goods for her daughter during this time period. She has paid a small amount of support of approximately Ninety-Five dollars ($95.00) after the filing of the petition between November 11, 2016, and January 26, 2017. The Court was unable to determine if she was able to work the entire four (4)-month period. The Court finds that the [Grandparents] have failed to prove this ground by clear and convincing evidence because the Court is not convinced that the Mother was able to work the entire four (4)-month period....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In this case, Mother repeatedly testified that she understood that she had a duty to\n   support Addy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   although Mother did express some confusion regarding whether Grandparents were seeking payments from her following the dismissal of the first child support petition. Regardless of this dispute, we conclude that the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that Mother had the capacity to pay support during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The evidence concerning this issue is limited at best. It is undisputed that Mother was employed at Aspen Technologies for a portion of the four-month period. Mother however testified that she only worked at Aspen Technologies for \"about three weeks or so.\" Mother's testimony revealed, however, that the lack of reliable transportation made it difficult for her to maintain employment, which affected her ability to pay child support. The trial court declined to discredit Mother's testimony on this issue, and Grandparents offered no countervailing proof to show that Mother worked longer than three weeks or that the termination of her employment was based on anything other than her lack of transportation. Accordingly, from August 10 to December 10, 2015, Mother was employed for less than one-quarter of the relevant period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is also undisputed that Mother was paid for her work at Aspen Technologies; however, the record is completely devoid of evidence regarding the number of hours Mother worked per week, her hourly pay, or the expenses Mother incurred during this time. Indeed, the only evidence included in the record regarding the wages earned by Mother at Aspen Technologies is that Mother was able to purchase items such as clothing, food, personal hygiene products, i.e. soap and shampoo, and drugs. Mother's decision to purchase drugs during the relevant time period is a grave concern for this Court and indicates that Mother did have some funds for non-necessities. However, the purchase of illegal drugs alone is insufficient to prove that Mother's failure to provide support was willful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Kira G.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , No. 2016-01198-COA-R3-PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201395521\">\n    2017 WL 1395521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Tenn.

The record in this case, however, lacks clear and convincing evidence to support this ground for termination.

Indeed, there is a complete lack of evidence concerning her hours worked, wage earned, overall income, or expenses during this time in the record, and Mother repeatedly testified that her failure to work was due to circumstances outside her control.

As an initial matter, it appears that there is no dispute that this definition of abandonment is applicable to Father, as he was incarcerated \"during all or part of the four (4) months immediately preceding the institution of such action or proceeding\"; Father was incarcerated from September 29, 2015 to December 2, 2015, leaving incarceration approximately nine days before the December 11, 2015 termination petition was filed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323337\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/319/586/#p596\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Determining the four-month period relevant to Father's alleged willful failure to support, however, is somewhat more difficult.

Thus, Father's relevant four-month period runs from June 5, 2015 to September 28, 2015, and resumed December 3, 2015 to December 10, 2015, due to his incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-102\">\n    Tenn.

Regarding this ground, the trial court found the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The testimony at trial showed that [Father] was able-bodied and had the ability to work during the relevant time frame. Proof at trial showed that he paid a token amount of child support during this four (4)-month period. [Father] provided receipts totaling Eighty Dollars ($80.00). There was no proof introduced at trial that the Father petitioned the Court to set or hold support payments during the pendency of his proceedings.... The Court finds that [Grandparents] have proven that the Father willfully failed to provide more than token support during the relevant time period by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On appeal, however, Father argues that this evidence was insufficient to find willful failure to support because, like with Mother, Grandparents failed to offer evidence of Father's expenses during the relevant time period. Respectfully, we cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, we note that the record provides ample evidence that Father was working and earning a significant wage during the four-month period. Regarding his income during the four-month period, Father stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [Grandparents' Attorney]: You've testified that your job for the last four years has largely been construction work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [Father]: For the most part, yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q: And you, generally had made about a hundred dollars a day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A: Yeah.

Father did not dispute that these were the only support payments made both during the four-month period and in the child's lifetime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Most importantly, Father admitted that he could have paid child support throughout the child's life, but chose not to. His relevant testimony regarding his failure to provide support to Addy follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [Grandparents' Attorney]: You know that you have a duty to financially support [Addy]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [Father]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q: You've known that you had a duty to financially support her since the day she was born, didn't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Q: However, you've only paid the $80 in child support-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Q:-over the four years.

While we agree that the lack of evidence regarding expenses is troubling in this case, we cannot ignore Father's own admission that he had no justifiable excuse for his failure to pay child support while he was gainfully employed. Here, the evidence shows that Father paid less than five percent of his approximate monthly earnings for only a single month of the four-month period. Thus, even if $80.00 was the uppermost that Father was able to pay after paying his expenses, the record shows that he had the ability to make this payment throughout the four-month period, rather than for a single month. This amount is therefore clearly token under the circumstances. Coupled with Father's admission at trial that he had the knowledge and ability to\n   pay support but did not do so, we conclude that Grandparents provided clear and convincing evidence that Father willfully failed to provide no more than token support in the relevant period.

Although the trial court in this case did not analyze each of the nine factors enumerated in the statute, the trial court did specifically mention the existence of the nine factors when determining the best interest of the child. While we conclude that the trial court's order is sufficient to determine whether termination is in Addy's best interest in this case, we urge trial courts to make specific findings regarding each factor, and any other considerations, in all future decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Gabriella D.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387331\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/531/662/#p681\">\n    531 S.W.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the court's obligation to consider \"all the factors and all the proof\"). We also agree with the trial court's determination that the enumerated factors do not establish that it would be in Addy's best interest to terminate Father's rights at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   First, Father's long history of drug abuse and brief periods of incarceration prior to trial are troubling in relation to the stability and safety of Father's home and to Father's mental and emotional state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

Mother testified however that this incident occurred before Addy was born, and there was no evidence of any abuse toward Addy or any other person perpetrated\n   by Father during the child's life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 36-1-113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(6). The evidence indicates, however, at the time of trial, Father was endeavoring to make a lasting adjustment in circumstances in order for Addy to be safe in his home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

It is also concerning that Father failed a drug test in December 2016, approximately three months prior to the trial; however, since that failed drug test, Father has attended and completed drug treatment and also passed a drug test given by his probation officer on the trial date. Further, at the time of trial, Father had been living with his girlfriend and her son since November 2016. At trial, Father's girlfriend testified that she had never personally witnessed Father take illegal drugs (although she was aware that he failed a drug test in December 2016) and has seen no signs of drug use in their home. Father's girlfriend also stated that Father takes good care of her son and has provided support for her and her son during the four months they have lived together. Father is clearly making an effort to improve his circumstances. Comparing Father's undisputed prior drug abuse with his somewhat belated effort and success in treating his issues and maintaining a safe and stable home, we conclude that these factors weigh in favor of termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Next, Father has maintained visitation with Addy when he was not incarcerated. Testimony from Father and his sister both indicate that Father has attended all allowed visitations, with the exception of the time he was incarcerated or in a rehabilitation program. In his testimony, Grandfather admits that Father, or a member of Father's family, has exercised visitation with Addy over ninety percent of the time. It is, therefore, our view that Father has maintained regular visitation with Addy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

Addy also has a meaningful relationship with Father's extended family. Addy is especially close with her cousin and her aunts. We note that the trial court put great weight on this factor stating that \"[t]his is particularly important in this case for Addy.\" These factors weigh against termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   A change in caretakers, however, would certainly have a negative effect on Addy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

Grandparents also provide Addy with a stable, loving home, as well as financially support her. Both Mother and Father agree that Grandparents have done a wonderful job raising Addy and neither have any complaints as to Grandparents caring for her. There is also testimony that Addy adores her Grandparents. Furthermore, Father has failed to provide Addy with any financial support since the petition was filed even though he has been providing support for his girlfriend and her son for four months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

These factors certainly weigh in favor of termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In addition to the factors listed in section 36-1-113(i), the trial court found that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Agree[d] with the opinion of the Guardian ad Litem that the best interest of the minor child would not be served by severing the parent-child relationship of only one parent and that if the termination is not granted as to both parents, it would not be in the child's best interest to sever either parental relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Grandparents argue that \"the trial court determined that because it would not sever the relationship with the Mother, the Father also remained a parent by default.\" We do not agree that the trial court found that the continuation of Mother's parental rights to the child,\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   , required the trial court to find that termination was inappropriate as to Father. Indeed, had the trial court made such a finding, it would have been unnecessary for the trial court to discuss any other factors relevant to best interest; the trial court, however, clearly contemplated a number of factors in its best interest determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Moreover, we agree that the trial court was permitted to consider this fact among the factors relevant to its best interest analysis.

In this case, the trial court and guardian ad litem clearly considered whether only Father's rights should be terminated, and concluded that it would not be in Addy's best interest to sever only Father's rights in this case.

This Court has previously indicated that in some cases the lack of a meaningful relationship between a parent and child is the most important factor; it is not error for a trial court to place similar weight on the fact that such a relationship exists.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Jayvien O.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , No. W2015-02268-COA-R3-PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203268683\">\n    2016 WL 3268683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 7, 2016) (affirming the trial court's decision where it found the lack of meaningful relationship the \"most important[ ]\" factor);\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Terry S.C.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , No. M2013-02381-COA-R3-PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203808911\">\n    2014 WL 3808911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 2014) (\"[P]erhaps most importantly, [the mother] has failed to maintain regular visitation with the children and therefore has no meaningful relationship with them\"). From our review of the record as a whole, the facts as found by the trial court indeed militate in favor of maintaining the parent-child bond between Father and the child. In a similarly \"close case\" this Court has held that allowing the parent to continue a relationship with the child supported denying termination of parental rights even where the children were in a loving pre-adoptive home and questions remained as to whether the parent could effectively parent the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     In re Liam S.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , No. E2016-02461-COA-R3-PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204422342\">\n    2017 WL 4422342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 4, 2017) (\"We, like the trial court, believe that is [ ] an extremely close case.\"). Under this circumstance, Grandparents failed to meet their burden to show that termination is in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The judgment of the Coffee County Chancery Court is therefore affirmed.
