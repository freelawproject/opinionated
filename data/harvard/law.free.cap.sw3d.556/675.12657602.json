Mr. Maria claims the trial court plainly erred in failing to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   declare a mistrial or instruct the jury to disregard allegedly improper closing argument by the State that was not objected to by Mr. Maria at trial. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
