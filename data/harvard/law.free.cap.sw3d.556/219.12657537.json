Neal McBrayer, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The primary issue in this appeal is whether the former spouse of a military retiree is entitled to a share of his military retirement. The military retiree submits that, because of his service-connected disability rating of 100%, his former spouse is not entitled to a share of his military retirement. Based on its interpretation of the parties' marital dissolution agreement, the trial court ruled in favor of the former spouse and awarded her a percentage of the retiree's \"total military retired pay,\" including disability benefits. Upon our de novo review, we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding the former spouse a percentage of the retiree's disability benefits. But the trial court correctly determined that the military retiree's disability\n   rating did not deprive his former spouse of an interest in his military retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Joanna Marie Vlach (\"Wife\") and Gregory Alan Vlach (\"Husband\") married on November 3, 1982, separated in April 2002, and ultimately divorced on December 9, 2002. The final decree of divorce entered by the Chancery Court for Montgomery County, Tennessee, incorporated the parties' marital dissolution agreement (\"MDA\"). As part of the property settlement, the MDA included a provision dividing the military retirement of Husband, who served in the United States Army.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The provision granted Wife a percentage of Husband's \"disposable retirement pension.\" The provision also took into consideration that retired pay might be impacted by Husband's receipt of disability benefits. Specifically, the provision provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Wife shall receive twenty-six percent (26%) of the Husband's disposable retirement pension from the United States Army, with no consideration for disability until the Husband is classified as seventy-four percent (74%) disabled. It is the understanding and belief of the Parties that the Husband's twenty (20) year military retirement will equal to forty percent (40%) of his base pay, meaning that the Wife's entitlement would equal twenty-six percent (26%) of the total retirement, but if the percentage of base pay is higher, the controlling figure will be twenty-six percent (26%) of disposable retirement pension. The Parties will be married in excess of ten (10) years at the time of the entry of the Final Decree, during which time the Husband served on active duty with the United States Army. For the purpose of this agreement, disposable retirement pension will include, any and all VA, any early-out or separation bonus such as VSI or SSB, or other disability pension to which the Husband is entitled. The Husband waives any right of privacy, including but not limited to any rights pursuant to the privacy act 10 U.S.C. 1450(f)(3)(A) to the Wife in order to obtain information pertaining to the Husband's retirement account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It is the Court's intention that if the Wife receives a deduction from his military retirement pension, such as for an election of VA disability, then the percentage of the military retirement pension will be adjusted to equal the same dollar sum as if no disability or similar deduction was made, up to 74% as previously stated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Husband's retirement date approached, Wife contacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (\"DFAS\"). An agency of the Department of Defense, DFAS \"manages the pay accounts for and provides payroll service to ... military retirees.\"\n   <em>\n    Kucinich v. Def. Fin. &amp; Accounting Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398601\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/183/1005/#p1007\">\n    183 F.Supp.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (N.D. Ohio 2002). DFAS informed Wife that it could not issue a direct payment or garnishment based on the wording of the MDA. According to the DFAS, the language concerning Husband's retirement pay included \"to [sic] many contingencies.\" And DFAS requested that the wording be clarified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As requested, on January 7, 2011, Wife filed a \"Motion to Clarify Final Decree of Divorce.\" Wife's motion also proposed an interpretation of the MDA language. Husband disputed Wife's interpretation, primarily on the ground that the MDA contemplated a retirement following twenty years of service. Because he had served longer and been promoted, Husband argued that Wife should not share in amounts earned after the divorce based on \"longevity and additional promotions.\" Ultimately,\n   the trial court determined that Wife's motion was premature because Husband had not yet retired from the military.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over three years later, Wife moved for a new hearing on her motion to clarify. Wife alleged that Husband planned to retire in September 2014. The court granted the motion, and a hearing was held in which no testimony was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court found that Husband had retired and that, although he had applied for disability, Husband was receiving his full retirement without any adjustment for disability. Based on the language of the MDA, the court concluded that \"Wife should receive twenty six percent (26%) of the Husband's retirement and only if he received a VA disability exceeding seventy-four percent (74%) would there be any adjustment in the amount of the retirement benefit to the Wife.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When presented with this ruling, DFAS complained that the award of retirement pay was still subject to a condition and that it was ill-equipped to monitor if or when Husband received a disability rating. So, on Wife's motion, the court amended its order to provide that Wife \"is awarded 26% of [Husband's] total military retired pay.\" The order further provided that, \"[i]f [Husband] becomes classified as 74% or more disabled, he may petition this court for appropriate relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Approximately one month later, on April 10, 2015, Husband filed a motion informing the court that he received a disability rating of 100% effective October 1, 2014. As a result, Husband argued that Wife was not entitled to any of his military retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court determined that, \"although the Husband has a VA disability rating of 100%, effective October 1, 2014, this does not relieve him of his obligation to pay military retirement.\" In the court's view, the language in the MDA concerning the division of the retirement benefit only permitted the court to consider a modification of the percentage awarded if Husband was determined to be more than 74% disabled. The court concluded that Wife was entitled to the 26% of the retirement benefit beginning October 2014. Because Husband had failed to pay Wife her portion of the benefits for ten months, the court found Husband in civil contempt and awarded Wife a judgment of $9,230.00, later reduced to $7,384.00 due to payments Wife had received. The court also awarded Wife attorney's fees of $1,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal, Husband argues that the language of the MDA \"was intended to limit the Wife's ability to recovery [sic] a portion of the Husband's military retirement in the event the Husband was awarded a Veteran's Administration Disability in excess of 74%.\" Properly interpreted, Husband submits that the MDA entitled him to a greater percentage of his retirement in the event of disability and the entire amount in the event of a 100% disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In order to understand the language used in the MDA, one must understand federal law governing military retirement pay at the time the MDA was drafted.

By providing \"that if the Wife receives a deduction from [Husband's] military retirement pension, such as for an election of VA disability, then the percentage of the military retirement pension will be adjusted to equal the same dollar sum as if no disability or similar deduction was made,\" the MDA sought to impermissibly award Wife a share of Husband's waived retired pay. To the extent it does so, the provision runs afoul of the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   and is unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/\">\n    at 1405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[F]ederal law completely pre-empts the States from treating waived military retirement pay as divisible community property.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The provision did not, as Husband argues, \"create a disability threshold at which time the Wife's interest in Husband's Military Retirement would be limited or terminated.\" According to Husband, \"[t]here [wa]s no other reason why the language cited was included in the [MDA].\" We disagree. As shown above, the reason for the language was clear: to protect Wife from a potential reduction in the value of her share of Husband's military retirement due to his receipt of disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Of course, the practical effect of Husband's receipt of disability benefits might be a complete waiver of retired pay, which would result in Wife receiving no further retired pay. After all, 26% of $0 retired pay is $0. But in this case, Husband was not required to waive any of his retired pay despite receiving a \"service-connected disability rating of 100%.\" In response to requests for admission, Husband admitted that he was receiving payments from both the DFAS and the VA. Husband further admitted that there had been no deduction from his retired pay that he received from the DFAS due to his disability benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although not raised specifically as an issue by Husband, to prevent needless litigation, we exercise our discretion to review the language used in the trial court's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn.

The trial court awarded Wife \"26% of [Husband's] total military retired pay.\" And, in a later order, the court provided that Wife's counsel could \"prepare and submit to the Court any additional Order that may be necessary for the VA or DFAS to pay directly to [Wife] twenty-six percent (26%) of [Husband's] military retirement and disability pay.\" In both respects, the trial court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the Supreme Court has made clear, Congress has only authorized state courts to divide as marital property \"disposable retired pay\" as that term is defined by the Former Spouses' Protection Act.\n   <em>\n    Mansell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605033\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/581/#p583\">\n    490 U.S. at 594-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605033\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/581/#p583\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
