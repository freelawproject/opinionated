C.B. appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services (Cabinet) petitioned this Court for discretionary review, which we granted. After our review of the record and the law, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the orders of the Clark Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   C.B. and Mother\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   lived together but were never married. Mother had a previous case plan with the Cabinet regarding another child, and C.B. had a previous involuntary termination of parental rights (TPR) case with the Cabinet, involving other children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In late June 2016, C.B. began attending the suboxone clinic, Beall Recovery. C.B.'s intake form at the clinic indicated that he admitted to using heroin, Percocet, and off-street suboxone. Mother also had a history of substance abuse problems. Child was born on August 5, 2016. Child tested positive for suboxone, had low oxygen intake, mild retractions and hip dysplasia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also, in August 2016, social worker Roberta Mardis (Roberta) received a new investigation request relating to Child being born, positive for suboxone, referencing C.B.'s and Mother's previous histories with the Cabinet and substance abuse. C.B. and Mother agreed to the Cabinet's Prevention Plan (case plan). Child was placed in the care of the maternal grandmother, C.R. C.R. was to supervise C.B.'s and Mother's contact with Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The case plan also required C.B. to call the Cabinet office three times per week for random drug tests. If required to test, C.B. would report to the office during a designated time. C.B. was also required to continue attending Beall Recovery, follow all treatment recommendations and take all medications as prescribed, and to have only supervised contact with Child until further notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   C.B. called the Cabinet office, as required, during the early stages of his case plan. At the adjudication hearing, however, the Commonwealth introduced drug tests showing that C.B. had tested positive for Gabapentin on three occasions. C.B. did not have a prescription for Gabapentin. C.B. also failed to call the Cabinet office for random testing on several occasions and even left the office prior to providing a testing sample on two occasions. C.B. also continued to test positive for suboxone, even though he was not currently receiving suboxone prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Cabinet filed a petition on November 29, 2016, seeking a finding that the Child was dependent, neglected, or abused. The case was set for an adjudication hearing on April 13, 2017. The Commonwealth requested, and the court granted, that Mother's case be adjusted and continued for two months. The Commonwealth indicated its intention to dismiss the case against Mother so long as Mother continued to follow and make progress on her case plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The above evidence was presented at the adjudication hearing. Roberta also testified regarding C.B.'s prior TPR proceeding. C.B. testified that he had never taken the drug Gabapentin and that he was willing to do a hair follicle test to show he had never taken the drug. There were also drug screens presented from Beall Recovery that did not show the presence of\n   Gabapentin. These drug screens were taken on consecutive days to those from the Cabinet showing the presence of Gabapentin. In regard to the positive suboxone tests, C.B. indicated that he had \"stretched\" out his prescription to keep from getting sick. C.B. began working two jobs and did not think he would be able to see the doctor for a couple of months, so he had not been using suboxone according to his prescription in order to make it last longer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C.B. also testified about the TPR proceeding. He stated that the children from that case were not his biological children. The trial judge reviewed the TPR file finding that C.B. had held himself out as the father and made no objection in the case about not being the father. The trial judge indicated that his rights were terminated in that case because of his history of substance abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the instant case, the trial judge found that the petition was proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Child was found to be a neglected child due to the risk of harm associated with C.B.'s substance abuse issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.B. appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed. Not only did the Court of Appeals find that the Cabinet's evidence was speculative and did not rise to the preponderance level, but the Court of Appeals also found that the Child could not be found to be neglected because C.B. had never exercised custodial control or supervision over the Child. This Court granted the Cabinet's motion for discretionary review. We now reverse the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Statutory Interpretation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This case primarily presents us with the task of interpreting Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) 600.020.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the emphasized portion above, the phrase \"exercising custodial control or supervision\" modifies \"other person.\" This makes sense based on the grammatical construction of the provision. First, the provision separates the enumerated relationships by an \"or.\" \"In common and natural usage the word 'or' is disjunctive and expresses an alternative as between either of two or more separate subjects or conditions and implies an election or choice as between them.\"\n   <em>\n    Board of Nat'l Missions of Presbyterian Church v.

It is therefore plain and apparent that the General Assembly intended to name multiple alternatives in the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, this theory of interpretation is supported by the fact that the alternatives are all distinct classifications of relationships. KRS 600.020(46) defines parent as \"the biological or adoptive mother or father of a child.\" \"Guardianship gives a person 'the powers and responsibilities of a parent regarding the ward's support, care, and education[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

KRS 620.010. Based on our review of the evidence, the family court's findings are supported by the record and its ultimate finding of neglect is sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Evidence was presented that C.B. initially complied with the drug testing requirements of his case plan. C.B. appeared for testing multiple times per week. Evidence was presented that C.B.'s suboxone levels became inconsistent with the dosage of suboxone C.B. was supposed to be consuming. C.B. admitted that he had \"stretched\" his suboxone prescription because he did not know if he could see a doctor due to his new employment. Although inconsistent with the Beall Recovery Center drug tests, the Cabinet's drug tests also showed the presence of Gabapentin, a drug that C.B. had not been prescribed. Even though C.B. presented evidence and explanation of his own, all of this evidence was properly submitted before the trial judge, and the trial judge was certainly permitted to find the Cabinet's evidence more credible or persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   C.B. argues that the family court erred in relying on evidence of his seven-year old TPR proceeding. For several reasons, we find no error. First, it must be stated that in order for a trial judge to terminate an individual's parental rights, in an involuntary proceeding, one of the prerequisites\n   to termination is that the trial judge find that the child has been abused or neglected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   So in C.B.'s prior TPR proceeding, the judge had to have found C.B.'s putative children\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to be abused or neglected. This is significant because, as stated above, KRS 620.023 indicates that acts of abuse or neglect against\n   <em>\n    any child\n   </em>\n   are relevant in\n   <em>\n    any proceeding\n   </em>\n   pursuant to KRS Chapter 620, and the trial court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   consider such circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the same statute mandates the trial judge to consider whether alcohol or drug abuse incapacitates a parent to the point of affecting the care of the child. KRS 620.023(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (3) \"Alcohol and other drug abuse\" means a dysfunctional use of alcohol or other drugs or both, characterized by one (1) or more of the following patterns of use:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (a) The continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent social, legal, occupational, psychological, or physical problem that is caused or exacerbated by use of alcohol or other drugs or both;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (b) Use in situations which are potentially physically hazardous;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (d) Use of alcohol or other drugs or both is accompanied by symptoms of physiological dependence, including pronounced withdrawal syndrome and tolerance of body tissues to alcohol or other drugs or both;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   KRS 222.005(3)(a)(b)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The trial judge indicated to C.B., that the \"termination of parental rights happened because you had a significant long-term substance abuse history and you weren't doing what you needed to do to fix the issue back then.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Even without that history, it is absolutely uncontested that you have a very recent substance abuse history.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   C.B. checked into the Beall Recovery Center a little over a month before the Child was born. C.B. admitted to using heroin, Percocet, and off-street suboxone. At the adjudication hearing, C.B. further conceded that he had not been following his suboxone prescription. He indicated that he stretched out his suboxone prescription so he would not get sick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This evidence and testimony clearly satisfies KRS 222.005. C.B.'s admitted drug use, occurring as far back as 2009 and the earlier TPR proceeding, certainly caused and exacerbated C.B.'s legal problems involving his children and/or putative children. KRS 222.005(3)(a). C.B.'s incorrect use of his suboxone prescription so he would not get sick, albeit for the stated\n   purpose of maintaining employment, also tends to show C.B.'s continued dependency and fear of withdrawal symptoms. KRS 222.005(3)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As stated in KRS 600.020(1)(a)(2), a court can find neglect if an individual \"creates or allows to be created a risk of physical or emotional injury as defined in this section to the child by other than accidental means.\" \"The statute, as written, permits the court's finding where a\n   <em>\n    risk of abuse\n   </em>\n   exists and\n   <em>\n    does not require actual abuse\n   </em>\n   prior to the child's removal from the home or limitation on the contact with an abusive parent.\"\n   <em>\n    Z.T. v.

App. 2008) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   C.B.'s prior history of drug abuse was found to have created a risk of harm in the prior TPR proceeding. C.B.'s recent compliance with the Cabinet's case plan, followed by missed tests and positive tests, provide an inference that C.B.'s drug issues are still not resolved. While family courts are not left with unfettered discretion when it comes to restricting parents' rights to their children, the family court certainly does not have to wait for actual harm to occur before taking protective measures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the evidence and C.B.'s own admissions, it was reasonable for the family court to rely upon this evidence in finding neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
