After the insured discovered that one of its employees embezzled approximately $100,000 in 2014 and 2015, it filed a claim for $30,000, the aggregate of the policy limits of $15,000 for each policy year. The insurer took the position that the limitation of coverage for such an occurrence was $15,000, paid that amount, and denied the balance of the claim. The trial court held that the policy language was ambiguous and by construing the policies in favor of the insured, determined there were two policies, each of which provided $15,000 of coverage and ruled that Plaintiff was entitled to recover $30,000. The insurer appealed. Finding no ambiguity, we have determined that the 2015 policy was not a separate policy but a renewal of the 2014 policy, that the policy limit for employee dishonesty is $15,000 per occurrence, and that there was one continuous occurrence, as that term is defined in the policy, which spanned two years. We have also determined that the policy prohibits \"stacking\" of coverage from one policy year to the next. For these reasons, we respectfully reverse the judgment of the trial court and hold that the policy limits for the claim asserted by the insured is $15,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Auto-Owners (Mutual) Insurance Co. (\"Auto-Owners\") provided commercial liability insurance for Tennessee Clutch and Supply, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\") in 2014 and 2015. The coverage was provided under two policies with effective dates from February 1, 2014, until February 1, 2015 (\"the 2014 policy\"), and from February 1, 2015, until February 1, 2016 (\"the 2015 policy\"). Each policy provided coverage for loss resulting from \"employee dishonesty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July of 2015, Plaintiff discovered that an employee had embezzled $48,206.59 during the 2014 policy period and $50,384.51 during the 2015 policy period. Plaintiff timely made a claim for $30,000, which constituted policy limits per occurrence of $15,000 for two separate occurrences, one under each policy period. Auto-Owners responded to the claim stating the policy limits for the loss claimed was $15,000. Plaintiff then filed suit against Auto-Owners for breach of contract. During the pendency of this action, Auto-Owners interpleaded $15,000, which represents the policy limits for one occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After entering into a joint stipulation of the material facts, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment to address whether Auto-Owners was liable for an additional $15,000. In its motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff contended that the 2014 policy and the 2015 policy were separate policies and that the language of the Employee Dishonesty endorsement was ambiguous as to whether the policies could be \"stacked.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Auto-Owners argued that the two policies at issue were one continuous policy, that the 2015 policy was a renewal of the 2014 policy, and there was one continuous occurrence, as that term is defined in the policy, which spanned two years. Auto-Owners further argued that\n   the language of the Employee Dishonesty endorsement expressly prohibited stacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled in favor of Plaintiff on the breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As grounds for its ruling, the trial court found the language of the endorsement to be ambiguous, because it could be read in at least two different ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   One interpretation would lead the court to construe the policies as one continuous policy, while the other interpretation would lead the court to construe the policies as two separate contracts. Since ambiguities in insurance contracts should be construed against the insurer, the trial court concluded that it must interpret the provisions in the contract at issue here against Auto-Owners. Accordingly, the trial court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   the 2014 and 2015 policies are two separate policies and that the Plaintiff's employee's actions constituted two \"occurrences\"-one \"series of acts\" that occurred during the 2014 policy period and one \"series of acts\" that occurred during the 2015 policy period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court further found that the matter of stacking commercial liability policies was an issue of first impression in Tennessee and thus looked to similar cases from other jurisdictions for guidance. It found guidance in\n   <em>\n    E.J. Zeller, Inc. v. Auto Owners Ins.

Specifically, the Ohio court held that paragraph E(2) of the endorsement (Discovery Period for Loss) \"acts as an expiration date for the insurer's liability under each policy.

OCCURRENCE , AS DEFINED IN THE POLICY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The policy states, \"The most we will pay for loss in any one 'occurrence' is the Limit of Insurance shown in the Declarations for EMPLOYEE DISHONESTY.\" The policy defines \"occurrence\" as \"all loss caused by, or involving one or more 'employees', whether the result of a single act or series of acts.\" A leading legal commentator on insurance explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In defining 'occurrence' as 'all loss caused by or involving, one or more employees,' the definition expressly aggregates 'all loss' caused by any one employee into a single occurrence. Thus, the commission of multiple consecutive acts of employee theft by one employee is only one occurrence and the single occurrence limit and deductible apply. Simply stated, if the same employee is always involved, it is only one occurrence. It also is only one occurrence if employees in collusion were stealing from the insured. Only if employees were stealing independently would there be separate occurrences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   10-134 Jeffrey E. Thomas,\n   <em>\n    New Appleman on Insurance Law Library Edition\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 134.03 (LexisNexis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Therefore, under the foregoing interpretation of the definition of occurrence, all loss that stems from multiple consecutive acts of theft by one employee is only one occurrence and the single occurrence limit and deductible apply. Although we have found no Tennessee cases interpreting similar provisions, we find the interpretations of federal courts in Colorado and Mississippi to be persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wausau Business Ins. v.

Like Plaintiff in this case argues,\n   the insured business contended that since the employee committed acts constituting embezzlement within those two policy years, the court should consider the acts committed within each policy year as one occurrence for a total of two occurrences, which would entitle it to recover under both policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156911\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/341/1180/#p1182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156911\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/341/1180/#p1182\">\n    at 1183-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   court noted, however, that \"occurrence\" was defined as \"all loss caused by, or involving, one or more 'employees', whether the result of a single act or series of acts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156911\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/341/1180/#p1182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156911\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/341/1180/#p1182\">\n    at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Over the same span of time, the defendant insurer had issued a series of insurance policies, each for a term of one year, that provided employee dishonesty coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the losses occurred during ten policy periods, the insured argued that it was entitled \"to recover up to the policy limit for each of the ten successive policies\" issued by the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n    at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument was based in part on the insured's argument that the definition of \"occurrence\" was ambiguous because it did not explicitly provide that an occurrence may span multiple policy periods.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Madison\n   </em>\n   court disagreed with the insured's argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Policy language is ambiguous only if it can be\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   interpreted in more than one way. As [the employee's] embezzlement scheme consisted of a \"series of related acts involving one or more 'employees,' \" it undisputably [sic] meets the policy definition of occurrence.

(emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similar to the policy at issue here, the policy in\n   <em>\n    Madison\n   </em>\n   stated that \"the most we will pay for loss in any one 'occurrence' is the applicable Limit of Insurance shown in the DECLARATIONS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n    at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also had a similar definition of \"occurrence\" which read \"an act or series of related acts involving one or more 'employees.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on the foregoing definitions in the insurance policy, the court concluded that, under that definition of occurrence, \"there was only one occurrence of employee dishonesty over the ten year period,\" because one employee \"repeatedly committed related acts of embezzlement throughout the decade\" of coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783684\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/541/#p542\">\n    at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We agree with the analysis of the courts above and hold that the \"Limit of Insurance\" provision and the definition of \"occurrence\" are unambiguous. The policy at issue states, \"The most we will pay for loss in any one 'occurrence' is the Limit of Insurance shown in the Declarations for EMPLOYEE DISHONESTY.\" The policy defines \"occurrence\" as \"all loss caused by, or involving one or more 'employees', whether the result of a single act or series of acts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, Plaintiff suffered a loss when one of its employees engaged in a series of related acts over a period of two years. Under the policy's definition of \"occurrence,\" this series of related acts by one employee constituted one occurrence. Therefore, under the \"Limit of Insurance\" provision, Plaintiff is entitled to recover for one occurrence, not two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III. NON-CUMULATION OF INSURANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff's coverage is also limited by the \"Non-Cumulation of Insurance\" provision, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Non-Cumulation of Limit of Insurance\n   </strong>\n   : Regardless of the number of years this insurance remains in force or the number of premiums paid, no Limit of Insurance cumulates from year to year or period to period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    New Appleman on Insurance Law Library Edition\n   </em>\n   states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Another clause fidelity insurers traditionally have included in their policies to preclude stacking is the non-cumulation clause. Under a loss sustained policy, such a clause has been understood to mean that there is no stacking of the limits in force during prior policy periods. Rather, when a policy is renewed, it is to be considered only a single continuous policy with a single stated limit that does not increase over time, and except to the extent permitted by a prior insurance clause, there is no coverage under one policy period for loss occurring in another period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   10-134 Jeffrey E.
