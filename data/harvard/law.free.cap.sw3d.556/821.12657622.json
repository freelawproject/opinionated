Among other things, the amended Act requires commitment to a tiered treatment program that includes the possibility of \"total confinement,\" while the Act's previous version provided for outpatient treatment only. The trial court denied the relator's request for counsel and, after a hearing, entered an amended commitment order. The court of appeals granted mandamus relief to the relator, ordering the trial court to vacate its orders and appoint counsel to represent the relator in further proceedings on the State's motion. We hold that the court of appeals abused its discretion and conditionally grant the State's petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In November 2010, a jury unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that Clarence Brown was an SVP. The trial court rendered final judgment on the verdict and ordered Brown \"civilly committed ... in accordance with\n   Texas Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 841.081 for outpatient treatment and supervision.\" The court of appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    In re Commitment of Brown\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-10-00589-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204466348\">\n    2012 WL 4466348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Beaumont Sept. 27, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.). The trial court also signed a civil commitment order imposing various requirements on Brown under section 841.082, including that he reside in supervised housing at a residential facility under contract with the state and submit to tracking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court issued a biennial review order in May 2013, concluding \"no evidence\" suggested that Brown's treatment had \"resulted in his behavioral abnormality having changed to the extent that [he was] no longer likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence.\" The court ordered that Brown \"shall remain a committed person\" under the Act, subject to all requirements of the final judgment and commitment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In May 2015, the trial court appointed counsel to represent Brown in his second biennial review. On November 9, the trial court issued a biennial review order, again holding that Brown \"shall remain a committed person\" under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the meantime, in July 2015, the Office gave written notice to persons previously committed under the Act about the 2015 amendments thereto, including \"the change of the civil commitment program from an outpatient program to a tiered treatment program.\" The notice informed the recipients, including Brown, of their right to notice and a hearing before being transitioned to the new program. In August 2015, the State filed an \"Opposed Motion for Placement in Tiered Treatment Program,\" requesting that the trial court amend Brown's final judgment and civil commitment order to conform to the amended Act. Brown moved for appointment of counsel to represent him at any hearings conducted on the State's motion, arguing that he had a \"vested liberty interest in his outpatient status\" and that due process entitled him to assistance of counsel when his liberty was at stake. The trial court denied Brown's motion for counsel and held a hearing on the State's motion on August 27. On October 21, the court granted the State's motion, ordered Brown to be placed in the tiered treatment program, and issued an amended civil commitment order. Among other things, the amended order required that Brown be provided with \"appropriate sex offender treatment and necessary supervision pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 841.0831 [the tiered treatment program]\" and \"reside where instructed\" by the Office. According to Brown, he was moved from the Southeast Texas Transitional Center in Houston to the Texas Civil Commitment Center in Littlefield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Brown filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the court of appeals, arguing: (1) the trial court's failure to appoint counsel to represent him at the hearing on the State's motion, which placed his liberty at risk, violated his due process rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions; (2) the amendments to the Act do not contemplate modifying existing civil commitment orders to require placement in the tiered treatment program; and (3) if they do, the amended Act is unconstitutionally punitive and retroactive as applied because it provides for the possibility of \"total confinement\" and Brown \"has a vested liberty interest in outpatient treatment\" under the terms of his final judgment. In a supplemental petition, Brown argued the amended Act violates the Texas Constitution's separation-of-powers clause. Brown requested that the court of appeals vacate the amended commitment order and either modify it to require outpatient treatment only or order the trial court to appoint counsel and hold a new hearing on the State's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A divided court of appeals conditionally granted mandamus relief.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123532\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/116/\">\n    501 S.W.3d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

The court recognized that a hearing to modify a commitment order, conducted under Subchapter E, is not included in the definition of a \"civil commitment proceeding\" for which the Act requires appointed counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123532\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/116/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 119 (citing TEX.

The Legislature has provided such a mandate with respect to certain portions of proceedings under the Act. Specifically, as noted, the Act requires appointment of counsel to represent an indigent person subject to a \"civil commitment proceeding,\" defined as a trial or hearing conducted under Subchapter D (governing the initial trial to determine whether a person is an SVP and must be civilly committed), Subchapter F (governing biennial reviews), or Subchapter G (governing petitions for release from commitment).

The court essentially concluded that, because Brown was statutorily entitled to counsel for the Subchapter F biennial review, and because both the biennial review and the Subchapter E hearing on the State's motion concerned whether to modify civil commitment requirements, Brown was also statutorily entitled to counsel in the Subchapter E proceeding. We disagree. As the court of appeals recognized, \"the parties treated the modification of the civil commitment requirements as a separate proceeding completely disconnected from the ongoing biennial review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123532\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/116/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court did so as well, confirming at the outset of the hearing on the State's motion that it was \"not a biennial review.\" This is consistent with the Act's separate treatment of civil commitment requirements, which may be modified under Subchapter E \"at any time after notice ... and a hearing,\" TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 841.082(e), and biennial reviews under Subchapter F, which involve the court's consideration of an examination report prepared by the Office and require a hearing only if the court makes certain predicate findings,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12123532\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/501/116/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 841.101-.102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court of appeals' reliance on the timing of the State's motion to amend in relation to the biennial review is erroneous\n   for several reasons. First and foremost, it reads a requirement into the statute that simply is not there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iliff v.

Nothing in the Act indicates the Legislature intended to engraft Subchapter F's right to counsel onto a Subchapter E proceeding that temporally coincides with a biennial review. Further, the court of appeals' reading of the statute leads to the nonsensical and unwieldy result that a committed person's right to counsel in a proceeding to modify a civil commitment requirement hinges on its timing. Quite simply, the right to counsel under Subchapter F does not entitle a committed person to appointed counsel in a Subchapter E proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Brown also argues that, because the 2010 final judgment declaring him an SVP required outpatient treatment, any modifications to that requirement must be conducted under Subchapter D, which guarantees counsel. We disagree. As noted, Subchapter D governs the initial trial conducted to determine whether a person is an SVP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7\u00a7 841.061 -.065. Subchapter E then begins with the following statement: \"If at a trial conducted under Subchapter D the judge or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, the judge shall commit the person for treatment and supervision to be coordinated by the office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318772\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/339/74/#p80\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.081(a). Subchapter D simply has nothing to do with the terms of civil commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that the trial court was not statutorily required to appoint an attorney to represent Brown with respect to the State's motion to amend. We further hold that the court of appeals abused its discretion in ordering the trial court to appoint counsel on statutory grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Due Process Grounds for Appointment of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As noted, because the court of appeals granted mandamus relief on statutory grounds, it did not address the constitutional due process arguments Brown asserted in support of his right to counsel. The State argues that by reurging these unaddressed arguments here, Brown \"effectively asks this Court to exercise mandamus jurisdiction in the first instance\" without stating a compelling reason for doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 52.3(e) (requiring a petition for writ of mandamus to \"be presented first to the court of appeals unless there is a compelling reason not to do so\"). We disagree. Brown presented his mandamus petition, which included his due process arguments, to the court of appeals. He presents these same arguments here as an alternative ground to deny the State's petition. That the court of appeals chose to grant Brown's petition for different reasons does not preclude us from addressing the arguments he raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On the merits, Brown argues that due process entitled him to counsel in defending the State's motion to modify, the purpose of which was to remove him from an outpatient treatment program and place him in a program that includes the possibility of inpatient treatment. Brown argues that he should be afforded \"the full panoply of due process rights when the State seeks to impose a much more restrictive curtailment of his liberties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In analyzing Brown's due process argument, we find guidance in the United States Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Vitek v.

State law afforded Brown notice\n   and a hearing, which was sufficient process under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   That said, we must emphasize the narrow scope of our holding. As noted, unlike the pre-2015 Act, the tiered treatment program provides for an additional level of confinement in the form of inpatient treatment at the more restrictive tiers. And the Act enumerates procedures for the movement of SVPs between treatment tiers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 841.0834 (allowing the Office to transfer a committed person to less restrictive or more restrictive housing and supervision under certain circumstances, and providing procedures for the person to request transfer to less restrictive supervision and to challenge a return to more restrictive supervision). Further, as amended, the Act continues to require a \"biennial review of the status of the committed person,\" for which appointed counsel is required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p481\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 841.005, .102.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We express no opinion on whether these procedures are constitutionally adequate, and we express no opinion on any other constitutional challenges to the amended Act that may be brought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold only that Brown was not entitled to appointed counsel on the State's motion to amend his civil commitment order to conform to the amended Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brown's request for appointed counsel on the State's motion to modify his civil commitment order. Accordingly, the court of appeals abused its discretion in granting Brown mandamus relief. We conditionally grant the State's petition for writ of mandamus and order the court of appeals to vacate its own order conditionally granting mandamus relief. Our writ will issue only if the court fails to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Justice Blacklock did not participate in the decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Unless otherwise stated, cites are to the current version of the Act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Before the 2015 amendments, the agency was known as the Office of Violent Sex Offender Management.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    A person is an SVP if he: \"(1) is a repeat sexually violent offender; and (2) suffers from a behavioral abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in a predatory act of sexual violence.\" Tex.
