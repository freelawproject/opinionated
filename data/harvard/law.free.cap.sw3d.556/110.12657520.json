White argues on appeal that section 302.020\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates the United States Constitution, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction, and that he had a valid driver's license issued by the \"Pembina Nation Little Shell Band of North America\" which the State of Missouri was obliged to recognize as a valid license of a \"nonresident ... issued to him in his home state or country[.]\" We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   White was charged by amended information with the class D felony of driving without a valid license in violation of section 302.020, in Johnson County, Missouri, on November 14, 2015, by knowingly operating a motor vehicle on a highway during a time when he did not have a valid license. The information classified the charged crime as White's third or subsequent offense based upon two prior convictions for the same crime in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A transcript of White's trial has not been deposited with this court and thus is not part of the record on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury found White guilty of driving without a valid license. The trial court found that White had two prior convictions for driving without a valid license and followed the jury's recommendation, sentencing White to two days in the Johnson County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, White filed a \"Declaration of Mistrial,\" which alleges the same arguments as those contained in his appeal. The trial court denied relief to White pursuant to White's \"Declaration\" and this appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   White appeals\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and his appellate brief contains briefing deficiencies in violation\n   of Rule 84.04.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though we exercise our discretion not to dismiss this appeal, the deficiencies with White's briefing are numerous and it would be well within our discretion to dismiss this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   White argues that section 302.020 violates the United States Constitution, \"as used against this Tribal Nation.\" We disagree.

Section 302.020's requirement that a driver is required to possess a valid driver's license to operate a vehicle on Missouri highways is well within the constitutional limits on the reasonable exercise of the legislative police power to regulate personal rights appertaining to public safety, which is its legitimate public purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, both procedurally and substantively, White's constitutional arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   White next contends that the trial court was without jurisdiction because of his claim that he is an Indian and the United States has jurisdiction of all cases affecting states versus Indian Tribal people. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The United States Constitution gives the United States Courts jurisdiction over \"all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority[.]\" Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1.

The treaty is unavailing to White's jurisdictional claim. As explained by another court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant bases his argument on an 1863 Treaty entered between the Pembina Tribe and the United States.... The Treaty says nothing about the ability of tribal members to cross the borders of the United States freely and without compliance with United States law. Article 4 of the Treaty does state that members of the Tribe \"shall not be held\n   liable to punishment for past offences,\" but nothing in the Treaty suggests that tribal members are immune from liability for post-Treaty crimes committed off the reservation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ariz. Mar. 20, 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, setting aside the issue (discussed above) regarding the lack of federal recognition of the Pembina Nation, it is clear that White subjected himself to the laws of the state of Missouri (and enforcement thereof) when he left the territory of the Pembina Nation and entered into the jurisdiction of Missouri. Therefore:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [E]ven if the Court were to accept the defendant's assertion that he is a member of a sovereign nation, that fact would not relieve him of criminal liability for violations of United States law committed within the Court's jurisdiction.

Here, White was at all relevant times a \"person[ ] within the state[,]\" and hence the trial court had personal jurisdiction. The State's prosecution of White for violation of section 302.020 was a criminal case; thus, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, White argues that the State of Missouri is obligated to recognize his driver's license issued by the \"Pembina Nation Little Shell Band of North America\" as a valid license of a \"nonresident ... issued to him in his home state or country\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   under the exemptions of section 302.080. Section 302.080 provides certain exemptions to the requirement of section 302.020 that a person operating a vehicle in Missouri have a valid license.
