One of Zerboni's daughters, Ana Patricia Zerboni Flores (\"Flores\"), later intervened in the probate proceedings and claimed Zerboni's signature on the will was a forgery. The probate court granted the wife's no evidence motion for summary judgment dismissing that claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mario Zerboni passed away on September 19, 2010. His wife, Margaret Patricia Hart (Hart), filed an application to prove a will dated January 10, 2005. The will was witnessed by three persons, and contained a self-proving affidavit as set out in the Estates Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.EST.CODE ANN. \u00a7 251.104 (West Supp. 2017). The probate court admitted the will to probate following a hearing on October 26, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Almost two years later, Flores filed an application to set aside the order probating the will. Flores alleged that her father's signature on the January 10, 2005 will was a forgery, and that she was a beneficiary under an earlier will. After the parties exchanged discovery, Hart filed a no evidence motion for summary judgment claiming that Flores lacked any evidence of the essential elements of the claims asserted. In particular, the motion claimed that Flores lacked any evidence that the signature on the challenged will was forged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Flores filed a response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The response included Hart's deposition explaining that she and Mario Zerboni jointly redid their wills using a form found on an internet website. They executed the wills at a Merrill Lynch office where Hart worked. The three witnesses were Merrill Lynch employees, as was the notary public that notarized the signatures. Mario Zerboni had also worked for a time at this same Merrill Lynch office and would have been known to the witnesses and notary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The response also attached an opinion letter from a handwriting expert, Curtis Baggett. The response included Baggett's curriculum vitae setting out his education and experience as a document examiner. Baggett's report explains in general that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   An examination of handwriting includes establishing patterns of writing habits to help identify the author. Handwriting is formed by repeated habits of writing by the author, which are created by neuro-pathways established in the brain. These neuro-pathways control muscular and nerve movement for writing, whether the writing is executed by the hand, foot, or mouth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Baggett's report indicates that he compared twenty-nine documents with the known signature of Mario Zerboni to the signature on the January 10, 2005 will. Baggett then concludes with respect to this case that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Based upon thorough analysis of these items and from an application of accepted forensic document examination tools, principles and techniques, it is my professional expert opinion that a different person authored the name of Mario Zerboni on the questioned documents. Someone did indeed forge the signatures of Mario Zerboni on [the January 10, 2005 last will and testament].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Baggett then included quotes and citations to several references standing for the proposition that \"one significant difference in the fundamental structure of a writing compared to another is enough to preclude common authorship[.].\" Baggett did not explain, however, what \"significant difference\" he observed between the exemplars and the challenged signature on the will. Rather, he states his willingness to testify in court where he \"will prove to the Court that my opinion is correct.\" The report contains a concluding jurat swearing to the contents of the letter opinion. Flores also attached to the summary judgment response the various exemplar signatures that Baggett identified in his report, as well as a copy of the January 10, 2005 will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing, Hart orally objected to the documents attached to the summary judgment response because they were not properly proven up. The trial court did not expressly rule on that objection, but it did generically grant the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

A self-proving will obviates some of those burdens, but once admitted to probate, a self-proved will is prima facie evidence of valid will execution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7258003\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/417/531/#p540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 251.102 (West 2014);\n   <em>\n    Schindler v.

Accordingly, Flores carried the burden of proof on the issue of forgery on the already probated will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson v.

(mem. op., not designated for publication)(allocating burden of proof to party claiming forgery of self-proved will). Flores claims she met that burden through her expert's opinion letter which was attached to her summary judgment response. On its face, the expert report states that the signature is a forgery. In response, Hart does not challenge the expert's qualifications, but rather claims that the attachments to the summary judgment response were never proved up as admissible and that the expert's opinion was conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hart first contends the exhibits to the summary judgment response were never authenticated.

Baggett's expert report, however, contains a jurat at its conclusion such that it could be considered as an affidavit. An \"affidavit\" is \"a statement in writing of a fact or facts signed by the party making it, sworn to before an officer authorized to administer oaths, and officially certified to by the officer under his seal of office.\" TEX.GOV'T CODE Ann. \u00a7 312.011(1) (West 2013).

Here, however, Baggett states a premise and a conclusion, but because there is nothing connecting the two, the conclusion is little more than his bare opinion. Baggett first claims that there is a science to document examination, a proposition no one here contests. He next claims that he compared exemplar signatures to the questioned signature. He then concludes that the questioned signature is a forgery. He finally states that a single difference in handwriting proves a forgery, perhaps inferring that such a situation exists here, but he never identifies what difference, if any, he\n   found. He finally suggests that he is willing to testify in court and prove his assertion. The problem here is that the summary judgment proceeding is where he needed to offer proof of that assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The fact that Baggett may be a qualified expert does not change our opinion.

And had Baggett articulated some specific characteristic in the signature that supported his conclusion, we might well view the situation differently. But merely stating that he made a comparison, and that in his opinion one signature is a forgery, is no different than an expert who claims to have reviewed a case file and concludes that one party should win.

Two days before the summary judgment hearing, she filed \"Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Brief in Support.\" Because there is no order allowing the amended response, which was otherwise not timely, we consider only the initial response.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Benchmark Bank v.
