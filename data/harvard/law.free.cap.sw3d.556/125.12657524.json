Ms. Rissell contends that the judgment was entered against the weight of the evidence, which she asserts showed that Mr. Rissell failed to demonstrate a substantial and continuing change in circumstances. She also argues that the trial court erred by denying without an evidentiary hearing her motion to reopen the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm. Because an extended opinion would have no precedential value, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting\n   forth the reasons for this order pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
