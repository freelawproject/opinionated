According to the contestant,\n   decedent attempted to revoke the will by directing an unnamed person to destroy it in her presence. But the unnamed person allegedly tricked decedent and destroyed another document instead. A beneficiary under the will and the administrator of the estate filed a joint motion to dismiss the contest for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The beneficiary and the administrator argued that the statutes applicable to revocation of wills required that the will actually be destroyed for an effective revocation. The circuit court granted the motion and dismissed the will contest. Upon review, we conclude that the enactment of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202 did not abrogate the common-law rule that fraud will not defeat revocation of a will. So the contestant did state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 21, 1991, Wanda Jeanne Starkey executed her last will and testament. Under her will, Ms. Starkey left \"all of [her] clothing, all pictures of family members related to [her] by blood, and all jewelry, with the exception of [her] engagement ring and wedding ring\" to her three living children, Drema Dickinson, now Louck, Terri Scoggins, and Charlotte S. Goe. Ms. Starkey left the remainder of her estate to her husband. In the event that he predeceased her, the three children would inherit everything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 28, 2009, Ms. Starkey executed a second will, which explicitly revoked \"all former wills and codicils to wills heretofore made by [her].\" Like her previous will, under the 2009 Will, the bulk of Ms. Starkey's estate went to her husband. But unlike the prior will, Ms. Starkey disinherited all of her children, \"as [she and they] ha[d] not maintained a close, amicable bond.\" If her husband predeceased her, the 2009 Will provided that the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Middle Tennessee (the \"LLS\") would inherit in place of her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Starkey died on March 14, 2013. Her husband predeceased her, leading to what would be the central dispute between Ms. Louck and the LLS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 2, 2013, Ms. Louck filed a petition for probate of the 1991 Will and granting of letters testamentary in the Chancery Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petition alleged that no later wills or codicils could be found and that Ms. Louck was \"not aware of any instrument revoking the document or documents being offered for probate.\" On the same day, the Clerk &amp; Master entered an order admitting the first will to probate and appointing Ms. Louck to serve as executor of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 21, 2013, the LLS filed its own petition for probate of the 2009 Will and granting of letters testamentary. The court revoked the letters testamentary previously issued to Ms. Louck, and because the executor named in the 2009 Will declined to serve, the court appointed Gregory D. Willett as administrator\n   <em>\n    cum testamento annexo\n   </em>\n   (the \"Administrator\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 4, 2014, Ms. Louck filed a notice of will contest, challenging the 2009 Will. Despite previously asserting that she was \"not aware\" of any instrument revoking the 1991 Will, Ms. Louck claimed to have information concerning the fate of the 2009 Will. Specifically, Ms. Louck alleged\n   that Ms. Starkey \"attempted to have the [2009] Will destroyed and indeed believed that the [2009] Will had been destroyed in her presence, thereby rendering the Decedent intestate or, in the alternative, making an earlier will effective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Administrator and the LLS filed responses in opposition to the will contest. Both argued that Ms. Louck failed to allege sufficient grounds for a will contest. As the Administrator noted, Ms. Louck only alleged that Ms. Starkey had attempted to destroy the 2009 Will, not that it had been destroyed in the manner specified under the will revocation statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-201\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 32-1-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (2015). In addition, the original of the 2009 Will had been submitted to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Louck later filed an amended notice of will contest, but the amended notice only further highlighted the fact that the 2009 Will had not been destroyed. In the amended notice, Ms. Louck alleged that Ms. Starkey instructed \"another person\" to destroy the 2009 Will in her presence and, in fact, believed that the 2009 Will had been destroyed. But this unnamed person allegedly destroyed another document, \"trick[ing]\" Ms. Starkey into believing that the destroyed document was the 2009 Will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 20, 2014, the chancery court sustained Ms. Louck's right to contest the 2009 Will.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32-4-101(a) (2015). And, at the request of Ms. Louck, the court ordered that \"the conduct of the trial upon the validity of the will shall be in Circuit Court to be heard with a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32-4-109 (2015). Thus, the matter was transferred to the Circuit Court for Hamilton County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Once in the circuit court, the Administrator and the LLS filed a joint motion to dismiss the will contest for \"failure to state a valid claim for relief.\" According to the motion, Ms. Louck \"fail[ed] to allege facts establishing any of the statutory manners of will revocation as set forth in Tenn[essee] Code Ann[otated] \u00a7\u00a7 32-1-201 and 32-1-202.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The circuit court concluded that \"the bases set forth in [Tennessee Code Annotated] \u00a7\u00a7 [32]-1-201 and [32]-1-202 are the exclusive bases under which a will may be revoked.\" Because Ms. Louck did not allege that the 2009 Will was actually destroyed, the court found that \"the facts alleged ... do not fit within any of the bases set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 [32]-1-201 and [32]-1-202.\" So the court dismissed the will contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The circuit court dismissed Ms. Louck's will contest on a motion under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(6). A Rule 12.02(6) motion, also known as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, \"challenges only the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the strength of the plaintiff's proof or evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

As early as 1846, our supreme court recognized that, where a testator has the apparent intention to revoke a will, an act of destruction does carry out that effect even though the will was not literally destroyed, so long as the testator completed the act he intended to work the revocation.\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

Over fifty years later, the court explained by way of example that, \"if the testator attempts to burn his will, and believes he has done so, but by the fraud of another a different paper is burned, it will be a revocation if the testator really intended it to be so, and honestly believed the will destroyed.\"\n   <em>\n    Billington v.

The Administrator and the LLS contend that subsection (e) of this statute makes the statutory methods for revocation found in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7\u00a7 32-1-201 and 32-1-202 the only possible methods for a valid revocation. Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) If after executing a will the testator is divorced or the testator's marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent but \u00a7 32-3-105 shall not apply. Other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the testator's remarriage to the former spouse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (d) For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment that would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of \u00a7 31-1-102(b). A decree of separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    No change of circumstances other than as described in this and \u00a7 32-1-201 revokes a will.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032-1-201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32-1-202 (2015) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Administrator and the LLS argue that it is \"axiomatic\" that all of the methods of revocation listed in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-201 present a \"change of circumstance.\" For this axiom, they direct us to the definitions of the words\n   \"circumstance\" and \"change\" in the fourth edition of WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD COLLEGE DICTIONARY .

Like Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202, Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 2-508 addressed revocation of a will by virtue of a divorce or annulment. Also like Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202, Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 2-508 included a final sentence regarding \"change of circumstances\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are\n   interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of Section 2-802(b). A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.\n   <em>\n    No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   UNIF. PROBATE CODE \u00a7 2-508 (Pre-1990 Version) (emphasis added).

Consequently, subsection (e) of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202 necessarily must reference the change of circumstances included in that section, divorce and annulment, and also \"the subsequent marriage and the birth of a child of the testator,\" which is listed as revoking a will under Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We note that the current version of the Uniform Probate Code maintains the common-law distinction between revocations by change of circumstances and other types of revocations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UNIF.

The Uniform Probate Code also recognizes revocations by writing, such as \"by executing a subsequent will that revokes the previous will or part expressly or by inconsistency,\" and revocations by act, such as\n   \"burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the will or any part of it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985%20Tenn.%20Pub.%20Acts%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-507(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Applying this background, we interpret the phrase \"change in circumstances\" under Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202(e) to mean the marriage and the birth of a child of the testator or the divorce or annulment of the testator's marriage. Thus, subsection (e) of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 32-1-202 does not abrogate the common-law principle as recognized by our supreme court in such cases as\n   <em>\n    Billington v.
