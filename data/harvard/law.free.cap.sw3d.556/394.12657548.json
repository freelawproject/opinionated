Gloria Bustillos sued Texas Tech University Health Science Center-El Paso (TTUHSC) alleging that its physicians subjected her to a series of x-rays and invasive pelvic and anal examinations to assist U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in determining whether Bustillos was smuggling illegal drugs from Mexico. No drugs were found. Bustillos sued for medical negligence, for \"Assault/Battery Based on Negligence,\" and for violating her civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . TTUHSC filed a plea to the jurisdiction arguing that Bustillos failed to adequately plead a waiver of its sovereign immunity. We must decide whether TTUHSC's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity has been waived allowing Bustillos to bring a \u00a7 1983 action in state court. We must also determine whether Bustillos adequately pled facts demonstrating that TTUHSC's sovereign immunity was waived under the Texas Tort Claims Act (the Act), and if not, whether Bustillos should be afforded an opportunity to replead. We reverse the trial court's denial of the plea to the jurisdiction and dismiss all of Bustillos' claims for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bustillos alleged she was returning to El Paso after visiting a friend in Juarez, Mexico, when agents detained her at the border because they suspected she was carrying illegal drugs. They conducted a pat down search but found no drugs and conducted a canine search, but the dog failed to alert to the presence of drugs. The agents then had Bustillos pull down her pants and underwear and conducted a non-invasive visual search of her vaginal and anal areas, but again found no drugs. They handcuffed and transported her to University Medical Center of El Paso\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   where two TTUHSC physicians, Dr. Parsa and Dr. Solomin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ordered a series of x-rays to search her body, subjecting and exposing her to unnecessary radiation. The x-rays did not reveal the presence of drugs. The physicians then conducted an invasive pelvic and rectal exam, both of which failed to\n   reveal any drugs. The doctors eventually released Bustillos to the agents who transported her back to the border and released her. She alleged that the searches humiliated and traumatized her physically and emotionally and that she incurred medical expenses for the unnecessary rectal and pelvic exams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In her second amended petition, Bustillos alleged a \"Claim for Medical Negligence under Texas Tort Claims Act\" in which she complained the physicians had negligently injured her when they \"used and/or misused x-ray equipment, medical probes (including speculum), and other devices to examine Plaintiff's vagina and rectum.\" She asserted that TTUHSC had waived its sovereign immunity for her personal injuries caused by the use or misuse of tangible personal property under the Act. She also pled a Claim for Assault/Battery Based on Negligence, alleging that \"TTUHSC's negligence in failing to supervise its physician employees allowed those physicians to commit intentional torts of assault and battery on Plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bustillos also brought a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against TTUHSC for its physician employees' violation of her civil rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, alleging that the physicians knowingly violated the U.S. Constitution and law by proceeding to search her vagina and rectum after x-rays and visual examination showed no foreign body present and did so pursuant to an unconstitutional custom, policy and practice of performing unwarranted body cavity searches of detained individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   TTUHSC filed a plea to the jurisdiction asking the trial court to dismiss all of Bustillos' claims for lack of jurisdiction because she had not, and could not, adequately plead that sovereign immunity had been waived. In particular, it argued that her pleadings did not demonstrate that she suffered an injury due to its employees' negligent use of tangible personal property and that her allegations of assault and battery demonstrated she was seeking to hold it liable for the intentional torts of its physicians. It also claimed and that the Act did not waive immunity for intentional acts or for any failure to supervise its employees. Finally, it contended that Bustillos could not maintain her \u00a7 1983 cause of action in state court because TTUHSC's sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment had not been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bustillos responded that she had adequately pled a waiver of sovereign immunity arising from the negligent use of tangible personal property. She argued that her assault/battery claim based on negligence was a failure-to-supervise claim of negligently implemented policy, which does waive sovereign immunity. Bustillos also claimed that she was not required to show a waiver of immunity under the Act to maintain her \u00a7 1983 claim and that while the federal court is not available for \u00a7 1983 claims against a state entity, \"such claims may be brought in state courts.\" After hearing, the trial court denied the\n   plea to the jurisdiction without specifying the reasons why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Immunity from suit implicates a court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Sampson v.

The federal court granted the physicians' motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The federal\n   court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims against the physicians in their individual capacity under the qualified immunity doctrine, which shields state officials from money damages unless the plaintiff pleads facts showing the official violated a statutory or constitutional right and the right was clearly established at the time of the conduct. The court held that the physicians did not violate Bustillos' Fourth Amendment right because, although these were \"non-routine\" searches (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , invasive) requiring reasonable suspicion to search, physicians are not required to have knowledge of search and seizure law and are not required to articulate reasonable suspicion when conducting searches at the behest of federal officers. Further, the law was not clearly established at the time of the searches, because current law did not provide the physicians with fair warning that they must have knowledge of search and seizure law and must conform to the Fourth Amendment in their medical practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   There several problems with applying\n   <em>\n    DeWitt\n   </em>\n   . First, the federal court's ruling was based on \"qualified immunity\" which evaluates whether there was a violation of a constitutional right and whether that right was clearly established at the time.\n   <em>\n    DeWitt\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, was based on a finding of \"official immunity.\" Official immunity in Texas looks at whether the government employee was performing a discretionary job duty in good faith. An employee acts in good faith for official-immunity purposes if \"a reasonably prudent official, under the same or similar circumstances, could have believed that his conduct was justified based on the information he possessed when the conduct occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    R.R. Comm'n of Texas v. Gulf Energy Expl.

These are two different inquiries, and thus the federal court did not determine that a reasonably prudent government physician, under the same or similar circumstances, could have believed that his conduct was justified based on the information he possessed when the conduct occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livingston v.

That would require applying either the doctrine of \"claim preclusion\" (res judicata), which requires a final judgment, or the doctrine of \"issue preclusion\" (collateral estoppel), which requires\n   that the fact issue to be precluded have been actually litigated in the prior proceeding. The parties agree there is no final judgment in the federal court lawsuit (as least at the time all the briefs were filed), and the federal court did not litigate any fact issues, but only applied the law to Bustillos' federal court pleadings. These problems distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    DeWitt\n   </em>\n   where the ruling was made in the same case, the ruling was specifically based on official immunity (as opposed to qualified immunity), the ruling was made after trial where factual issues had been decided, the judgment was final, and the ruling was applied in the same case, not to a different case in a different jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    University Medical Center of El Paso is part of the El Paso County Hospital District's health care system.
