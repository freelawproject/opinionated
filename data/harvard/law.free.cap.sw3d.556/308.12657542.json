The relationship had recently ended, and Molien moved into a separate residence. In the early morning hours of March 21, 2014, the two exchanged several text messages in which Appellant accused Molien of being unfaithful to him. Appellant went to Molien's duplex around 3 a.m., she let him inside, and the two argued. Appellant began to search for any sign of another man. He also removed all of Molien's clothing and digitally penetrated her sexual organ. Appellant repeatedly demanded to know with whom she was cheating on him. Each time that Molien replied that she had remained faithful to him, he struck her with his hands in the head/face region.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point while Appellant was striking her, in an attempt to get him to leave the room, Molien asked appellant to get her a glass of water. When Appellant briefly left the room to retrieve the water, Molien attempted to shut the bedroom door, but Appellant returned and was able to prevent her from doing so. While she was lying on the floor, Appellant used one hand to choke her while simultaneously pouring water from a jug down her throat. There is no indication in the record that he struck her with his hands at\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   point, however. Molien was eventually able to kick Appellant off of her and get dressed, and then the two of them went outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Appellant left, Molien reported the assault. Appellant was later arrested and charged in a three-count indictment with aggravated sexual assault, assault/family violence, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 22.021, 22.01, 22.02(a)(2), respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The count of the indictment charging aggravated assault with a deadly weapon alleged that Appellant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   cause[d] bodily injury to Melanie Molien by striking [her] head or body with [his] hands, and [he] did then and there use or exhibit a deadly weapon, to-wit: water, during the commission of said assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After trial, the jury convicted Appellant of non-aggravated sexual assault and of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon while acquitting him of assault/family violence. The jury assessed a seven year sentence for the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon conviction and a ten year sentence, suspended to community supervision, for the sexual assault conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Court of Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Among other claims on appeal, Appellant challenged the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon conviction, arguing that the evidence was legally insufficient to show that water was either used or exhibited\n   as a deadly weapon at the time he was striking Molien with his hands. In response, the State argued that it had presented sufficient evidence to show both that\n   <em>\n    water\n   </em>\n   and/or Appellant's\n   <em>\n    hands\n   </em>\n   were used as a deadly weapon.

The first type of variance occurs when the State's proof deviates from the\n   <em>\n    statutory theory\n   </em>\n   of the offense as alleged in the indictment; the State may not plead one specific statutory theory but then prove another.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8197881\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/532/#p537\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Gollihar\n   </em>\n   , we said, this type of variance is always material and renders the evidence legally insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 294-95. The example we gave in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   derived from the retaliation statute, which \"makes it a crime to threaten a 'witness' or 'informant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 294 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Cada v.

Proof that he threatened an informant only, and not a witness, would amount to a material variance between pleading and proof that would result in an acquittal (even though it constitutes an offense to threaten an informant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second type of variance that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   identified is a \"non-statutory allegation that is descriptive of the offense in some\n   way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321436\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/334/766/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This type of variance can be either material or immaterial, we said, depending upon whether it would result in conviction for a different offense than what the State alleged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 295.

If the proof at trial shows that the victim was instead bludgeoned to death, we said, this would not constitute a material variance because the manner in which the murder was perpetrated does not affect how many murder offenses occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n    at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly, we reasoned, in a prosecution for aggravated assault under Section 22.02(a)(1) of the Penal Code, the gravamen of the offense is causing serious bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 298 (citing\n   <em>\n    Landrian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8197881\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/532/#p537\">\n    268 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   537 ). How that serious bodily injury was caused does not \"help define the allowable unit of prosecution for this type of aggravated assault offense, so the variance at issue [in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ] cannot be material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8197881\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/532/#p537\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case involves a prosecution for aggravated assault under Section 22.02(a)(2) of the Penal Code rather than, as in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Section 22.02(a)(1). Under Section 22.02(a)(2), a simple assault becomes aggravated if the assailant uses or exhibits a deadly weapon in committing the assault. Of course, the gravamen of the offense remains the resulting bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    Landrian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8197881\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/268/532/#p537\">\n    268 S.W.3d at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For reasons we now address, we need not ultimately decide whether this case involves one continuous assaultive event or discretely prosecutable assaultive events; either way, we conclude there is no material variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    The State's Theory: One Assault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State argues that the facts of this case present but a single assault; that the striking with hands and the retrieval and use of water while choking the victim all occurred within an integrally actionable assaultive episode. Appellant's retrieval of water from another room did not sever the episode into two distinct offenses, in the State's view. If the State is correct, then a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon is supported for the simple reason that no variance between pleading and proof would exist. In that instance, it would be irrelevant that Appellant used the water as a weapon only after returning to the bedroom and did not use it earlier while striking Molien with his hands. The exact sequence in which the water was used would make no difference because the deadly weapon-water-was used or exhibited during the commission of the same assault in which Appellant struck Molien with his hands. Therefore, the evidence presented\n   at trial would be legally sufficient to support a conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellant's and the Court of Appeals' Theory: Discrete Assaults\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But even if the facts of this case present more than one actionable assault, as Appellant and the court of appeals believed, we conclude that there is still no material variance between allegation and proof. Even assuming there were two assaults, one in which Appellant struck Molien with his hands and another in which he choked her with his hands while pouring water down her throat, only one of those assaults involved the use of a deadly weapon, and in that assault, the deadly weapon used was, indeed, water, as alleged in the aggravated assault count of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a legal sufficiency analysis, evidence is considered sufficient to support a conviction when, after considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reviewing court concludes that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Therefore, a hypothetically correct jury charge reflects the governing law, the indictment, the State's burden of proof and theories of liability, and an adequate description of the offense for the particular case.\n   <em>\n    Malik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11898363\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/953/234/#p240\">\n    953 S.W.2d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the court of appeals reasoned that, because aggravated assault is not a continuing offense, the on-going incident split into two discrete assaultive episodes when Appellant left the room to retrieve the water. The court of appeals believed it was the first assaultive episode, before Appellant left the bedroom, that was the assault pled in the indictment because it was during that first assault that Appellant struck Molien with his hands. Focusing thus on the initial assaultive conduct, the court of appeals concluded that, in order to justify a deadly weapon finding, a fact-finder would have to find the deadly weapon had been used or exhibited even as Appellant was striking Molien with his hands. Because there was no evidence that appellant used water at the same time that he was striking her with his hands, the court of appeals concluded, the evidence failed to show that the deadly weapon alleged was actually used \"during the commission of the offense,\" as required by Section 22.02(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But this analysis fails to consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the evidence. When focusing properly on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the evidence presented at trial that might have supported the guilty verdict, we must also consider the evidence demonstrating the second assaultive event-during which Appellant actually used water. With a proper focus on all of the evidence that might have supported a guilty verdict, it becomes clear that the variance between the pleading and proof in this case is immaterial. If sufficiency of the evidence is measured against the second rather than the first assaultive event, then there does indeed appear to be a variance, but it is a variance that stems from the allegation in the indictment that Appellant struck Molien with his hands. The language of the aggravated assault count alleges \"striking with the hands,\" but the testimony at trial showed that when Appellant returned to the bedroom with the water, he used one hand to choke Molien while simultaneously using the other to pour the water down\n   her throat, and the evidence does not show that he \"struck\" her at that point in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But this particular variance between the pleading and the proof should not be considered to be material in the sufficiency analysis because it would be patently immaterial under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n    364 S.W.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The variance regarding Appellant's use of his hands would be one describing only the manner and means by which the bodily injury was caused. Under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , this would fall into the second category of variance, a \"non-statutory allegation that describes the offense in some way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n    at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What was pled and proved was that Appellant committed aggravated assault against Molien by causing her bodily injury and that he used water as a deadly weapon while doing so. The indictment did not specify the precise injury that would be shown by the evidence, and exactly how Appellant used his hands to cause the bodily injury is inconsequential to the legal sufficiency analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We hold that the court of appeals erred by failing to consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the evidence presented at trial that might have supported the aggravated assault offense alleged in the indictment when conducting its legal sufficiency analysis. The evidence presented in this case was not legally insufficient to support a conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals to the extent that it reformed the trial court's judgment, and we reinstate the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Richardson, J., filed a concurring opinion in which Walker, J., joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Newell, J., concurred in the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCURRING OPINION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Richardson, J., filed a concurring opinion in which Walker, J. joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I agree with the majority's decision to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate Appellant's conviction. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. I write separately, however, because I arrive at that conclusion via a different route than the majority. In holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, the majority opines that the variance between what was alleged in Count 2 of the indictment and what was proved at trial is immaterial. I would instead hold that there was no variance at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      The Testimony at Trial\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The complainant, Melanie Molien, testified that she and Appellant had been dating, but their relationship had deteriorated,\n   and they had broken up. Early one morning, close to 2:00 a.m., Appellant began texting Melanie because he was convinced that she had been cheating on him. He came to her house about 3:00 a.m., she let him come in, and she said he was acting \"like a madman, trying to see if anybody was in [her] house.\" Melanie said that he looked \"enraged\" and \"psychotic,\" so she tried to calm him down. She said that while she was sitting on the bed he \"pulled off [her] clothes\" to look for \"signs of [her] cheating,\" and he \"put his fingers inside of [her] vagina.\" Melanie made it clear that she had not consented to him putting his fingers inside of her. She then described the rest of his attack:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. What did he do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. He asked me again who was I fucking. I told him nobody. And he punched me so hard on my face and my temple my ear was ringing. I fell from the bed to the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. So you were on the bed and he struck you in the face and you moved from the bed to the ground?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. When you moved from the bed to the ground, just for clarification, you have no clothes on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A.

He continued to say, \"Who are you fucking?\" and I would say \"I'm not fucking anybody,\" and he would hit me over and over and over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. About how many times did he hit you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. I said 20. I don't know because it lasted for hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. So this is about three in the morning when he showed up, marching around the house, you're sitting on the bed, he stripped your clothes off and stuck his finger inside of your vagina and started pummeling you with his fists?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. Was there ever a time when he stopped and stepped back and said, \"I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. He never said sorry. The only time he would stop was in between-when he would ask me, \"who are you fucking?\" And just to get a breath of air, I'd say, \"All right, hold on.\" And then I'd say, \"I'm not fucking anybody,\" just so I could get a break so he'd stop hitting me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. During this altercation, did you stay in that bedroom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Up until we went outside, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. When he was hitting you, was he using an open hand or a closed hand or something different?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A.

In the kitchen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Q. Why did you ask him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A.

Why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. Because he took apart my phone when he first got there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q.

And what did he do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. He was screaming, \"Neither one of us are going to make it out alive.\" And then he rushed in there with the water bottle and he threw the water in my mouth and started choking me at the same time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. So he came back into the room?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q. And where were you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A. I was on the ground, lying on the ground by the TV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q.

So he was standing over you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Q. Was one leg on each side of your body or something?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. Yes, he straddled over me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q.

Now, when you say \"choking,\" what does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A. Where I could not breathe. He was cutting off oxygen. I felt like I was dying, like I almost blacked out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Melanie described the water bottle as a gallon-size water jug that had been about three quarters full of water. She said Appellant had just grabbed it off of the kitchen counter, and he came back into the bedroom. As the prosecutor was trying to demonstrate how the water was being used by Appellant, Melanie testified that Appellant was \"just pouring it down me,\" and it was \"going into [her] orifices.\" She said multiple times that he was pouring the water from the jug directly into her mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Melanie then said she was able to kick him away so he fell against the window, and she said that she kept thinking, \"he's going to kill me, he's going to kill me, he's going to kill me.\" She said he then \"snapped,\" and finally walked outside and she was able to put her clothes back on and calm him down. She went outside with him, and during that time she threw up and asked him to take her to the hospital, but he refused. Melanie said that when she threw up that triggered a reaction in Appellant and he became enraged again and grabbed her whole body. She started screaming, and he finally left. Melanie called 911 and told the dispatcher that her boyfriend just tried to kill her. She had a friend take her to the Women's Shelter, and she went to the hospital after that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Michael Casillas, a detective with the San Marcos Police Department, testified about some of the State's exhibits. State's Exhibit 30 is a photograph of the top of the water bottle. Detective Casillas noted that there was a substance visible on the top of the water jug, which could have been either lipstick or blood. State's Exhibit 31 is a picture to represent how much water was left in the jug-it was almost empty. Detective Casillas also stated that, to his knowledge, the water was used to \"either drown her,\" or \"to cause her\n   enough panic to give answers to the questions he was asking.\" Detective Casillas testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Q. In the manner that was related to you and the way the water was used, could that potentially cause serious bodily injury or death?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q. Are you familiar with any other terminology that's consistent with the manner in which the water was used?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Q. What is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   A. Waterboarding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q. Okay. What is your familiarity with waterboarding?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   A. That it's the act of pouring water into someone's mouth and/or nose to-what I've heard is it's like an interrogation technique and that it causes the sensations of drowning, which, in my opinion, that causes me fear. And it's used as an interrogation technique, which, again, from information Melanie gave me, appears that that's what was happening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The next witness to testify was Janie Mott, the registered sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) in this case. She examined Melanie to assess her injuries. Ms. Mott stated that Melanie had two black eyes, red marks across her nose, and a bruise on her forehead. Ms. Mott observed trauma on both sides of Melanie's face. She also testified that she observed \"petechia,\" which are small red ruptured blood vessels that can be caused by choking, as can the bruising on her ears. She testified that when someone is lying flat on their back, and water is poured into the mouth, it can go down the person's airway into the lungs and cause drowning. She agreed that, in the manner in which the water was used on Melanie, it could cause serious bodily injury or death. Her opinion was that Melanie could not breathe because Appellant was pouring water down her nose and into her mouth. On cross examination, Ms. Mott admitted that she did not see any marks on Melanie's neck other than the petechia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Appellant testified in his own defense. He admitted to being at Melanie's house that morning. He admitted to having been in a physical fight with her-some slapping and grabbing. He denied pouring water down her throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      The Indictment\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The indictment against Appellant reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   On or about the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2014, in Hays County, Texas, the Defendant, Teodoro Miguel Hernandez, did the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   COUNT 1-A\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   [AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   Did then and there intentionally or knowingly cause the penetration of the female sexual organ of Melanie Molien by defendant's finger, without the consent of Melanie Molien, and in the course of the same criminal episode the defendant attempted to cause the death of Melanie Molien by strangulation and waterboarding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   COUNT 1-B &amp; C\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   [AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Did then and there intentionally or knowingly cause the penetration of the female sexual organ of Melanie Molien by defendant's finger, without the consent of Melanie Molien, and the defendant did then and there by acts or words threaten to cause, or place, Melanie Molien in fear that death or serious bodily injury would be imminently inflicted on Melanie Molien, and said acts or words occurred in the presence of Melanie Molien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   COUNT 1-D\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   [AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Did then and there intentionally or knowingly cause the penetration of the female sexual organ of Melanie Molien by defendant's finger, without the consent of Melanie Molien, and in the course of the same criminal episode the defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon, to-wit: water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   COUNT 2\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   [AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Did then and there intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause bodily injury to Melanie Molien by striking the victim's head or body with the defendant's hands, and the defendant did then and there use or exhibit a deadly weapon, to-wit: water, during the commission of said assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   COUNT 3\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   [ASSAULT FAMILY VIOLENCE/STRANGULATION]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Did then and there intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause bodily injury to Melanie Molien, a person with whom the defendant has or has had a dating relationship, by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of Melanie Molien by applying pressure to the throat or neck and blocking the nose or mouth of Melanie Molien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      The Jury's Verdicts on the Three Counts\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As to Count 1, the jury found Appellant guilty of the lesser included offense of sexual assault, which was charged as intentionally or knowingly causing the penetration of the sexual organ of another person without that person's consent.

He claims that the evidence shows that he had completed his act of striking Melanie before he went into the kitchen to get the water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court of appeals agreed with Appellant's argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   They reformed Count 2 to reflect a conviction for the lesser included offense of assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On review before this Court, the majority has concluded that the court of appeals erred by failing to consider all of the evidence presented at trial that might have supported the aggravated assault offense alleged in the indictment when conducting its legal sufficiency analysis. Specifically, the court of appeals failed to consider the evidence supporting what the majority views as the second assaultive event-evidence showing that Appellant used one hand to choke Melanie while simultaneously using the other hand to pour water down her throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   I, too, would reverse the court of appeals. But, under these particular facts, I disagree with the majority's approach holding that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   there were two separate assaultive events, the variance still was not material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   I would hold that there was one bodily injury assault-one physical attack-during which Appellant caused bodily injury by hitting Melanie with his hands,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   he used water as a deadly weapon when he tried to force it down Melanie's throat. As a result, there was no material variance in what was charged in Count 2 and what was proved at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      The Evidence Was Sufficient To Support The Guilty Verdict in Count 2\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Appellant was charged in Count 2 under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02(a)(2), which criminalizes using or exhibiting a deadly weapon during the commission of an assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence presented at trial through Melanie's testimony was that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   \u2022 Appellant repeatedly struck Melanie with his fists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   \u2022 He left the room momentarily to retrieve a large water jug.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   \u2022 He was not away from Melanie long enough for her to even get up from the floor and close the door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   \u2022 Melanie was in his sight the entire time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   \u2022 Appellant rushed back into the room with the water jug.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   \u2022 He started pouring water down Melanie's throat while his hand was around her neck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The physical beating continued from the bed to the floor of Melanie's bedroom, where Appellant continued to beat her in the face and head. The momentary break in time for Appellant to retrieve the water jug did not mean that the beating had finished. While a bodily injury assault is not typically considered a continuing offense, under these particular facts, it is unrealistic not to view this as one bodily injury aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Thus, under the one-continuous-assault theory there is no variance between pleading and proof because the use of water as a deadly weapon occurred during the commission of the one continuous assaultive transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, rather than deciding between a finding of one assaultive transaction or two separate assaults, the majority first acknowledges that if there was one continuous assault, there would be no variance at all. And, in the alternative, the majority holds that if there were two assaults the variance between what was pled in Count 2 and what was proved was immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   A variance between what is pled and what is proved occurs when the State proves the defendant guilty of a crime\n   <em>\n    in a manner\n   </em>\n   that varies from the allegations in the indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   A variance between an allegation in the indictment and the State's proof at trial is material if it prejudices the \"substantial rights\" of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court of appeals held that the State's evidence presented in support of the charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon differed materially from how that charge was pled in Count 2. The majority holds, however, that, assuming there were two separate assaults, the court of appeals failed to consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the evidence. In considering all of the evidence, the majority finds that it is sufficient to support the\n   conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon because even though the use of the water occurred during the second assaultive event, Appellant used his hands to choke Melanie during the commission of\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   assault. Thus the variance, according to the majority, is in the manner and means by which the bodily injury was caused-a \"non-statutory\" descriptive allegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For several reasons, I would have avoided that approach. First, the evidence that Appellant's\n   <em>\n    hands\n   </em>\n   impeded Melanie's breathing is arguably slim. Although it is true that portions of Melanie's testimony could be interpreted as evidence that Appellant's hands were impeding her breathing, the greater weight of the evidence supports the finding that the impediment to her breathing was caused by the water being poured down her throat, not by pressure from Appellant's hands. Second, the jury acquitted Appellant of the choking/strangulation charge in Count 3. Although we must ignore inconsistencies in the jury's verdicts, the fact that Appellant was found not guilty of the choking assault as alleged in Count 3 is troublesome. That acquittal undermines the strength of an aggravated assault conviction if we say that the underlying assault supporting that conviction is the same act of choking for which Appellant was acquitted. Finally, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that \"exactly how Appellant used his hands to cause the bodily injury is inconsequential to the legal sufficiency analysis.\" A criminal defendant has the right to fair notice of the specific charged offense in order to be able to prepare a defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is bad precedent to uphold Appellant's conviction for Count 2 on the basis that it is supported by the same evidence that was used to support the charge Appellant was acquitted of. If, in evaluating sufficiency, we must view the verdict under Count 2 independently of the other verdicts, then shouldn't we view the evidence supporting\n   <em>\n    the offense charged\n   </em>\n   in Count 2 independently of the evidence supporting the offense charged in Count 3-at least under the unusual circumstances of this case?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Under these facts, I find it a more accurate and realistic evaluation of the facts supporting the jury's verdict to hold that there was no variance at all. Appellant committed one continuous assault on Melanie during which he beat her and tried to choke her by pouring water down her throat. Count 2 alleged that Appellant committed aggravated assault by causing Melanie bodily injury by striking her with his hands (which is supported by the evidence) and that he used water as a deadly weapon during the commission of that assault. The deadly weapon alleged does not have to be what caused the bodily injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   It need only be used or exhibited during the commission of the offense. Use of a deadly weapon during the commission of the offense means that \"the deadly weapon was employed or utilized in order to\n   achieve its purpose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's purpose in physically assaulting Melanie was to cause her bodily injury. There was ample testimony to support the finding that water could constitute a deadly weapon if it were forced down someone's airway and into their lungs. Even though, in this case, the water was not what caused the trauma to Melanie's head and face, it was used during the commission of the continuous physical assault on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Reviewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict in Count 2, I agree that the evidence presented at trial supported the jury's verdict that Appellant was guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, as charged in Count 2. With these comments, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     OPINION ON REHEARING\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In two counts of a three-count indictment, Appellant, Teodoro Hernandez, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and family-violence assault by strangulation.

The evidence showed that Hernandez struck the victim on her head or body and that he strangled her, but it showed that he poured water down her throat while he was strangling her, not while he was striking her. The court of appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the aggravated-assault-with-a-deadly-weapon conviction, but on original submission, this Court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and ordered Hernandez's aggravated-assault-with-a-deadly-weapon conviction reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   After we issued our opinion, Hernandez filed a timely motion for rehearing, which we granted.

Here, Hernandez argues, the factual allegations are material because they define the allowable units of prosecution for the two separate assaults. Hernandez contends this is because it is \"only by looking at the manner and means that the litigants were able to distinguish one unit of prosecution from the other,\" and \"[r]emoving the striking and replacing it with choking switches units of prosecution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Hernandez is mistaken.

The legislature has not expressly defined the unit of prosecution for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, but we have determined that the offense is result oriented and that the gravamina of the offense are the victim and the bodily injury that was inflicted.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315266\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/292/\">\n    364 S.W.3d at 298, n.45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, because the manner and means by which an aggravated assault is effectuated is not a unit of prosecution for aggravated assault, nor does it describe a unit of prosecution for aggravated assault, the manner-and-means allegation is not included in the hypothetically-correct jury charge and should be disregarded in a legal-sufficiency analysis. We reaffirm our conclusion on original submission that, assuming that the State had to prove two offenses, under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the variance between the manner-and-means alleged in the aggravated-assault-with-a-deadly-weapon count and the proof at trial is only an immaterial non-statutory allegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   To the extent that Hernandez argues that our decision on original submission violated his double-jeopardy rights, we disagree.

In line with that jurisprudence, and as applied to\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   , a non-statutory allegation that does not describe a unit of prosecution does not constitute a basis for the jury's verdict because it is not part of the legal or factual theory submitted to the jury, even if it is included in the jury charge. The State's legal theory was that Hernandez committed aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The State's factual theory was that Hernandez exhibited or used water as a deadly weapon while he caused Molien bodily injury, and the evidence\n   supported that theory. The State was not bound to prove how Hernandez assaulted Molien or how he exhibited or used water as a deadly weapon as part of its factual theory. There might be a\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   problem if, for example, the State had alleged that Hernandez caused a specific bodily injury, and the jury convicted him on that basis, but an appellate court revised the basis of that conviction because, while there was insufficient evidence to support the pled injury, there was sufficient evidence of another injury to support the conviction. This is because the allegation would be a non-statutory allegation that describes a unit of prosecution for aggravated assault, and in that scenario, Hernandez's conviction would have been sustained based on a factual theory not alleged in the indictment. Similarly, if Hernandez had been indicted for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and the jury convicted him of that offense, but the evidence showed only that he caused the victim serious bodily injury, not that he used a deadly weapon, an appellate court would err in upholding the conviction based on the serious bodily injury because that \"legal theory\" was not presented to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   We must also address the jury charge. The charge contained a paragraph labeled, \"Accusation,\" which restated the by-striking manner-and-means allegation, but the abstract and application portions of the charge refer only to \"bodily injury.\" The issue is which portion of the jury charge controls for a\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   analysis. The relevant portions of the jury charge state that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    Accusation\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   In Count II, the state accuses the defendant of having committed the offense of aggravated assault. Specifically, the accusation is that the defendant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caused bodily injury to Melanie Molien by striking Melanie Molien's head or body with the defendant's hands, and during the commission of this assault the defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon, to-wit: water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    Application of Law to Facts\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   You must determine whether the state has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, three elements.

We are not persuaded.
