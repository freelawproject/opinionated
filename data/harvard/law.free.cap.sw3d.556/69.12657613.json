We reverse and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 7, 2015, Plaintiff filed its petition for breach of contract seeking a deficiency judgment after Defendant failed to make payments on a vehicle he purchased from and financed through Plaintiff. After Plaintiff's first two attempts to serve Defendant were unsuccessful, Defendant was allegedly served on September 21, 2015 with a summons and instructions to appear on September 29, 2015. Defendant failed to appear on September 29, 2015, and the trial court entered a default judgment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 16, 2016, Defendant moved to set aside the default judgment (\"the motion to set aside\") because of improper service; Defendant alleged he had good cause and a meritorious defense. In his\n   motion to set aside, Defendant also requested \"[fourteen] days to answer the Petition or otherwise respond.\" While the motion to set aside was still pending, Plaintiff filed two notices of voluntary dismissal and Defendant filed a proposed answer and counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 27, 2016, the Honorable Norman C. Steimel III (\"Judge Steimel\") entered a judgment (\"the September 2016 Judgment\") stating, (1) the default judgment against Defendant was set aside; (2) the default judgment closed the case at the time it was entered, the only filings allowed on a closed case are motions under Missouri Supreme Court Rules 74.05 or 74.06 (2016), thus, all filings submitted by the parties other than the motion to set aside were \"nullities and of no effect[;]\" (3) \"the parties are now free to file whatever pleadings they deem appropriate[;]\" and (4) the case was continued to the October 25, 2016 docket for \"further announcement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 28, 2016, the day after the default judgment was set aside, Defendant filed his answer and counterclaims. Six minutes later, Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties appeared before Judge Steimel on October 25, 2016. After several months of inactivity, the court entered an order on April 19, 2017 scheduling the matter for the May 5, 2017 docket for setting or disposition. The next day, Defendant applied for a change of judge and the request was granted by the trial court. Plaintiff then moved to strike Defendant's application for change of judge (\"the motion to strike\"), arguing the voluntary dismissal it filed on August 19, 2016, while the motion to set aside was still pending, was effective on the date it was filed and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to take any further action in this case. The motion to strike was denied by Judge Steimel in an \"[o]rder/[j]udgment\" entered on April 28, 2017 (\"the April 2017 Order\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as he found the September 2016 Judgment reset the return date to October 25, 2016, and thus, Defendant's answer and counterclaims filed on September 28, 2016 were timely and operative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The case was thereafter assigned to the Honorable Matthew Thornhill. On May 23, 2017, Plaintiff applied for and was granted a change of judge; the case was then transferred to the Honorable Rebeca M. Navarro-McKelvey (\"Judge Navarro-McKelvey\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 14, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the April 2017 Order (\"the motion to reconsider\"). In support of the motion to reconsider, Plaintiff argued the court had no jurisdiction over the matter after Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. On August 29, 2017, Judge Navarro-McKelvey entered an order and judgment (\"the August 2017 Judgment\") concluding, (1) Defendant's answer and counterclaims were untimely and invalid because Defendant failed to seek leave of the court to file them and no new return date was set; and (2) the voluntary dismissal filed after the default judgment was set aside was valid, ended the case at that time, and the court had no further jurisdiction to act after it was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant then filed the instant appeal from the August 2017 Judgment. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Our Court ordered Plaintiff's motion to dismiss to be taken with the case, and the submission of this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this case, we first consider Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which was taken with the case. Then, we will address Defendant's three points on appeal in the following order. In Defendant's third point on appeal, he argues Judge Navarro-McKelvey had no authority to reconsider the April 2017 Order. In his first and second points on appeal, Defendant asserts Judge Navarro-McKelvey erred in granting Plaintiff's motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Motion Taken with the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We initially consider Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, in which Plaintiff argues Defendant was not aggrieved by the August 2017 Judgment because the court ordered the dismissal without prejudice as to Defendant and Defendant was \"free to file suit against [Plaintiff] in another action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Pursuant to section 512.020 RSMo Supp. 2005,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the right to appeal generally extends to \"[a]ny party to a suit aggrieved by any judgment of any trial court in any civil cause.\" A party is aggrieved by a judgment when: it will directly, prejudicially, and immediately affect the party's personal or property rights or interests; or it practically terminates the case in the form it was filed or in the party's chosen forum.\n   <em>\n    Universal Credit Acceptance, Inc. v. Randall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655912\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/726/#p728\">\n    541 S.W.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (Mo. App. E.D. 2018). We determine whether a party was aggrieved by a judgment by examining the particular facts and circumstances of the case, always remembering the right to appeal is to be construed liberally and any doubts should be resolved in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655912\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/726/#p728\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's motion to dismiss, Defendant maintains he was aggrieved by the judgment he appealed from because it prevents him from bringing his claims against Plaintiff in the form they were filed (counterclaims) or in his chosen forum (state court). We agree. Because the August 2017 Judgment dismissed Plaintiff's petition, Defendant must file his claims as a plaintiff rather than asserting them as counterclaims in the present action. As a result, Defendant would incur additional expenses, his claims could be subject to additional defenses, and Plaintiff might seek to remove the case to federal court where it would be time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations. Liberally construing the right to appeal and resolving any doubts in favor of allowing this appeal to proceed, we find the August 2017 Judgment practically precludes Defendant from asserting his claims in his chosen form and forum, i.e., as counterclaims in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655912\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/726/#p728\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655912\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/726/#p728\">\n    at 728-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly finding). Accordingly, we deny Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and proceed to address the merits of Defendant's points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Judge Navarro-McKelvey had Authority to Reconsider the April 2017 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We now turn to Defendant's third point on appeal, in which he argues Judge Navarro-McKelvey had no authority to reconsider the April 2017 Order. Initially, Defendant asserts motions to reconsider \"have no legal effect in that no [Missouri Supreme Court Rule] provides for such a motion.\" Defendant also contends Judge Navarro-McKelvey erred in reconsidering the ruling previously entered by Judge\n   Steimel. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Garza v. Valley Crest Landscape Maintenance, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , this Court addressed a claim similar to Defendant's initial argument that the Missouri Supreme Court Rules do not contemplate a motion to reconsider.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303979\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/224/61/#p65\">\n    224 S.W.3d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (Mo. App. E.D. 2007). Our Court found the assertion without merit because the only case cited by the appellant was distinguishable as it dealt with a motion to reconsider a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303979\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/224/61/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the ruling that had been reconsidered was interlocutory in nature, this Court found the trial court had continuing jurisdiction over the order and was free to reconsider issues decided therein.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303979\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/224/61/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, we must first determine whether the April 2017 Order was a final judgment or an interlocutory order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303979\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/224/61/#p65\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A final judgment is one that resolves \"all issues in a case, leaving nothing for future determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Transit Cas.

A judgment is final when it fully disposes of the entire merits of the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101059\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/43/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, an interlocutory order \"generally decides some point or matter between the commencement and the end of a suit, but [ ] is not a final decision on the whole controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101059\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/43/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A ruling is interlocutory when it \"adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties.\" Rule 74.01(b);\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

Rather, in denying Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant's application for change of judge, it ruled only on the issues of whether a new return date was set and whether Defendant's answer and counterclaims were timely filed. Further, in finding Defendant's counterclaims were timely and operative, the April 2017 Order left the merits of those claims for future determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the April 2017 Order was not a final judgment, but was interlocutory in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797007\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/717/#p720\">\n    490 S.W.3d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (similarly finding where the trial court's order ruled on only two issues within the case);\n   <em>\n    Klein v.

Finally, the fact that Judge Steimel denominated the ruling as an \"[o]rder/[j]udgment\" does not change our conclusion as it is the substance, content, and effect of the order that determines its finality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaney v. Gleed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8926741\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/169/84/#p85\">\n    169 S.W.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (Mo. App. S.D. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because we have determined the April 2017 Order was an interlocutory order rather than a final judgment, the trial court had authority to reconsider it. Pursuant to Rule 74.01(b), any interlocutory order is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797007\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/717/#p720\">\n    490 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   720-21 ; Rule 74.01(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As such, a trial court has discretion to reconsider, amend, reverse, or vacate an interlocutory order at any time prior to the final judgment being entered.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Koster v. Didion Land Project Association, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845374\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/469/914/#p918\">\n    469 S.W.3d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (Mo.

App. W.D. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendant additionally maintains Judge Navarro-McKelvey erred in reconsidering a previous decision made by Judge Steimel. This argument has been previously rejected by the Western District in\n   <em>\n    Richey v. Meter Investments, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a case in which the appellant asserted one judge erred in overruling a prior motion ruling made by another judge.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9938766\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/680/381/#p384\">\n    680 S.W.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (Mo. App. W.D. 1984). Recognizing that Missouri does not follow the rule that a motion once ruled on cannot be reconsidered, the\n   <em>\n    Richey\n   </em>\n   Court found that to adopt the appellant's position would preclude a trial court from correcting what it later concludes was a mistaken ruling even when it still has jurisdiction over the matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9938766\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/680/381/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court held \"[s]uch a doctrine would militate against the practical and effective administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9938766\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/680/381/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rozansky Feed Co., Inc. v.

Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After default judgment was initially entered against Defendant as a result of his failure to appear on the return date, Defendant moved to set aside the default judgment because of improper service. In his motion to set aside, Defendant also requested \"[fourteen] days to answer the Petition or otherwise respond.\" While the motion to set aside was still pending, Plaintiff filed two notices of voluntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the September 2016 Judgment, Judge Steimel found, (1) the default judgment against Defendant was set aside; (2) the default judgment closed the case at the time it was entered, the only filings allowed on a closed case are motions under Missouri Supreme Court Rules 74.05 or 74.06 (2016), thus, all filings submitted by the parties other than the motion to set aside were \"nullities and of no effect[;]\" (3) \"the parties are now free to file whatever pleadings they deem appropriate[;]\" and (4) the case was continued to the October 25, 2016 docket for \"further announcement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On September 28, 2016, the day after the default judgment was set aside, Defendant filed his answer and counterclaims. Six minutes later, Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 20, 2017, Defendant applied for a change of judge and the request was granted by the trial court. Plaintiff then moved to strike Defendant's application for change of judge, arguing the voluntary dismissal it filed on August 19, 2016, while the motion to set aside the default judgment was still pending, was effective on the date it was filed and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to take any further action in this case. The motion to strike was denied by Judge Steimel in the April 2017 Order, as he found the September 2016 Judgment reset the return date to October 25, 2016, and thus, Defendant's answer and counterclaims filed on September 28, 2016 were timely and operative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After the case was re-assigned per Defendant's request, Plaintiff requested and was granted a change of judge, which led to the case being transferred to Judge Navarro-McKelvey. Plaintiff then filed the motion to reconsider the April 2017 Order, arguing the court had no jurisdiction over the matter after Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. On August 29, 2017, Judge Navarro-McKelvey entered the August 2017 Judgment declaring:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   .... On September 27, 2016, the [c]ourt set aside the default judgment finding it void due to improper service, and declared all prior filings, other than [the] motion to set aside the default, to be null and void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The [c]ourt's order re-opened the case, and the cause was continued to October 25, 2016,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     but this did not constitute a new return date\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added). On September 28, 2016, almost one year after the original return date, the defendant filed [an answer and counterclaims], without seeking leave of the [c]ourt first. Shortly thereafter, also on September 28, 2016, [ ] Plaintiff filed its voluntary dismissal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [ Section 517.031 RSMo 2000 ] requires that counterclaims be filed in writing no later than the return date and time of the summons, unless leave of [c]ourt is sought and granted. Defendant failed to seek leave of the [c]ourt and therefore the answer and counterclaim[s] were not\n   timely filed and are invalid. Plaintiff's properly filed voluntary dismissal took effect immediately upon its filing. The filing of the dismissal was valid and it ended the case. Therefore, the trial court had no jurisdiction to act after the dismissal was filed and did not have authority to issue any further orders including, [the April 2017 Order]. Any orders issued after the September 28, 2016 dismissal have no [effect] and are null and void. [P]laintiff's case is dismissed with prejudice, but [D]efendant is free to file suit against [P]laintiff in another action. ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendant's First Point on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In Defendant's first point on appeal, he asserts Judge Navarro-McKelvey erred in granting the motion to reconsider upon finding the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because his answer and counterclaims were timely filed in that he was not required to seek leave to file them after the default judgment was set aside for improper service.

Defendant's Second Point on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, in Defendant's second point on appeal, he contends Judge Navarro-McKelvey erred in granting the motion to reconsider upon finding the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Judge Steimel set a new return date in the September 2016 Judgment; Defendant's answer and counterclaims were timely filed; and thus, his counterclaims were not dismissed by Plaintiff's subsequent voluntary dismissal. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we find it important to clarify which of Plaintiff's voluntary dismissals is relevant to our analysis, i.e., which one Judge Navarro-McKelvey found took effect immediately upon its filing and deprived the court of jurisdiction over the matter. Plaintiff filed a total of three notices of voluntary dismissal-two were filed while Defendant's motion to set aside was pending and one was filed the day after the default judgment was set aside. The last voluntary dismissal was filed six minutes after Defendant filed his answer and counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the motion to reconsider, Plaintiff argued the court lost jurisdiction over the matter after Plaintiff filed its first notice of voluntary dismissal on August 19, 2016. However, this notice of voluntary dismissal was filed after the case had been effectively closed by the entry of default judgment and before the September 2016 Judgment re-opened the matter by setting aside the default. While Missouri Supreme Court Rule 67.02 (2016)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   allows the plaintiff in a civil action to voluntarily dismiss its claims without court approval any time prior to the swearing in of the jury panel or prior to the introduction of the evidence, the rule presupposes that a \"civil action\" is pending at the time the voluntary dismissal is filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 67.02(a)(1)-(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655912\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/726/#p728\">\n    541 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   729-30 ;\n   <em>\n    Muza v.

Quigless, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As discussed more fully below, Plaintiff has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the motion was taken with the case, and we deny Plaintiff's motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    section II.B. below where we find that although Judge Steimel designated the April 2017 Order as an \"[o]rder/[j]udgment,\" it was an interlocutory order and not a final, appealable judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The statutory reference to section 512.020 is to RSMo Supp. 2005, which incorporates legislative amendments through 2004 and is the latest version of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    All further references to Rule 74.01(b) are to Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2016), which was the version of the Rule in effect at the time the April 2017 Order was entered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Although the April 2017 Order also found Defendant's answer was timely and operative, the answer was not subject to future determination because as explained below, Plaintiff's voluntary dismissal filed after the default judgment was set aside was immediately effective to dismiss Plaintiff's claims under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 67.02 (2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    All further statutory references are to RSMo 2000, which are the latest versions of the statutes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    All further references to Rule 41.01(d) are to Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2014), which was the version of the Rule in effect at the time Plaintiff's petition was filed before an associate circuit judge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    All further references to Rule 67.02 are to Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2016), which was the version of the Rule in effect at the time Plaintiff's voluntary dismissals were filed. Because we have found no law holding Rule 67.02 is inapplicable to a civil action pending in the associate circuit division, and because the parties have not provided us with any, we find Rule 67.02 governs civil actions before an associate circuit judge under Chapter 517.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Clark\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804202\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/488/750/#p758\">\n     488 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    758 ;\n    <em>\n     Manor Square\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9993558\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/854/38/#p41\">\n     854 S.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    41 ; Rule 41.01(d);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
