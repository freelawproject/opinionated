The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Columbia, Missouri, Police Officer Turner Schuster was working in a special enforcement capacity at a sobriety checkpoint when at approximately 12:45 a.m. on August 13, 2016, Mullin drove her vehicle into the checkpoint. When she rolled down her window, Officer Schuster detected a strong odor of intoxicants coming from the vehicle. Mullin's eyes were watery and bloodshot, and she admitted to having consumed alcohol (prior to arrest, she admitted having two drinks; post-arrest, she admitted having three drinks). Officer Schuster asked her to exit the vehicle, and he took her to the sidewalk to Officer Mark Hoehne, the field sobriety testing officer for the checkpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Officer Hoehne made contact with Mullin, he detected a strong odor of intoxicants; her eyes were watery, glassy, and bloodshot; and her speech was slurred. When Officer Hoehne administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, Mullin exhibited all six clues of impairment. He also noticed that Mullin swayed while he was administering the test. He asked her to take a preliminary breath test, but she\n   refused. Officer Hoehne concluded that Mullin was under the influence of intoxicants. Despite her resistance, Officer Hoehne, assisted by Officer Schuster, handcuffed Mullin and arrested her for DWI. Mullin requested an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The officers took Mullin to the mobile response unit. Officer Hoehne informed her that since she requested an attorney, she would be given twenty minutes to contact one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He advised her of her rights under the Missouri Implied Consent Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immediately, Officer Schuster began a fifteen-minute observation period coterminous with the twenty-minute section 577.041.1 time period, during which Mullin made several telephone calls asking for advice but was unable to speak with an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mullin asked the officers numerous questions, including questions regarding the consequences of consenting or refusing to consent to a breath test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Mullin: I have no information, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Schuster: Well, it's, uh, your decision....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Mullin: Okay, so if I refuse to have the breathalyzer, then I have my license revoked for a year, and if I-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Schuster: Yes, ma'am. And let me just explain. If you refuse to submit to a chemical test of your breath, we will apply for a search warrant for your blood, and it will likely be granted. You will then be taken to the hospital where your blood will be drawn. You will be charged with a state misdemeanor instead of a city infraction and your license will be immediately revoked for one year. So, you would be charged with a more serious crime. Your license will be suspended for longer, and Officer Hoehne will apply for a search warrant for your blood and go from there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After twenty minutes, Officer Hoehne again advised Mullin of her rights under the Implied Consent Law. Mullin continued to ask the officers questions regarding what would happen if a blood test or breath test came back above or below 0.08%. The officers informed her that the charging decision was the prosecutor's, not theirs. Mullin asked, \"If I refuse, what happens next? Do I go to the hospital and get a blood test?\" Officer Hoehne responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   No, it's about a two-hour process to apply for and receive a search warrant. And then we go to the hospital, that takes probably anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour, depending on how busy the emergency room is. Then, we go back to the department, fingerprint and photograph-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mullin asked the officers several more times about what she should do:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Mullin: So, can you tell me honestly, is refusing to take the test better for me-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Officer Schuster: I cannot give you legal advice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Mullin: -if I don't believe I'm under the influence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Schuster: I cannot give you legal advice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The officers informed Mullin that her time to contact an attorney had expired and that she needed to give them a yes or no answer as to whether she would submit to a breath test. Mullin agreed to take a breath test, which Officer Hoehne, a certified breath test operator, conducted. Mullin's blood alcohol content was determined to be .142% by weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Director subsequently suspended Mullin's driver's license under section 302.505. Mullin requested an administrative hearing before the Missouri Department of Revenue (\"Department\"). The Department upheld the suspension. Mullin filed a petition for a trial\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   pursuant to section 302.535. At trial, the Director presented the testimony of Officer Schuster and Officer Hoehne and certified copies of Mullin's Missouri driver record, the Department's notice of suspension, Officer Hoehne's Alcohol Influence Report, a copy of the ticket charging Mullin with driving while intoxicated in violation of Columbia Ordinance 14-612, the maintenance reports for the breath test instrument, Officer Hoehne's arrest report, and Officer Schuster's and Officer Hoehne's body camera videos. Mullin's counsel objected to the admission of the breath test result on the grounds that her consent was not voluntary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Officer Schuster informed her before she consented to the breath test that it would be a less serious offense if she consented to the breath test, that a search warrant would be granted if she refused, that she wouldn't get out of jail until 7:00 in the morning if she refused, and that it was a city or a municipal infraction if she consented, and it was a county or state misdemeanor if she refused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Director responded that Mullin's objection was not \"relevant to this proceeding.\" The trial court overruled Mullin's objection. Mullin testified on her own behalf. Following trial, the trial court entered judgment upholding the administrative suspension of Mullin's driver's license. Mullin's motion to reconsider was denied by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mullin timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court's judgment in a driver's license suspension case under section 302.535 is reviewed on appeal as any court-tried civil case.\n   <em>\n    White v.

Specifically, Mullin avers that Officer Schuster falsely informed her that if she consented to a breath test she would be charged with an infraction, and if she refused to consent to a breathalyzer test she would be charged with a more serious crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When reviewing a license suspension under section 302.505.1, the trial court is to determine whether the Director established by a preponderance of the evidence that: \"(1) the driver was arrested on probable cause for violating an alcohol-related offense; and (2) the driver's blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of .08 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/298/#p307\">\n    321 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   309 n.11. In this appeal, Mullin does not challenge the trial court's findings on either of those issues. Rather, she claims that she did not make a voluntary, intentional, and informed decision to submit to the breathalyzer test because of representations made by Officer Schuster, rendering the breath test result inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to Missouri's Implied Consent Law, \"[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent to ... a chemical test or tests of the person's breath, blood, saliva or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol or drug content of the person's blood\" under certain circumstances, including if the person is arrested on reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving while intoxicated. \u00a7 577.020.1(1). \"If a driver refuses to submit to chemical analysis to determine [her] blood alcohol content, that driver's license will be subject to revocation pursuant to section 577.041.\"\n   <em>\n    Allison v.

Mullin does not challenge that Officer Hoehne made two statutorily sufficient requests that she submit to a breathalyzer test and that Mullin understood from the warnings that her license would be revoked for one year if she refused. Instead, she focuses on one of Officer Schuster's responses to her numerous questions concerning the consequences if she refused to submit to a chemical test of her breath: \"You will be charged with a state misdemeanor instead of a city infraction and your license will be immediately revoked for one year.\" Mullin claims that Officer Schuster's \"false and coercive statements and promises\" violated her right to due process because she was promised a mitigation of punishment in exchange for her consent to a breath test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At trial, when the Director asked Officer Schuster whether he told Mullin that if she submitted to a breathalyzer then any offense would be charged as an infraction, the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. From-as best as I remember, my explanation to her was that if she did not submit to a chemical test of her breath, it would be a state-it would be a state charge; whereas, if she did submit to a chemical test of her breath and she had no priors, it would be a city violation. Due to the number of times that Ms. Mullin required me or asked me to explain things to her, I tried to explain things in multiple ways to her.... I may have misspoke and referred to the DWI as an infraction, but the multiple other explanations I gave her, I believe properly explained the situation to her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. Okay.

I did not give Ms. Mullin advice. She was ... allowed to contact an attorney....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On recross-examination, Officer Schuster reiterated that \"I do not give advice, I give explanations.\" When asked whether he explained to Mullin that a state misdemeanor is a more serious crime than an infraction, he answered, \"That a state misdemeanor is more serious than a city ordinance [violation], yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While Officer Schuster did misspeak in calling a municipal DWI ordinance violation an \"infraction\" rather than a misdemeanor, he did not make promises to Mullin regarding punishment. He merely explained to her that in his experience, drivers who refused to take the breathalyzer test were charged with a state violation while drivers who provided a breath sample were charged with a municipal violation.
