On the 12th of July, 1869, the plaintiff sold his interest in the business to the defendant. The agreement of sale provides that the defendant assumes all outstanding claims of the firm of Jacob Stapenhorst <em>&amp; </em>Co. for collection; also to pay with the same all that they owe, and agrees to pay the remaining balance to Jacob Stapenhorst forthwith within thirty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-9\">The plaintiff claims that at the time of the sale, the debts due by the firm amounted to $1,610.99, and that the debts due and owing to the firm amounted to $4,044.05, and seeks to recover under this provision of the agreement the sum of $2,433.46, being the difference between the two accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-10\">The defendant claimed that that was not the true meaning of the instrument. That it does not show, by any proper construction that may be given it, that, thereby Wolff, the defendant, agreed to pay Stapenhorst, the plaintiff, the difference between the debts due to, and the debts owing by, the firm, on the 12th of July, 1868, and which differences amounted to $2,433.46, but that on the contrary the real meaning and interpretation of it, was simply to constitute the defendant the agent of the firm, and of Stapenhorst, to collect the debts due to it, and to pay those owing by it, and entitling Stapenhorst to any balance which, on an accounting, would be shown to be in the defendant\u2019s hands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>after paying all the debts of the firm out of his collection of debts due to the firm. The action was commenced by a summons for relief. The relief demanded by the complaint was in part \u201cthat defendant may be \u2018 \u2018 decreed and compelled to pay over the balance of the \u201cdebts in his hands, collected by him, or which could \u201chave been with due diligence collected by him, and \u201c which amount, after the deduction of said debts due \u201cby the firm, to the sum of $2,433.46, and that he be \u201c decreed to pay said amount to the plaintiff, with interest thereon from August 12, 1869, the time when the \u201c same should have been paid according to said agree\u201cment, besides the costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">Upon the trial, the referee held, that under the agreement the plaintiff was entitled to recover the difference, $2,433.46, between the amount of debts owing by the firm on the 12th of July, 1869, and the amount due to it, it having been proved that on that day the firm owed $1,610.59, and that there was due to it the sum of $4,044.05. Upon this evidence the plaintiff rested. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of failure of proof. This motion was denied, and an exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">The appellant offered no evidence, and appeals from the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-7\"><em>Robert H. Strahan, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-8\"><em>G. Storms </em>Carpenter, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-9\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">The contract contain- \u2022 ing the provision in question is drawn in the German language, and this portion of it is rather obscure in the expression of its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The summons is for relief, and taken in connection with the prayer of the complaint, which is partly for equitable relief, it would seem as if the plaintiff was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>some loss as to what construction he should place on this clause of the agreement of July 12, 1868, when he commenced this action in June, 1870. The evidence shows that previous to the execution of this agreement schedules were made out by the parties, showing the amount of the debts due and owing by the firm, and that the difference between them was this sum of $2,433.46 in favor of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">If it had been the intention of the parties that the defendant should pay this sum to the plaintiff, it would have been the most simple and natural course to have had it so expressed in the instrument, and as becoming due within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Upon reading this provision as it exists in the instrument, and as the parties seem to have themselves at first viewed it, and looking at the surrounding circumstances, it appears to me, that it really means nothing more than that the defendant, Wolff, should collect the debts of the firm, pay its obligations, and then pay over whatever surplus might remain in his hands to the plaintiff, Stapenhorst. Any other interpretation of it is forced and improbable, and not, as it seems to me, warranted by the language employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">I think the construction given to it by the referee is incorrect, and that there should be a reversal of the judgment, with a new trial, and with costs to the defendant to abide the event of the suit. Order of reference also vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
