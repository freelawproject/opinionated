The court charged, that while in cases of murder the presumption is that the defendant is <em>sane, </em>when a man takes his own life the presumption of law is otherwise, and so far as there is any presumption, it favors insanity at the time of committing an act of self-destruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">The charge of the court was correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">It is the settled law of this State, that the phrase \u201c die by his own hand,\u201d does not mean a death while the prisoner is insane (4 <em>Seld. </em>299). The law is now the same in England (How <em>v. </em>Anglo, etc., Life Ins. Co., 7 <em>per </em>N. <em>S. </em>673; 30 <em>L. J. Chane, </em>511; 9 <em>W. R. </em>359; 4 <em>L.

That, in itself alone, unexplained, it raised a legal presumption of insanity. Was the charge correct <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-4\">It is obvious that in the solution of this problem a clear idea and statement of what is the legal definition of the term insanity is primarily and essentially important.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-5\">There have been various definitions of insanity\u2014medical and legal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">So widely have definitions varied, that \u201csome,\u201d says Dr. Grood, \u201care so narrow as to set at liberty half the \u201cpatients at Bethlehem or the Biritre; and others so \u201cloose and capacious as to give a straight-waistcoat to \u201c half the world \u201d <em>(Dean, </em>457).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-7\">Prof. Dean then proceeds to give a number of the definitions propounded by writers and thinkers on the subject (q. v. p. 458). John Locke considered madmen as not having lost the reasoning faculty, but that, in j oining together incongruous ideas, they mistake them for truths, and err as men do that argue right from wrong principles. Dr. Battie defines madness to consist in false perceptions. Dr. Chrichton defines the disease as consisting in general derangement of the mental faculties, in which deceived perceptions are mistaken for realities. Dr. Connolly considers it to consist in the impairment of any one or more faculties of the mind, accompanied with or inducing a defect in the comparing faculty. Dr. Heville defines it to consist in disordered functions of the brain generally, or of one of its several parts, without consciousness of this derangement on the part of the individual affected. Dr. Spurzheim defines it to be \u201can aberration of any sensation or intellectual power from the healthy state, without being able 'to distinguish the diseased state; or again, an aberration of the manifestations of the mind from their ordinary normal healthy state.\u201d This last seems to be specially approved by Prof. Dean, pp. 458, 459.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>But, however defined, it is now conceded to \"be a <em>disease, </em>and substantially conceded to be a disease of the brain <em>(Dean, </em>p. 459).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\">In its characteristics and manifestations, insanity has been divided into intellectual and moral insanity <em>(Dean, </em>p. 488), according as the disease is manifested, more particularly in the intellectual power and faculties, or in the emotions, passions, and feelings <em>(Ib.).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">In strictly legal definitions, Lord Hale seemed to regard insanity as diminishing the mental faculties instead of deranging them. In Arnold\u2019s trial, the doctrine was stated that total deprivation of understanding and memory, so that the accused knew what he was doing no more than an infant, than a brute, than a wild beast, were necessary to exempt from punishment <em>(Dean, </em>pp\u201e 532, 533). In Hadfield\u2019s case the definition was greatly enlarged. Total deprivation of reason was held not necessary, and derangement sufficient <em>(Dean, </em>355). In Percival\u2019s case, Lord Mansfield held that the test was whether the accused had sufficient understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong <em>(Dean, </em>537).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">This seems generaEy to have been the received doctrine since, except as it has in some cases been modified by requiring a knowledge of the wrong of the particular act he was then doing <em>(Dean, </em>539, 540, and see a <em>r\u00e9sum\u00e9 </em>of the different doctrines held on p. 544 of <em>Dean).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-8\">The test is, are the suspected actions the offspring of a healthy or a diseased brain <em>% </em>If of a healthy brain, the person should be held responsible, no matter how extraordinary the act. If of a diseased brain, not responsible, no matter how simple or common the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-9\">And if we are right in our definition of insanity, the question presented by the charge is, whether the act of suicide is <em>prim\u00e1-faeie </em>evidence that the relations of the suicide to external nature has been changed by disease of the brain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-10\">On that point we must first remember the wonderful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>strength in the natural, sane man, of the. love of life. \u201cAll that a man hath will he give in exchange for his life.\u201d \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friend.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-5\">Of course, the fact of suicide is conclusive evidence that in the patient this love of life is extinguished\u2014 conclusive evidence that the relations of the suicide to external nature had \"been changed. The simple question then is, is it fair to presume that such change was induced by disease of the brain <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-6\">We apprehend that few would deny that by far the greater number of cases of suicide are cases of insanity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">All writers on insanity state that a tendency to suicide is one of the most frequent manifestations of insanity <em>(Dean, </em>p. 508, and see the curious cases referred to.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">So far as there is any direct judicial decision on this point, it would seem to be in accord with the charge as delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">In Borradale <em>v. </em>Hunter, 5 <em>Mann and G. </em>647, the jury found that deceased threw himself into the water, intending to destroy himself, but added that previous to that time there was no evidence of insanity. Mr. Justice Erkskihe, however, told them that they must <em>lake the act itself </em>into consideration in connection with his previous conduct, and then say whether, at the time of its commission, they thought him capable of knowing right from wrong. They then found him incapable. That direction does not seem to have been questioned in the further progress of that case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-10\">The question appeals to the knowledge of the court derived from whatsoever source it may be, and founded upon human experience, as to whether, in the majority of cases of suicide, the cause is not mental disease. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-11\">If it be so, then the conclusion is correct, that from the mere naked act of self-destruction, with no statement of surrounding circumstances, the presumption is that insanity was the cause.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Barbour, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATZ\">This was an action upon a life insurance policy, which contained this condition : \u201cIn case he\u201d (the person whose life was covered) \u201cshall die by his own hand . . then the said company shall not be liable for the payment of the sum insured, or any part thereof.\u201d Upon the trial, evidence was given, tending to prove the following facts: Just previous to the</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">taking of the policy, Coffey, the person whose life was insured for the. benefit of his wife, the plaintiff, was insolvent and out of business, and had a wife and several children dependent upon him for their support. While thus situated, he procured insurances upon his life to the amount of some $40,000, mostly in favor of his wife, borrowing the money from his friends to pay the premiums thereon upon the false statement that he wanted the same for his expenses in carrying into effect some pretended land sales. A short time after he effected those insurances, Coffey took his passage on a steamboat from Louisville to Cincinnati, where during the trip he went into his stateroom, and although the weather was quite warm, locked and fastened the doors and windows. After the arrival of the boat at Cincinnati, the next morning, the door of the stateroom was broken open, when he was found to be in a comatose state, and the next night he died from the effects, as then appeared on examination, of an overdose of morphine. Other evidence was also given of circumstances which tended to prove that his death was caused by his own voluntary act in a sane state of mind, and in pursuance of a preconceived plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The judge, before whom the cause was tried, charged the jury <em>inter </em>alia, thus : When a man takes the life of another, and alleges insanity as an excuse and defence, he is met by the presumption of law that he was sane, and he must remove or rebut such presumption, by showing affirmatively, and by competent and sufficient proof, that he was insane when he committed the deed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>But when a man tafees his own life, the presumption of law is otherwise. The law does not and cannot pre\u00f1\u00f3me that a man in the full possession of his mental </em>, <em>faculties, in that normal condition of mind which we call </em>sanity, <em>will deliberately tafee Ms own life; and therefore, so far as there is any presumption, it favors insanity at the time of committing an act of self-destruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\n<em>I therefore charge you as matter of law, that as affecting this case, you must presume that the deceased when he toofc his life was not in a sound state of mind.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>It is, however, but a mere presumption, and may be removed by evidence. But as I have said before, the burthen of removing it lies upon the defendants, and it is for you to say whether they have done so.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The question raised by the exceptions to this portion of the charge of the learned judge is somewhat novel and important. It has long been a well-settled rule in the law of evidence, that where the deed or act of a party is sought to be avoided on the ground of his insanity, he will be presumed to be of sound mind until the contrary shall appear, and therefore that the burthen of proving such party to have been insane, rests upon him who alleges it. Indeed, the rule that sanity is to be presumed until the contrary be proven, is a general one, applicable to all cases, and its reason is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">It is founded upon the fact that general sanity is the natural and ordinary condition of the human mind, and that mankind, considered as a class or whole, are sane (the exceptions being comparatively few and rare), followed by the natural conclusion that each individual may well be assumed to be like the great mass of his fellow-men in that regard, unless proven to be otherwise (1 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a742; 2 <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 689, 373; 3 <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5 ; 2 <em>Kent's Com. </em>\u00a7 451; <em>Bliss on Life Ins. </em>\u00a7 378 ; McNaghtin\u2019s Case, 10 <em>Clarke &amp; Fin. </em>210; Gardner <em>v. </em>Gardner, 22 <em>Wend. </em>526. Aside from extrinsic facts and circmn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>stances, therefore, the law presumes that every person who destroys Ms. own life is sane up to the very moment when he does the act which causes his death. Can it properly be said, then, that the commission of that act not only removes the presumption of sanity, but establishes a legal presumption that he was then insane 1</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Ho presumption that insanity exists in the case supposed, can be deduced from the mere fact that the death of the person was caused by his own physical act; for every legal presumption of a fact of that character must be founded upon and derived from some other fact or facts with which it is usually or always found, as the result of general experience and knowledge, to be connected in a certain relation (1 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a7 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">There can be no doubt, however, that if courts were at liberty to assume as a fact established by experience, that all persons who intentionally deprive themselves of life are insane, or diseased in mind, or even such a majority of them, that it might properly be said that persons who thus destroy their lives are, as a general rule, insane, and that sanity is a mere exception; the legal conclusion that insanity or derangement of mind must be presumed in every case in which it appeared that the man intentionally caused Ms own death, would necessarily follow. But that fact is not so established. Hot only is the history of the world in former times filled with instances in which great and sound-minded men, such as Cato and Hannibal, have committed suicide, and where others have for the purpose of saving their estates from forfeiture, submitted themselves to the <em>peine forte et </em>dure, but the most learned men of the present day in this branch of mental science, not mere lawyers, are still groping for the truth in the twilight of doubt and peradventure. Indeed, it is by no means settled, either among educated men or in the common mind, that even a majority of those who deprive themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of life by their own physical act, do so because of insanity. The fact cannot be legally presumed, therefore, that a person who has killed himself was not sane at the time, and consequently the charge in question was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The most that can be said is, that inasmuch as many, and perhaps most persons who destroy their own lives, are insane at the time, the fact of such self-destruction of itself wholly removes the presumption of sanity (see Cooper <em>v. </em>Mass., etc., Ins. Company, 102 <em>Mass. R. </em>227; Terry <em>v. </em>Mutual Life Ins. Company, 1 <em>Dillon\u2019s R. </em>403).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Judgment reversed with costs, and new trial directed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b332-6\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">I amobliged reluctantly to differ with the learned judge, in charging the jury that the law presumed that a man was insane who killed himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">First.

Coffee in favor of the latter\u2019s wife, the plaintiff in the action. The policy, among other provisions to avoid it, contained a clause that, in case the assured should die by Ms own hand, the company should not be liable for the payment of the sum insured or any part thereof. .In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Breasted v. The Farmers\u2019 Loan, and Trust Co. (4 <em>Seld. </em>299), the policy contained precisely the same clause, and the Court of Appeals, in sustaining the decision of the Supreme Court in the same case (4 <em>Hill, 73), </em>and disapproving the English doctrine of Borradale <em>v. </em>Hunter, <em>5 </em>Man. <em>&amp; Gr. </em>648, and Cliff <em>v. </em>Schwabe, 3 <em>Man. &amp; Gr. </em>437, settled the law of this State to be, that the phrases \u201cdeath by his own hand,\u201d and \u201cdeath by suicide,\u201d mean the same thing, and that both, unless qualified by some other expressions, import a criminal act of self-destruction, whicli can be committed only by the free will of a sane man.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The learned judge who presided at the trial was correct, therefore, in charging that, if Coffee, at the time he took the poison, was insane, if he was then laboring under either permanent or temporary insanity, he did not die by his own hand within the true meaning of that phrase, and that consequently there was no breach of the condition of the policy in that respect. Indeed, no error whatever seems to have been committed in giving and refusing instructions to the jury, provided the learned judge was justified in refusing to charge, that the presumption of sanity attaches to the commission of suicide, and in charging, in place thereof, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cThe law does not and cannot presume that a man \u201c in the full possession of his mental faculties, in that \u201cnormal condition of mind which we call sanity, will \u201c deliberately take his own life; and therefore, so far as \u201c there is any presumption, it favors insanity at the time \u201cof committing an act of self-destruction. <em>* </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cI therefore charge you as matter of law that there is \u201cno such presumption, and that as affecting this case \u201cyou must presume that the deceased, when he took \u201c his life, was not in a sound state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cIt is, however, but a mere presumption, and may \u201cbe removed by evidence.

They have shown that the assured was \u201cin a pecuniarily embarrassed condition ; was in debt, \u201cand prosecuted and harassed by his creditors. They \u201c have also shown that at or about the time he effected \u201c the insurance in this case, he procured other policies \u201c upon his life in other companies, all for the benefit of \u201chis wife, and amounting in the aggregate to forty \u201cthousand dollars; and they have further proved the \u201csubstance of a conversation between the deceased and \u201ca lawyer of Cincinnati, in which he sought information and advice respecting the legal effect of the con- \u2018\u00a3 dition against self-destruction in the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cThese facts and circumstances are submitted to you \u201c as tending to show, as is claimed, a motive, and there\u201cby to repel the presumption of insanity, and it is for \u201cyou to say whether you believe they are sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The question thus presented is an important, novel, and difficult one. It is an open one in this State, and as the few adjudications made elsewhere upon it (Nimick <em>v. </em>The Mutual Life Ins. Co., 10 <em>Am. Law Reg., </em>N. <em>S. </em>101; Terry <em>v. </em>The Mutual Life Ins. Co., 1 <em>Dillon, </em>403; St. Louis Mutual Life Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Graves, reported in 6 <em>W. P. D. Bush, </em>268, and also in N. <em>Y. Daily Transcript </em>of March 7th, 1871, in which last-named case the Kentucky Court of Appeals stood equally divided) are conflicting,' it must be decided on principle. Fortunately, in this case its consideration is not embar \u25a0 rassed by other questions, which are usually connected with it and relate to the different forms or species of insanity known to the law. For the charge has not been excepted to in that respect; nor has the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of insanity, which was laid down for the guidance of the jury, been complained of in any manner, t\u00edo, by omitting to move for the direction of a verdict, the defendant has conceded the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s evidence to carry the case at least to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Freed, therefore, from all embarrassments which the intervention of other questions might occasion, I think the examination of the point at issue may be commenced in the most fitting manner, by considering for a moment what <em>IAfe </em>is. The definitions of it given by philosophers and biologists are almost innumerable. But none of them commends itself so much to my mind, as that given by Professor Herbert Spencer, who deservedly ranks in scientific circles as one of the greatest of modem thinkers. It is, that Life consists in the definite combination of heterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive, in correspondence with external co-existences and sequences, or in other words, in the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations. Consequently, Life is a continuous struggle. All vital actions, considered not separately, but in their ensemble, have for their final purpose the balancing of certain outer processes, by certain inner processes. There are increasing external forces tending to bring the matter of which organic bodies consist, into that state of stable equilibrium displayed by inorganic bodies ; there are internal forces by which this tendency is constantly antagonized ; and the perpetual changes which constitute Life, may be regarded as incidental to the maintenance of the antagonism. So strong is this antagonism in the human organism, that while there is life there is hope. The strength in the natural, sane man, of the love of life is indeed proverbial. Drowning men will catch at straws. All that a man has, will he give in exchange for his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">From individual organisms thus struggling for life, small aggregations were formed, which soon felt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>want of alliance and union with each other. This led to the formation of civil society, and the formation of that necessarily led to the establishment of government, for the express purpose of preserving and keeping that society in order. Thus it came, that every member of the society had to submit to a restraint by human laws of his natural liberty, to do as he pleased in his struggle for life and existence ; and that judges, juries, and all the instruments of the law came into being. Whenever it was found necessary or expedient, on account of new manifestations of the tendency on the part of the strong to subjugate the weak, in spite of existing law, to extend and perfect the prevailing system of law, it was done. In the course of the general improvement which our system has thus undergone, the doctrine of presumptive evidence became engrafted upon it. The presumptions recognized by the law were founded, either upon the first principles of justice, or the laws of Nature, or the experienced course of human conduct and affairs, and the connection usually found to exist between certain things. Under these circumstances it was found indispensably necessary for the proper enforcement of the whole body of the law, and essential to the safety of society, to establish the rule that, because sanity is the normal condition of the intellect, every man should be presumed to be sane, and that under the effect of such presumption, he who seeks to avoid responsibility for an act on the plea that he was insane, and hence not responsible, should take upon himself the burden of proving that condition of his mind. The rule was accordingly established, and upon it has since been built the further one, that every sane person must be presumed to intend that which is the ordinary and natural consequence of his own purposed act. Both these presumptions have ever since been firmly maintained, and rigidly enforced. They are applied, and justly so, to the murderer, the homicide, the parricide, and the living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>animal of every grade ; for the experience of mankind has demonstrated that even the most atrocious crime is generally perpetrated in the course of the struggle for life and existence, with the deliberate purpose of effecting by its commission' an adjustment of internal relations to external relations. The presumption of sanity attaches, therefore, to a man in all his dealings with his fellow-men.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">But in case of suicide, the reason for the rule fails, and the necessity for its application disappears. Suicide is self-destruction. It is a self-inflicted, violent, and summary severance of relations, contrary to the ordinary laws of Nature. It is a refusal to obey Nature\u2019s law, and, therefore, in the light of the present state of science, such an unnatural proceeding, that eminent men of great learning and research insist that suicide is necessarily an insane act, while others contend that it is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of insanity. The first proposition has never been accepted to any great extent; but the second is quite prevalent among scientific men, and is daily gaining ground <em>(Winslow\u2019s Anatomy of Suicide, </em>ch. 11, p. 237; <em>Esguirol's Maladies </em>Mentales, vol. 1, pp. <em>559, 560; Ellis on </em>Insanity, <em>London Edition of </em>1838, pp. 114,115; <em>Prichard, London Edition of </em>1842, pp. 134, 141; <em>Bernard &amp; Tuke on Insanity, Philadelphia Edition, </em>1858, pp. 88, 153, 202, 204, 331; <em>Dean\u2019s Medical Jurispr. </em>pp. 508, 509).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">As,the law should always keep step with the great truths that are unearthed from time to time by science, the courts, upon these authorities, might well hold, and in my judgment should hold, in a case like the present, that\u2014while upon the whole case the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to satisfy the jury that a loss has occurred under the policy, that is to say, that the person whose life is covered by the policy was insane at the time of the perpetration of the deed within the true definition of that term in the law\u2014the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to be drawn from the naked and unexplained fact of suicide is, that the perpetrator at the time of the fatal act was not in the possession of a sane and well-poised mind. Such presumption, like other presumptions of a similar character, is by no means conclusive, but may be removed by evidence. It becomes neutralized and inoperative as soon as a motive for the commission of the act is shown by evidence. Upon this latter point the charge of the learned judge below is wholly unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">As long as the presumption of insanity is thus applied and enforced, harmony will prevail between science and law, and no evil results can accrue to society. For the danger to be dreaded does not lie in the presumption, which, as such, may be rebutted and overcome by proof in each case, but in the doctrine of moral and emotional insanity, and of temporary insane impulses ; or, to be still more specific, in the vague and unsatisfactory definition sometimes laid down by the courts for that species of insanity and that class of impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The fact, which is generally alluded to, to sustain the opposite doctrine, that men of historic fame, such as Themistocles, Demosthenes, Hannibal, and Cato, committed suicide, without the imputation or suspicion of impelling insanity, cannot have much weight at this late day. Insanity, as now understood, was not known then, nor were the unerring and immutable laws of Hature then known and understood to the same perfection as they are now. So it may also be safely assumed that each of these men shared the mythological notions of his age. The ancients seem very generally to have arrogated to themselves the right to destroy their own lives, whenever, in their judgment, it should be proper. Pliny was accustomed to term it the greatest privilege the gods had left in the power of men, amid the calamities of human life. Judge Robertson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, very properly remarked of these historic men: \u201c Without faith in a future state of retribution, they seemed, each and all, to prefer, on rational calculation, annihilation to hopeless torture or degradation.\u201d With the Christian era, however, came a change of views and of feeling in that respect, and Christian rulers set to work to suppress the barbarous practice. Thus it came, that under the common law suicide was declared to be a crime, and visited with punishment as such. As the criminal could not be reached himself, for the reason that by the very act of .suicide, he had placed himself beyond the reach of human punishment, the penalty consisted in denying the body of the criminal Christian burial, and in the forfeiture of his goods to the king.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Nor can I appreciate the force of the reasoning of the learned chief justice in this case, in first denying that insanity can be presumed, and then holding, that the most that can be said is, that inasmuch as many, and perhaps most, persons who destroy their lives are insane at the time, the fact of such self-destruction, of itself, wholly removes the presumption of sanity. If suicide is the unnatural proceeding I have shown it to be, and the fact of self-destruction wholly removes the presumption of sanity, because many, and perhaps most, .persons who destroy their lives are insane at the time, I can see no escape from the conclusion, that the naked and unexplained fact of suicide must be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the existence of insanity at the time of the perpetration of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">I have also carefully examined the recent case of Fowler <em>v. </em>The Mutual Life Ins. Co., 4 <em>Lans. </em>202, but do not consider it in point here. It seems to have been determined, on the strength of the declarations made by the assured shortly before his death, and which, in the judgment of the court, conclusively established the fact, that his subsequent suicide was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>entirely voluntary, deliberate, wilful, and with knowledge of its nature, character, and consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Being unable to discover any error in the instructions given and refused on the trial, and defendants\u2019 exceptions to the -admission and exclusion of testimony by the court having been found, on examination, to be untenable, I am of the opinion that the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
