That the defendant, Richard B. Connolly, comptroller of the city of New York, did not appear in the action, or answer the complaint therein. That the defendant, William P.

(5). 1STow, no one can deny that if Louis Muller had waited until the first day of March, 1869, and had then paid all the taxes and assessments on lots thirty-six and thirty-seven, he would, if there had been no proceedings taken for the acquisition of those lots by the city, have been entitled to remove the buildings in question during the month of April, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">There is nothing in the lease itself which prohibited Louis Muller from waiting until the last moment, and then paying the taxes and assessments, and thereby preserving his right to the buildings, <em>(c). </em>The commissioners therefore, we submit, were not right in assuming that Muller would make default in the payment of the taxes and assessments, or that he had in any way forfeited, at the time their report was made up, his right to remove the buildings, nor to an award for their value, <em>(cl). </em>Clearly the commissioners had no right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>assume that there had been a forfeiture of Louis Muller\u2019s right to remove the buildings, and that the title to said buildings, and to an award for their value, had become vested in the defendant Earle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\"><em>Second Point. </em>There had been no forfeiture of Louis Muller\u2019s right to remove the buildings on lots thirty-six and thirty-seven at the time the report of the commissioners was made, nor at the time it was confirmed. <em>(a). </em>The lease from Whitney to Alois Muller contained the usual clause, that if the lessee failed to keep or made default in any of the covenants therein contained on his part, the lessor might then <em>re-enter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">The breach of this condition did not work an <em>absolute </em>forfeiture of the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">It could be considered a forfeiture only at the <em>election-</em>of the lessor, and the case clearly shows that Earle never elected to consider the lease as forfeited (Clark <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 <em>Denio, </em>516; Stuyvesant Davis, 9 <em>Paige,, </em>427; Arnsby <em>v. </em>Woodward, 6 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress, </em>p. 519).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">Earle, as landlord, had done nothing indicating his intention to insist that there had been a forfeiture of the lease by the lessee, nor had he re-entered or taken any steps showing that he elected to consider the lease as void <em>(Ib. </em>519).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">The taxes and assessments upon the lots had been standing for several years, and it was too late for Earle to elect to consider the lease as forfeited, even if he wished to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\"><em>Third Point. </em>Again, even if a tenant has forfeited his lease, by a neglect to pay a certain sum of money, a court of equity will in general relieve him from the forfeiture, where the interest can be calculated with certainty (Baxter <em>v. </em>Lansing, 7 <em>Paige, </em>350; Jackson v. Brownson, 7 <em>John. </em>235; <em>Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, </em>sec. 495).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">And in this case it would be competent for the court, acting on this principle, to make such a decree as would. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>do justice between the parties, to wit, by adjudging that the plaintiff pay off the taxes and assessments, with the accrued interest, and that the balance of the value of his buildings be paid to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">\n<em>And such is the prayer for judgment.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\"><em>Fourth Point. </em>But if there ever was a forfeiture on the part of Louis Muller, that forfeiture had been waived by the defendant Earle by the receipt of rent from Muller, subsequent to the alleged breach of the covenant. <em>(a). </em>The evidence shows that the defendant Earle continued to receive rent from Louis Muller up to the 18th day of March, 1868, or eighteen days after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, and, of course, after the alleged forfeiture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">Such a receipt operated as a waiver of the forfeiture, if any forfeiture had occurred (Jackson <em>v. </em>Sheldon, 5 Cowan, 448; Hunter <em>v. </em>Osterhoudt, 11 <em>Barb. </em>33; Bleecker <em>v. </em>Smith, 13 <em>Wend. </em>530).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\"><em>Fifth. </em>The suggestion contained in the opinion of the Chief Justice, that there had been an award to the plaintiff for $200 by the commissioners, is no answer to the claim of the plaintiff, <em>(a). </em>In his opinion the Chief Justice admits that the award \u201c was <em>very </em>small, and \u201cthat it is quite possible that nothing was included \u201c therein, for the value of the buildings or materials, \u201c when removed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-9\">It is, with great deference, contended by the appellant that, by the record in this case, it must be considered as having been determined that <em>no allowance was made in the award to Muller for the value of the buildings.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-10\">The Chief Justice has <em>found, as matter of fact, that the award to Earle comprehended and included the buildings which have been erected by the plaintiff.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-11\">Such being the case, the inequity of allowing Earle to receive the value of the buildings, it seems to us, must strike any candid mind. <em>(b). </em>The injustice perpetrated upon Muller by the commissioners can best be seen by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the award made hy them to Masterson. Masterson was the assignee of that part of the Whitney lease which related to lot No. 33.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">Masterson, for his Building, on one lot, was allowed By the commissioners $5,600, and for his lease $2,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s Buildings were worth much more than Masterson\u2019s, as would have Been shown if the report of the appraisers had not Been excluded By the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">There was no reason why Louis Muller should not have Been allowed, <em>upon doing </em>equity, to wit: upon <em>paying up </em>the <em>taxes </em>and <em>assessments, to receive equity </em>By an <em>award </em>for his <em>leasehold interest and the value of his buildings.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">Muller\u2019s lease had fourteen months to run, the same as Masterson\u2019s; and it is mockery to say that the value of such an interest and of the Buildings amounted to no more than $200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">Besides, the case shows that the greater part of unpaid assessments and taxes were imposed on lot 33 (Masterson\u2019s).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-10\"><em>Sixth. </em>The plaintiff was not precluded, Because he appeared Before the commissioners and claimed an. award to the Buildings, from maintaining this action. <em>(a). </em>The decision of the commissioners, as to the question who is the owner of the property taken for a proposed improvement, is not Binding upon the rival claimants, if there are such, and an error in making a decision on the part of the commissioners will always Be corrected By the courts By decreeing the award made By the commissioners to the <em>actual </em>owner (Matter of Central Park Extension, 16 Abbott, 64).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-11\">In that case Judge Ingraham says :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-12\">\u201cIf the commissioners should err in awarding to the \u201cwrong persons the damages, no injury can accrue. <em>lt The true owner can recover the money if paid, </em>or \u201cmay, By <em>injunction, stay </em>the <em>payment </em>and have his \u201cclaim investigated,\u201d etc. <em>(Ib. </em>p. 64).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>It is quite immaterial, therefore, what the commissioners decided as to the respective claims of Earle and Muller, under the lease, to the buildings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">Those claims could <em>only finally </em>be settled by a court <em>(Laws, </em>1813, sec. 178, p. 408; William and Anthony Streets, 19 <em>Wend. </em>678; John and Cherry Streets, 19 <em>Wend. </em>657; Palliet v.

Martin, </em>of counsel for respondent,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqmY\">urged:\u2014I. The buildings erected on the land became the property of the owner of the fee, subject to the tenant\u2019s license to remove such as he had erected, on payment of all taxes and assessments, and removing them one month before the termination of the lease on the 28th day of February, 1868 (Elmers v. Mann, 3 <em>East, </em>38; Austin v. Stevens, 24 <em>Me. 520, 528; </em>Mathinet v. Geddings, 10 <em>Ohio, </em>364).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-7\">II. By failing to pay such taxes and remove the buildings as required by the lease, the tenant lost all claim thereto, and any award for the value of them properly belonged to Earle (Worthington v. Young, 8 <em>Ham., Ohio, </em>401, and cases cited under last point).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-8\">III. The only testimony material to the plaintiff\u2019s case was such as tended to sho w that he, or his assignor, erected the buildings, paid the taxes, and removed the buildings pursuant to the precedent condition of the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-9\">All other testimony was wholly irrelevant and immaterial.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-10\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">The construction which I have given to the provision in the lease, in respect to the right of the lessee to remove the buildings, renders it unnecessary to examine the exception relating to the alleged insufficiency of the evidence of the non-payment of taxes or assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The covenant to pay taxes and assessments, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>a covenant running with the land so as' to \"bind the estate in the hands of an assignee (Demarest <em>v. </em>Willard, <em>8 Cow. </em>206), is a personal covenant for the breach of which an action will lie without any payment by the lessor (Rector, &amp;c., Trinity Church <em>v. </em>Higgins, 48 <em>N. Y. R. </em>532). At any time during the term, and whenever and as often as default was made by the lessee, payment could have been enforced by action by the lessor. It was not necessary to wait until the expiration of the term or to look solely to the proviso in the lease ; but the right of action was complete, on any default of payment by the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The right reserved to the lessee ,to remove the buildings upon the demised premises at the expiration of the term, is limited by the condition that the lessee shall have kept and performed all the covenants and agreements of the lease ; and the construction of this condition by the court at Special Term was, that the default of the tenant happening before and continuing to the time the lands were condemned, operated as a forfeiture of his right to remove the buildings, and therefore of his right to any award for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The right to remove the buildings extended by the terms of the lease to the end of the term, and could be exercised at any time during the term, or on the day it terminated; and such right was qualified only by the \u25a0condition that the lessee had paid all taxes or assessments laid upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">If, at the time this right of removal terminated by its limitation, taxes or assessments were unpaid, the condition would operate; the buildings and improvements would become the property of the lessor, and the lessee\u2019 s right of removal would cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">But this effect of the condition is, I think, confined to a termination of the lease and term <em>by the effluxion of </em>time, and to a state of things within the supposed contemplation of the parties, and not to a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the estate and of the relations of the parties hy operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">No right of re-entry for breach of covenant or condition is given by the lease, and the right to remove the-buildings was, therefore, restricted as a security for, or indemnity against, taxes and assessments. For it Avasdoubtless the intention of the lessor to secure their payment by providing a <em>quasi </em>forfeiture if there should be default. But it is very clear that although the covenant to pay could be enforced at any time, the condition could not operate except on the expiration of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In this case, the estates of the lessor and of the lessee-terminated at the same time and in the same manner. The act which authorizes the condemnation of lands for public purposes provides <em>(Laws, </em>1813, \u00a7 178) that, upon confirmation of the commissioners\u2019 report, the city shall be seized in fee of the lands; and further (\u00a7 181), that thereupon all leases, or other contracts respecting-the lands so taken, shall cease and determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">It is found as a fact that the'commissioners of estimates appraised the value of the buildings upon the-demised premises at nine thousand five hundred dollars, and that their report was confirmed by the court on the-28th of February, 1888. Upon such confirmation, the title to the land and to the buildings and improvements-thereon became vested in the corporation of the city of New York, and the awards for damages became the property of the parties entitled to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Until, therefore, this legal transfer to the corporation, the condition in. the lease was unaffected, and inoperative to deprive the lessee of his buildings.\" By this, transfer, the award was substituted in the place of the buildings, and the lessee was possessed of the same right in respect to it that he had theretofore possessed in respect to the buildings. He could not have his buildings, and it is doubtful if, during the pending proceedings to condemn the land, he could lawfully have-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>removed them. He. was not bound to remove them. That right, at least as between him and Ms landlord, had not and could not be terminated until the expiration of the term of the demise, and until it was so terminated the landlord had no claim whatever upon the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">But, upon the confirmation of the commissioners\u2019 report, the rights of the lessee were transferred to the award, and as between him and the lessor, were probably subject to the condition contained in the lease, so-far at least as to require the payment by the lessee of all taxes and assessments for which he was liable under his covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The breach of the condition did not at any time work a forfeiture of the estate of the lessee. There was no-right of entry or words of forfeiture, and it could operate only after the estate had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">But if it was in the nature of a forfeiture, it c.ould be relieved ; and it would, I think, be the duty of the court to adjust the equities between the parties in furtherance of justice (Baxter <em>v. </em>Lansing, 7 Paige, 350).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">In The Rector, &amp;c., of Trinity Church <em>v. </em>Higgins <em>(supra), </em>the action was upon the covenant to pay assessments, and a recovery was had for the amount of the unpaid assessments, although no part had been paid by the covenantee. The court, in speaking of a recovery under such circumstances, recognizes the equitable power of the court to grant to the covenantor adequate and proper relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">As it was found as a fact that the buildings belonged to the plaintiff, it follows, I think, that the damages for their being taken should have been awarded to him. That it has been also found that their value was included in the award to the defendant Earle, and after-wards paid to Mm, does not divest, and cannot deprive, the plaintiff of his right to claim them ; and his action is therefore properly brought to recover money received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>But as the defendant, \"before receiving the award, was required to, and did pay certain taxes and assessments, which were claimed to be liens on the demised premises, and which, if liens, the plaintiff had covenanted to pay, the defendant should be allowed to deduct the amount with interest, upon establishing that they were liens upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The judgment, I am of opinion, should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
