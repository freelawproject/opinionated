Review of cases upon this point (Orser \u00ae. Grossman, 11 <em>How. Pr. P. </em>520; Kuhlman \u00ab. Orser, 5 <em>Due)', </em>242 ; Clarke \u00bb. Goodrich, 41 AT\". <em>Y. </em>210).</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b79-7\">Before Monell, Curtis, and Sedgwick, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b79-8\"><em>Decided June </em>29, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">Appeal from a judgment and order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">The action was upon a policy of insurance made Tby the defendants to one E. S. Chandler, Jr., against loss Tby fire to his property at Belleville, Florida. The property was destroyed Tby fire on the 36th of October, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-11\">On the 3d of February, 1869, certain creditors of Chandler commenced an action against him in the Supreme Court of this State, in which action they procured an attachment under the 337th section of the Code, and delivered it to the plaintiff, who, as he claimed, attached under it the claim against the defendants arising under the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-12\">The deputy sheriff testified that he served a copy of the attachment upon the defendants, and asked if they had any property belonging to Chandler, and was told that they did not know at that time what property of his was in their possession. He said nothing to the company about a policy of insurance. Ho written or printed notice of any kind was served on the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-13\">Ho other evidence was given in respect to the levy of the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-14\">After giving evidence of the loss, the plaintiff rested, ' and the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground (amongst others) that there was no evidence in the case that any levy was ever made upon the policy of insurance issued by the defendant in this action, or upon any claim for money alleged to be due under said policy ; that there was no evidence in the case that any notice was served upon the defendants by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the sheriff, specifying that a levy was intended to be made, or was made, under any attachment upon said policy or contract of insurance, or upon any money or debt or demand due or alleged to be due by virtue thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-4\">The motion was denied, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFz\">The jury found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AC\">The defendants appealed from the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-7\"><em>Mr. George W. Parsons, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-8\"><em>Mr. William W. </em>Badger, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b80-9\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL0\">We are presented at the threshold of this case with the objection that the sheriff has never acquired the right of the insured under the policy of insurance; and, therefore, has no <em>status </em>to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">His right to maintain it of course depends upon the sufficiency of the levy under the attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">The Code requires, in respect to debts due to the defendant in the attachment, that the execution of the attachment shall be made by leaving a copy of the warrant with the debtor, <em>with a notice showing the property temed on (Code, </em>\u00a7 235).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The deputy sheriff testified that he served a copy of the attachment upon .the secretary of the defendant\u2019s company, and at the same time \u201c asked if they had any property belonging to Mr. E. S. Chandler, and that the secretary replied that he did not know at that time what property of his was in their possession. Nothing was said about a' policy of insurance ; and it does not appear that even the usual notice, which ordinarily is printed upon the back of the attachment, was served on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The cases are uniform that to make a sufficient levy the notice must specify the property levied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In. Orser, Sheriff, <em>v. </em>Grossman, 11 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>520, the action was hy the sheriff to recover a debt due from the defendant to the defendant in the attachment, and it was shown that a copy of the attachment was served with a notice, that he attached \u201c all property,\u201d etc. It was held not to he a levy, and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In Kuhlman <em>v. </em>Orser, 5 Duer, 242, a similar notice was held to he insufficient; and a like decision was made in Wilson <em>v. </em>Duncan, 11 <em>Abb. </em>3. See also Harman <em>v. </em>Remsen, 2 <em>Abb. (N. S.) </em>272.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The late case of Clarke <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 41 <em>N. Y. R. </em>210, is directly in point. The levy of the attachment was hy serving a copy and giving a general notice, which was held to he insufficient. The cases of Wilson <em>v. </em>Duncan, and Kuhlman <em>v. </em>Orser are approved, and that of Greenleaf <em>v. </em>Abbott, 19 <em>Abb. </em>469, repudiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Under the authority of those cases, the levy in the present case was wholly insufficient, and the sheriff did not acquire under it any right to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The judgment must he reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
