S. </em>463, \u00a7 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The judiciary act of 1847 <em>(Laws, </em>1847, ch. 280, p. 319, \u00a7 16) transferred to, and vested in, the <em>Supreme Court </em>all the equity jurisdiction and poAver Avhich had theretofore been possessed by the Court of Chancery, Avhich included, of course, its jurisdiction to dissolve corporations. By such transfer, the jurisdiction over such cases became exclusive in the Supreme Court, as it had theretofore been exclusive in the Court of Chancery; and such exclusive jurisdiction has continued in the Supreme Court to the present time, unless the legislature has, since the passage of the judiciary act, conferred a like jurisdiction upon other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The Superior Court of the City of NeAv York Avas created by the legislature in 1828, with a common-laAV jurisdiction only. It possessed no equity powers or jurisdiction whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The constitution of 1846 (Art. 14, \u00a7 12) continued the court with its then powers and jurisdiction, until the legislature should otherwise direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">By the passage of the Code of Procedure in the year succeeding the passage of the judiciary act, the equity jurisdiction, which by that act was vested exclusively in the Supreme Court, was bestowed in part upon the Superior Court, the Court of Common Pleas, and Mayors\u2019 and Recorders\u2019 Courts of cities, and to the extent that each of those courts was given <em>a general equity jurisdiction </em>(Bowen <em>v. </em>Irish Presby. Cong., 6 <em>Bosw. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>246; Bennett <em>v. </em>LeRoy, 5 <em>Abb. </em>55; Forrest v. Forrest, 6 <em>Duer, </em>102, aff\"d 25 N. <em>Y. R. </em>501).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The judiciary article of the constitution which was adopted in 1870, continued the Superior Court, with all its then powers and jurisdiction, and such other powers and j urisdiction as might thereafter be conferred upon it by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Under that provision of the constitution, the Superior Court was removed from the interference of the legislat ure, except to increase or add to its jurisdiction and powers. None which it possessed at the adoption of the article can now be taken away or diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The 33d section of the Code of Procedure does not, in terms, confer upon this court a general equity jurisdiction. It gives it such jurisdiction, in certain specified cases, which theretofore were of exclusively equitable cognizance, such as actions for the partition of lands, and the foreclosure of mortgages, and then, generally, \u201cto all <em>other actions </em>\u201d where the defendants reside, or were served within the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Thus it would seem that it must have been the intention of the legislature to make the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, <em>as respects the cause of </em>action, equal and co-extensive with the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the only apparent qualification being in the jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. So that, if the defendant resides, or can be served with process, within the city of New York, the Superior Court may claim jurisdiction over any or every action of which any other court has cognizance, whether the cause of action be of an equitable or legal nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">In speaking on this subject, in a case where the equity jurisdiction of the Superior Court was attacked (Forrest Forrest, 25 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>501), Mr. Justice Weight has given the history of legislation upon the subject of a somewhat analogous jurisdiction. He has shown that the legislature has complete power over the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of divorces, and could give jurisdiction over them to any tribunal; and that, although it saw proper to confine the jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery, while that court was in existence, it was never deprived of the right to extend such jurisdiction to any other existing court, or to have created a court expressly for the purpose of such cases, similar to the ecclesiastical courts of England. The learned judge concluded, therefore, that it was competent for the legislature to vest such jurisdiction in the Superior Court; and that an action for divorce was embraced among the \u201cother actions\u201d to which the jurisdiction of that court was extended by the 33d section of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The theory of the decision in the Forrest case is, that by the Code, the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity being abolished, and one form of action provided, which is denominated a <em>civil </em>action, the only question which can, in any case, arise, is whether the proceeding is an \u201c action,\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the Code. If it is an action, then clearly the Superior Court is vested, by the 33d section, with jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In the case before us, the question might be regarded as sufficiently answered by a mere reference to the plaintiff\u2019s proceeding to obtain the relief he seeks. There is a summons in the usual form, and a complaint, stating a cause of action within the provision of the Revised Statutes relating to proceedings against corporations in equity, and a demand for the appropriate relief. It has, therefore, all the characteristics and elements of an action, in the form prescribed by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The proceeding for the sequestration of the property of an insolvent corporation, was required by the statute to be instituted by \u201cpetition\u2019\u2019\u2019 to the chancellor, with a further provision for a final decree. The form of the proceeding, therefore, as well as the peculiar jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tion over the subject-matter, was fixed and created by the legislature ; and, being the mere creature of the statute, could be changed, modified, or enlarged by the power creating it. Although the \u201c <em>second </em>\u201d part of the Code, until otherwise provided, is not to affect proceedings against corporations, as provided in the title of the Revised Statutes before referred to <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 471), yet, when in consequence of such proceedings, <em>a civil action shall be </em>brought, such action shall be conducted in conformity to such part.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The plaintiff has, therefore, brought <em>an action </em>in the . manner and form prescribed by the second part of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It cannot be supposed, I think, that the legislature intended to do more or otherwise than merely to preserve certain peculiar remedies which had been provided by statute. Thus leaving the remedies intact, but requiring that in pursuing them, if it was necessary to bring an action, to conform the action to the new Code of Procedure. Among the remedies thus qualifiedly excepted from the operation of the second part of the Code, is the remedy a creditor of an insolvent corporation has against the corporation, to sequestrate its property, and annul its corporate powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">It is only by statute that an inquisitorial power is given to <em>any </em>court over corporate bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The Court of Chancery had no jurisdiction over such bodies, until it was given by the legislature (Atty.-Gen. <em>v. </em>Utica Ins. Co., <em>2 J. Ch. R. </em>371; Varplanck <em>v. </em>Mer. Ins. Co., 1 <em>Edw. </em>811). Hence, as was said in the Forrest case, it was and is competent for the legislature to give the jurisdiction over such bodies to any court or courts, and to prescribe the form of procedure to secure the remedies given by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The word \u201c petition\u201d only is used in the 36th section, but the chancellor gives to it its broad signification, namely, a prayer to the court, saying, that every bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was a petition for relief. He therefore, in two cases, sustained a <em>bill </em>(Judson <em>v. </em>Rossie, Galena Co., 9 <em>Paige, </em>598 ; Morgan v. N. Y. <em>&amp; </em>Albany R. R. .Co., 10 <em>Id. </em>290).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">If, therefore, the remedy provided by the statute, could have been enforced by bill in equity, before the Code', then it is clear that it can be now pursued by <em>action; </em>and that the latter is an entirely appropriate form of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">I have not found it necessary to look to the <em>third </em>subdivision of the 33d section of the Code, to find a conferred jurisdiction in this court. That subdivision embraces, in terms, actions against corporations for the recovery of any debt or damages; and also <em>\u201c upon any cause of action </em>\u201d arising within the State, which would seem to be sufficiently comprehensive to include a creditor\u2019s remedy under the provisions of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">But as I have not found it necessary to rely upon that subdivision, for the requisite jurisdiction in this court, over the subject of this action, and having found sufficient in the \u201c&gt; <em>second\u201d </em>subdivision, as explained by the Forrest case, to sustain the action in this court, I am not embarrassed by the two decisions in this court adverse to the views I have expressed (Kattenstroth <em>v. </em>Astor Bank, 2 <em>Duer, </em>632; Brahe <em>v. </em>The Pythagoras Ass., 4 <em>Id. </em>658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Those decisions, which were before the decision of the Forrest case, were put upon the ground that the third subdivision did not reach to inquisitorial actions or proceedings against corporations under the Revised Statutes. The court did not examine the second subdivision, but confined itself to a construction of the third subdivision only.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">I am, therefore, of the opinion that the case before us is an <em>action </em>within the meaning of the Code, and as such this court has jurisdiction over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The order sustaining the demurrer should be reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>with costs, with leave to defendant to withdraw the demurrer and answer on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
