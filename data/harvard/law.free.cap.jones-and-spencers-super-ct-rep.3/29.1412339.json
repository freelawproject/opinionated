The language of the composition agreement, \u201c We, the subscribers, creditors \u201c of the firm of Miller &amp; Co., do hereby <em>severally and </em>\u20181 <em>each for himself </em>agree with the said firm of Miller \u201c <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d etc., excludes the idea of any agreement <em>between the subscribing creditors </em>for the relinquishment, by each, of a portion of his claim, in consideration of a like relinquishment by the others. The effect of the agreement, as to each creditor, is the same as if it had been signed by him alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-12\">1. If the composition agreement be construed as the <em>separate </em>contract of plaintiffs with defendants, even <em>acceptance </em>by the former of the 20 per cent, stipulated for would constitute no defence. Acceptance of a less sum in lieu of a greater, admitted to be due, does not amount to a valid accord and satisfaction (Cumber <em>v. </em>Wane, 1 <em>Strange, </em>426; Harrison <em>v. </em>Close, 2 <em>Johns. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>448; Seymour <em>v. </em>Minturn, 17 <em>Id. </em>169; Dederick <em>v. </em>Leman, 9 <em>Id. </em>333 ; Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Hazard, 13 <em>Id. </em>353; Bunge <em>v. </em>Koop, 5 <em>Bob. </em>1; 1 <em>Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases, </em>550).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">2. But there was no acceptance of the smaller sum agreed to lye paid. The most that can \"be claimed is an <em>accord </em>with <em>tender of satisfaction, </em>which is no defence (3 <em>Black. Comm. </em>15 ; Heathcote <em>v. </em>Crookshank, 2 <em>T. R. </em>24; <em>Com. Dig. Accord, </em>b; Russell <em>v. </em>Lytle, 6 <em>Wend. </em>391; Brooklyn Bank <em>v. </em>Degrauw, 23 <em>Id. </em>342 ; Tilton Alcott, 16 <em>Barb. </em>598; Day <em>v. </em>Roth, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>448; Fellows <em>v. </em>Stevens, 24 <em>Wend. </em>294).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">3. The objection is not avoided by the fact that the agreement is under seal. The composition deed, so far from <em>merging </em>the original debt, <em>expressly excludes </em>the idea of such merger- by the stipulation, <em>in futuro, </em>to release the original indebtedness when the condition of the agreement shall have been performed (Hicks <em>v. </em>Clark, 41 <em>Vermont, </em>183, 186; U. S. Lyman, 1 <em>Mason, </em>482, 505; Van Vliet <em>v. </em>Jones, <em>Spencer, </em>341; Yates <em>v. </em>Aston, 4 <em>Q. B. </em>182, 196; Bell <em>v. </em>Banks, 3 <em>M. &amp; Gr. </em>258, 265; Wallace <em>v. </em>Fairman, 4 <em>Walts, </em>378; Charles <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>294; Bank of Columbia <em>v. </em>Patterson\u2019s Admr. 7 <em>Cranch, </em>299 ; Montgomery <em>v. </em>St. Stephen\u2019s Church, 4 <em>Watts </em>&amp; <em>Sergeant, </em>542, 546).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\">4. In Heathcote <em>v. </em>Crookshank, 2 <em>T. B. </em>24, where all the creditors were made parties to a general composition, and the composition money was actually tendered to the plaintiff, the defence was held incomplete because it was not <em>expressly pleaded </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s agreement was in consideration of all the creditors coming in. In the case at bar, not only is no such consideration pleaded, but its existence is negatived by the language of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-8\"><em>a. </em>The creditors agree \u201c <em>severally and each for him</em>self.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-9\"><em>b. </em>The <em>expressed </em>and <em>only </em>consideration of each cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>itor\u2019s agreement is the 20 per cent, stipulated to be paid on his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">5. <em>A </em>contract to do an act, <em>in </em>futuro, in satisfaction of a past breach of contract, is revocable and inoperative until performance (Lynn <em>r. </em>Bruce, 2 <em>H. Bl. </em>317; Graham <em>r. </em>Gibson, 4 <em>Exch. </em>768).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">II. If it be implied, notwithstanding its express terms, that the agreement is <em>between the creditors </em>as well as <em>with </em>the debtors, still the defence must fail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">1. Although it is averred in the answer that \u2018 \u2018 defendants have paid the several other creditors who \u201cexecuted said deed the various amounts contracted \u201cto be paid thereby,\u201d no evidence of such payment, or tender of it, was offered. That such evidence was necessary becomes manifest when we reflect that, in composition agreements, the consideration for each creditor\u2019s relinquishment of part of his demand, is a similar relinquishment by the others. But the failure to pay any one creditor, by operation of law (see authorities cited below), and, in this case, by the terms of the agreement, remits such creditor, and, as a necessary consequence, each of the others, to his original rights. The creditors, not paid, it is plain, are let in to claim the entire amount of their respective demands. In other words, they are absolved from their agreement to relinquish part of what was due them; but it was that very agreement which constituted the consideration of the agreement to relinquish by the others. In the present case, if it be claimed that the plaintiffs have relinquished a portion of their demand in consideration of a similar relinquishment by the other creditors, I answer, that unless the contract has been so performed, either by payment or tender, as to render the relinquishment by the others effectual, the consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 agreement has failed (3 <em>Chitty on Plead. </em>931; 36 <em>Eng. Law &amp; Eq. </em>193 ; Penniman v. Elliott, 27 <em>Barb. </em>315; Reay <em>v. </em>Richardson, 2 <em>C. M. &amp; R. </em>422).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>2. </em>It rested on defendants to show complete performance of the composition agreement (Cranley <em>v. </em>Hillary, <em>Maule &amp; Sel. </em>120 ; Oughton <em>v. </em>Trotter, 2 <em>Nev. &amp; Man. </em>71; Fellows v. Stephens, 24 <em>Wend. </em>302).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">3. The tender pleaded is ineffectual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>a. </em>The money was not paid into court, and notice given to the plaintiffs (Simpson <em>v. </em>French, 25 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>464.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\"><em>b. </em>It was not shown that the money produced and tendered on the trial, was the same previously tendered [fols. 40, 41] (Roosevelt <em>v. </em>Bull\u2019s Head Bank, 45 <em>Barb. </em>579; Brooklyn Bank <em>v. </em>De Grauw, 23 <em>Wend. </em>345).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">III. Defendants\u2019 exceptions should be overruled, and judgment entered for plaintiffs on the verdict with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-9\"><em>Messrs. Goodrich &amp; </em>Wheeler, attorneys, and <em>Mr. Thomas M. </em>Wheeler, of counsel for defendants, urged : <em>First. </em>The instrument, being under seal, imports a consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-10\"><em>Second. </em>The consideration in this deed is the payment of the twenty per cent., and a tender being equivalent to payment, the defendants were released from the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-11\"><em>Third. </em>Other creditors besides the plaintiffs having signed the deed, the relinquishment of a part of their demands, and the surrender of their right to enforce them in full, is a sufficient consideration to uphold it (Hull <em>v. </em>Merrill, 5 <em>Bosw., </em>266; Renard <em>v. </em>Tuller, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>107).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\"><em>Fourth. </em>The insertion of the words \u201c severally and each for himself,\u201d does not render the deed invalid. The law infers that the creditors agree \u201cseverally and each for himself,\u201d and the insertion of what the law infers would not invalidate it. The law infers a separate agreement between each creditor and the debtors, and also an agreement between each of the creditors (see Hall <em>v. </em>Merrill, 5 <em>Bosw. </em>273 ; Brick <em>v. </em>Cole, 4 <em>Sand. </em>83).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Fifth. </em>The verdict should be set aside, and judgment given for the defendants.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b42-5\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAF\">It is understood that the learned justice at the trial held, that the composition deed being a several, and not a joint, agreement, it did not operate as a release of the original debt, for want of a sufficient consideration to uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The ground on which these composition deeds are sustained is, that the relinquishment to the debtor by others who sign of a part of their claims, or the concession of some modification of the right to enforce them, constitutes a sufficient consideration. The agreement must be mutual, and mutually binding upon all who sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">I am unable to distinguish this case from Hall <em>v. </em>Merrill, 5 <em>Bosw. </em>266. In that case, the agreement was <em>joint. </em>In this case, it was several. Whatever may be the nature of the obligation in terms, it must, necessarily, in all cases be several. Bach creditor must agree for himself with the debtor, and his several agreement is joint, or his joint agreement is several, only so far as it is mutual with the others signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">It is not necessary that the agreement should express the mutuaEty of all the signers. It is sufficiently implied by the nature of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">This cannot, therefore, be regarded as the mere separate contract of the defendants, and as such having the effect only of an accord. But it must be regarded as a mutual agreement, among all who signed it, to relinquish a part of their respective debts to the debtor, and binding upon all.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">I think the exceptions should be sustained, the v\u00e9rdict set aside, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the defendants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
