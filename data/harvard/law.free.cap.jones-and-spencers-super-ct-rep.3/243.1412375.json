That account was of purchase and sale assumed by the defendant to have been made by them for the plaintiff. The plaintiff then proceeded to point out many errors in it. He also gave testimony as to violations of orders given by him to the defendants under the agreement, by which he testified he lost large sums of money. He further testified to the defendants\u2019 buying and selling without orders. Hone of these matters were objected to by the defendants. When the latter went into their case, they gave evidence as to these alleged errors and violations of orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">It will be noticed that the plaintiff made out the case he stated in the complaint, simply by the account which he proved had been given to him, and which he used in an admission by the defendant, except so far as he varied or contradicted it by affirmative proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">On the evidence, as matter of fact, the referee found in substance (the finding, however, being specified) that the defendants had neglected to make sale and purchases when directed by plaintiff; that purchases were made without plaintiff\u2019s orders, and the amounts given thereon were charged against the plaintiff, when in fact they could have been bought for much less ; that sales were made on plaintiff\u2019s account, and charged against him without plaintiff\u2019s authority ; that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>duction that should be made from the account presented, and the amounts of credit that should be given to the plaintiff on that account by reason of these acts and omissions of defendants done without plaintiff\u2019s authority, were in all $32,080.32, \u201cfrom which sum,\u201d in the words of the report, \u201cdeduct the balance appearing by said account to be due to the defendants, and there remains the sum of $9,597.10.\u201d And as a conclusion of law from these facts, the referee found that the plaintiff should have judgment for the difference, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The result is, that the plaintiff proved that he was not entitled to recover anything as profits made on his account, and not one cent; of his recovery consists of profits. His recovery was for damage he had sustained by a violation of his directions ; the measure of damage as .to most of his claim being the profit he would have made. The complaint did not claim damages for violation of orders, or for neglect to obey orders. It said there had been profits on the purchases and sales, and it demanded an accounting as to these profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The defendants excepted to the conclusions of law. The objection is, that, as matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to no other payment on the complaint than is based upon proof of profits, and that proof of damages, or violation of orders or directions, will not support the judgment. We think the objection must be maintained. It is not a case of the defendant voluntarily, by not objecting, taking the court\u2019s judgment as to the legal result of - a set of facts with which both sides have fully gone; and yet which, upon defendants\u2019 motion, would be held to be within the case a failure of proof (Belknap <em>v. </em>Sealey, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>143). It is rather within Codd <em>v. </em>Rathbone, 19 <em>N. Y R. </em>39. There was no barrier of any objection, because the matters which were given in evidence on which the referee relied, were relevant to the issue framed upon the complaint as it stood. An objection to them would have been over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ruled. The plaintiff set out by proving admissions of the defendants, as to purchases and sales, made by them for plaintiff\u2019s account, as stated in an account which defendants had rendered plaintiff. He then proposed to \u25a0contradict certain parts of that account, which would leave the rest of it good evidence against the defendants. This was all unobjectionable. On the other hand, the plaintiff was entitled, without waiving the objection that there was a failure of proof, to go into the facts testified to by plaintiff, in showing errors in the account, because the defendants claimed, as an affirmative defence and counter-claim, that there had been accounting and an account stated between the parties. Therefore, the defendants were entitled to show that there were no errors in the account as rendered. All this left the plaintiff to make out the case of his complaint, that the defendants\u00bb in executing his orders for purchases and sales had earned large profits, and that he was entitled to an account of them. This I think the plaintiff failed to do, and therefore the defendants\u2019 exception to the referee\u2019s conclusion of law is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and there must be \u25a0a new trial, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The order of referee should also be vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
