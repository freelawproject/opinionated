That on the 10th day of October, 1852, Johnston died intestate, and without issue; and was, at the time of his death, an inhabitant of the city and county of New York; and that on the sixteenth day of November, 1852, the surrogate of that city and county issued letters of administration upon his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-12\">4.

That the sale of the premises by the sheriff of the city and county of Hew York, under and by virtue of the judgment recovered by the Bowery Bank of the city of blew York, and the execution issued thereon, as aforesaid, was valid and regular in all respects; and that the subsequent conveyances of the premises by the sheriff to Thomas Haskins were also valid and regular in all respects, and that they operated to convey the premises to Haskins in fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\"><em>2. </em>That the defendant, Sinnott, by the conveyances made to him by John Johnson and wife, and Thomas Haskins and wife, became the owner of the premises in fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">3. That the plaintiff in this action was not, at the time of the commencement thereof, and is not now entitled to the possession of the premises, or of any part thereof, or to any interest or right therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-7\"><em>Mr. John </em>Townsend, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZK\">presented the following points : I. The right to sell land under an execution, is one derived from statute ; it is only by showing that the provisions of the statute have been complied with, that the existence of the right can be proved (Townshend v. Wesson, 4 Duer, 356).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">II. To enable the party to sell the real estate of the judgment debtor under an execution, the judgment must be a lien upon the estate at the time of the sale <em>(Willard on Real </em>Estate, 455, ed. 1861; Graff <em>v. </em>Kipp, 1 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>619 ; Little <em>v. </em>Harvey, 9 <em>Wend. </em>157; Tuffts <em>v. </em>Tuffts, 18 <em>Wend. </em>621, 625).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-9\">III. A judgment which never became a lien, and a judgment which has ceased to be a lien, are identical. Ho sale can be had on a judgment which never became a lien (Townshend <em>v. </em>Wesson, 4 <em>Duer, </em>356). <em>(a). </em>And therefore no sale can be had on a judgment which has ceased to be a lien. The sale is to enforce the lien: the lien having expired, there is nothing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>enforce. It is like a mechanic\u2019s lien, which, if suffered to expire, cannot \"be enforced (Grant <em>v. </em>Vandercook, 8 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>445).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">IV. In the case now \"before the court, the judgment ceased to be a lien on the 2d or 3d of October, 1861. By the Code, section 282, the judgment is a lien for \u201cten years from the time of docketing the same.\u201d This provision differs from the Revised Statutes (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>359), which provided, \u201cFrom and after ten years from the time of docketing, every such judgment shall cease to bind .... such property .... as against purchasers in good faith,\u201d etc. In the case of a judgment under the Code, it is a lien for ten years only. Under the Revised Statutes, the judgment was a lien so long as it continued unsatisfied, with a provision for the lien ceasing at the end of ten years, against certain parties only. <em>(a). </em>The action by the Bowery Bank having been commenced after the Code took effect, the proceedings therein, and the effect of the judgment as a lien, are governed by the Code <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 8).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">Decision of Judge Robinson, MS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">V. The death of the defendant intermediate the judgment and the execution, did not extend the lien of the judgment beyond the ten years prescribed by Code, section 282. The Revised Statutes (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>368, \u00a7 27) provide, that if a party die after judgment rendered against him, but before execution issued thereon, the remedy on such judgment shall not be suspended by reason of the non-age of any heir of such party ; but no execution shall issue on such judgment until the expiration of one year after the death of the party against whom the same was rendered. The only events which can extend the lien of the judgment are those mentioned in section 282, namely, the judgment creditor being restrained by injunction or other order, or by appeal (Pennsylvania Bank <em>v. </em>Creon, 2 <em>Rawle, </em>224; Fryhoffer <em>v. </em>Busby, 17 <em>Serg. &amp; R. </em>121; Lesher <em>v. </em>Gillingham, <em>Id. </em>123).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>VI. The provisions of law not in conflict with chapter 1 of title IX. of the Code (\u00a7\u00a7 283-291), relating to executions and their incidents.....apply to executions prescribed by that chapter (Code, \u00a7 291).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">That a judgment shall be a lien for twenty years, conflicts with a provision that a judgment shall be a lien for ten years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">VII. The judgment debtor having died after the execution returned unsatisfied, no proceedings to enforce the judgment could be taken, until the judgment was revived or the heirs summoned, pursuant to section 376 of the Code. Th\u00f3 law of 1850, ch. 225, provides an additional preliminary to the issuance of an execution against the estate of a deceased judgment debtor, but has not dispensed with the proceedings provided by section 376 of the Code. The execution was irregular and void, as against the heirs (Marine Bank of Chicago <em>v. </em>Van Brunt, <em>Court of Appeals, April, </em>1872 ; Wood v. Moorhouse, 45 <em>N. Y. </em>368).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-9\"><em>James P. Sinnott, </em>for respondent,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB\">urged: I. Section 3, of Article 1, Title 5, Chap. 6, of the Revised Statutes, enacted, that the lands and real estate of every person against whom a judgment should be docketed, should \u201cbe subject to be sold upon execution to be issued on such judgment\u201d (2 <em>Rev. Stat., Edmonds, Ed. </em>p. 371).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\">Section 291, of the Code of Procedure, enacted :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">\u00a7 291. \u201c Until otherwise provided by the legislature, the existing provisions of law, not in conflict with this chapter, relating to executions and their incidents, <em>the property liable to sale on execution, </em>the sale and redemption thereof, the powers and rights of officers, their duties thereon, and the proceedings to enforce those duties, and the liability of their sureties, shall apply to the executions prescribed by this chapter \u201d (5 <em>Edmonds' Stat. at Large, </em>p. 83).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Section 289, of the Code of Procedure, in prescribing the form of an execution, enacted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">\u201c1. If it be against the property of the judgment debtor, it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment out of the personal property of such debtor, and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, <em>out of the real property </em>belonging to him on the day when the judgment was docketed in the county, or at ary TIME THEREAFTER.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">The court will observe that not only is <em>no </em>distinction, <em>based upon the time of the issue of the </em>execution, made between real and personal property, but the execution <em>must </em>direct the sheriff to satisfy the judgment out of the real property, if sufficient personal property cannot be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">Now, where an execution has once been issued within five years, and even if it had not been, the right to issue one continues an absolute legal right for <em>twenty </em>years, if the judgment remains unpaid and <em>unsatisfied of record. </em>It is the <em>record </em>of the judgment which gives the right to execution (Lee <em>v. </em>Watkins, 13 <em>How. </em>178; S. C. 3 <em>Abb. </em>243; Kennedy v. Mills, 4 <em>Abb. </em>132; Betts <em>v. </em>Garr, 26 <em>N. Y., </em>12 <em>Smith, </em>383).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">\u2022 Here, then, we have the right to issue execution within <em>twenty </em>years, and we have the statute requiring us, whenever we do issue the execution, to make it direct the sheriff to satisfy the judgment out of the real \u25a0 property belonging to the judgment debtor at the time of the docketing of the judgment, \u201cor at any time thereafter ; \u2019 \u2019 and yet it is pretended \u2022 that we cannot touch this real property after <em>ten </em>years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">It is true that if the creditor waits for more than ten years, and, in the mean time, other judgments have also become liens, the lien of the first judgment becomes ended, <em>as to those other judgment </em>creditors, and the liens of these other judgments continuing, the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>judgment becomes a <em>postponed </em>judgment; it ceases to be a senior, and becomes a <em>junior, </em>judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">II. By \u201cthe existing provisions of law,\u201d at the time of the adoption of the Code, the lands of a judgment debtor were liable to be sold on execution, <em>notwithstanding that more than ten years had elapsed </em>since the judgment was docketed; and the sale was good as against the judgment debtor, and as against his heirs, and as against his grantees without value (Scott v. Howard, 3 <em>Barb. </em>319; <em>Ex </em>parte, Peru Iron Company, 7 <em>Cowen, </em>540; Mower v. Kip, <em>2 Edw. C. R. </em>165; Pettit <em>v. </em>Shepherd, 5 <em>Paige, </em>493 ; Mohawk Bk. <em>v. </em>Atwater, <em>2 </em>Paige, 54).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">In all these cases, the court holds that, notwithstanding the lapse of the ten years, the property will pass to the heirs, and gratuitous grantees, charged with the lien of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">III. The existence of a technical lien is not, however, we insist, essential to the power of selling on execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">The power of selling land on execution is one thing; the lien of the judgment <em>by which that power is made </em>efficacious, is quite another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\">To create either the power or the incumbrance, a judgment must be rendered and docketed; which pimply shows, that they are children of the same parent, to wit, the docketed judgment; but surely this does not show that one may not survive the other, but the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-10\">The Code, in stating what an execution shall contain, <em>does not say </em>that it shall direct the sheriff to satisfy the judgment out of any real property <em>upon which the judgment is a lien; </em>but it says, to satisfy the judgment out of <em>any real property belonging to the judgment debtor at the time of the docketing, or at any time thereafter (Code, </em>\u00a7 289).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-11\">How, if, when the sheriff comes to sell, he finds real property belonging to the judgment debtor, and finds that that judgment debtor has still precisely the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>interest- in the property which he had when the judgment was docketed, why may not the sheriff sell ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">IY. The <em>judgment does </em>continue a lien after the ten years, as against the judgment debtor and his heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">It is conceded, we believe\u2014at least it cannot be denied. \u2014that under the Revised Statutes the judgment continued a lien after the lapse of the ten years, as against the judgment debtor, his heirs and gratuitous grantees (3 <em>Barb. </em>319; 7 Cowen, 540 ; <em>2 </em>Paige, 54; <em>2 Edw. </em>ch. 165 ; 5 Paige, 493).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">But the learned counsel for the plaintiff contends that the Code repeals the provisions of the Revised Statutes in that behalf. For this he cites no authority whatever, and his assertion is contrary to every expression of opinion heretofore published on the subject, including his own Annotations to the Code. There is no reported case upon the point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">The learned counsel for the plaintiff has, in the various editions of the Code which he has so ably edited, cited, <em>under this very </em>section, 282 of the Code, the case of Scott <em>v. </em>Howard, as an authority to show, that the lien of a judgment continued, <em>as against the judgment </em>debtor, <em>after the lapse of ten years.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">Judge Willard, in his able work on Real Estate and Conveyancing, after reciting the provisions of the Revised Statutes on this subject, says, \u201c the provisions of the Code are substantially the same\u201d (page 153).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-10\">Judge Comstock, in his 11th edition of Kent\u2019s Commentaries, published in 1866, seems to have discovered no substantial change, and treats the provisions of the Revised Statutes as still in force (4 Kent, 435).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-11\">In Tillinghurst and Shearman\u2019s Practice, it is said, vol. 2, p. 719 : \u201c Whether the provisions of the Revised Statutes on the subject of judgment liens are in force or not, the interpretation put upon them by the courts is the same that would be put upon the Code. And on the same page they cite several cases to show that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>against the judgment debtor and his grantee, without a valuable consideration, the lien of the judgment <em>\u2018 </em>continues in force for <em>twenty </em>years at least.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">In Gerard\u2019s \u201cTitles to Real Estate,\u201d the sections of the Revised Statutes referred to are set forth as existing laws.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">In Willard\u2019s Equity, a whole paragraph is devoted to the lien of judgments, and the provisions of the Revised Statutes in question are treated as continuing in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">Mr. Justice Moeell, in his work on Practice, also lays down the rule, that the judgment continues a lien, except as against <em>bona-fide </em>purchasers, etc. (2 <em>MonelV s TPr. </em>101).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">Such a universal understanding, by the profession, of a matter involving the title to real estate, will not, and should not, be lightly dissented from by this court, to the disturbance and confusion of titles, <em>bond fide </em>acquired. The argument <em>db inconvenienti </em>ought, in such a case, to be given the greatest force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel cited below the manuscript case of Coe <em>v. </em>Williams, decided by Hon. H. W. RobnsrsoR, as a referee. But that case seems to us not to have the slightest application. The case merely decides that if a junior judgment creditor issues an execution and sells real estate of the judgment debtor, the title of the purchaser will be good, subject to the prior judgment, and that if the ten years are permitted to elapse without a sale under the prior judgment, the title of the purchaser at the sale under the junior judgment will thereupon be released from the prior judgment, and a subsequent sale under the prior judgment will thereupon be void, <em>as to the title of suph purchaser at the sale previously made.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-10\"><em>Y. </em>The provisions of the Revised Statutes and of the Code as the latter stood in 1861, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\n<em>Oode.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">\u00a7 282.

Stat. </em>p. 371).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-11\">The question here arises, what was the true intention of the legislature, in reference to the lien of judgments, in enacting the Code; and was it such that, by a <em>necessary </em>and <em>inevitable </em>implication, the foregoing provisions of the Revised Statutes were repealed ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>To ascertain this, we must look, not only to this section, \"but to the <em>entire act called the Code; </em>and not only to that, but to <em>the whole body of legislation </em>on the same subject matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">In Bwabris on Statutes, pp. 145, 146, recently published and edited, with notes, by Mr. Justice Platt Potter, the following rules of interpretation are laid down, fortified by the highest authorities:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u201cWhere there is a discrepancy or disagreement between two statutes, such interpretation should be given, that <em>both </em>may, if possible, <em>stand together </em>\u201d (McCartee <em>v. </em>Orphan Asylum Society, 9 <em>Cow. </em>437).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">16 In the construction of a statute, <em>every part of it </em>must be viewed in connection with the whole, so as to make all its parts harmonize, if practicable, and give a sensible and intelligent effect to each. It is not to be presumed that the legislature intended any part of a statute to be without meaning\u201d (Ogden <em>v. </em>Smith, <em>2 Paige </em>384; People <em>v. </em>Draper, 15 <em>N. Y. </em>532).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">\u201cAll statutes in <em>pari materia </em>are to be read and construed together, as if they formed part of the same statute and were enacted at the same time \u201d (1 <em>Kents Com. </em>463 ; <em>Smith's Com. </em>\u00a7 639 ; 9 <em>Barb. </em>161; Rogers <em>v. </em>Bradshaw, 20 <em>John. </em>735; McCartee <em>v. </em>Orphan Asylum, 9 <em>Cow. </em>437; Rexford <em>v. </em>Knight, 15 <em>Barb. </em>627).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">Applying these rules to the subject under consideration, we find that section 282 of the Code contains <em>no limitation </em>for the benefit of <em>bond-fde </em>purchasers and encumbrancers, except it be contained in the words \u201cfor ten years.\u201d If you omit these words, then \u00a7 280 makes the lien perpetual, <em>even as against bond-fde pur chasers ; </em>but by holding that these words of limitation were intended to operate to protect <em>bona-fide purchasers, </em>and were, in effect, <em>but a </em>reiteration, in another form, of the \u00a7 4 of the Revised Statutes, then you give a legitimate effect to both, and you make the whole act reconcilable with itself and with the Revised Statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>In the <em>next </em>place, the court will observe that section 282 of the Code leaves unchanged and untouched the \u25a0clause of section 8 of the Revised Statutes reading \u20181 <em>and such real estate and chattels real shall be subject to be sold upon execution to be issued on such judgment </em>/\u2019 \u2019 while section 289 of the Code requires, that the execution <em>shall direct </em>the <em>real estate </em>to be sold. Why, if any lien be necessary to sustain the power of selling under the execution, the court must hold it to be created here, by necessary and inevitable intendment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">Can any one read the Code and believe that it was in tended by \u00a7 282 that a judgment debtor might make over his real estate to his wife, or bestow it gratuitously upon his nephew, and leave a judgment duly docketed against him unpaid, in the face of \u00a7 289, which gives the right to sell this real estate on execution at any time within <em>twenty </em>years, and in the face of \u00a7 292, in regard to proceedings supplementary to execution ? If at any time within the twenty years you can discover property \u2014real as well as personal\u2014in the hands of a party who obtained it from the judgment debtor without value, can you not follow it into his hands <em>% </em>Therefore, it must be that the judgment continues to bind and be a charge upon the land as against that judgment debtor and his gratuitous grantee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">How sections 289 and 292 not only help us to understand the real meaning of section 282, but, being later sections in the same act, <em>they control it, </em>to the extent necessary to give full effect to the power of execution.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-7\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2G\">The case furnished us on this appeal contains none of the evidence taken at the trial. It is made up merely of the findings and conclusions of the referee. The objection, therefore, that it does not appear that the surrogate had authority to allow the issuing of the execution, cannot now be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>In. the latest case (Stoddard Whiting, 48 <em>JY. Y. B. </em>627), the rule is stated to be, that, \u201c when the case does not contain any of the evidence, but the finding of facts only, it is to be assumed that there was no evidence from which any other fact could be found ; and when the conclusions of law in such a case have been excepted to, the question to be determined, is, whether such conclusions are warranted by the facts found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The referee in this case having found that the surrogate, upon sufficient cause shown, made an order granting permission to issue execution upon the judgment; and the surrogate by statute <em>(Laws, </em>1850, <em>ch. </em>295) having power to make the order, it will be assumed that there was the requisite evidence before the referee to authorize its being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The remaining and important question is, whether the sale under the execution gave a valid title to the purchaser ; and the solution of that question depends upon whether the provisions of the Revised Statutes (2 <em>JR. 8. </em>359, \u00a7 4) respecting the lien of judgments is now in force, or has been changed by the provisions of the Code, so as to destroy the right to sell the real property of the debtor upon execution issued more than ten years after judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The provision of the Revised Statutes, limits the <em>lien </em>to ten years only as against subsequent purchasers and encumbrances; leaving the lien to continue after that period as against the debtor (Mohawk Bk. <em>v. </em>Atwater, 2 Paige, 54; <em>Ex parte, </em>The Peru Iron Co., 7 <em>Cow. </em>540; Scott <em>v. </em>Howard, 3 <em>Barb. </em>319). But the section of the Code fixing the lien of judgments, does not contain the exception which is found in the former statute ; but as well against the debtor, and consequently his heirs or devisees, as against subsequent purchasers or encumbrances, the lien by the terms of the statute, it would seem, absolutely ceases after ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The authority given to the surrogate by the Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>1850 <em>(supra), </em>to allow the issuing of an execution upon a judgment, is confined to judgments which are a <em>lien </em>upon the real estate of the deceased debtor; and the execution is to be issued and executed, in the same manner and with the same effect, as if the debtor was still living, except that a year must elapse after the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">If, therefore, the judgment could be enforced only in virtue of a subsisting lien, the order of the surrogate was imperative if such lien had ceased to exist. Under the Act of 1813, which was like the provision of the Revised Statutes (1 <em>R. L. </em>500), it was held (Roe <em>v. </em>Smart, 5 <em>Cow. </em>294), that the issuing of an execution would not prolong the lien. From which it would seem to follow, that at least the sale must be made within the ten years, if nothing more. At any rate the <em>lien </em>ceases as to subsequent purchasers, etc., after that time (Crozier v<em>. </em>Acker, 7 <em>Paige, </em>137).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">But although the lien ceases, it does not follow that an execution may not issue, and a levy and sale made, of any property of the debtor within the bailiwick of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The omission in the Code \u20181 as against subsequent purchasers,\u201d etc., does not alter the legal effect of the provision. Under either statute the lien would cease after ten years as to such purchasers, etc.; and possibly under the Code, the lien, <em>as a mere lien, </em>would also cease as to the debtor. But the writ of execution is a judicial writ, issued, presumptively, by the court to execute or enforce its judgment. Its form and time of issuing, etc., have been regulated by statute, but the power to issue is inherent in the court <em>(Boote\u2019s Suit at </em>Law, 193), and its mandate is, as respects real property, to make the amount out of the real property of the debtor belonging to him on the day the judgment was docketed, <em>or at any time thereafter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Being satisfied that the Code has not deprived the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>creditor of the right to sell his debtor\u2019s real estate at any time while he remains the owner, and that the sale in this case vested the title in the purchaser, I have not found it necessary to see whether the provision of the Revised Statutes is or is not repealed by the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Act of 1850 <em>(supra) </em>has been held not to be in conflict with the provisions of the Code, giving an action, in lieu of the former <em>scire facias, </em>to revive against heirs and terre tenants (Marine Bk. of Chicago <em>v. </em>Van Brunt, <em>Court of Appeals, April, </em>1872), but as merely furnishing a cumulative remedy. The order of the surrogate \u00bfad the effect of reviving the judgment as against the heirs of the deceased debtor, and as to them the lands became bound from that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">I think the judgment of the referee was correct, and should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
