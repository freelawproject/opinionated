The plaintiff at that time held the note of the defendant for $62.50, which the plaintiff testified, he gave to and it was received by the defendant in lieu of plaintiff\u2019s note of same amount, and as part payment for the work on the carriage. The three notes of plaintiff for $75 each,' and the defendant\u2019s note for $62.50, covered the entire bill for repairs. The mortgage was to cover the four notes, and was executed by the plaintiff, and delivered to the defendant, as were also the three notes for $75 each, and which three notes were afterwards all paid, and the amounts received by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">The defendant testified that he and the plaintiff came to \u201can agreement, and he accepted the bill, and he requested me to draw notes and the mortgage, and I drew three notes for $75 each, and one note for $62.50. When they were drawn up he signed the three notes for $75 each and the mortgage, and I said \u201cthere is another note for $62.50 ; you ought also to sign thathe said no, he would not, and he drew from his pocket a note which I had given him, and laid it before me, and said, \u201c There is a note which I hold against you, and I want you to take that.\u201d I replied, \u201cI cannot accept that note, for the simple reason that you have the goods for which I gave that note in your possession yet, and that note is not due, and I cannot give you credit for a thing that you have in your possession, and a note that is not due when you hold the goods ; \u201d I made the remark, \u201c do you sign this note, and I will return this note to you when you send me the phaeton and the note ; but I do not feel satisfied to give you your coup\u00e9 and receipt my bill in full until.I see what I get for my note ; \u201d thereupon Mr. Murphy left the shop and returned with the sheriff and took possession of the coup\u00e9.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">He also testified that he retained the mortgage, and three notes which were paid, and also afterwards re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ceived the phseton, the purchase of which from the plaintiff had formed the consideration for the note for $62.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\">There was evidence tending to show that when the defendant sent for the phaeton, its delivery was refused until a lien for storage due to a warehouseman was paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">The phaeton had not been delivered when this action was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-7\">All the evidence in relation to the refusal to deliver the phaeton and the claim for storage was conflicting, as was also the evidence of the defendant\u2019s agreement to take Ms own note in part payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-8\">The court submitted the case to the jury upon this conflicting evidence, charging them in substance that if the defendant agreed to accept, and did accept and receive the three notes of plaintiff, and a return of his own note, as payment for the repairs, it discharged the lien upon the carriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-9\">The jury found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-10\">The defendant moved for a new trial upon the judge\u2019s minutes, wMch motion was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-11\">The defendant appealed from the judgment and order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-12\"><em>George A. </em>Black, attorney, and of counsel for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHq\">urged:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-13\">I.

The plaintiff claimed on the trial that the hack was delivered to the defendant for repairs, the defendant agreeing to give the plaintiff <em>credit </em>therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\"><em>(a) </em>In the evidence, defendant expressly testifies that he <em>agreed to gine plaintiff credit for the worJc.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-9\"><em>(b) </em>The evidence shows that plaintiff in pursuance of such agreement gave his promissory notes secured by mortgage on the property in question, as security for his indebtedness to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-10\">(c) The evidence shows that these notes were all paid by plaintiff as they matured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-11\">Defendant also admits the payment; and that he kept the mortgage as security until the notes were all paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-12\">II. If defendant did not at the time of the execution and delivery of the mortgage and notes intend to accept his own note of $62. \u00ab50 in payment, he should have <em>returned it, </em>together with the other notes and the mortgage plaintiff gave as security. Plaintiff testifies that he gave this note in payment, and that defendant agreed to receive it in payment ;\u25a0 and defendant admits that he received the phaeton from plaintiff, thus receiving the consideration of the note of $62.50, and making the full amount due him as stated in the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The notes and mortgage were executed and delivered by plaintiff, and accepted by defendant in payment, and such acceptance and credit divested defendant\u2019s lien for work performed, and plaintiff\u2019s right of action was complete.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">III. The jury by their verdict found, as a matter of fact, that a credit was given to plaintiff, and that the note of 362.50 was given in part payment of his indebtedness, and having so found, their verdict is final.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">The rule of damages was correctly stated by the court <em>(Sedgwick on the Measure of Damages, 5th ed. </em>p. 577, and cases cited, p. 581).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b554-8\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfDD\">The questions in dispute in this case were given to the jury upon very conflicting evidence, and I can see no reason for disturbing their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The alleged agreement that the defendant should receive and did receive the three notes of the plaintiff, and his own note held by the plaintiff as payment, has been found by the jury, and as, found was sufficient to operate as a discharge of the defendant\u2019s lien upon the carriage. A mechanic may waive a lien for work done by any special agreement giving credit (Baily <em>v. </em>Adams, 14 <em>Wend. </em>201), or by taking security (Cowell <em>v. </em>Simpson, 16 <em>Ves. 275).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Taking, therefore, the finding of the jury as to the agreement as settling the facts, the lien of the defendant had ceased when the demand was made for the carriage, unless, as was claimed by the appellant, the note of the defendant was invalid for want of consideration. It was ' given for the price of a phaeton which had been sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, but which the defendant claimed had not been delivered to him, delivery having been refused until certain charges for storage had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The evidence in respect to the refusal to deliver was conflicting, and although the learned judge does not appear to have submitted that as a distinctive question to the jury, it was nevertheless in the case, and it must be presumed was passed upon by the jury. And as the verdict was a general verdict for the plaintiff, it must be presumed that the jury found there had not been any refusal by the plaintiff to deliver the phaeton. There was no exception to the charge, or any request made to submit any specific question of fact to the jury, and every intendment must be in favor of the correctness of their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">But the refusal to deliver the carriage, even if it had been so found, would not have been such a failure of consideration as would have invalidated the note after it came back to the defendant. It had when given operated as a payment for the phaeton, and the defendant could at any time afterwards have recovered the possession of the vehicle. It was at most a mere failure to receive the <em>benefit </em>of the sale, and not a failure of the consideration for the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">I think the judgment and order should be affirmed, With costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
