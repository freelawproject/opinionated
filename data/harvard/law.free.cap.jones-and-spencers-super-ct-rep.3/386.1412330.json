Benedict. The policy provided, that in case he should \u201c die by his own hand,\u201d it should be void, null, and of no effect. The deceased died by shooting himself with a pistol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-13\">The court charged the jury \u201cthat the act of self-destruction, unexplained, is of itself presumptive evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that the person committing it was not in his right state of mind at the time of the commission of the deed.\u201d The other parts of the charge show that the words \u201cnot in his right state of mind,\u201d here used, were intended by the judge to mean \u201cinsane.\u201d He had charged that if Benedict, at the time of the firing of the pistol, was insane to an extent which rendered him incapable of understanding the nature and consequences of the act he was about to commit, the plaintiff should have a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-4\">The judge refused on request to charge that61 James M. Benedict\u2019s shooting himself affords no presumption that he was insane.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-5\">Exceptions were taken by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">The plaintiff had a judgment, from which this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-7\"><em>Mr. Alvin O. </em>Bradley, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-8\"><em>Hon.

Co., argued at the April Term, 1872 <em>(see page </em>314 <em>ante), </em>passed upon the questions which are raised by the exceptions stated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">That case decided, that under such circumstances as the present, the mere fact that a man kills himself, does not create a presumption that he is insane. The general presumption is, that every man is sane until the contrary is proven by the facts of the case. Suicide is but one fact, which goes with all other pertinent facts to the jury, for the purpose of getting from them a verdict as to whether the facts prove insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The exceptions taken in this case were to matters that raised the question here alluded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">The judgment should thereupon be reversed, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>costs to appellant to abide the event, and there should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Monell and Curtis, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
