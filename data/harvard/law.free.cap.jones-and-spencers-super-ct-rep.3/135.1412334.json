In such schedule is set down only one-third residuary interest in the premises conveyed by said Alexander M. Bruen to said Dyson, and reference is made to a note at the end of the schedule. Such note stated that Matthew St. Clair Clarke, of Washington City, was entitled to remaining two-thirds interest arising from any excess after satisfying the amount of mortgage on such property which had been allowed said Clarke in accounting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\"><em>Eighth. </em>In August, 1846, the official assignee in bankruptcy for the southern district of New York, conveyed one-third of the premises conveyed to the said D.

That the plaintiff has failed to establish any title to the premises in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">2. That the defendants, August Belmont and John Home, as surviving trustees to Caroline S. Belmont, are entitled to recover the possession of the said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">3. That the said defendants, as such trustees, are entitled,to judgment against the plaintiff for their costs in this action, and for the possession of the said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-13\">On these findings judgment was taken, adjudging that the defendants, Belmont and Home, as surviving trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of Caroline Slidell Belmont, recover possession of the premises of and from the plaintiff, and also recover of the plaintiff their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">The plaintiff excepted to the finding, and appealed from the judgment to the General Term upon the pleadings, findings, and exceptions only.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-6\"><em>John Townsend, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">I. This judgment coming up for review upon the judgment roll and exceptions only, this court can take cognizance of the facts as found \"by the court at Special Term, and nothing more.' As the deeds referred to are not before the court, their construction cannot be passed upon, and their effects must be taken to be those mentioned in the \u201c findings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">II. .The Revised Statutes provided that a proceeding to compel the determination of claims to real estate should be commenced by the party in possession serving a notice on the claimant to show his claim, and the person so served might plead, in bar of the proceedings, that the person serving the notice had not been three years in possession; this was the only plea allowed. Besides this, the person proceeded against might serve a declaration in ejectment, or he might do nothing, or he might disclaim. These were the only courses open to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-9\">Afterwards, by the amendment to the Code of Procedure, 1849, the person in possession was allowed to proceed by action instead of notice, and the law of 1855, amending the Revised Statues, merely adapted the proceeding to a proceeding by action (2 <em>R. S. </em>313; <em>Laws of </em>1849, ch. 438 [am\u2019d Code]; <em>Laws of 1855, </em>ch. 511).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-10\">III. Under the provisions of the Revised Statutes, the person proceeded against, after pleading, in bar, that the person serving the notice had not had the requisite possession to maintain the proceeding, and that-issue being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>found against Mm, migM afterwards serve Ms declaration in ejectment (Tanner v. Tibbetts, 18 <em>Wend. </em>544).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">IV. Since the Code amd the law of 1855, the defendant, besides pleading the non-possession of plaintiff, may-set up title in himself, in which event his answer of title is new matter, of which the burden of proof is upon him (the defendant), and he can recover only to the extent to which he can establish a title. In such a case, all the plaintiff has to do is to establish the three years\u2019 prior possession ; that shows his right to sue, and then the defendant on his issue of title can recover only on such a title as he can make out. His position is that of a plaintiff in ejectment; he is to recover on the strength of his own title (Hagar <em>v. </em>Hagar, 38 Barb. 96).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">V. It was obviously the intention of the Code, that a party proceeding by action should have the same rights as a person proceeding-by notice. And it was obviously the intention of the Revised Statutes to enable persons in possession to force adverse claimants to show the nature and extent of their claims, and to enforce them by action of ejectment, in which, of course, the plaintiffs would recover only to the extent of title they could establish. The law of 1855 did not change this, but provided for a determination of the right by one proceeding instead of two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">VI. In this proceeding it is not incumbent on the plaintiff to prove any title nor anything beyond three years\u2019 possession under a claim,\u2014that she did, and the defendants could recover only to the extent of title shown by them (Barnard v. Simms, 42 <em>Barb. </em>304; Burnham <em>v. </em>Onderdonk, 41 <em>N. Y. </em>435).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-8\">VII. The plaintiff, by showing possession under a claim, did establish a title to the premises, except the part to which the defendants established an adverse title. Possession is evidence of title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-9\">VIII. The fact that the defendants showed a prior possession, if it had stood alone, would have entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>them to the judgment awarded. But the defendants went further and showed what was their title; they showed that their possession was under a deed which purported to convey only a third interest in the premises. They showed, therefore, that their prior possession was to the extent only of the interest conveyed. Defendants showed a title out of themselves for all the property, except the part conveyed to Gordon L. Ford, under whom they claimed. The case to which the opinion at Special Term refers is an authority for this (Smith <em>n. </em>Lorillard, 10 <em>Johns. </em>356).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACq\">IX. It is shown that D. S. Dyson was \"bankrupt, and it is shown that the official assignee in bankruptcy conveyed to Gordon L. Ford \u201c one-third of the premises conveyed to the said D. S. Dyson.\u201d It is not stated that the official assignee was the assignee of D. S. Dyson. The bankrupt law of 1841, \u00a7 3, provided that on a person being decreed a bankrupt, his property should, by force of the decree, vest in such assignee as the court should from time to time appoint, and a person was appointed, called a general assignee, in whom in all cases where no special assignee was appointed, the estates of all bankrupts became vested. Even if the court take judicial notice of this appointment of a general assignee, still it is not shown that no special assignee of D. S. Dyson was appointed. Nor can it be known what other estates became vested in that assignee. It is known that Robert Dyson was a bankrupt. Really, as appears by the findings, the common source of title was the official assignee, and for aught that appears to the contrary, he had the entire fee, and conveyed one-third to G. L. Ford, and two-thirds to plaintiff. The assignee did not convey merely one-third of the interest held by D. S. Dyson, but his deeds convey (fols. <em>29, </em>36) the one a <em>one-third, </em>and the other all of the premises conveyed to D. S. Dyson. It is a. description or identification of the premises, and not of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>interest conveyed. Bnt if the court conclude otherwise, or if the assignee had only the estate of D. S. Dyson, then:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-5\">X. When Dunbar S. Dyson became bankrupt, he had either the entire fee or a <em>sixth </em>of the fee,\u2014a third was reserved to the <em>two </em>Dysons, not to D. S. Dyson alone. The assignee could convey only what D. S. Dyson possessed. The assignee undertook to convey to Gordon L. Ford only \u201c one-third of the premises conveyed to D. S. Dyson.\u201d If D. S. Dyson had the entire fee, this passed one-third of it. If D. S. Dyson had only a sixth, only one-third of that sixth part (one-eighteenth part) passed by that deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-6\">XI. If D. S. Dyson had the entire fee, then the assignee\u2019s deed to plaintiff passed two-thirds of the fee. If D. S. Dyson had one-sixth only, then the deed to plaintiff passed one-ninth of the premises to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-7\">XII. If the title was one-third in the two Dysons and two-thirds in Clarke, there was nothing to show that the plaintiff had not Clarke\u2019s title. The Clarkes, defendants, made no defence, and the defendants Belmont and Home could not avail themselves of the defence as to a part of the property to which they showed no title. As was said by a judge of the Court of Appeals : \u201cIt seems to me no answer, to say that there are other parties who can successfully contest the plaintiff\u2019s title. It may be that such parties will acquiesce as they have hitherto done. Whether they do or not is a matter of no interest to the defendants, and in neither case can they (the defendants) have any claim to the land\u201d (Craft v. Merrill, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>464).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">XIII. The statement in an insolvent\u2019s or bankrupt\u2019s schedule cannot contradict or limit his assignment (Elverd v<em>. </em>Foster, 6 <em>Dowl. P. C. 922).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-9\">XIV. Where, as in this case, the quantity and quality of the estate of D. S. Dyson rested upon the execution of deeds, the nature of the estate is a conclusion of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and the declaration of D. S. Dyson cannot change that estate. Declarations as to title can be material only where the title rests in a matter <em>in pais </em>(Brewster v. Stryker, <em>2 N. Y. </em>19; Warren <em>v. </em>Leland, <em>2 Barb. </em>613 ; Chautauqua Co. B\u2019k <em>v. </em>White, 6 <em>N. Y. 253; Adams </em>Ejectment, 249, <em>note </em>3.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\"><em>Bowdoin, Larocque &amp; </em>Barlow, attorneys, and W. W. <em>Macfarland, </em>of counsel for respondents, argued: <em>First Point. </em>When a bankrupt places his property in the hands of the law to be administered as a trust fund for the benefit of his creditors, he necessarily parts with and conveys that, and that only, in which he had a beneficial interest, and might himself have lawfully appropriated to the satisfaction of his debts, this alone being necessary to the due execution of his trust. <em>A </em>trust estate never passes (Webster <em>v. </em>Cooper, 14 <em>How.

This, therefore, was all the assignee had to convey, and all he supposed he had to convey, and he did convey this by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>deed to Stephens, leaving no residue of title whatever to pass by his subsequent deed to Ford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-5\"><em>Third Point. </em>It follows that the plaintiff never obtained any title from the assignee in bankruptcy ; that she wrongfully, and without color of title, invaded the lawful possession of the defendants, and that the defendants are entitled to recover possession (Smith <em>v. </em>Lorillard, 10 <em>John. </em>338; Jackson <em>v. </em>Harder, 4 <em>John. </em>202; Jackson <em>v. </em>Graham, 3 <em>Cai. </em>188; Jackson <em>v. </em>Bush, 10 <em>John. </em>223).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">. <em>Fourth Point. </em>The judgment of the Special Term should be affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b155-7\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">The learned judge be: fore whom the action was tried, has found that the plaintiff had been in the actual possession of the premises for three years immediately next preceding the commencement of this action, and that her possession was such as to entitle her to maintain this action. The suit is in the nature of a proceeding to compel the determination of claims to real property, pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, but prosecuted as an action, under the 449th section of the Code. It is consequently governed by the same rules as other actions, and the same defences to defeat the right to such relief may be set up (Peck <em>v. </em>Brown, 26 <em>How. </em>360 ; Barnard <em>v. </em>Simms, 42 <em>Barb. </em>304 ; Hammond <em>v. </em>Tillston, 18 <em>Barb. </em>332).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The cause was tried at Special Term by both parties, on the assumption that the defendants had properly pleaded their title, and on that assumption was there disposed of. The case comes up for review on the judgment roll and exceptions only.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The first question that arises is, whether the plaintiff has established any title to the premises. She claims title by a deed from the official assignee in bankruptcy executed for a nominal consideration, in October, 1860, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>purporting to convey all the premises, including the ten lots in question, conveyed by Alexander M. Bruer to Duncan S. Dyson, July 7, 1835. Chief Justice Robertson held that the true construction to be given to the deeds under which D. S. Dyson had an interest which passed to the assignee in bankruptcy was, that thereunder the only estate he had, which was capable of passing to an assignee in bankruptcy, was an undivided one-third part (Ford v. Belmont, 7 <em>Rob. </em>110); and I agree with the judge before whom this cause was tried at Special Term, that this view is substantially the ground taken in the General Term opinion (7 <em>Robt. 522).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It seems to be determined in this court by the construction already given to the effect of these instruments, and of the assignment to the assignee in bankruptcy by D. S. Dyson, that only an undivided third part passed to the assignee, and there appears no reason for putting a different construction on the instruments and the effect of the proceedings in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">This individual one-third of the premises conveyed to D. S. Dyson, including the ten lots in question, having become vested in the assignee in bankruptcy, was by him conveyed, in August, 1846, to one Gordon L. Ford, in fee simple; consequently, all the estate of the assignee in bankruptcy passed to him, and there was nothing left for the assignee to convey to the plaintiff by his deed to her in 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The next and remaining question is, whether the defendants, Belmont and Home, as surviving trustees of Caroline S. Belmont, are entitled to recover the possession of these ten lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The plaintiff shows a possession for three years immediately preceding the commencement of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">From 1861 to 1865 the lots in question were in the actual occupation of one McNulty, who had charge of the premises on behalf of the trustees of Mrs. Belmont, and previous to that they were in the possession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>occupation of lessees, whose possession and occupation was also through the trustees of Mrs. Belmont, and enured to their benefit. It had been conveyed to these trustees in November, 1847, for the purposes of a marriage settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The plaintiff by her action seeks that the court shall upon the strength of her three-years\u2019 possession, defeat the prior possessory title of the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Down to the trial of this cause, the defendant Belmont had paid the taxes on the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The trustees had a long-continued possession under claim of title to the entire interests in the premises, and this possession was immediately-prior to the possession of the plaintiff. This prior possession of the trustees had never been abandoned, and whether it was short of twenty years or not, it was of such a character that it must prevail over the subsequent possession of less than twenty years (Smith <em>v. </em>Lorillard, 10 <em>J. R. </em>356; Jackson <em>v. </em>Livingston, 7 <em>Cow. </em>636).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
