It is admitted by the answer that seven cents, which he paid, was all that was required to be paid for the fare from any point above Sixty-fifth Street to any point below Sixty-fifth Street. You will therefore have no trouble about that question. The next question for you to decide is, whether these facts occurred as alleged in the complaint, that the plaintiff actually paid his fare, and was afterward put off the car, as claimed in his complaint, and as claimed by his testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">\u201c The testimony here is contradictory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">\u201c This is one of those cases peculiarly within the province of a jury to weigh, estimate, and decide. It is not my business, as a court, to direct you in the premises, or to even give you an intimation, perhaps, beyond reflection upon the character of the testimony as it appears in the case. The plaintiff has been upon the stand. You have heard him testify. He has given a clear statement in regard to dates, and the time of this occurrence. He distinctly states that it occurred on the 20th day of June ; that he paid his fare in the regular way ; that it was received ; that it was his intention to go to a point below Sixty-fifth Street; and that he paid his fare in accordance therewith, seven cents. From that time, gentlemen, there is no doubt that the character of passenger came upon him, and that these parties, the defendants, were in the position of common carriers, compelled by the law to do all that was necessary to insure his safety to the place where he should leave the car. They were bound to treat him as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">\u201cHe states, also, that when he came to Sixty-fifth Street, the car he was upon turned into the depot; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the conductor called out, \u201cChange cars;\u201d that he heard that said by the conductor; that the passengers left and went into another car that was very near it; that he spoke to a man who afterwards acted as conductor upon that car, and asked him if he required a check to go on that car, and he was answered that he did not; that he went on board that car, and that somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifty-ninth Street, or below there, it matters not exactly, after he had gone in and taken his seat in this car No. <em>2, </em>he was requested by the conductor to pay his fare ; he refused; thereupon the conductor put him off the car. There was a scuffle. It does not appear that there was any undue violence, or any serious damage to the plaintiff from the scuffle which ensued; but the plaintiff tells us that he was put off the car, and left there, and took another car, and paid six cents .for going on to the place of his destination, and there he left the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\">\u201cThese are the facts testified substantially by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">\u201cNow, on the other side, comes the testimony of the officers of this road, and you have heard them testimony. In the first place, the superintendent and the receiver have come and showed you, by means of a description of the manner in which that road is carried on, how the cars ran, that on that day car No. 75 was a through car from Harlem to the City Hall; that car No. <em>2 </em>was a car running from Sixty-fifth Street to the City Hall; that these two cars in nowise connected according to the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">\u201cNow, although their testimony is not positive, from their own personal knowledge, like the testimony of the plaintiff in this case\u2014for they testify that they do not know that they even saw those cars on that day\u2014yet it is a kind of testimony entitled to consideration on your part as affecting the facts in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-7\">1 \u2018 Then there comes upon the stand the conductor of car No. 75, who testifies to you positively that he was on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that car on that day ; that he came through from Harlem here on regular trips ; that there was no stopping ; that there was no going into the depot at Sixty fifth Street on that day ; and that it did not connect with car Ho. <em>2. </em>He testifies as positively on that subject, as far as car Ho. <em>75 </em>is concerned, as the plaintiff testifies to the facts that he speaks of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-4\">\u201c Then comes before you the conductor of car Ho. <em>2, </em>and positively states that he was on that car on that day ; and that it did not connect with car Ho. 75. He states that he ran trips from the depot in Sixty-fifth Street to the City Hall on that day, and that no such occurrence took place upon that car as is stated by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-5\">\u201c The driver testifies substantially to the same facts, that he was on that car; and he testifies from the memory, as positively as the plaintiff in this case, that such an occurrence could not take place as a man being put off behind him with a box of tools without his knowing it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">1 \u2018 This is the testimony before you that you will have to consider and decide upon, in regard to the commission of the offence and the wrong charged in these pleadings. You have got to weigh this testimony. It is contradictory, I admit; but it is the peculiar province of every jury to take into consideration, and to reconcile if possible, or at least to decide, if they can agree upon the testimony. It often happens that juries do not agree when there is such a state of contradiction. I only advert to one or two rules in reference to contradictory evidence, that a jury has a right to consider always in such cases. You have a right to consider the appearance of the persons upon the stand when they testified, whether they appeared to be telling the truth ; whether their statements were full, with regard to the whole matter; whether they covered the whole case ; and you have a right to consider the circumstances and facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>about the matter as to the probability of its occurring under the circumstances. It is always proper for the jury to consider these points in weighing contradictory testimony, to arrive at the truth. It is not always, gentlemen, that the greatest number of witnesses establishes a certain fact. It may be a less number of witnesses, and the jury will establish a fact against the testimony of the greater number of witnesses, because of those circumstances and facts round about the testimony which carry conviction to the minds of the jury. You must take this testimony and weigh it, and consider these points, and decide whether these circumstances happened, or did not happen. You may come to the conclusion that the plaintiff is mistaken about these two cars ; that this connection was not as he stated. You may come to the conclusion that he is mistaken about connections on the two cars so closely. You may arrive at the conclusion that he is right, and that the officers of this road running these cars are mistaken, or have forgotten of this occurrence taking place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-4\">\u201c This is a matter that is before you; a plain, common circumstance which you are to consider without reference to the character of the parties, without reference to any sympathy; but which you are to weigh just as you would any other fact, and come to a conclusion; and until you arrive at that conclusion, whether those facts occurred as stated by the plaintiff or not, you are not in a position to go any further. You must decide that fact.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">He then charged the jury, that if they found for the plaintiff they might assess exemplary as well as compensatory damages. In this part of his charge he referred to, and commented on, several decided cases as bearing on and sustaining his view, that exemplary damages could be given, but did not state the amounts of the verdicts in these cases. After the charge the following proceedings took place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel begged the judge to observe that the plaintiff took no exception to the charge, and the presiding justice said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\">I do not think you ought to, for I think the charge was altogether on your side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">To this remark the defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-6\">The defendant requested the judge to charge\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-7\">1.

Counsel for plaintiff requested him to instruct the jury that it was not necessary so to believe. Counsel for defendant requested him to instruct the jury that the number and times of running of the defendant\u2019s cars specified by plaintiff were material facts, and unless they believe his testimony with respect thereto, they should not find a verdict in his favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">But the justice returned answer to the jury that the counsel of the respective parties did not agree as to what his instructions should be, and he therefore would give them no instructions on the point at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">To this ruling and announcement the defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">The jury subsequently found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at the sum of five hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-11\">The defendant moved upon a case made at Special Term, for a new trial; which motion was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-12\">The appeal is from the order denying motion for new trial, and also from the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Jas.

Having voluntarily taken the chance of a favorable verdict at their hands, which would -have concluded the plaintiff upon the facts, we must hold upon the authority of Rowe -y. Stevens, recently decided by this court, and reported in 34 <em>N. Y. JSupr. Ct. S., </em>p. 436, that the defendant cannot be permitted to complain of an adverse verdict by arguing that the case presented no evidence to be submitted to the jury, or at least presented such a preponderance of evidence on defendant\u2019s side, as to admit of no other verdict except one in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Allowing, at the commencement of the trial, the amount claimed in the complaint to be increased from $3,000 to $5,000, without a previous notice of motion therefor, was a matter resting in the discretion of the court (Richtmeyer v. Remsen, 38 <em>N. Y. </em>206; Meyer <em>v. </em>Fiegel, 7 <em>Rob. </em>122). Hot the slightest harm has accrued to the defendant from such amendment, and consequently no reason exists for the interference of the General Term with the exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The detailed statements made by the court, in charging the jury, of other similar cases and of the action of the courts therein, and the remark to plaintiff\u2019s counsel in reply to said counsel\u2019s announcement, that he had no exceptions to take, involve no error, but present mere questions of propriety. These are not re viewable on a bill of exceptions, and can only be considered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>a motion for a new trial, if assigned as a specific ground for the granting of a new trial, for the reason that the jury may possibly have been influenced thereby. Not having been thus urged, we must disregard them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Defendant\u2019s exceptions to the rulings of the court below in admitting certain evidence, and to the refusal of the court to reinstruct the jury, after their retirement under an elaborate charge covering the point respecting which additional information was sought, are clearly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On the trial, defendant\u2019s superintendent testified that \u201cif a passenger leaves one car, and gets on another, he \u201c must either pay his fare or produce a transfer. If he \u201cdoes neither, the instructions of the company are \u201cto put him off, using as little force as may be neces- \u201c sary. The only guide to the conductor is the fare or \u201ca transfer.\u201d Upon this testimony the court was justified in charging, that putting a passenger off from a car in case of refusal to pay fare, is within the line of the duty and employment of defendant\u2019s conductors. And the jury having by their verdict adopted plaintiff \u2019 s version of the occurrence, instead of believing the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses, defendant\u2019s liability to respond in damages became fully established. For it is well settled that, if an act is done by a servant in the business of the master and within the scope of his employment, the master is liable to third persons for any abuse of the authority conferred, and for injuries resulting from any error of judgment or mistake of facts by the servant, as well as for those resulting from a negligent or reckless performance of his duties. This rule applies equally to corporations and natural persons (Weed <em>v. </em>The Panama R. R. Co., 17 <em>N. Y. </em>363; Sandford, Adm\u2019r, v.The Eighth Av. R. R. Co., 23 <em>N. Y. </em>343; Drew <em>v. </em>The Sixth Av. R. R. Co., 26 <em>N. Y. </em>51; <em>Higgins.v. </em>The Watervliet Turnpike Co., 46 <em>N. Y. </em>23).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The remaining question, therefore, is to what extent the law will hold the defendant liable. This is a grave and most important question. Upon this point the jury were instructed that, in case they found for the plaintiff, they might assess exemplary as well as compensatory damages. The latter were held to be such as would compensate the plaintiff for the injuries actually sustained, including his pain and anguish of mind and body. The former were defined as damages which are given as an example, by way of punishment, to prevent a repetition of the wrongful act complained of, and they were described as something in the character of a punishment by the people, with the difference, however, that the person injured is the one that recovers the damages-, instead of the people, by fine or imprisonment. At the same time the jury were severely cautioned against rendering a verdict for an excessive amount. They were instructed that the case is not one calling for severe punishment; that if they came to the conclusion that they must find damages for the plaintiff, and that they must be exemplary as well as compensatory damages, they should consider the character of the offence, and affix a sum within the limits of reason, by way of example, but not as an act of impulse or of passion; and that they should decide between the plaintiff and the corporation defendant as they would decide between man and man. These definitions and instructions were not only substantially correct, but eminently proper, if the case itself justified the instruction in any manner that the jury might give exemplary in addi tion to compensatory damages. Damages for pain and anguish of body and mind are not exemplary or punitory in their character, in any strict or proper sense of those terms, but compensatory (Morse v. The Auburn <em>&amp; </em>Syracuse R.R. Co., 10 <em>Barb. </em>621); and in actions for injuries to the person occasioned by the negligence of the defendant, it has been repeatedly held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that the plaintiff may recover damages for his pain and suffering not only down to the time of the trial, \"but future suffering, which, the evidence renders reasonably certain must necessarily result from the injury, may also be compensated (Curtis v. Rochester &amp; Syracuse R.R. Co., 18 <em>N. Y. </em>534, affirming S. C., 20 <em>Barb. </em>282; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Murphy, 1 <em>Duer, </em>233, affirmed in 11 <em>N. Y. </em>416).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The same rule as to compensatory damages applies with still greater force to actions of assault and battery, and it is no answer to the enforcement of the rule that the assault was committed by an agent, if committed by such agent in the line of his duty and within the scope of his employment. In such case'the master is liable as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">How, in Caldwell v. The Hew Jersey Steamboat Co., 47 <em>N. Y. </em>296, the present Court of Appeals fully endorsed the principle that, in any case where exemplary damages may be recoverable against the servant, they should be allowed against the master, if it appears that he had reasonable notice of the negligent habits of the servant, or if he left the servant without control or supervision in the work. In addition, it was distinctly held, that corporations are not exempt from the infliction of punitive damages in a proper case. That the case at bar is one of that character, seems to be clearly apparent from the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in Goddard <em>v. </em>The Grand Trunk Railway, reported as a leading case upon the points involved in the 10th volume of the new series of the American Law Register. Justice Walton, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case in favor of sustaining a verdict of $4,850, discusses at length the question of the liability of corporations as common carriers of passengers for the unlawful acts of their employes committed upon such passengers, to whom the said corporations, as such carriers, owe the legal duty of exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>cising the highest degree of care that human judgment and foresight are capable of, to make the journey safe. He then gives an interesting review of the origin, growth, and application of the doctrine of exemplary damages, and points out that the said doctrine is even more beneficial in point of public interest in its application to corporations than in its application to natural persons. His reasoning upon this point commends itself so forcibly to the intellect, and is so fully sustained by \"the numerous authorities cited in its support, that further elaboration of the subject here would be a work of supererogation. A simple reference to. it is amply sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">There being no error in the proceedings below, the judgment and order appealed from must be severally affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
