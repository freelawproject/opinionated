Subsequently, a new Court on the Judiciary was appointed to conform to section 22 of article VI of the New York Constitution. The matter was referred to a Referee to conduct a hearing and make findings with respect to the charges against respondent. A hearing was held before the Referee from March 7 through March 29, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"Arb\">Fourteen acts of judicial misconduct, contained in 11 charges, were alleged by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct against respondent. The Referee sustained four of the charges: Charge VIII (a) (the acceptance of a weekend stay at Kutsher\u2019s Country Club for respondent and his wife paid by the law firm of respondent\u2019s long-time close personal friend); Charge VII (registering under the name and address of a partner of that same law firm without that person\u2019s permission, thereby concealing respondent\u2019s identity); Charge X (failing to disqualify himself from cases in which his law secretary\u2019s law partner appeared in respondent\u2019s court on behalf of one of the parties); and Charge XI (failing to disqualify himself from presiding over a nonjury Small Claims trial in which his close friend was a party defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"AhDo\">Based upon an examination of both the transcript of testimony and Referee\u2019s report, we confirm the Referee\u2019s findings which were established by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence. As to the charges reported as not sustained, we agree with the Referee that the evidence presented on each was insufficient. Furthermore, we confirm the Referee\u2019s procedural rulings and find that respondent was accorded due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"(f)\">*(f)</page-number>process throughout. The affirmative defenses are without merit and are dismissed. The interim procedural rulings of the Referee are confirmed. The sole question remaining for our consideration is the sanction to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aulf\">In order to determine the appropriate sanction, it is necessary to examine briefly the confirmed charges. In connection with Charge VIII (a) we note that respondent exercised poor judgment and engaged in injudicious conduct. Although there is no evidence that respondent gave either his long-time friend, Gerald Garson, or his law firm special favor or treatment in any matter before him, despite the long-standing intimate and personal social relationship with his long-time friend, the Referee found that it was injudicious of respondent to spend a weekend with his wife at a hotel as a guest of a law firm because such is beyond the permissible ordinary social hospitality permitted by the Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 5, subd C, par [4], cl [b]). With respect to Charge VII, it is clear that respondent signed Louis Goldberg\u2019s name when registering at Kutsher\u2019s at the behest of one of Goldberg\u2019s partners. The Referee found, however, that although respondent may not have intended to conceal his identity, he did create the objective impression on the records of the hotel that he was Louis Goldberg which was both injudicious and in violation of the Canons of Judicial Ethics (Canons 1, 4, 13).</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">Charge X related to conferences or settlements in cases where Robert G. Stern, a law partner of respondent\u2019s law secretary, appeared before respondent. The Referee found that respondent participated in only a handful of such cases over a three-year period while he was assigned as one part of a \"troika\u201d which handled thousands of cases. It must be observed that the settlement procedures described were carried on virtually publicly and mostly by the same groups of lawyers for both sides, long accustomed to dealing with each other in a mass effort to dispose of great numbers of calendar clogging cases in what might be characterized as a settlement mill. In the circumstances there could have been no opportunity, even assuming such a desire, for anything untoward to have taken place. Nevertheless, it was an exercise of poor judgment for respondent to have presided in these cases. In view of the large number of cases presented daily to respondent, the Referee found respondent\u2019s conduct here \"excusable\u201d. Nevertheless, the Referee did find a technical violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"(g)\">*(g)</page-number>of the Canons, even though no injustice of any kind was shown to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"Az2\">Finally, on Charge XI, although it was a judicial impropriety and a violation of the Canons of Judicial Ethics for respondent to sit on a case where his long-time friend appeared as a party defendant in a nonjury Small Claims Part, the case involved only a $106.81 claim and there were no allegations or evidence that the defendant received any preferential treatment or that injustice was perpetrated. However, the improper act did, as we have said, convey the impression of impropriety, and it is the primary basis for the sanction we impose.</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">We find no evidence in this record of corruption, general neglect of duty, acts violative of law inspired by self-interest, oppressive and arbitrary conduct, reckless disregard of litigants\u2019 rights or any finding that respondent\u2019s future retention of office is inconsistent with the fair and proper administration of justice in this State <em>(Friedman v State of New York, </em>24 NY2d 528, 540). Nor is there evidence of a \"repeated and unrelenting display of unjudicial temperament\u201d <em>(Matter of Waltemade, </em>37 NY2d [a], [hhh]). Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to indicate that respondent lacks the ability or fitness to perform the duties imposed upon him as a Supreme Court Justice. Accordingly, removal is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"Aim\">Nevertheless, with respect to the charges sustained and confirmed, respondent\u2019s conduct was injudicious and improper and, as such, constituted a serious transgression of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Canons of Judicial Ethics. High standards of conduct must be observed by judicial officers so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved. A Judge\u2019s official conduct should be free from the appearance of impropriety in his personal behavior on the Bench and his conduct in everyday life should be beyond reproach. He may engage in social and recreational activities so long as these do not detract from the dignity of his office or interfere with the performance of his judicial duties. Furthermore, neither a Judge nor a member of his family residing in his household should accept a gift or favor from any attorney or from any person having or likely to have any official transaction with the court in which he presides, except for reasonable exchanges incident to family, social or recretional relationships or activities.</p>\n<p id=\"A3j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"(h)\">*(h)</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that respondent\u2019s conduct violated the Code of Judicial Conduct (Canons 1, 2, 3, subd [C], par [1]; 5, subd A; 5, subd C, pars [1], [4], [5]), the Canons of Judicial Ethics (Canons 1, 4, 13, 32) and the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct of the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference of the State of New York (22 NYCRR 20.6 [now 20.4], 33.5 [c] [3]). Under these circumstances, respondent should be suspended without pay <em>(Matter of Pfingst, </em>33 NY2d [a]) for a period of six months commencing from the date of the order to be entered on this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"AMCL\">Presiding Officer Markewich and Judges Moule, Cardamone, Kane and Main concur in Per <em>Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"ApzG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"(i)\">*(i)</page-number>State of New York Court on the Judiciary</p>\n<p id=\"AO0V\">At a Court on the Judiciary for the State of New York held at Courthouse of the Appellate Division, First Department, New York, New York on the 26th day of September A.D. 1977</p>\n<p id=\"AH-y\">Present: Honorable Arthur Markewich, Presiding.
