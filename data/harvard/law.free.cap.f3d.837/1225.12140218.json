Based on his prior Alabama convictions for robbery, first-degree possession of marijuana, and trafficking in cocaine, Defendant was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) to serve 180 months in prison. On appeal, Defendant argues that he should not have been sentenced under the ACCA because neither of his drug offenses is a valid ACCA predicate. Because this argument is foreclosed by controlling precedent, Defendant\u2019s sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-16\">On September 18, 2013, officers from the Birmingham Police Department made a routine traffic stop having observed a seatbelt violation. Defendant was in the front passenger seat of the car that was stopped. The officers found a gun during the stop, and Defendant admitted the gun was his. A record check indicated that the gun was stolen, and a criminal history check revealed an outstanding warrant for Defendant\u2019s arrest, as well as numerous prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-17\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-18\">Defendant pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Citing Defendant\u2019s prior Alabama convictions for first-degree possession of marijuana and trafficking in cocaine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) assigned Defendant a base offense level of 24 under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Two points were added pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) because the gun found in Defendant\u2019s possession was stolen, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 26. Although Defendant pled guilty, the PSR did not recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because while on pretrial release, Defendant had been arrested on a domestic violence charge and had also provided a urine sample that reflected his use of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-19\">The PSR further recommended that Defendant be sentenced as an arined career criminal under the ACCA based on his prior violent felony and drug convictions. According to the PSR, Defendant\u2019s mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>juana and cocaine trafficking convictions qualified as serious drug offenses under the ACCA. Defendant also had a prior Alabama robbery conviction, which the PSR classified as a violent felony. Applying the ACCA enhancement, the PSR assigned Defendant a total offense level of 33 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), yielding a guidelines range of 188 to 235 months and a mandatory minimum of 180 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In written objections to the PSR, Defendant argued that a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was warranted, given his guilty plea and his admission at the time of arrest to possessing the gun. Defendant also objected to the ACCA enhancement. He conceded that his robbery conviction qualified as a violent felony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but argued that his marijuana and cocaine trafficking convictions were not serious drug offenses as defined by the ACCA. Specifically, Defendant argued that both drug offenses were defined by Ala-bama law to cover simple possession, and that neither of the offenses necessarily involved the manufacture or distribution of, or the intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance, as required by the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">The district court sustained Defendant\u2019s objection in part as to the acceptance of responsibility issue, applied a two-level reduction, and adjusted his guidelines range accordingly. Citing controlling precedent from this Court, the district court overruled Defendant\u2019s ACCA objections and found that Defendant had three qualifying predicates, including the robbery, first-degree possession of marijuana, and cocaine trafficking convictions. The court sentenced Defendant to the mandatory minimum term of 180 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. Defendant argues on appeal that the district court should not have applied the ACCA enhancement because neither of his drug convictions qualified as a serious drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">We review de novo whether a conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir. 2009). In conducting our review, \u201cwe are bound to follow a prior binding precedent \u2018unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-11\">II. The ACCA</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-12\">The ACCA mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for a defendant who has three prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense and who is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>victed of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined by the ACCA to include \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ,.. for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii),</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">In determining 'whether \u00e1 state conviction qualifies as a predicate under the ACCA, we follow what is described as a \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1295. Under this approach, we are concerned only with the fact of the conviction and the statutory definition of the offense, rather than with the particular facts of the defendant\u2019s crime. <em>Id. </em>As applied to this case, the categorical approach requires us to determine whether first-degree possession of marijuana and cocaine trafficking, as those crimes are defined by Alabama law, fall within the definition of a serious drug offense set forth in the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir. 2014) (explaining that we look to the plain language of the ACCA\u2019s definition of the term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d to determine the elements of such an offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">When a statute covers some conduct that falls within, and other conduct that is broader than, a predicate offense as defined by the ACCA and when that statute is divisible,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we may use a modified categorical approach to determine whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies. <em>See Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281-82, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Under the modified categorical approach, we look to a limited class of documents, such as the indictment and jury instructions, to determine which alternative element was the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 2281. We then consider whether that element is encompassed by the ACCA predicate offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">III. Defendant\u2019s Marijuana Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-17\">Section 13A-12-213(a) of the Ala-bama Code provides that a person is guilty of first-degree possession of marijuana if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-18\">(1) He or she possesses marihuana for other than personal use; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-19\">(2) He or she possesses marihuana for , his or her personal use only after having been previously convicted of unlawful possession of marihuana in the second degree or unlawful possession of marihuana for his or her personal use only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-20\">Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Defendant was convicted of first-degree possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d under \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant concedes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>conviction meets the ACCA\u2019s requirement that it be punishable by a maximum term of at least ten years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But he argues that it is not a serious drug offense because the Alabama statute does not expressly require \u201cmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent\u201d to do either. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">We rejected Defendant\u2019s argument in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1296-97 (11th Cir. 2009). As we explained in <em>Robinson, </em>possession of marijuana \u201cfor someone else\u2019s use\u201d necessarily involves possession \u201cwith the intent to distribute\u201d it to another person. <em>Id. </em>at 1296. <em>See also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7802(11) (defining the term \u201cdistribute\u201d for purposes of federal drug laws to mean \u201cdeliver\u201d). Consequently, we held that a conviction for possession of marijuana for other than personal use under \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) qualifies as a serious drug offense under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Defendant argues that <em>Robinson </em>is wrong and that the conduct made criminal by \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) falls outside of the ACCA\u2019s definition of a serious drug offense because, in theory, a person could violate the statute by jointly possessing marijuana with another person or by possessing it with intent to administer or dispense it, rather than with intent to distribute it. Defendant, however, does not explain why jointly possessing marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d would not also necessarily involve an intent to distribute or deliver it to another person. As to his argument that an individual could violate the statute by possessing marijuana with intent to administer or dispense it, he does not cite any authority to suggest that \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) has ever been applied in this hypothetical situation. <em>See Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1685, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (\u201c[T]here must be \u2018a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007))); <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir. 2014) (rejecting a similar argument where the defendant failed to show a realistic probability that the statute at issue had been applied in an \u201cadministering\u201d situation), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1892, 191 L.Ed.2d 767 (2015). Rather, the case law indicates that our interpretation of \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) in <em>Robinson </em>is consistent with that of the Alabama courts. <em>See McWhorter v. State, </em>588 So.2d 951, 954 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991) (reversing a defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(1) where there was no evidence that his marijuana growing room was part of a distribution operation); <em>Harris v. State, </em>594 So.2d 725, 728-29 (Ala. Crim. App. 1992) (affirming a defendant\u2019s conviction under the statute where law enforcement found, among other evidence, 18 separate packets of marijuana hidden in an eyeglass case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-13\">Defendant acknowledges that <em>Robinson </em>rejected his argument, but he asserts that <em>Robinson </em>is no longer controlling as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Descamps. </em>His argument is unpersuasive. Binding circuit precedent can only be overruled by a Supreme Court decision that is \u201cclearly on point.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trustees, </em>344 F.3d 1288, 1292 (11th Cir. 2003). To meet that standard, the intervening Supreme Court decision must \u201cactually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>abrogate or directly conflict with, as opposed to merely weaken,\u201d the prior panel\u2019s holding. <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir. 2009). Obviously, <em>Des-camps </em>had no such impact on <em>Robinson. </em>The question before the Supreme Court in <em>Descamps </em>was whether the modified categorical .approach applies when a state statute of conviction contains a \u201csingle, indivisible set of elements\u201d that is broader than the generic version of an enumerated violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2282. The Supreme Court held that it does not, but that holding has no bearing on our decision in <em>Robinson </em>that the possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d necessarily involves an intent to distribute, such that a conviction under \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) is encompassed by the ACCA\u2019s definition of a serious drug offense. <em>See Main Drug, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>475 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cObedience to a Supreme Court decision is one thing, extrapolating from its implications a holding on an issue that was not before that Court in order to upend settled circuit law is another thing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">To repeat, because the prior precedent rule requires that we follow <em>Robinson </em>unless and until it is overruled by this Court en banc or by the Supreme Court, <em>Robinson </em>clearly governs \u2014 and forecloses \u2014 this ground of Defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>See Robinson, </em>583 F.3d at 1295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">IV. Defendant\u2019s Cocaine Trafficking Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">Section 13A-12-231 of the Alabama Code prohibits trafficking in specified kinds of drugs. Defendant was convicted of trafficking 'in cocaine, pursuant to \u00a7 13A-12-231(2). This section provides that a person commits the offense of trafficking in cocaine if he \u201cknowingly sells, manufactures, delivers; or brings into this state, or ... is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, 28 grams or more of cocaine or of any mixture containing cocaine.\u201d Conviction under this section carries a mandatory-minimum sentence of three years imprisonment. <em>See </em>13A-12-231(2)a. The mandatory penalty under the statute increases as the quantity of cocaine increases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">The above statute prohibiting drug trafficking is part of a three-tiered scheme for punishing drug offenses in Alabama that also includes: (1) a statute which prohibits possession of any amount of a controlled substance other than marijuana (Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-212)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) a statute prohibiting the unlawful distribution of or possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance other than marijuana (Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-211).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number> As noted, the third leg of this three-tier statutory scheme is the statute prohibiting trafficking in a controlled substance, under which statute Defendant was convicted: Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-231(2). Trafficking is the most serious of these offenses. <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-231(13) (stating that trafficking in cocaine is a Class A felony) and Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5-3(b)(1) (designating Class A felonies as the most serious offenses). Notwithstanding its top ranking in the severity-pecking order of Alabama cocaine statutes, Defendant contends that trafficking in cocaine, as defined by \u00a7 13A \u2014 12\u2014231 (2), does not qualify as a serious drug offense under the ACCA because it does not necessarily involve \u201cmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing [a controlled substance] with intent\u201d to do either. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">We rejected this same argument in <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150 (11th Cir. 2005), <em>overruled on other grounds by Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The defendant in <em>James </em>had a prior conviction for trafficking by possession of between . 200 and 400 grams of cocaine under a Florida statute that is nearly identical to Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-231(2), and that fits within a similar three-tiered statutory scheme defining trafficking as a more serious crime than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id<em>. </em>at 1152, 1154. He argued, as Defendant does here, that the conviction did not qualify, as a serious drug offense under the ACCA because it was based on simple possession of a specified amount of cocaine rather than a demonstrated, intent to manufacture or distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 1154. We rejected that argument, holding that the Florida trafficking statute inferred intent to distribute based on the quantity possessed, and that the defendant\u2019s conviction under the statute thus fell within the ACCA\u2019s definition of a serious drug offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1155-56,</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">The rationale underlying <em>James' </em>originated in <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir. 2003). The defendant in <em>Madera-Madera </em>had a prior conviction for trafficking by possession of 87 grams of methamphetamine under a materially indistinguishable Georgia trafficking statute that was part of a comparable three-tiered statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31. We held that the conviction qualified as a . drug trafficking- offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1231. For purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is defined to include a state offense \u201cthat prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a72L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)). The defendant in <em>Madera-Madera </em>argued that his Georgia trafficking conviction did not fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>that definition because it was based on mere possession rather than a listed act such as possession with intent to distribute. We rejected that argument, reasoning that \u201cGeorgia\u2019s trafficking statute necessarily infers an intent to distribute once a defendant possesses a certain amount of drugs.\u201d <em>Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">As <em>Madera-Madera </em>further explained, Georgia\u2019s trafficking statute requires the possession of a significant quantity of drugs to support a conviction, and its three-tiered drug punishment scheme deems trafficking to be more serious than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 1231-32. Georgia law thus \u201crecognizes that someone who is in possession of [the requisite quantity of drugs] ... plans on distributing and thereby \u2018trafficking\u2019 those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Finally, <em>Madera-Madera </em>noted that if we do not likewise recognize the inferred intent to distribute for purposes of the guidelines, an anomaly would result: trafficking, the most serious drug crime under Georgia law, would not qualify for a sentencing enhancement, whereas' the less serious crime of possession with intent to distribute would. <em>Id. </em>at 1233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">When faced in <em>James </em>with the question whether a conviction under a nearly identical Florida trafficking statute qualified as a serious drug offense for purposes of an ACCA enhancement, we found no reason to distinguish or depart from <em>Ma-dera-Madera. James, </em>430 F.3d at 1154. Citing <em>Madera-Madera, </em>we held that an inference of intent to distribute was warranted by the significant quantity of drugs a defendant must possess to violate the trafficking statute and by Florida\u2019s three-tiered statutory scheme designating trafficking as more serious than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 1155. And as in <em>Madera-Madera, </em>we noted the anomaly, that would result from treating a Florida trafficking conviction more leniently under the ACCA than a Florida conviction for possession with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSuch an anomalous result,\u201d we explained, \u201cwould thwart the ACCA\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">As an additional ground for our holding in <em>James, </em>we relied on the ACCA\u2019s definition of a serious drug offense to broadly include \u201cany offense <em>involving </em>the manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to manufacture or distribute\u201d drugs. <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)) (emphasis added and quotation marks omitted). We found it clear from the ACCA\u2019s use of the term \u201cinvolving\u201d that the definition of a serious drug offense might include \u201cstate offens\u00e9s that do not have as an element the manufacture, distribution, or possession of drugs with intent to manufacture or distribute.\u201d <em>James, </em>430 F.3d at 1155. As such, we were unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00bfhe \u201clanguage of the Florida statute need[s] [to] exactly match\u201d the specific acts listed in the ACCA definition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">Other circuit courts have likewise adopted an expansive interpretation of the word \u201cinvolving\u201d as used in the ACCA\u2019s definition of a serious drug offense. <em>See United States v. Whindleton, </em>797 F.3d 105, 110-11 (1st Cir. 2015) (holding that an offer to sell drugs is sufficiently related to distribution to qualify as a serious drug offense, even if the defendant never possesses the drugs and the offer is not accepted); <em>United States v. Bynum, </em>669 F.3d 880, 886 (8th Cir. 2012) (holding the same and noting that involving is an expansive term); <em>United States v. Winbush, </em>407 F.3d 703, 708 (5th Cir. 2005) (\u201cthe term \u2018involving\u2019 clearly suggests that Congress intended to include other drug offenses, in addition to those already enumerated\u201d); <em>United States v. King, </em>325 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2003) (construing the word involving \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>extending the focus of \u00a7 924(e) beyond the precise offenses of distributing, manufacturing, or possessing\u201d to include the offense of attempted possession with intent to sell); <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>331 F.3d 116, 131 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (relying on the \u201cexpansive connotations\u201d of the word involving to hold that a conviction for attempted possession with intent to distribute qualified as a serious drug offense under the ACCA (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">None of these courts, however, have held that a conviction for trafficking based on the possession of a certain quantity of drugs is a serious drug offense under the ACCA. Nonetheless, they have all rejected the basic premise of the argument made by the defendant in <em>James </em>\u2014 and by Defendant in this case \u2014 that an offense cannot qualify unless it expressly requires \u201cactual distribution or manufacture, or a specific intent to distribute or manufacture.\u201d The Fourth Circuit is the only other circuit court to have considered the specific issue that was before us in <em>James. See United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186, 192 (4th Cir. 2001). Consistent with <em>James, </em>the court in <em>Brandon </em>indicated that it would have \u201cno difficulty concluding\u201d that\u2019 a conviction for trafficking by possession of a sufficiently large quantity of drugs \u201c\u2018involved\u2019 an intent to ... distribute\u201d because \u201cit is natural and reasonable to assume that those who possess very large quantities of drugs intend to distribute those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. Brandon </em>thus concurred with our reasoning in <em>James </em>that it is not essential that the state statute of conviction include as an element a specific intent to manufacture or distribute to qualify as a serious drug offense under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 190. Nevertheless, <em>Brandon </em>concluded that the 28-gram threshold required for a conviction under the North Carolina trafficking statute at issue in that case \u2014 the same amount required under the Florida trafficking statute in <em>James </em>and under the Alabama trafficking statute at issue here\u2014 was simply too low a. quantity of drugs to warrant an inference of the defendant\u2019s intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 192-93. In short, <em>Brandon </em>agreed in principle with our approach in <em>James </em>\u2014 that a statute classifying possession of a certain quantity of drugs was sufficient to indicate an intent to distribute those drugs. <em>Brandon, </em>however, disagreed that possession of 28 grams of cocaine was sufficient to give rise to that inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Defendant cites decisions from the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits in which those courts refused to infer intent to distribute in the context of determining whether a state trafficking-by-possession conviction qualified as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a72L1.2 or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines. In each of the cited decisions, the court held that such an inference was contrary to the guidelines definitions of a drug trafficking offense and a controlled substance offense, both of which are limited to offenses that <em>prohibit </em>\u201cthe manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of\u2019 a controlled substance or \u201cthe possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense\u201d it. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a72L1.2, 4B1.2(b). <em>See United States v. Lopez-Salas, </em>613 F.3d 174, 180 (5th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThe Guidelines could have defined a drug' trafficking offense based on the quantity of drugs possessed. Instead, they require that a state prove an intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d); <em>United States v. Villa-Lara, </em>451 F.3d 963, 965-66 (9th Cir. 2006) (focusing on the guidelines definition of a drug trafficking offense to conclude that the defendant\u2019s Nevada trafficking by possession conviction did not qualify); <em>United States v. Montanez, </em>442 F.3d 485, 488 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[U]nder the Guidelines, simple possession \u2014 that is, possession without the proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>requisite intent to \u2018manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense\u2019 \u2014 is not a controlled substance offense.\u201d); <em>United, States v. Herrera-Roldan, </em>414 F.3d 1238, 1241 (10th Cir. 2005) (rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that the guidelines permit an inference of intent to distribute based on the defendant\u2019s' possession of more than 50 pounds of marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s argument, these decisions do not necessarily conflict with the result we reached in <em>James, </em>which was an ACCA case. For the most part,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> though, they do reject the rationale underlying <em>Madera-Madera. </em>As discussed, there is general agreement among the circuits that the ACCA\u2019s definition of a serious drug offense is broader than the guidelines definition of a drug trafficking or a controlled substance offense because of the ACCA\u2019s use of the term \u201cinvolving.\u201d Based on that broad language, we reasoned in <em>James </em>that \u201cthe Florida statute need not exactly match\u201d the specific acts listed in the ACCA\u2019s definition. <em>James, </em>430 F.3d at 1155. That reasoning is undisturbed by the cited decisions holding (1) that the guidelines definition of a drug trafficking and a controlled substance offense does require an exact match and (2) that there is no match when the state statutes of conviction require nothing more than possession of a certain quantity of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">Finally, we reject Defendant\u2019s argument that <em>James </em>is no longer controlling as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Descamps. </em>As noted, the Supreme Court held in <em>Descamps </em>that \u201csentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach\u201d to determine whether a defendant\u2019s conviction under a statute with a \u201csingle, indivisible set of elements\u201d qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2282. The Supreme Court had no occasion in <em>Descamps </em>to decide whether it is appropriate to infer intent to distribute based on the quantity of drugs that must be possessed in order to violate a state trafficking statute, or even to consider more generally the proper interpretation or application of the ACCA\u2019s serious drug offense provision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">We are thus bound .under the prior precedent rule to follow our decision in <em>James </em>unless and until it is abrogated by an en banc decision or by a Supreme Court decision. Therefore, we hold in accordance with <em>James </em>that Defendant\u2019s Alabama conviction for trafficking by possession of at least 28 grams of cocaine constitutes a serious drug offense and a valid predicate under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-11\">For the reasons discussed above, Defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">.
