HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">Paula Sue Graves appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of an agency decision that she is not disabled, and therefore is not entitled to disability insurance benefits. Graves argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) who reviewed her ease erred by failing to ask a testifying vocational expert whether her testimony was consistent with the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(DOT), as required by an agency policy interpretation ruling, but nonetheless relying on that testimony. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-19\">In August 2011, Graves filed applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income payments, alleging that she became disabled the previous month because of her anxiety, depression, and intellectual disability. The Commissioner of Social Security denied those applications, finding'that Graves is not disabled, and adhered to that decision on Graves\u2019s request for reconsideration. Graves then asked for and received a hearing before an ALJ, at which she was represented by counsel. During this hearing, the ALJ questioned a vocational expert, who described certain jobs appearing in the record and estimated their availability in the national and Texas economies.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">The ALJ affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision in May 2013, finding that Graves has the residual functional capacity to perform some jobs available in the national economy so long as she can alternate between sitting and standing. After the agency\u2019s Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, Graves sought judicial review, A magistrate judge recommended that the Commissioner\u2019s decision be affirmed. The district court overruled Graves\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">Our review of the finding that Graves is not' disabled \u201cis limited to determining whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the proper legal standards were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>used in evaluating the evidence.\u201d <em>Bowling v. Shalala, </em>36 F.3d 431, 434 (5th Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir. 1990)). We will, however, reverse an ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cif the claimant shows (1) that the ALJ failed to fulfill his duty to adequately develop the record, and (2) that the claimant was prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>Brock v. Chafer, </em>84 F.3d 726, 728 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">.A claimant is not entitled to disability benefits unless she \u201cis unable \u2018to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of [a] medically determinable physical or mental impairment ... which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowling, </em>36 F.3d at 435 (alteration and ellipsis in original) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(1), 423(d)(1)(A)). The Social Security Administration follows a sequential five-step process to make this determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">(1) a claimant who is working, engaging in a substantial gainful activity, will not be found to be disabled no matter what the medical findings are; (2) a claimant will not be found to be disabled unless he has a \u201csevere impairment\u201d; (3) a claimant whose impairment meets or is equivalent to an impairment listed in Appendix 1 of the regulations will be considered disabled without the need to consider vocational factors; (4) a claimant who is capable of performing work that he has done in the past must be found \u201cnot disabled\u201d; and (5) if the claimant is unable to perform his previous work as a result of his impairment, then factors such as his age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity must be considered to determine whether he can do other work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\"><em>Id.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). The burden of-proof is on the claimant for the first four steps but shifts to the agency at step five; a finding at any step that a claimant is or is not disabled ends the analysis. <em>Bowling, </em>36 F.3d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In this case, the ALJ proceeded to step five before determining that Graves is not disabled. Graves\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the ALJ failed to follow Social Security Ruling 00-4p, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajiy\">Occupational evidence provided by a VE or VS [vocational expert or vocational specialist] generally should be consistent with the occupational information supplied by the DOT. When there is an apparent, unresolved conflict between VE or VS evidence and the DOT, the adjudicator must elicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict before relying on the VE or VS evidence to support a determination or decision about whether the claimant is disabled. <em>At the hearings level, as part of the adjudicator\u2019s duty to fully develop the record, the adjudicator will inquire, on the record, as to whether or not there is such consistency.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">SSR 00-4p, 2000 WL .1898704, at *2 (Dec. 4, 2000) (emphasis added). As the italicized language suggests, an ALJ in a hearing such as Graves\u2019s \u201chas an affirmative responsibility to ask about \u2018any possible conflict\u2019 between VE evidence and the DOT ... before relying on VE evidence to support a determination of not disabled.\u201d <em>Kemp ex rel. Kemp v. Colvin, </em>743 F.3d 630, 633 (8th Cir. 2014) (footnote omitted); <em>accord, e.g., Lindsley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>560 F.3d 601, 603 (6th Cir. 2009); <em>Terry v. Astrue, </em>580 F.3d 471, 478 (7th Cir. 2009). Here, though the vocational expert cited the DOT in her testimony, the ALJ did not ask whether her testimony was consistent with the DOT. That was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Yet \u201c[tjhis Court will not reverse the decision of an ALJ for failure to fully and fairly develop the record unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>claimant shows that he or she was prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s failure.\u201d <em>Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 181, 142 (5th Cir. 2000);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see also Jones v. Astrue, </em>691 F.3d 730, 734-35 (5th Cir. 2012) (\u201cThe party seeking to overturn the Commissioner\u2019s decision has the burden to show that prejudice resulted from an error. A mere allegation that additional beneficial evidence might have been gathered had the error not occurred is insufficient to meet this burden.\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 448 (5th Cir. 2007) (\u201c \u2018Procedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required\u2019 as long as \u2018the substantial rights of a party have not been affected.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir. 1988))). Graves does not even attempt to show that the vocational expert\u2019s testimony was actually inconsistent with the DOT. Nor has she otherwise demonstrated prejudice. Hence, the ALJ\u2019s procedural error was harmless and does not warrant reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\u2022 Graves does not before this court raise any other ground for reversal, and it appears from our review of the record that the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">. Graves argues at length that <em>Carey </em>was wrongly decided. But \"[i]t is a well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness that one panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the Supreme Court, \u00f3r our <em>en banc </em>court.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir. 2,008). Further,, Grayes\u2019s appeal fails because she is unable to show prejudice resulting from the ALJ\u2019s error \u2014 a requirement found in other cases within and without this circuit. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"><em>. </em>Other circuits also apply harmless-error analysis to this type of procedural error. <em>See, e.g., Poppa v. Astrue, </em>569 F,3d 1167, 1174 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cBecause there were no conflicts between the VE\u2019s testimony and the DOT\u2019s job descriptions, the ALJ\u2019s error in- not inquiring about potential' conflicts was harmless.\u201d); <em>Terry, </em>580 F.3d at 478 (\"Terry is correct that the ALJ did not ask, the VE if his testimony conflicted with the DOT. However, the error is harmless -unless' there actually was a conflict.\u201d); <em>Massachi v. Astrue, </em>486 F.3d 1149, 1154 n.19 (9th Cir. 2007) (\"This procedural error could have been harmless, were there no conflict, or if the vocational expert had provided sufficient support for her conclusion so as to justify any potential conflicts.... \u201d); <em>Jackson v. Barnhart, </em>120 Fed.Appx. 904, 906 (3d Cir. 2005) (unpublished) (\"Where substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s opinion and where the failure to solicit the testimony contemplated in SSR 00-4P is harmless, this court will not reverse the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d); <em>cf. Shinseki v. Sanders, </em>556 U.S. 396, 409, 129 S.Ct. 1696, 173 L.Ed.2d 532 (2009) (\u201d[T]he burden of showing that an error is harmful normally falls upon the party attacking the agency's determination.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
