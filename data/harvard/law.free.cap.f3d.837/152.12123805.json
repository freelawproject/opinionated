(collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), brought this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Briccetti, /.), asserting various claims against Defendants-Appellees the Mount Vernon School District; the District Board of Trustees; Dr. Welton Sawyer, the Superintendent of the District; Shelly Jallow, the Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction of the District (collectively, \u201cDistrict Defendants\u201d); the New York State Education Department (\u201cNYSED\u201d) and Roberto Reyes, Title I, School and Community Services Director of the NYSED (collectively, \u201cNYSED Defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">This opinion addresses one of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims: that the district court erred in concluding that Plaintiffs did not make a prima facie showing of discrimination against the District Defendants pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\u201cSection 504\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7794 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Plaintiffs advance a disparate impact theory, relying on statistics showing that the District\u2019s- academic intervention services (\u201cAIS\u201d) \u2014 non-credit bearing courses intended for students at risk of not meeting state performance standards \u2014 were offered to children with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>at a greater rate than to children without such a disability. Because the ADA and Section 504 define \u201cdisability\u201d differently than does the IDEA, Plaintiffs present a question of first impression in this Circuit: whether an individual with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the IDEA categorically qualifies as an . individual with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA and Section 504, such that Plaintiffs\u2019 data relating to \u201cchild[ren] with a disability\u201d under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(3)(A), can establish a prima facie case with respect to a claim predicated on the plaintiff having a \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a712102(1), and Section 504, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20). We hold that it does not. A summary order filed simultaneously with this opinion addresses and rejects the balance of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims on appeal. For the reasons stated below and in the accompanying summary order, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Back&amp;round</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">J.C., daughter of Plaintiff-Appellant B.C., was classified as a, child with a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq. </em>Pursuant to that Act, J.C. had an individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) that set out certain guidelines for her public school instruction and specified the special education J.C. required. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(14) (defining IEP); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1414(d) (specifying IEP requirements). During the 2008-2009 school year, J.C. enrolled in the ninth grade at Mount Vernon High School, which is part of the Mount Vernon City School District. Her schedule consisted of seven classes, two of which were \u201cMath AIS 9\u201d and \u201cEnglish 9 AIS.\u201d J.A. 327-28. J.C. had been designated to receive AIS based on scores from standardized tests that she took during the eighth grade. Due to their \u201cremedial\u201d nature, J.C.\u2019s AIS courses were non-credit-bearing courses, meaning that they did not count towards the academic credits a student needed to advance to subsequent grades or to graduate. J.A. 349 at \u00b6 14. The instruction in these courses took place in an integrated setting with both special education students and general education students.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">To advance from the ninth grade to the tenth grade in the Mount Vernon City School District, a student needed six credits. Although J.C. passed all of her ninth grade courses, including her AIS courses, during her 2008-2009 school year, J.C. earned only four-and-a-half credits, reflecting the fact that her Math AIS and English AIS courses were non-credit-bearing courses. The following school year (2009-2010), J.C. transferred to Nellie A. Thornton High School, which is also part of the Mount Vernon City School District. When J.C.\u2019s parent B.C. received J.C.\u2019s class schedule at the beginning of the school year, she was \u201cvery much ... surprise[d]\u201d to discover that the schedule noted that J.C. was enrolled in ninth grade because she had not earned sufficient credits during the 2008-2009 school year to be promoted to the tenth grade.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. 135. J.C,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>meanwhile, was uncertain what grade she was in, \u201cbecause one of [her] papers would say ninth grade-.and other papers would say tenth.\u201d J.A. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">At the start of the 2009-2010 school year, J.C. was enrolled in \u201cEnglish 10 AIS\u201d and \u201cMath AIS 10,\u201d among other courses. J.C.\u2019s mother, however, insisted that J.C. be removed from the AIS courses and \u201cplaced immediately into additional credit bearing classes ... to ensure that [J.C.]- would amass enough credits that school year to qualify for the Eleventh Grade\u201d the following year. J.A. 413. In August 2010, B.C.\u2019s- counsel sent a formal complaint to Defendant Roberto Reyes, an official at the NYSED. Reyes agreed to conduct an investigation into B.C.\u2019s complaints about the District\u2019s AIS policy, promising to respond by October 15, 2010. According to B.C., however, no investigation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">By the start of the 2010-2011 school year, J.C. had accrued sufficient credits to be classified as being in the eleventh grade. But in-March 2011, J.C. left Nellie A. Thornton High School and transferred to The Karafin School, which is not within the Mount Vernon City School District. J.C. completed eleventh grade and twelfth grade at The Karafin School, graduating from The Karafin School in the spring of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">T.H., daughter of Plaintiff-Appellant T.H., was classified as a child with a disability under the IDEA. Pursuant to that Act, T.H. had an IEP that set out certain guidelines for her public school instruction and specified when T.H. should receive special education. During the 2008-2009 school year, T.H; enrolled in the ninth grade at Nellie A. Thornton High School, which is part of the Mount Vernon City School District. Her schedule, like J.C.\u2019s, consisted of seven classes, two of which were Math AIS 9 and English 9 AIS. As with J.C.\u2019s AIS courses, T.H.\u2019s AIS courses were noncredit-bearing courses, and they took place \u201cin an integrated environment with undifferentiated instruction.\u201d J.A. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Although T.H. passed all of her ninth grade courses during the 2008-2009 school year, including her AIS courses, T.H. did not earn sufficient academic credits to \"be promoted to the tenth grade because her AIS courses were non credit-bearing courses. J.A. 39. Despite the fact that, based on credits earned, T.H. should have been classified as in the ninth grade, the school enrolled T.H. in the tenth grade for the 2009-2010 school year. T.H. continued receiving English AIS courses during the 2009-2010 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">By the 2010-2011 school year, T.H. had earned sufficient credits to be classified as a tenth grader but not as an eleventh grader. T.H. did not take any AIS courses during the 2010-2011 school year. By the 2011-2012 school year, T.H. had earned sufficient credits to be classified as a twelfth grader. T.H. did not take any AIS courses during the 2011-2012 school year. In the spring of 2012, T.H. graduated from Nellie A. Thornton High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">On July 14, 2011, B.C. and T.H., individually and on behalf of their daughters, filed suit. Plaintiffs asserted various claims against the District Defendants and the NYSED Defendants under the ADA, Section 504, the IDEA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. As pertinent here, the Plaintiffs alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that the District Defendants violated the ADA and Section 504, and, in so doing, Section 1988, because the District\u2019s policy of scheduling AIS courses during school hours disparately impacted students with disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u25a0On January 16, 2014, the District Defendants moved for summary judgment. In a decision signed on August 27, 2014 and entered on August 28, 2014, the district court (Briccetti, <em>J.) </em>granted District Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>B.C. v. Mount Vernon City Sch. Dist., </em>No. 11 CV 1411 VB, 2014 WL 4468082, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2014). As to Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA and Section 504 claims, the court stated that the IDEA exhaustion requirement applied because Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were related to the provision of special education to J.C. and T.H. under the IDEA. <em>Id. </em>at *5-*6. The court concluded, however, that Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA and Section 504 claims were excused from the IDEA exhaustion requirement, as these claims challenged a \u201cdistrict-wide policy of discrimination,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Cave v. E. Meadow Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>514 F.3d 240, 250 (2d Cir. 2008)), and exhausting administrative remedies with respect to the District\u2019s \u201cframework and procedures\u201d would have been futile, <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>J.S. ex rel. N.S. v. Attica Cent. Schs., </em>386 F.3d 107, 114 (2d Cir. 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On the merits, the court rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the District\u2019s policy of scheduling AIS courses during school hours, rather than outside of school hours, disparately impacted' children with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA and Section 504. <em>See id. </em>at *6-*9. In support of their disparate impact claim of discrimination, Plaintiffs had offered evidence showing that the District\u2019s AIS policy affected children with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the IDEA at a higher percentage than it affected children without such disability. <em>Id. </em>at *7. This evidence, the court reasoned, at most showed that the District\u2019s AIS policy, disparately impacted children with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the IDEA. <em>Id. </em>at *7-*8. It did not, however, show that the District\u2019s AIS policy disparately impacted individuals with a \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA and Section 504, since the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d is different under the IDEA than under the ADA and Section 504. <em>Id. </em>at *8. The court therefore deemed the evidence insufficient to support a prima facie claim of disparate impact discrimination under the ADA and Section 504. <em>Id. </em>at *9. Because Plaintiffs failed to state a prima facie claim of discrimination under the ADA and Section 504, the court also granted summary judgment to the District Defendants on Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1983 claims, to the extent that such claims were based on alleged violations of the ADA and Section 504. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Discussion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">This Court \u201creview[s] <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Mullins v. City of New York, </em>653 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn moving for summary judgment against a party who will bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial, the movant may ... point[ ] t\u00f3 an absence of evidence to support an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Gummo v. Village of Depew, </em>75 F.3d 98, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>107 (2d Cir. 1996). We \u201cconstru[e] the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\u201d in reviewing the district court\u2019s determination to grant the motion, which is proper only when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Silverman v. Teamsters Local 210 Affiliated Health &amp; Ins. Fund, </em>761 F.3d 277, 284 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 66(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The ADA and Section 604 both protect \u201cqualified individuals] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a712132 (ADA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) (Section 504). Under the ADA; \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Likewise, under Section 504, \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). \u201cBecause the standards adopted by the two statutes are nearly identical, we consider the merits of these claims together.\u201d <em>McElwee v. Cnty. of Orange, </em>700 F.3d 635, 640 (2d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under either the ADA or Section 504, a plaintiff must show the following: (1) plaintiff is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability;\u201d (2) plaintiff was \u201cexcluded from participation in a public entity\u2019s services, programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by [the] public entity;\u201d and (3) \u201csuch exclusion or discrimination was due to [plaintiffs] disability.\u201d <em>Fulton v. Goord, </em>591 F.3d 37, 43 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting <em>Har-grave v. Vt., </em>340 F.3d 27, 34-35 (2d Cir. 2003)). Exclusion or discrimination may take the form of disparate treatment, disparate impact, or failure to make a reasonable accommodation. <em>Id. </em>To establish a prima facie case under a disparate impact theory, plaintiff must demonstrate \u201c(1) the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant\u2019s facially neutral acts or practices.\u201d Tsom<em>banidis v. W. Haven Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>352 F.3d 565, 574-75 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis omitted). Thus, \u201cplaintiffs are ordinarily required to include statistical evidence to show disparity in outcome between groups.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. This can be done by offering evidence showing that a neutral policy adversely affects a much greater percentage of people with a disability than it affects people without a disability. <em>See id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Here, plaintiffs seek to establish their prima facie disparate impact claim by comparing (1) the percentage rate at which high school students classified as having a \u201cdisability\u201d under the IDEA receive AIS courses to (2) the percentage rate at which high school students not classified as having such a disability receive AIS courses. During the 2008-2009 school year in the Mount Vernon City School District, high school students who were classified as having a \u201cdisability\u201d under the IDEA (i.e., special education students) took AIS courses at a rate that was almost three times the rate at-which high school students not classified as having a disability received AIS instruction. Approximately 23.02% of high school students receiving special education support took AIS classes, as compared to 8.62% of the rest of the student body. During the 2009-2010 school year in the Mount Vernon City School District, high school students receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>special education support were enrolled in AIS courses at a rate that was more than one-and-a-half times the rate at which the general high school student body received AIS instruction. In that year, approximately 20.37% of the special education high school students took AIS courses, as opposed to the 12.56% of the general high school population enrolled in these classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Plaintiffs do not rely upon and have not placed into the record any particularized evidence to show that individual students included in their data who are classified as having a \u201cdisability\u201d pursuant to the IDEA also satisfy the ADA and Section 504 \u201cdisability\u201d definitions. Nor have they identified any generalized evidence tending to establish this point. Plaintiffs\u2019 statistical evidence, therefore, shows disparate impact under the ADA and Section 504 only if, as a matter of law, a child with a disability under the IDEA necessarily qualifies as an individual with a disability under the ADA and Section 504, such that Plaintiffs\u2019 data on children with a disability under the IDEA suffice as data on individuals with a disability under the ADA and Section 504. We conclude that this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We begin with the statutory text. The ADA and Section 504 define the term \u201cdisability\u201d differently than the IDEA does. The ADA defines \u201cdisability\u201d as a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1)(A). Section 504 expressly incorporates, with certain qualifications not applicable here, the ADA\u2019s definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(B). By contrast; under the IDEA, a \u201cchild with a disability\u201d has one or more of an enumerated list of impairments requiring \u201cspecial education or related services.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">These are distinct legal standards. Although both define \u201cdisability\u201d by reference to the effects of an individual\u2019s impairment, the statutes provide for different inquiries. The ADA asks whether an impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d a major life activity, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1)(A), while the IDEA trains on whether an impairment necessitates \u201cspecial education and related services.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(3)(A). Thus, a child might \u201cneed[ ] special education and related services\u201d by reason of an impairment, <em>id. </em>even if that impairment does not \u201csubstantially limit[ ] ... [a] major life activity],\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the Tenth Circuit concluded, \u201cone may ... qualify as \u2018disabled\u2019 under the IDEA for purposes of that statute without demonstrating a \u2018substantially limiting]\u2019 impairment.\u201d <em>Ellenberg v. N.M. Military Inst., </em>572 F.3d 815, 821 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Although many, if not most, IDEA-eligible individuals may \u201calso [be] handicapped under [the ADA],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 823, we agree with the Tenth Circuit that Plaintiffs\u2019 approach reads the ADA\u2019s substantial limitation requirement, which we have consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tently enforced, out of that statute, <em>cf. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, </em>534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001) (\u201cIt is our duty \u2018to give effect, if- possible, to every clause and word of a statute\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955))). Mindful that \u201c[n]ot every impairment that affects an individual\u2019s major life activities -is a <em>substantially </em>limiting impairment,\u201d <em>Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., </em>140 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Knapp v. Nw. Univ., 101 F.3d </em>473, 481 (7th Cir. 1996)), \u201cin assessing whether a plaintiff has a disability, [we] have been careful to distinguish impairments which merely <em>affect </em>major life activities from those that <em>substantially limit </em>those activities,\u201d <em>Ryan v. Grae &amp; Rybicki, P.C., </em>135 F.3d 867, 870 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201cAlthough almost every impairment may, of course, in some way affect a major life activity, the ADA clearly does not consider every impaired person to be disabled.\u201d). A plaintiff seeking redress under the ADA must \u201cshow that any limitations are in fact substantial, not amounting to only a mere difference in conditions, manner, or duration.\u201d <em>Bartlett v. N. Y. State Bd. of Law Exam\u2019rs, </em>226 F.3d 69, 80 (2d Cir. 1998) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We have taken care to distinguish between \u201csubstantially overlap[ping]\u201d definitions in a similar context. <em>Ellenberg, </em>572 F.3d at 822. In <em>Rodriguez v. Village Green Realty, Inc., </em>the plaintiff, whose child had a \u201cdisability\u201d within the meaning of the IDEA, alleged discrimination under the Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d). 788 F.3d 31, 44 (2d Cir. 2015). The FHA prohibits discrimination on the basis of \u201chandicap,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f), defined as \u201ca physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more .,. major life activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3602(h)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we concluded that evidence pertaining to, <em>inter alia, </em>the' \u201cnature of [the child\u2019s] specific [special education] services\u201d created a triable question of fact as to whether the plaintiff had a disability under the FHA, we stated that \u201cthe receipt of special education services is not, by itself, determinative as to whether a child -qualifies as disabled [under the FHA].\u201d 788 F.3d at 44. We reasoned that \u201c[a] child receiving services under the IDEA \u2018need not be substantially limited in the major life activity of learning,\u2019 so \u2018one may therefore qualify as disabled under the IDEA for purposes of that statute without demonstrating a substantially limiting- -impairment,\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ellenberg, </em>572 F.3d at 821). <em>Rodriguez </em>thus supports our holding that the ADA and IDEA set forth distinct legal standards in their definitions of \u201cdisability,\u201d such that an individual will not qualify for the ADA\u2019s protections simply by virtue of his or her disabled status under the IDEA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>This reading is consistent with the statutory schemes at issue. The ADA- and IDEA, while both providing relief for persons with disabilities, serve distinct ambitions in different ways.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ADA sweeps broadly, seeking to curb discrimination \u201cagainst disabled individuals in major areas of public life,\u201d such as employment, public services, public accommodations, and education, <em>PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, </em>532 U.S. 661, 675, 121 S.Ct. 1879, 149 L.Ed.2d 904 (2001); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101, while the IDEA trains more narrowly on public education to ensure the provision of special education benefits to qualifying individuals, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400. Disability is defined generically in the ADA, 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 12102(1), with the sub-stantiality requirement then serving to focus the statute on the class of persons Congress aimed to protect \u2014 those who, by virtue of their disability, may experience discrimination impairing their \u201cright to fully participate in all aspects of society,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12101(a)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The IDEA, for its part, focuses on ensuring that special education and related services are provided to persons who might benefit by virtue of a mental or physical impairment. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400. The IDEA asks only whether a child \u201cneeds\u201d special education and related services because of a particular impairment. <em>Id, </em>\u00a7 1401(3)(A)(ii). This straightforward test thus advances the ameliorative statutory aim of \u201c[ijmproving educational results for children with disabilities,\u201d regardless of how acute those disabilities might be. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1400(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">For these reasons, an IDEA disability is not equivalent to a disability as cognizable under the ADA and Section 504. Plaintiffs, therefore, cannot rely solely on \u201creceipt of special education\u201d to establish an ADA or Section 504 disability. <em>Ellenberg, </em>572 F.3d at 819. Those seeking relief pursuant to ADA or Section 504 must come forward with \u201cadditional evidence\u201d \u2014 beyond simply their eligibility for IDEA coverage \u2014 showing their eligibility for the remedies, afforded by the ADA and Section 504. <em>Rodriguez, </em>788 F.3d at 45. Under a statistics-based disparate impact theory, this means that a plaintiff may not rely solely on statistics concerning individuals \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the IDEA to establish a prima facie claim under the ADA or Section 504.</p>\n<p id=\"pAT1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact claim relies exclusively on data concerning students with disabilities under the IDEA. Aside from their receipt of special education services, the record is devoid of any evidence as to whether the students included in the data qualify as disabled under the ADA or Section 504. Because, as a matter of law, an IDEA disability does not necessarily constitute a disability under the ADA or Section 504, Plaintiffs\u2019 data do not establish \u201ca significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant\u2019s facially neutral acts or practices.\u201d <em>Tsombanidis, </em>352 F.3d at 575. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to make their prima facie showing that District Defendants\u2019 AIS policy adversely impacted individuals protected by the ADA and Section 504. Because Plaintiffs \u201cfail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [their] case, and on which [they] will bear the burden of proof at trial,\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of District Defendants as to Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA and Section 504 claims. Likewise, because Plaintiffs failed to make their prima facie showing under the ADA and Section 504, the district court properly entered summary judgment on their derivative Section 1983 claim against the District Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">For the foregoing reasons and for the reasons stated in the accompanying summary order, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\">.
