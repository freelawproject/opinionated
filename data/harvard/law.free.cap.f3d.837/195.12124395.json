(\u201cAIG\u201d). Like many disputes over finite settlements, this case concerns who gets a \u201cslice\u201d of the settlement \u201cpie.\u201d Appellants American International Group, Inc. Incentive Savings Plan (the \u201cAIG ISP\u201d), American General Agents\u2019 and Managers\u2019 Thrift Plan (the \u201cThrift Plan\u201d), American International Group, Inc. Retirement Plan (the \u201cRetirement Plan\u201d), and AIG Insurance Company \u2014 Puerto Rico Capital Growth plan (the \u201cCapital Growth Plan\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cPlans\u201d) are employee benefit plans sponsored by AIG or its affiliates under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq. In this case, we consider whether the Plans' are \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG for the purposes of a class action settlement agreement. The district court below held that Appellants were \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG and thus ineligible for their own slice of the settlement pie. We disagree. Because ERISA imposes important statutory limits on an employer\u2019s control over the management and policies of an employee benefit plan, those plans do not fall within the ordinary meaning of \u201caffiliate.\u201d Thus, Appellants are entitled to their own slice of the settlement pie and Appellees will have to live with a somewhat smaller portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of the Plans\u2019 motion to direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq7\">A. The Settlement Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">Lead Plaintiffs reached several agreements with both AIG and Pricewaterhou-seCoopers (\u201cPwC\u201d) to settle certain class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws. Appellees resolved the class actions by way of four separate settlements: (1) the AIG Settlement; (2) the PwC Settlement; (3) the Gen Re Settlement; and (4) the Starr Settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreements\u201d). The four settlements are substantially similar and all define the \u201cSettlement Class\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxU\">[The Settlement Class includes] all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired <em>AIG Securities </em>during the period of time from October 28, 1999, through April 1, 2005, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), as well as all persons and entities who held the common stock of HSB Group, Inc. (\u201cHSB\u201d) at the time HSB was acquired by AIG in a stock for stock transaction, and all persons and entities who held the common stock of American General Corporation (\u201cAGC\u201d) at the time AGC was acquired by AIG in a stock for stock transaction, and were damaged thereby (the \u201cSettle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ment Class\u201d). Excluded from the Settlement Class are (i) the Defendants, as named in the Consolidated Third Amended Class Action Complaint, dated December 15, 2006 (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) in this Action; (ii) the immediate families of the Individual Defendants, as named in the Complaint; <em>(Hi) any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, officer, or director of AIG\u2019, </em>(iv) persons who made requests for exclusion from the Settlement Class in the manner and within the time period provided by Section IV of the Agreement and/or by order of the Court and did not thereafter rescind such requests, such excluded persons being listed on Exhibit A hereto; (v) any entity in which any excluded person has a controlling interest; and (vi) the 'legal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of any excluded person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Special App\u2019x at 6 (emphasis added); <em>see also, e.g., </em>App\u2019x at 1034-35. Both Appellants and Appellees agree that the term \u201caffiliate\u201d is not defined in the Settlement Agreements. <em>See </em>Special App\u2019x at 7. \u201cAIG Securities\u201d is defined in the agreement as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5qA\">any and all <em>publicly-traded </em>securities issued by American International Group, Inc., whether debt or equity securities, including, without limitation, AIG common stock, the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures referenced in paragraph 189 of the Complaint, the 0.5% Cash Exchangeable Equity-Linked Senior Notes referenced in paragraph 193 of the Complaint, the 2.85% Medium-Term Notes, Series F referenced in paragraph 203 of the Complaint, the 2.875% Notes 144A securities referenced in paragraph 212 of the Complaint that were exchanged into registered like coupon bonds and the 4.25% Notes 144A securities referenced in paragraph 217 of the Complaint that were exchanged into registered like coupon bonds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">App\u2019x at 2546 (emphasis added). Accordingly, to be a member of the Settlement Class, an investor, among other things, must have purchased <em>publicly-traded </em>AIG Securities and <em>must not be </em>an \u201caffiliate\u201d of AIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Claims were to be administered by Rust Consulting, Inc. (\u201cRust\u201d). Rust\u2019s principal responsibility was to calculate the recognized loss for each claim based on the claimant\u2019s acquisition of AIG securities during the class period (the \u201cRecognized Loss\u201d) and to distribute corresponding settlement funds, all according to formulas provided in the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">After holding separate final approval hearings, the district court approved each of the settlements. On February 3, 2012, the District Court entered the Order and Final Judgment granting final approval to the AIG Settlement, which provided for the payment of $725 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">B. The Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The Plans are of two different types. The Retirement Plan is a defined benefit plan, under which AIG guarantees each participating employee a set annual benefit upon retirement. AIG sets aside a pool of assets, including its own stock, to fund those benefits, and it assumes responsibility for providing additional funding if the pool proves- inadequate for any reason\u2014 including market losses.- The remainder of the Plans are defined contribution plans (the \u201cDefined Contribution Plans\u201d), under which AIG guarantees a set payment into participating employees\u2019 accounts each year before retirement. Participants may choose to invest those payments in the market through several funds that hold securities on the employees\u2019 behalf, including one fund that holds AIG common stock. If employees make such' investments, however, they \u2014 and not AIG \u2014 take the risk of market losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The parties have identified two distinct methods of tabulating how much AIG common stock the Defined Contribution Plans acquired during the class period: the \u201cplan level\u201d and the \u201cparticipant level.\u201d Claims submitted at the plan level list the total number of AIG shares that the Defined Contribution Plans purchased on behalf of all participating individuals. Claims submitted at the participant level, in contrast, list the total number of AIG shares that participating employees elected to acquire by investing money in their accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Claims made at the plan and participant levels can diverge significantly. When an employee elects to acquire a share of AIG stock through' one of the Defined Contribution Plans, the plan will not necessarily purchase a share on the open market; it may instead transfer a share previously held on behalf of a different employee who has since elected to sell it, thereby avoiding certain transaction costs. In this way, the number of AIG shares that the Defined Contribution Plans purchased on the open market during the class period- (the plan level calculation), could be lower than the number of shares participating employees elected to acquire (the participant level calculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">By contrast, there is only one way:to tabulate how much AIG common stock the Retirement Fund, which is a defined benefit plan, purchased during the class period: the plan level. The Retirement Fund invests in AIG stock, among other securities, in the hope of earning income sufficient, to pay its set obligations to participating employees. The fund never purchases AIG stock on behalf of particular employees, which renders a participant-level claim in-apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">C. Claims Administration</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">1. PWC Settlement Submissions</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">As institutional investors in AIG common stock during the. class period, the Plans submitted claims for a share of the PwC settlement. On January 23, 2009, Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company (\u201cVanguard\u201d) submitted claims on behalf of the AIG Stock Fund \u2014 Master Trust, Fund #1837 (the \u201cMaster Trust\u201d) for, among other plans, the AIG ISP, the Capital Growth Plan, and the Thrift Plan. The claim was submitted at the plan-level. Rust estimated the Recognized Loss for these plans as approximately $25.6 million with respect to the PwC Settlement and $25.7 million with respect to the AIG settlement. On March 18, 2009, State Street Bank and Trust' Company submitted an omnibus claim in the PwC Settlement that included the Retirement Plan, also at the plan-level. Rust estimated the Recognized Loss for the Retirement Plan as approximately $12.8 million with respect to the. PwC Settlement and approximately $17.4 million with respect to the AIG Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On January 20, 2012, Mercer Trust Company (\u201cMercer\u201d),, which succeeded Vanguard as the Plans\u2019 trustee, submitted a claim form with a cover letter on behalf of AIG ISP and the Thrift Plan, along with several other employee benefit plans that merged into the AIG ISP during the class period, stating that \u201c[t]he account transactional detail associated with this claim will be provided under separate cover and should be considered as an addenda to one or more previous submissions submitted by [Vanguard]\u201d and that Mercer could not itself certify the accuracy or completeness of the data provided in the prior submissions by Vanguard. App\u2019x at 2956.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Three days -later, on January 23, 2012, Banco Popular of Puerto Rico (\u201cBanco Popular\u201d), submitted' a claim on behalf of the Capital Growth Plan, also with a cover letter stating the transactional information was not available and would be provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>under separate cover. According to Appel-lees, this additional information was not submitted to Rust until the end of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Appellants emphasize that at no point during \u201cthe next four-plus y\u00e9ars, did Rust ever suggest to the Plans\u2019 fiduciaries that the Plans were ineligible to participate in the Settlement -Classes because they were \u2018affiliates\u2019 of AIG.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 14; <em>see also </em>App\u2019x at 2541,</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">2. AIG Settlement Submissions</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The Plans retained Appellant Evercore Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cEvercore\u201d) as their independent fiduciary to assess whether they should participate in the AIG Settlement. On December 14, 2012, Evercore submitted a letter- to Rust with transactional data provided by . AIG in support of the prior claims filed by Mercer and Banco Popular. But unlike the. transaction data originally provided .by Vanguard in 2009 in the PwC Settlement, the transaction data provided in 2012 by AIG \u201cwas not plan-level data but was participant-level data.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 11; <em>see also </em>App\u2019x at 2957. Appellants claim that the proof of claim form approved by the Court for the AIG Settlement invited submissions that provided supplemental data not submitted in connection with the PwC Settlement. For this reason, Appellants claim that more detailed participant-level data was appropriate, <em>ie. </em>data accounting for the estimated losses by all of the participants of the Defined Contribution Plans, based upon their transactions involving AIG Stock rather than plan-level data which merely accounted for the purchases and sales of AIG Stock by the Plans on the open market. Evercore requested that Rust \u201cissue the appropriate \u2018Distribution Amounts\u2019 in a lump sum to Mercer and Banco Popular respectively\u201d and that \u201cMercer and Banco Popular w[ould] then allocate payments to the appropriate participant amounts.\u201d App\u2019x at 2957. Appel-lees claim this \u201cconversion\u201d from plan-level claims to participant-level claims, \u201cwould have resulted in a substantially higher Recognized Loss.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">But on January 11, 2013, Rust proposed accepting the participant-level, data on behalf of the Defined Contribution Plans and using that data for the PwC Settlement as well. Appellants explain that the Plans did not object to Rust\u2019s decision to apply participant-level data-\u201cbecause the use of participant-level data shows -the actual, individualized losses allegedly incurred by the Defined Contribution Plans\u2019 participants\u2014 just like all other AIG shareholders.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 16; <em>see also </em>App\u2019x at 2996.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">On February 22, 2013, approximately four years after the AIG ISP, the Capital Growth -Plan, and -the Thrift Plan submitted their claims for the PwC Settlement, Rust issued \u201cNotices of Ineligibility,\u201d all virtually identical, stating that the Plans\u2019 claims were ineligible under both the PwC Settlement and the AIG Settlement. Rust based its decisions on its review of the participant-level and plan-level data, the securities involved, and a consideration of the opinions in <em>In re Motorola Securities Litigation, </em>644 F.3d 511 (7th Cir. 2011) <em>(\u201cMotorola\u201d) </em>and <em>In re Marsh &amp; McClennan Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>No. 04-CV-8144 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 2011) <em>(\u201cMarsh\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Rust identified two independent grounds for ineligibility. First, it stated that each of the claims \u201csubmitted appeared] to be on behalf of an \u2018affiliate\u2019 of defendant AIG,\u201d which was impermissible under the Settlement Agreements. App\u2019x at 2618, 2620, 2622, 2624, 2626, 2628. Although the Notices of Ineligibility did not elaborate on this assertion, it seems clear that Rust classified the Plans as affiliates because they were sponsored, under ERISA, by AIG or its affiliates. Both <em>Motorola </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Marsh </em>had previously reached similar conclusions in analogous cases. <em>See Motorola, </em>644 F.3d at 521 (holding that a defendant corporation\u2019s 401(k) plan was excluded from the class definition as an \u201caffiliate\u201d); <em>Marsh </em>at 2-3, App\u2019x at 2633-34 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Second, Rust stated that claims submitted at the participant level on behalf of the Defined Contribution Plans would be ineligible because they failed to identify any purchases of publicly traded AIG Securities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Rust\u2019s view, although participating employees initially elected to acquire AIG stock under these plans, it was the plans themselves that actually purchased the stock in publicly traded form.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On March 19, 2013, Appellants\u2019 counsel sent a letter to Rust explaining why <em>Motorola </em>and <em>Marsh </em>\u201cdid not and should not control the Plans\u2019 status as members of the respective settlement classes,\u201d and argued the Plans are not \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG, and thus requested that Rust reverse its decision as to the Plans\u2019 eligibility. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 17. Appellants .state that to this day, Rust has not responded to this letter. Appellants claim that in lieu of responding to their request, Rust asked Appellants to provide: \u201c(1) information regarding whether \u2018trust level\u2019 transactions were made on the \u2018open market\u2019 or were direct purchases from AIG; (2) the amount of each type of transaction; and (3) broker confirmations for all purchases and sales during the class period.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 18; <em>see also </em>App\u2019x at 2659.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">On May 29, 2013, the Lead Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Approval of an Initial Distribution of Settlement Proceeds in Connection with the Settlements with PwC and AIG in the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Batts, J.). <em>See </em>App\u2019x at 1889-1937. Appellants timely filed a Motion to Direct in the same court requesting that the district court direct Rust to approve the Plans\u2019 claims and distribute proceeds from the Settlements to the Plans. Appellees opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The district court issued a Memorandum and Order, denying the Appellants\u2019 Motion to Direct and approving the initial distribution of the PwC and AIG Settlements. <em>See </em>Special App\u2019x at 1-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">The Plans and Evercore then filed a motion to Intervene for Limited Purpose of Possible Appeal (\u201cMotion to Intervene\u201d), which Lead Plaintiffs opposed. The District Court entered an order denying the Motion to Intervene, finding it untimely. In the court\u2019s view, the Plans should have moved to intervene \u201cat least as early as the filing of the Third Amended Complaint.\u201d App\u2019x at 3146; Special App\u2019x at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Appellants timely filed notices of appeal from both the order on the Motion to Direct and the order on the Motion to Intervene. Appellants did not appeal the district court\u2019s orders authorizing the initial distribution of the settlements. Rust issued the initial distribution payments on November 18, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">We \u201cmust address any jurisdictional standing question first, before deciding a case on the merits.\u201d <em>Friends of Gateway v. Slater, </em>257 F.3d 74, 77-78 (2d Cir. 2001). Appellees contest Appellants\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to bring this appeal on two grounds: (1) the non-appealability provision of the Settlement Agreements expressly bars appeals beyond the level of the district court; and (2) because the district court held Appellants are not members of the Settlement Class, they are non-parties that cannot bring an appeal. Appellants argue they are not bound by the non-appealability provision and that they are entitled to appeal despite their status as non-parties. In the alternative, Appellants urge us to reverse the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the non-appealability provision does not bar Appellants\u2019 appeal and that they may appeal the denial of the motion to direct as non-parties. Because we determine that Appellants may maintain this appeal without suqcessfully intervening below, we dismiss as moot their appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion.to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The Settlement Agreements included a non-appealability provision barring appeals from the district' court of \u201cdis-put\u00e9is] concerning a claim.\u201d App\u2019x at 847. The provision, in relevant part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">The validity of each Proof of Claim filed shall initially be determined by the Administrator in accordance with the Plan of Allocation approved by the Court. The Administrator shall promptly advise the claimant in writing if the Administrator determines to reject the claim\u2014 <em>If a dispute concerning a claim cannot be otherwise resolved, Lead Counsel shall thereafter present the request for review to the [District] Court for summary resolution, without any right of appeal or review.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">App\u2019x at 847 (AIG Settlement Agreement) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>App\u2019x at. 2556-57 (PwC Settlement Agreement). It is not uncommon for parties to include in a settlement agreement an \u201cexplicit agreement that the district court decision shall be final and that all rights of appeal are waived.\u201d 15A Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3901 (2d ed. 2014). But we conclude that this provision does not bar Appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">As an initial matter, Appellees urge us to endorse a kind of Catch-22 theory of appellate jurisdiction. Appellees argue that the Plans are <em>not </em>members of the Settlement Class because they are \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG. You would think, then, that Appellees would agree that the Plans are not bound by the Settlement Agreements, which were entered into between the Lead Plaintiffs, \u201con behalf of the <em>Settlement Class,\u201d </em>and AIG. App\u2019x at 829 (emphasis added). Not so. Instead, even as they maintain that the Plans are not members of the Settlement Class, Appellees argue that the Plans are nonetheless bound by the Settlement Agreements\u2019 non-appealability provision. We decline Appellees\u2019 request to permit them to have their pie and eat it too.</p>\n<p id=\"pA4r\">At oral argument, Appellees suggested that the Plans are bound by the non-appealability provision because they are \u201cclaimants.\u201d But nothing in the Settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>ment Agreements suggests that mere \u201cclaimants\u201d are bound by the agreements. It is a \u201cprinciple of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment ... in litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.\u201d <em>Hansberry v. Lee, </em>311 U.S. 32, 40, 61 S.Ct. 115, 86 L.Ed. 22 (1940). Because the Plans have not yet been held to be \u201cmembers of the Settlement Class\u201d they cannot be \u201cbound by any orders or judgments entered in respect to the settlement.\u201d <em>Casey v. Citibank, N.A., </em>No. 5:12-CV-820, at *5, 2014 WL 4120599 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">As a general rule, only parties to a lawsuit, whether from the .outset ,or through intervention, may appeal an adverse judgment. <em>Marino v.

And we \u201chave not required that a nonparty <em>prove </em>that it has an interest affected by the judgment;\u201d rather, \u201cstating a plausible affected interest has been sufficient.\u201d <em>WorldCom, </em>467 F.3d at 78 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u201cThe question therefore is whether [Appellants] can identify an \u2018affected interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kaplan v. Rand, </em>192 F.3d 60, 67 (2d Cir. 1999). Appellees argue that permitting Appellants\u2019 appeal would grant \u201cstanding\u201d to \u201cvirtually any third-party that filed' a notice of appeal.\u201d Appellees Br. at 20. We disagree. We believe there are several reasons Appellants should be \u201cconsidered a \u2018party\u2019 for the purpos[e] of appealing\u201d the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to direct. <em>Devlin, </em>536 U.S. at 7, 122 S.Ct. 2005. First, the Plans had bona fide reasons to believe they were members of the Settlement Class. Second, the Plans reasonably relied on claims submitted to Rust and were given no indication that they may have been ineligible. Third, and most important, the Pl\u00e1ns have a concrete and particularized interest clearly affected by the judgment of the district court: the exclusion of the Plans from the Settlement Class deprives the Plans, their participants, and their beneficiaries-of their recognized loss of either $81.5 million or $200.6 million, depending on whether it is calculated at the plan- or participant-level.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">At this time, we need not decide whether <em>any </em>nonparty putative class member would be able to- appeal a denial of a motion to direct, without first successfully intervening. We \u201cemphasize that our [holding] is heavily based on the unique ... posture.of this case,\u201d <em>In re Lawrence, </em>293 F.3d 615, 625 (2d Cir. 2002), which demonstrates that the Plans clearly have a sufficient \u201cinterest that is affected by the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Pertamina, </em>313 F.3d at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Because we find that Appellants may appeal the denial of the motion to direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>regardless of whether they successfully intervened, we dismiss as moot their appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to intervene. Nonetheless,, although \u201c[t]he timeliness requirement\u201d of intervention \u201cis flexible and the decision is one entrusted to the district' judge\u2019s sound discretion, <em>United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., </em>801 F.2d 593, 594-95 (2d Cir. 1986), we think it important to address the possible troubling consequences of the district court\u2019s holding that the Plans should have'moved to intervene \u201cat least as early as the filing of the Third Amended Complaint.\u201d App\u2019x at 3146; Special App\u2019x at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">At the complaint stage, it is unlikely the Plans would have known of their interest in the district court litigation. <em>See Catanzano by Catanzano v. Wing, </em>103 F.3d 223, 232 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201cAmong the most important factors in a timeliness decision is the length of time the applicant knew or should have known of its interest before making the motion.\u201d). The district court\u2019s suggestion that the Plans should have intervened at such an early stage could unduly encourage other putative nonnamed class member's in future class actions to needlessly intervene, frustrating the purposes and goals of class action litigation. Fearful that the district court would find their motions to intervene untimely, virtually \u201call class members would be forced to intervene to preserve their claims, and one of the major goals of class action litigation \u2014 to simplify litigation involving a large number of class members with similar claims \u2014 would be defeated.\u201d <em>Devlin, </em>536 U.S. at 10, 122 S.Ct. 2005. Unnecessary intervention by - any putative class member with the <em>slightest </em>doubt that they might be excluded from the settlement class would only increase the \u201cextraordinary amount of judicial and private resources ... [of] massive class action litigation.\u201d <em>Austin v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>876 F.Supp. 1437, 1455 (E.D. Pa. 1995). Thus, we caution the district courts to be mindful when dismissing similar motions to intervene on timeliness grounds \u00a1lest the courts invite needless litigation into their courtrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">As a question of law, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Settlement Agreements de novo. <em>Cirino v. City of N.Y. (In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster Site Litig.), </em>754 F.3d 114, 121 (2d Cir. 2014). The district court denied the motion to direct on the ground that the Plans are excluded from the, Settlement Class as \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG. In reaching this conclusion, however, the district court did not consider the statutory limitations imposed on a sponsor\u2019s control over an employee benefit plan under ERISA. Because those limitations are substantial, the Plans cannot be considered \u201caffiliates\u201d under any ordinary or specialized understanding of that term, and certainly not when viewed in the context of the Settlement Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Like consent decrees, settlement agreements are \u201chybrid[s] in the sense that they are at once both contracts and orders; they are construed largely as contracts, but are enforced as orders.\u201d <em>Berger v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 1556, 1567-68 (2d Cir. 1985) (citation omitted). As contracts, we interpret them in accordance with general principles of contract law. <em>See Collins v. Harrison-Bode, </em>303 F.3d 429, 433 (2d Cir. 2002). \u201cWhen interpreting a contract, the intention of the parties should control, and the best evidence of intent is the contract itself.\u201d <em>Cont'l Ins. Co. v. Atl. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>603 F.3d 169, 180 (2d Cir. 2010) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, if their terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>are unambiguous, we must interpret the Settlement Agreements \u201cwithin [their] four corners, and not by reference to what might satisfy the purposes of one of the parties to [them].\u201d <em>Berger, </em>771 F.2d at 1568 (quoting <em>United States v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>402 U.S. 673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971) (discussing consent decrees)); <em>see also Seabury Constr. Corp. v. Jeffrey Chain Corp., </em>289 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201cWhere the contract is unambiguous, courts must effectuate its plain language.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Settlement Agreements exclude from the settlement class \u201cany parent, subsidiary, <em>affiliate, </em>officer, or director of AIG.\u201d App\u2019x at 1035 (emphasis added). The parties agree that the term \u201caffiliate\u201d is not defined in the Settlement Agreements. Like the district court, we begin by consulting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>which defines an affiliate, in the context of securities, as \u201c[o]ne who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an issuer of a security.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Affiliate, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(10th ed. 2014). Thus, whether the Plans are \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG turns on whether they are controlled by, or are under common control with, AIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We note that we would reach the same conclusion if we looked to the definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d in the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SEC Rule 144 defines an \u201caffiliate\u201d of an issuer of securities as \u201ca person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.144(a)(1). And Rule 12b-2 of SEC Regulation 12B defines an \u201caffiliate\u201d as a \u201cperson' that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 240.12b-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u201cControl,\u201d in turn, is defined by <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>as the \u201cdirect or indirect power to govern the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise; the power or authority to manage, direct, or oversee.\u201d <em>Control, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(10th ed. 2014). This definition of \u201ccontrol\u201d is virtually identical to the definition of control \u201cprovided in regulations promulgated under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.\u201d <em>Waldman v. Riedinger, </em>423 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 2005). SEC Rule 405 of Regulation C defines \u201ccontrol\u201d as \u201cthe possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.\u201d <em>SEC v. Kern, </em>425 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.405); <em>see also </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.12b-2 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Accordingly, whether the Plans are \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG turns on whether AIG possesses the \u201cdirect or indirect ... power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies\u201d of the Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The district court concluded that AIG possessed the power to \u201cdirect or cause the direction of the management and policies\u201d of the Plans, relying on several indicia of \u201ccontrol:\u201d (1) \u201c[t]he plans are each sponsored by either AIG itself or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>company subsidiary[;]\u201d (2) \u201cthe AIG Retirement Board, the Plans\u2019 administrator, was not only appointed by AIG,- but its members were all AIG employees, including officers and directors of the company[;]\u201d and (B) \u201cthe company could disband the plans without reason.\u201d Special App\u2019x at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied, in part, on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision addressing an almost identical fact pattern concerning a securities settlement with Motorola. <em>See In re Motorola Sec. Litig., </em>644 F.3d 511 (7th Cir. 2011) <em>(\u201cMotorola\u201d). </em>The Seventh Circuit applied a similar definition of \u201caffiliate:\u201d \u201cone who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an issuer of a security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513. The <em>Motorola </em>panel noted that Motorola \u201cappointed] the Plan\u2019s administrator \u2014 the Motorola 401(k) Profit-Sharing Committee \u2014 and the members of this Committee serve[d] at the pleasure of Motorola\u2019s Board of Directors\u201d and concluded that this kind of \u201c \u2018structural organizational control\u2019 [was] sufficient to make the Plan an affiliate of Motorola.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The panel reasoned that \u201c[a]s the Plan Administrator, the Committee had general operational and administrative authority over the management of the Plan[,] [a]nd since \u2018control\u2019 includes the power to direct the management of an entity, we conclude that the Profit-Sharing Committee controlled the Plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520 (citations omitted). ...</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We are, of course, not bound by a decision by a sister circuit, but we do not disagree with one lightly. Nonetheless, the <em>Motorola </em>panel, and the district court here, did not consider the role of ERISA in shaping the contours and limits on an employer\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u201d over a sponsored plan. This inattention was understandable, inasmuch as the parties in that case failed to raise ERISA as an issue. <em>See generally In re Motorola Secs., Inc., </em>No. 09-1750, 2009 WL 1557636 (7th Cir. May 14, 2009) (Brief of Intervenor-Appellant Motorola, Inc. 401(k) Profit-Sharing Plan). But even if <em>Motorola </em>can be read to go so far as to say all ERISA plans are all \u201caffiliates\u201d of their sponsors, we decline to follow it. Doing so would require us to ignore Congress\u2019s specific statutory limitations on an employer\u2019s control over a sponsored plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u25a0 ERISA is structured to \u201cinsulate the trust from the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., </em>453 U.S. 322, 333, 101 S.Ct. 2789, 69 L.Ed.2d 672 (1981). The Department of Labor, the \u201cagency charged with administering and enforcing Title I of ERISA,\u201d <em>Faber v. Metro Life Ins. Co., </em>648 F.3d 98, 105 (2d Cir. 2011), has made clear that \u201c[m]any of the provisions of ERISA are grounded on the concept that an employee benefit plan <em>must be independent of the employer that sponsors the plan.\u201d Grindstajfv. Green, </em>No. 96-5628, 1996 WL 34386660 (6th Cir. Oct. 29, 1996) (Brief of Amicus Curiae, Robert B. Reich, Secretary of the United States Department of Labor) (emphasis added). For example, the plan\u2019s assets must be maintained in a trust, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a), and \u201cshall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(1);</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Thus, although the plans \u201care each sponsored by either AIG itself or a company subsidiary,\u201d Special App\u2019x at 10, this is too slender a reed upon which to predicate a finding of control. ERISA is a \u201ccomprehensive and reticulated statute [for which] Congress made detailed findings which recited, in part, \u2018that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>sion Benefit Guar.

Accordingly, ERISA is designed to delicately balance Congress\u2019s clear \u201cattempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock,\u201d <em>Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2459, 2468, 189 L.Ed.2d 457 (2014); <em>see also Gray v. Citigroup, Inc. (In re Citigroup ERISA Litig)., </em>662 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir. 2011) (noting Congress\u2019s \u201cgoal of encouraging employee ownership of the company\u2019s stock\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Fifth Third Bancorp, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2465, with a recognition that the interests of the employer and the interests of the plans may not be aligned. <em>Pegram v. Herdich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 255, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000). In fact, ERISA <em>presumes </em>that the interests of the employer and the employer-sponsored plans are <em>adverse. See is.; see also Liss v. Smith, </em>991 F.Supp. 278, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (\u201cEmployers are parties-in-interest [whose] interests are adverse to those .of the plan.\" (citation omitted)); <em>Gruby v. Brady, </em>838 F.Supp. 820, 833 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (\u201cClearly, Fund employers are parties with interests adverse to those of plan Members. Indeed, the employers\u2019 interests lie in minimizing their obligations to the Fund, whereas the Fund\u2019s interest is in collecting all contributions owed.\u201d). To the extent sponsorship of an ERISA plan says anything about an employer\u2019s control over that plan, it is that any such control is specifically circumscribed to ensure the plan is managed \u201csolely in the interest of the [plan\u2019s] participants and beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1). This is unlike your garden variety parent-affiliate relationship. For example, ordinarily, an affiliate\u2019s directors and officers can be removed \u201cwith or without cause, by the holders of a majority- of the shax-es,\u201d including when the individual acts contrary to the. interests of the parent. <em>See, e.g., </em>Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 141(k). This kind of control is simply impermissible under ERISA. <em>See, e.g., Bennett v. Mfrs. &amp; Traders, </em>No. 599-CV-827 HGM/GHL, 2005 WL 2896962, at *8 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2005) (\u201cBy selecting and appointing the Plans\u2019 trustees in her own interest ... Bennett failed to act solely in the interest of the Plans\u2019 participants and beneficiaries in violation of ERI'SA....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In light of ERISA\u2019s requirements, AIG\u2019s ability to appoint and remove members of the Plans\u2019 Retirement Board does not yield control over the' \u201cmanagement and policies\u201d of the Plans. If Board members had discretion to favor AIG to varying degrees in their management of the Plans, then AIG might be able to exert control both by appointing people particularly aligned with its interests and by using the threat of removal to ensure that such alignment persisted. But Board members have no such discretion. Appointees to the Retirement Board serve as fiduciaries to the Plans, their participants, and their beneficiaries, and ERISA subjects its fiduciaries to what have been called the <em>\u201chighest duties known to law.\u201d </em>Jayne Zanglein, et al., ERISA Litigation 1261 (5th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Plan fiduciaries must act \u201csolely in the interest of the [plan\u2019s] participants and beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C- \u00a7 1104(a)(1). \u201cThis statutory duty of loyalty has been described by this Court as requiring that a fiduciary act, in Judge Friendly\u2019s felicitous phrase, with an \u2018eye single to the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Salovaara, </em>326 F.3d 130, 136 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Donovan V. Bierwirth, </em>680 F.2d 263, 271 (2d Cir. 1982)). Although AIG may select who serves as a member of the Retirement Board, it may not use that power to shape the Plans\u2019 management and policies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>This conclusion holds even where AIG appoints its own officers and directors as members of the Retirement Board. ERISA \u201cimposes a duty on the [fiduciaries] to avoid placing themselves in a position where their acts as officers or directors of the corporation will prevent their functioning with the <em>complete loyalty to participants </em>demanded of them as\u201d fiduciaries of a plan. <em>Donovan, </em>680 F.2d at 271 (emphasis added). ERISA expressly contemplates scenarios where a sponsor might appoint its own officers and directors to a plan\u2019s board. But these officers and directors, who are permitted to \u201cwear different hats,\u201d must nonetheless \u201cwear <em>only one at a time, </em>and wear the fiduciary hat when making fiduciary decisions.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 225, 120 S.Ct. 2143 (emphasis added). \u201c[T]o prevent any possible injury to the beneficiary, the rule against a trustee dividing his loyalties must be enforced with \u2018uncompromising rigidity.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., </em>453 U.S. 322, 329-30, 101 S.Ct. 2789, 69 L.Ed.2d 672 (1981) (quoting <em>Meinhard v. Salmon, </em>249 N.Y. 458, 464, 164 N.E. 545 (1928) (Cardozo, J.)). \u201cA fiduciary cannot contend \u2018that, although he had conflicting interests, he served his masters equally well or that his primary loyalty was not weakened by the pull of his secondary one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Woods v. City Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Tr. Co., </em>312 U.S. 262, 269, 61 5.Ct. 493, 85 L.Ed. 820 (1941)). Thus, although Appellees note that AIG Retirement Board members Axel Freudmann and Kathleen Shannon, defendants in the ERISA Action, \u201cwere also executive officers of AIG during the Class period in the Action,\u201d Appellees\u2019 Br. at 34 (citing App\u2019x at 2887-88), that says nothing about whether AIG possesses the \u201cdirect or indirect ... power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies\u201d of the Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">For similar reasons, AIG\u2019s authority to \u201cdisband the Plans without reason,\u201d Special App\u2019x at 10, does not imply authority to direct management or policy decisions. Again, if the Board had discretion to favor AIG in its management of the Plans, AIG might be able to compel favorable treatment by threatening to disband the Plans if the Board did not cooperate. But ERISA\u2019s imposition of strict fiduciary duties blocks such corporate influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">In adopting the rationale of the <em>Motorola </em>decision, which had also been adopted by at least one district court in this Circuit, the district court failed to consider Congress\u2019s clear directive to encourage participation in plans providing employee ownership, of employer stock while ensuring that such plans are not managed in the interests of the sponsor, and in so doing erred. When examined, through the intricate prism of ERISA\u2019s statutory goals and requirements, AIG\u2019s sponsorship of the plans, its appointment and removal power, and its discretionary disbanding power are all insufficient to demonstrate it possesses the power to direct the management and policies of the Plans. Thus, we conclude the district court erred in determining that the Plans are \u201caffiliates\u201d of AIG.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Although we are confident our conclusion is dictated by the text of the Settlement Agreement, we observe that a contrary result could not reflect the purpose of the exclusion of \u201caffiliates\u201d from the settlement class. We have recognized elsewhere that ordinarily the purpose of a settlement agreement\u2019s exclusion of \u201caffiliates\u201d is to \u201censure that those who perpetrated, or otherwise profited from, the alleged [wrong] would not benefit from the settlement.\u201d <em>Waldman v. Riedinger, </em>423 F.3d 145, 153 (2d Cir. 2005). In Waldman, we considered whether a trustee was an \u201caffiliate\u201d of a corporation and determined he was not \u201cbecause he neither controlled nor was controlled by any of the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. We also noted that \u201c[r]ather than profiting from the alleged fraud, as an affiliate might have done, [the trustee] was <em>victimized </em>by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153(emphasis added). \u201cFor this reason, ... we c[ould not] conclude that he was an affiliate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is the case here; there is no dispute that the participants and beneficiaries of the Plans are not those that perpetrated the alleged securities violations that gave rise to this class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Nor would a distribution of settlement proceeds to the Plans inure to the benefit of AIG. The most that can be said is that a settlement recovery by the Retirement Plan, which is a defined benefit pension plan rather than a defined contribution plan, could reduce AIG\u2019s contribution obligation. But AIG would still lack any direct or indirect control over any assets recovered by the Retirement Plan under the settlement. <em>See, e.g., </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1106, 1002(14)(C) (prohibiting financial transactions between a plan and \u201can employer any of whose employees are covered by such plan\u201d). And AIG would also lack control over any investment decisions concerning any recovered assets for the defined contribution plans, as those decisions must be made solely by the participants themselves. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(c)(1)(A). In short, AIG would enjoy no added benefit if the Plans are included in the Settlement Class.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Our conclusion also makes sense by viewing the word \u201caffiliate\u201d in the full context of the exclusion provision. The term \u201caffiliate\u201d directly follows the terms \u201cparent\u201d and \u201csubsidiary,\u201d and directly precedes the terms \u201cofficer\u201d and \u201cdirector.\u201d These specific terms have precise and commonly understood definitions in corporate law. <em>See, e.g., </em>Del Code Ann., tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 141-46 (discussing the roles of officers and directors); Del. Code Ann., tit. 8, \u00a7 220 (defining subsidiary as \u201cany entity directly or indirectly owned, in whole or in part, <em>by the corporation of which the stockholder is a stockholder and over the affairs of which the corporation directly or indirectly exercises control, and includes, without limitation, </em>corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, statutory trusts and/or joint ventures\u201d (emphasis added)). The exclusion of \u201cparents,\u201d \u201csubsidiaries,\u201d \u201cofficers,\u201d and \u201cdirectors\u201d of AIG from the settlement class evinces an intent to exclude individuals who may have perpetrated or benefited from the alleged underlying securities violations. And because we often interpret a word \u201cby the company it keeps (the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis),\u201d </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201caffiliate\u201d to include the Plans \u201cascribe[s] [to it] ... a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words.\u201d <em>Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., </em>513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995); <em>see also WPP Luxembourg Gamma Three Sarl v. Spot Runner Inc., </em>655 F.3d 1039, 1051 &amp; n.3 (9th Cir. 2011) (applying the noscitur a sociis canon to the interpretation of a contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Consider, for example, two different employees who both work in the mailroom at AIG. One employee participated in one of the Plans; the other, chose not to do so, but purchased AIG common stock on the open market during the class period. Neither employee had any role in the alleged securities violations underlying this class action. Following the district court\u2019s logic, despite being nearly identical plaintiffs suffering the same injury, the first employee would be excluded from the settlement class whereas the latter would be included. And although the employee participating in the Plans has a secondary recourse by bringing an action under ERISA, that separate statutory right does- not deprive him or her of the protections of the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, the district court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201caffiliate\u201d would also strain drafters of settlement agreements in future securities class actions. Were the district court\u2019s interpretation to stand, we would expect plan fiduciaries to make an effort to ensure their plan is not excluded from a securities class action. Drafters could be forced into the uncomfortable position of writing language that would <em>exclude </em>\u201caffiliates,\u201d but <em>include </em>employer-sponsored plans. No doubt many dollars would be spent, and many hours would pass, as courts needlessly faced even more complicated interpretive thickets than the one we have before us today. It is better to avoid this altogether and interpret the term \u201caffiliate\u201d in the context of the exclusion provision: to exclude entities that could conceivably profit despite their own possible participation in the alleged securities violations. But if drafters <em>do </em>want to exclude employer-sponsored plans, they can simply say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Appellants urge us to also find that Rust erred by denying the Plans\u2019 claims on the basis that \u201cthe claim was submitted on a \u2018participant-level\u2019 and [] because it appears the participants did not directly purchase and sell \u2018AIG Securities[.]\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 49. As noted above, the number of AIG shares that the Defined Contribution Plans purchased on the open market during the class period (the plan level calculation) could, in theory, be lower than the number of shares participating employees elected to acquire (the participant level calculation), perhaps yielding a lower Recognized Loss under the Settlement Agreements. That appears in fact to be the case: According to Rust, the Plans\u2019 combined Recognized Loss would be $200.6 million if calculated at the participant-level (where possible) but only $81.5 million if calculated at the plan-level. Declaration of Eric Shacter, September 30, 2013, at \u00b6 24, App\u2019x at 2958. Appellants assert that \u201c[b]y refusing to accept participant-level claims from the Defined Contribution Plans, Rust has acted to reduce the Defined Contribution Plans\u2019 potential re-cov\u00e9ry by treating them differently from all other AIG shareholders, thereby artificially inflating the potential recovery for the other class members, including the Appellees, who are the lead plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Because the district court did not reach this question, we remand'so that the court may consider it in the first instance. <em>See Pinnacle Nursing Home v. Axelrod, </em>928 F.2d 1306, 1317 (2d Cir. 1991) (\u201cIt is a general rale that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS the appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to intervene as moot, and the district court\u2019s order denying the Plans\u2019 motion to direct is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. Rust also stated that the Retirement Plan\u2019s claim had improperly been submitted at the participant level.

Rather, what is truly at issue, is \"whether [the Plans] should be considered \u2018[parties]\u2019 for the purposes of appealing\u201d the denial of the motion to direct. <em>Devlin, </em>536 U.S. at 7, 122 S.Ct. 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">. We believe this definition of affiliate is instructive here because the dispute and Settlement Agreements relate to an underlying securities class action.

We merely note that courts could consider the DOL\u2019s views as to ERISA\u2019s impact on the degree of control exerted by a plan sponsor on an employee benefit plan. In this instance, our ruling that the district court erred in determining that the Plans are \"affiliates\u201d of AIG is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u2022with the DOL's belief that ERISA plan participants should not be disadvantaged when compared to other shareholders when settling securities litigations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
