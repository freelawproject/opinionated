To that end, OSHA in 1992 issued the so-called Process Safety Management Standard to protect the safety of those who work with or near highly hazardous chemicals. From its inception, the standard has exempted retail facilities from its requirements. The exemption rests on an assumption that the retail setting involves diminished risks of a substantial release of toxic chemicals. Recently, after a,catastrophic chemical explosion at a Texas fertilizer company that qualified as an exempt retail facility, OSHA narrowed the scope of the retail-facility exemption so that the safety standard\u2019s requirements would now apply to formerly exempt facilities like the Texas plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The question we confront is whether, when OSHA narrowed the scope of the exemption for retail facilities, the agency issued a safety \u201cstandard\u201d within the meaning of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act). If so, we have jurisdiction to review OSHA\u2019s action, and the OSH Act would have required the agency to adhere to procedural notice-and-comment requirements, which it concededly did not do. If, however, OSHA\u2019s action did not amount to issuance of a \u201cstandard,\u201d we would lack jurisdiction to review it and the OSH Act would have imposed, no obligation to follow notice-and-comment procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Under our decisions, when an action by OSHA corrects a particular hazard, as opposed to adjusting procedures for detection or enforcement, it amounts to a \u201cstandard.\u201d Applying that understanding, we conclude that the agency\u2019s narrowing of the substantive scope of the exemption for retail facilities qualified as' issuance of a \u201cstandard.\u201d We therefore have jurisdiction, and OSHA was required to adhere to notice-and-comment procedures. Consequently, we grant the petitions for review and vacate OSHA\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">In 1992, OSHA promulgated the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in an effort to \u201cprovide safe and healthful employment and places of employment for employees in industries which have processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.\u201d Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; Explosives and Blasting Agents, 57 Fed. Reg. 6356, 6359 (Feb. 24, 1992), <em>codified at </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a71910.119 (2016). The PSM Standard \u201ccontains requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.119.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">From the outset, OSHA exempted \u201c[r]e-tail facilities\u201d from the requirements of the PSM Standard. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1910.119(a)(2)(i). The exemption, OSHA explained in the preamble of the final standard,, was rooted in an understanding that \u201cchemicals in retail facilities are in small volume packages, containers and allotments, making a large release [of toxic chemicals] unlikely.\u201d 57 Fed. Reg. at 6369. OSHA identified \u201cgasoline stations\u201d as prototypical examples of retail facilities. <em>Id. </em>Shortly after promulgating the PSM Standard, OSHA issued a letter defining an exempt retail facility as \u201can establishment ... at which more than half of the income is obtained from direct sales to end users.\u201d <em>See </em>Letter from Patricia K. Clark, Dir. of Enf't Programs, OSHA, to Gary Myers, President, The Fertilizer Inst. (June 19,1992). The \u201c50 percent test\u201d remained the rule for more than two decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>In April 2013, a catastrophic chemical explosion at a fertilizer company in West, Texas, resulted in the deaths of 15 persons and injured many others. Although the company stored large quantities of a highly hazardous chemical (anhydrous ammonia) for bulk distribution as fertilizer to farmers, it had been exempt from\u2019 the PSM Standard under the 50 percent test for retail facilities. That test had enabled establishments to claim the exemption even if they stored large amounts of hazardous chemicals for distribution in wholesale quantities to commercial end users (including farmers), as long as the distributions went directly to the end users.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">After the explosion at the West, Texas, fertilizer facility, President Obama issued an executive order that, among other things, directed the Secretary of Labor to \u201cidentify any changes that need to be made in the retail ... exemption[ ] in the PSM Standard\u201d so as to \u201cmeet the goal of preventing major chemical accidents.\u201d Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security, 78 Fed. Reg. 48029, 48032 (Aug. 1, 2013). OSHA responded in 2015-by issuing the Memorandum at issue in this case. OSHA, Memorandum on Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and Application of the Retail Exemption (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.119(a)(2)(i)), July 22, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Memorandum \u201crescind[ed] all prior policy documents, letters of interpretation, and memoranda related to the retail exemption and the 50 percent test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>OSHA explained that the \u201c50 percent test allows employers who sell or distribute large, bulk quantities of highly hazardous chemicals directly to end consumers to claim the exemption, even if the end users are themselves commercial establishments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That result was \u201cdirectly contrary to OSHA\u2019s original intent,\u201d i.e., \u201cto exclude retail facilities from PSM coverage because the small container, package, or allotment sizes of the chemicals typically found at these facilities do not present the same safety hazards as establishments that handle large, bulk quantities of materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Concluding that the retail exemption \u201cshould never have been interpreted to cover facilities engaged in distinctly wholesale activities,\u201d OSHA announced that retail facilities would instead be defined by a Department of Commerce manual classifying types of businesses. <em>Id. </em>Under that definition, retail facilities must be \u201corganized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because farm supply \u25a0 establishments like the West, Texas, facility sell chemieal fertilizers in bulk to farmers, they fall outside the revised definition of retail facilities. <em>Id. </em>Under the new definition, those facilities thus would become subject to the PSM Standard\u2019s requirements for managing highly hazardous chemicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The Agricultural Retailers Association, the Fertilizer Institute, and a number of individual businesses brought petitions for review in this court to challenge OSHA\u2019s narrowed definition of retail facilities. According to petitioners, the OSH Act required the agency to adhere to notice- and-comment procedures in promulgating its new definition. We agree with petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The OSH Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor, through OSHA, to promulgate \u201coccupational safety [and] health standard[s].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b). The Act provides for pre-enforcement review in the courts of appeals of any such \u201cstandard\u201d issued by OSHA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 655(f). The Act also authorizes the promulgation of \u201cregulation[s]\u201d (and other rules falling short of \u201cstandards\u201d), which are governed by a different means of judicial review: challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>to regulations are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which calls for initial review in federal district court rather than in a court of appeals. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 657(c)(1); see <em>also Edison Elec. Inst. v. OSHA, </em>411 F.3d 272, 277 (D.C. Cir. 2005); <em>Workplace Health &amp; Safety Council v. Reich, </em>56 F.3d 1465, 1467 (D.C. Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The OSH Act provides for distinct treatment of \u201cstandards\u201d in another pertinent respect as well. When promulgating or modifying a \u201cstandard,\u201d OSHA must adhere to notice-and-comment procedures set forth in the OSH Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b). OSHA concedes that, when it promulgated its Memorandum redefining \u201cretail facility,\u201d it did not satisfy the procedural requirements for standards. The agency instead argues that the Memorandum did not issue or modify a standard. In the agency\u2019s view, the Memorandum only interpreted an existing standard, and it therefore was subject neither to the procedural requirements set out in the OSH Act, <em>id. </em>nor to direct review in this court under that Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 655(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The existence of jurisdiction in this court, as well as the applicability of the OSH \u25a0 Act\u2019s notice-and-comment procedures,- both turn on the same question: whether OSHA\u2019s Memorandum amounted to issuance (or modification) of an \u201coccupational safety and health standard,\u201d The OSH Act defines an \u201coccupational safety and health standard\u201d as \u201ca standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 652(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Our decisions construing that definition have established a framework for differentiating between OSHA standards and regulations. A standard within the meaning of that definition is \u201ca remedial measure addressed to a specific and already identified hazard, not a purely administrative effort designed to uncover violations of the Act and discover unknown dangers.\u201d <em>Workplace Health &amp; Safety Council, </em>56 F.3d at 1468 (quoting <em>La. Chem. Ass\u2019n v. Bingham, </em>657 F.2d 777, 782 (5th Cir. 1981)). Standards, that is, are designed for \u201ccorrection rather than mere inquiry into possible hazards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They focus on \u201ccorrecting] a particular significant risk,\u201d not on \u201cgeneral enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">In <em>Workplace Health &amp; Safety Council, </em>we applied that understanding to find that a rule requiring employers to report workplace deaths and hospitalizations was a regulation rather than a standard. 56 F.3d at 1468. The \u201cbasic function of the rule [was] administrative,\u201d in that it principally served to enable \u201ccollecting] information about unknown hazards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We distinguished \u201cinformation-gathering\u201d measures of that kind from the \u201ccorrection of a particular significant risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">When we later applied the same framework in <em>Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. U.S. Department of Labor, </em>174 F.3d 206 (D.C. Cir. 1999), we reached the opposite outcome with regard to the OSHA rule at issue in that case. We determined that a compliance program subjecting businesses to extra inspections if they did not-engage in specified safety measures amounted to a standard rather than a regulation. That program aimed at \u201ccorrecting, rather than merely uncovering,\u201d workplace safety hazards. <em>Id. </em>at 210. It therefore could not \u201cbe described as merely an enforcement or detection procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and internal quotation marks omitted). Whereas the rule held to be a regulation in <em>Workplace Health &amp; Safety Council </em>was \u201cprocedural,\u201d the \u201cba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>sic function of the rule\u201d in <em>Chamber of Commerce </em>was \u201csubstantive,\u201d in that it \u201cimpose[d] upon -employers new,\u201d and \u201cmore demanding,\u201d \u201csafety standards\u201d than those in existence beforehand. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Under the principles set forth in those decisions, we conclude that OSHA\u2019s new definition of a retail facility, like the compliance program in <em>Chamber of Commerce, </em>amounts to a standard. The \u201cbasic function\u201d of OSHA\u2019s new definition is to address a' \u201cparticular significant risk,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 209: the risk associated with storing large quantities of highly hazardous chemicals for distribution' to end users in bulk quantities, as had been the case at the West, Texas, fertilizer company. OSHA\u2019s Memorandum aims not just to gather data about that risk or otherwise serve a general detection or enforcement function, but instead to correct the risk by subjecting facilities such as farm supply companies to the preventative measures in the PSM Standard. OSHA estimates that its revised definition would subject up to 4,800 facilities to \u201cnew,\u201d and necessarily \u201cmore demanding,\u201d substantive standards for the management of highly hazardous chemicals. <em>Id. </em>at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Of course, the Memorandum itself does not require new preventative measures of its own accord; it does so in conjunction with the PSM Standard. But we do not look at the Memorandum in strict isolation. We consider the Memorandum\u2019s \u201cpractical effect,\u201d not \u201cits formal characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209. And the essential effect and object of the Memorandum is to expand the substantive reach of the PSM Standard by narrowing an exemption from that standard. As OSHA describes the measure, it aims to eliminate \u201cpolicy and regulatory gaps\u201d so as to help \u201cprevent incidents like the West Fertilizer explosion.\u201d OSHA, Questions and Answers\u2014 PSM Retail Exemption Policy, July 22, 2015. By redefining retail facilities, the Memorandum, in purpose and effect, subjects a substantial number of businesses previously classified as exempt retail facilities to additional safety standards in order to address a \u201cparticular significant risk.\u201d Given those specific circumstances, the measure, under our decisions, qualifies as a standard within the meaning of the OSH Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">OSHA argues that the Memorandum cannot be a standard because it would constitute an interpretive rule under the APA. But nothing in the OSH Act or APA establishes that the standard/non-standard distinction under the OSH Act must directly track the legislative/interpretive rule distinction under the APA. The OSH Act and the APA prescribe different procedural requirements, and those requirements do not necessarily apply to the same subset of rules. \u2018 Unlike some other statutes, the OSH Act does not adopt the \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d ' terminology, b\u00fct instead uses a vocabulary distinct from the APA\u2019s. <em>Compare </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655, <em>with </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh(c) (using the term \u201cinterpretive rules\u201d in the Medicare Act). And petitioners\u2019 principal submission is that they are entitled to relief under the OSH Act\u2019s governing standards, a result that, in their view, renders the APA irrelevant. Petitioners\u2019 Reply Br. at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">We thus need not decide whether the rule at issue here would constitute an interpretive rule for purposes of the APA. Because the Memorandum amounts to a standard within the meaning of the OSH Act, we have jurisdiction to review it and to vacate it for failure to comply with the procedural requirements established by that Act. Of course, nothing in our decision necessarily calls into question the substance of OSHA\u2019s decision to narrow the exemption for retail facilities and corre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>spondingly to expand the scope of the PSM Standard. We hold only that, insofar as OSHA does so, it must follow the notice-and-comment procedures for standards set forth in the OSH Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Finally, we consider the motion of the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (the Union) to intervene in support of OSHA. Mot. to Intervene Out of Time Filed on Behalf of [the Union], Nov. 5, 2015. We deny the motion because the Union has failed to establish its standing to intervene. The Union submitted a declaration saying that certain Union members \u201cmay\u201d be affected by OSHA\u2019s action insofar as there are members whose employers previously fit within the retail facility exemption under the 50 percent rule but would no longer do so under the Memorandum\u2019s revised definition. Decl. of Michael J. Wright \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 (attachment to Br. of Union). But because nothing in the Union\u2019s declaration establishes that the Union <em>does </em>have such members, the Union has failed to demonstrate standing. <em>See Summers v. Earth Island Inst., </em>555 U.S. 488, 498, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 173 L.Ed.2d 1 (2009). Although we deny the Union\u2019s motion to intervene for that reason, we grant the Union\u2019s alternative request to accord it amicus curiae status, and we thus have given full consideration to the Union\u2019s arguments. <em>See Rio Grande Pipeline Co. v. FERC, </em>178 F.3d 533, 539 (D.C. Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petitions for review and vacate OSHA\u2019s Memorandum for failure to abide by the OSH Act\u2019s procedural requirements. We also deny the Union\u2019s motion to intervene but grant it amicus status.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
