Plaintiff took a rule to strike off the marking of the judgment to use, on the ground that the attorney had no authority to take such action.

Plaintiff then took a rule to strike off the satisfaction, which rule, after hearing, was discharged. Plaintiff then petitioned for an issue, but the court dismissed his petition. Plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning as error the discharge of his two rules, and the refusal of an issue, but he did not print in his paper-book the record relating to the first rule. <em>Held, </em>that the record was incomplete, and that the judgment should be <em>affirmed, </em>without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to appeal from the order discharging the first rule.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b536-10\">Argued Jan. 11, 1894.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB7\">Appeal, No. 62, Jan.

W. Ledyard, attorney for plaintiff, marked the judgment to the use of Jacob Singer. On Oct. 1, 1892, plaintiff, alleging that his attorney had no authority to take such action, obtained a rule to strike off the marking of the judgment to use. On March 6, 1893, the court, after hearing on depositions, discharged this rule. On April 3, 1893, Jacob Singer satisfied the judgment of record. On April 25,1893, plaintiff obtained a rule to strike off satisfaction. This rule the court subsequently discharged. Plaintiff then filed a petition for an issue, but the petition was dismissed by the court. Defendant then appealed to the Supreme Court. Appellant did not print in his paper-book the record relating to the rule to strike off the marking of the judgment to use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were the action of the court: (1) in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rule to strike off the marking of the judgment to use of Singer; (2) in not striking off the marking of the judgment to use of Singer, and making plaintiff\u2019s rule absolute; (3) in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rule to strike off satisfaction of judgment entered of record by Singer; (4) in not ordering satisfaction of the judgment entered of record by Singer stricken off, and making plaintiff\u2019s rule absolute; (5) in not striking off satisfaction of judgment' because plaintiff had prior thereto issued a scire facias to revive the judgment; (6) in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rule for an issue; (7) in not awarding an issue to determine whether the judgment was marked to the use of Singer by order and authority of plaintiff, or whether such marking to use was without his authority and consent, as prayed for by plaintiff in his petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-5\"><em>J.

As presented to us, the record is manifestly incomplete, and not in such a shape as to enable us to properly dispose of the question referred to. There is nothing now before us that would justify a reversal of the proceedings complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Proceedings .affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs, but without prejudice to his right to appeal from the order of March 6, 1893, discharging said rule of October 1,1892.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
