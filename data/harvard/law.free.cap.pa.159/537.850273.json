An affidavit of plaintiff averred that rent amounting to over $300 for part of the month of September, and all of the month of October, was unpaid, and that ten days\u2019 notice- had been duly given on Oct. 18,1893, by serving a copy thereof on the premises, 1338 Walnut street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>A writ of hab. fa. poss. was placed in the hands of the sheriff, and subsequently a rule was taken on the sheriff by the plaintiff to show cause why he should not proceed. To this rule he filed a special return setting out that when he went to 1338 Walnut street, the premises in question, he was notified by affidavit of Lydia A. Leisenring, who was not a party to the proceedings, that she claimed to hold possession in her own right. To which return he annexed the answer of Lydia A. Leisenring, the present claimant, wherein she averred that the defendant was not in possession of the premises, nor had he ever been in possession, but resided with his family in the city of New York, and had resided there for more than two years; that before and at the time of the entry of such judgment she had been, and still was, in actual possession of said premises, and had been in possession thereof since October 1,1888, in her own right; that she had not and did not claim to hold the said premises under the said Frank Northrop, or under any one claiming by or under him, but claimed the right of possession was in her and not in the said plaintiffs. He also annexed the answer of W. Gardner Crowell, who alleged he occupied the second story of said premises under a lease from Frank Northrop, the defendant, to which answer a copy of the lease was attached. Also the answers of Maximillion West, M. D., William Duffield Robinson, M. D., and R. G. Barclay, who answered that they were in possession of the first floor of said building under Frank Northrop, and attached the lease for the same. The court made the rule upon the sheriff absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-5\"><em>Dwight M. </em>Lowrey, <em>Arthur U.
