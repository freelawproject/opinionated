The other distributees in the testator\u2019s mind were his nephews and nieces. Had he mentioned them as a class, \u201c nephews and nieces then living one share,\u201d he would undoubtedly have changed the presumption to be drawn up to this point and have indicated a division per stirpes. But as if to avoid this very result he inserts the domi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>nant word \u201c each,\u201d and makes the bequest, \u201c and to each of my nephews and nieces then living one share.\u201d The grammatical meaning of this clause of the sentence does not admit of question. The word \u201ceach\u201d separates the class into individuals and is equivalent to the detailed enumeration, \u201c to A. one share, to B. one share, to C. one share \u201d etc., for which it was a compendious summary. As well said by the learned court below, had the testator, after directing distribution share and share alike to the following persons, then \u201c designated all of the legatees by name there would be no room for doubt that he intended a per capita distribution.\u201d But by-the use of the word \u201c each \u201d he did in effect designate them all individually, as plainly as if he had inserted their several names.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">This being the clear grammatical effect of his words, it must prevail, unless there is apparent elsewhere in the will, a different intent. This we do not find. The appellant seeks to show such intent by showing a difference in the classification of the beneficiaries with reference to the time of distribution, that to the sister and stepdaughter being directed \u201c if they are living at the time of my death,\u201d while that to the nephews and nieces is to those \u201c then living,\u201d which, appellant argues, means living at the time of distribution, after payment of prior legacies, funeral expenses, etc. This construction would hardly afford sufficient evidence of a different intent, on which to set aside the plain meaning of the other words, but in fact it cannot be sustained. The whole distribution in this clause of the will is to be \u201c after paying the above named legacies .and funeral expenses \u201d etc., and it is to be \u201c To the foll\u00f3wing persons if they are living at the time of my death,\u201d namely the sister, the stepdaughter, and the nephews and nieces. They are all classed together to be living at the time of testator\u2019s death, and the additional phrase in regard to \u201c each of my nephews and nieces then living one share,\u201d so far from indicating that they are to take as a class, emphasizes their separate andindividualcharacter by the stipulation that each one who is to take shall be then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The cases cited by appellant do not afford us much light. Precedents in construing the language of wills, except as to technical or quasi technical phrases in the creation of trusts, or the limitation of estates, where they tend- to become rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>property, are of little value. The same words may be used by different testators, and yet in their context or their connection with other parts, they may have widely different meanings. Wills like contracts must be read according to the intent of their makers, and rules of construction are useful only as aids to the ascertainment of the actual meaning. When that is clear, no rule dr method of construction can be permitted to override it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">A few words however may be said in referenc\u00e9 to the cases cited: Minter\u2019s Appeal, 40 Pa. 111, is really in favor of the appellee, for, though a distribution \u201cshare and share alike among the children of A. and the children of M. and to my sister B.\u201d and \u201cThat said B. and the children of my said brothers A. and M. shall have the residue of my estate, share and share alike,\u201d was held to mean a division per stirpes, it was on the ground that the two phrases being somewhat conflicting left the intent in doubt, and therefore weight was given to the rule of the statute of distributions, and the court added significantly for our case,- \u201cIf he meant that his nephews should be each equal to his sisters, the word <em>each </em>would have made his meaning clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 8 Pa. 304, testator directed his estate to be \u201c equally divided between all the heirs,\u201d and the court held this to mean per stirpes, because the testator had in mind the intestate laws for the ascertainment of the persons to take, and it would therefore be presumed that the quantum of each was to be ascertained in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In Young\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 59, a direction that an estate after his wife\u2019s death, \u201c be equally divided between her relations and mine,\u201d and in Osburn\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 637, the remainder \u201c to be equally divided between the heirs of the said Henrietta .... and the said Harry, each to share and share alike,\u201d were held to mean a distribution by classes, upon the ground that such was the testator\u2019s intent, and in reaching that view, weight was given by the court to the use of the word \u201c between \u201d which grammatically suggests two objects only. We do not find anything in any of these cases that changes the view we have taken of the natural and proper meaning of the will under present consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Decree affirmed at costs of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
