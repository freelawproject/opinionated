In October, 1890, a certificate of incorporation in proper form was presented by the Hughes &amp; Gawthrop Co. to the governor, asking for a charter. The certificate was approved and letters ^patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>were duly issued. All of the details required by the act of /April 29, 1874, P. L. 77, were complied with, excepting only \u00a1the recording of the certificate in the recorder\u2019s office of Allegheny county. The certificate was not recorded until June, 1891. In the meantime, plaintiff, without knowledge of the incorporation, made the contract with Gawthrop, upon which he sued. Subsequently he accepted a note for the debt, signed with the corporate name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">Defendants\u2019 points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">\u201c 1. The provisions of section 3 of the act of April 29, 1874, which provides that \u2018 original certificates with all indorsements thereon shall then be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds in and for the county where the chief operations are to be carried on,\u2019 are merely directory, and a failure to so record does not render the charter void or render the subscribers thereto individually liable for debts contracted by the corporation. <em>Answer: </em>The failure to record as stated will not of itself render the stockholders individually liable.\u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">\u201c 2. That from the moment the letters patent were issued by the governor of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the Hughes &amp; Gawthrop Co., the subscribers to the articles of association became a corporation for every practical purpose, and any one dealing with them as a corporation is estopped from impeaching the charter in a collateral proceeding, by showing that a condition precedent to the existence of the corporation has not been complied with.\u201d Affirmed.

If the jury find from the evidence that letters patent were issued to the defendants by the governor of this commonwealth, to act as a corporation under the name of the Hughes &amp; Gawthrop Co., and that they were actually engaged in carrying on business under such letters-patent or charter, and that the contract sued on was made by E. B. Gawthrop, general manager of the Hughes &amp; Gawthrop Co., and that the plaintiff received the promissory note of Hughes &amp; Gawthrop Co., as a corporation, in payment of the amount due on said contract, he cannot now recover from Paul H.

What provisions are material must be gathered from the relation of each to the purpose and scope of the act; and when, therefore, successive steps are prescribed for the creation of corporations these must obviously be regarded as imperative. Enabling statutes, on the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>impliedly prohibit any other mode of doing the act which they authorize; they must be strictly construed: Sutherland on Stat. Construction, \u00a7 454. Hence it has been uniformly held that requirements in respect of filing charters are imperative: Childs v. Smith, 55 Barb. 45; Smith v. Warden, 86 Mo. 382; Abbott v. Smelting Co., 4 Neb. 416; Beach on Corporations, sec. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"A1D\">It is plain even from a cursory reading of the act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 77, that recording of the certificate \u201cin the office for the recording of deeds, in and for the county where the chief operations are to be carried on,\u201d was intended to be made one of the conditions precedent to corporate existence. That was the last of successive steps required to be taken, and the right to begin the transaction of corporate business was made to depend upon the taking of that step. . \u201c From thenceforth,\u201d the act expressly declares, the subscribers and their associates and successors \u201c shall be a corporation for the purposes and upon the terms named in the said charter.\u201d One of the purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>act being exemption from personal liability in tbe transaction of business, it is obviously material that the public should have notice, and notice by record was accordingly prescribed. Failure to record was failure to comply with one of the express conditions of incorporation, and consequently of exemption from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">It may be conceded that had plaintiff dealt with defendants, as a corporation he would have been estopped from claiming 1 against them in any other capacity, even though they failed to record their charter: Spahr v. Bank, 94 Pa. 429. But it is not pretended that he had any knowledge of the existence of the charter; and there was certainly nothing, either in the name under which they did business or in their conduct, which should have put him upon inquiry. In these circumstances he was j amply justified in dealing with them as partners. It was through [ their default \u2014 not his \u2014 that they were so <em>treated; </em>and it would \u00a1 be manifest injustice that he should lose his admittedly honest i claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In the absence of an express agreement the acceptance of a note from the defendants, as a- corporation, after plaintiff had performed his part of the contract, cannot operate by way of election or estoppel. The relation of the parties was fixed by their status when the original contract was made and cannot be changed by gratuitous inference. The members of the alleged corporation were the defendants, and were not injured by the acceptance of the note. The principle which treats the acceptance of a note as additional security to and not as satisfaction of a mechanic\u2019s lien (Jones v. Shawhan, 4 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 257) is, with even more justice, applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">It follows from what has been said that the instructions complained of are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Judgment reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
