The plaintiffs do not admit the contention of the _ defendants and upon argument deny that the children of deceased sisters have any interest in the property. Whether they admit Mrs. Blaney\u2019s interest does not appear. This possibly settles their right, for though the complainants are not bound to set forth the defendants\u2019 title \u2018 they must show their own.\u2019 Bisph. Eq., sec. 489. And \u2018 unless the title is undisputed the bill must be dismissed:\u2019 lb. This would clearly be the result if the dispute arose upon questions of fact, but complainants claim that the question here arises upon the construction of the will of Jesse Sill, and should be decided by the court upon the papers. We may have this right; but ordinarily \u2018 a bill for partition cannot be made the means of trying a disputed title.\u2019 Bisph. Eq. 489. And the bill presents a case where parties are made defendants for the purpose of having it decided that they have no interest in the property of which partition is prayed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">After quoting clauses 6 and 8 of the will, the court continued :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-9\">\u201cItem 8 is as follows: \u2018I direct that the residence I now occupy shall be occupied by the family so long as they may remain together as a family, together with all the furniture owned by me in said house.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c Under this will there was clearly no equitable conversion as claimed by the defendant Smith, because there is no direction to sell. The rents of the property being given to Thomas M. Sill, the title passed to him: \u2018 A grant or devise of profit of land passes the land itself.\u2019 Drusadow v. Wilde, 63 Pa. 170. Upon his death, S. O. Lowry was appointed trustee in his stead. The title is therefore in him. But it is in him for a temporary purpose, to apply the proceeds to the support of the family. When the family ceases to exist it will vest in. the parties who may then become beneficially interested, whether the surviving sisters or the heirs generally need not now be decided. Upon plaintiffs\u2019 contention it is now uncertain. The family still exists. One of them may die or Mrs. Blaney may die before the family is broken up. Upon plaintiffs\u2019 view the property would belong to the survivors. Who the survivor may be cannot now be known. Though partition may be made upon petition of one holding an equitable interest or limited estate, we find no authority for sustaining the action of one having an uncertain interest. The bill must therefore be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-6\"><em>Magnus Pflaum, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ame\">There can be no equitable conversion unless there is a positive and absolute direction that the land shall be sold : Bleight v.

C. Smith, as tenants in common, and was filed by the two surviving sisters of Jesse Sill, deceased, and the trustee appointed under his will. The testator by his will directs as follows, viz.: \u201c That the land in question shall not be sold under any circumstances unless it should become necessary to sell the same to pay debts without the consent of my brother and sisters, and, if it should become necessary to sell the same, the proceeds of the same shall be applied to the support and maintenance of the family so long as they may remain together, and whatever is left after the separation shall be divided share and share alike between my brother and sisters then living,\u201d and also, \u201cthat my brother, Thomas M. Sill, shall collect the rents of my share of the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>estate and apply the proceeds to the support and maintenance of the family.\u201d At the time of the death of the testator the family referred to consisted of the mother and three sisters. The mother and one of the sisters have since died, leaving surviving them the appellants, the Misses Sill, as the family, who still live together in the residence provided for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The scope of this bill is to effect a partition between the heirs of Jesse Sill, deceased, and J. C. Smith. The right to such partition is denied by the latter upon the ground that the will of Jesse Sill made an equitable conversion of the real estate, and by the other appellees upon the ground that as to the land in question the testator died intestate. The testator directs that this land shall not be sold unless it be necessary to do so in order to paj*- debts, but only with the consent of the brother and sisters, and, in case of sale, that the proceeds shall be applied to the maintenance of the family. As there is thus no absolute direction to sell, there is no equitable conversion of the land: Bleight v. Bank, 10 Pa. 131; Stoner v. Zimmerman, 21 Pa. 394 ; Anewelt\u2019s Appeal, 42 Pa. 414; Neely v. Grantham, 58 Pa. 433. But the question of equitable conversion however concerns all the devisees and not a stranger, and therefore the appellee Smith cannot make this an objection to bar the right to partition : Chew v. Nicklin, 45 Pa. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">As to the allegation of intestacy in regard to the land in question made by the other appellees, it may be said that the testator devised by his will his entire estate, and manifestly did not intend that any portion of it should go to nephews or nieces, and therefore as to this land he did not die intestate. But it is said the title here is in dispute, and there is therefore no jurisdiction to decree partition. It is true that a bill for partition cannot be successfully resorted to for the purpose of determining a disputed title. In this case however no attempt of this character is made. The appellee Smith has not made it and the other appellees have not; they at most claim to be the heirs at law with the Misses Sill, and as such to hold as tenants in common with them. As the testator directed the land to be held for the maintenance of the family as long as its members should remain together as a family, an uncertainty as to those who might survive at the time of the happening of such contingency, all parties having been joined in this action, is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>uncertainty such as would defeat partition. The appellants are in possession of this land, and if a doubt as alleged in regard to their title is permitted to operate to defer partition until it is settled by an action at law, the delay would be indefinite and its effect would practically bar partition. Such a doubt, if existing, may however be determined in these proceedings for partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In the case of the Old Men\u2019s Home et al. v. Penna. Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, 17 W. N. 171, decided by the court of common pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia Co., Judge Mitchell, delivering the opinion of that court, in regard to the question of determining a doubt as to title said: \u201c In the case now in hand there are some peculiar difficulties. The mode of determining the title at law is by ejectment. But neither of these parties is in possession more than the other. Upon which, therefore, shall be cast the burden of admitting itself out of possession and recovering upon the strength of its own title in a case which must at all times be open to some doubt.\u201d The doubt was resolved and partition decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">With the two sisters as plaintiffs is joined the trustee who under the will was appointed to collect the rents and to apply them to the maintenance and support of the family. The will does not make him a technical trustee, but an authorized agent, only to receive and collect the .rents so long as the family shall remain together, and apply the same to its maintenance. He had no power to sell and no title was vested in him, but, even if it was, it would not operate as a bar to partition. Hayes\u2019s Appeal, 123 Pa. 132. The bill sufficiently avers title in the heirs of Jesse Sill, deceased, in one half of the land for its severance from the half owned by appellee Smith. Such partition can be made and the one half thus held, or the proceeds of the same, in case a sale should be necessary, can be decreed to be held aggregately as in Phelps v. Green, 3 John. Ch. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">It is therefore ordered that the decree dismissing the bill be reversed at cost of appellees, and that the bill be restored and partition decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
