This well proved a dry one, and defendant abandoned the enterprise of sinking any wells upon about one thousand acres of land which it had under lease in the immediate neighborhood. Subsequently, however, defendant sunk a number of wells about two miles distant from the abandoned territory. Plaintiff claimed to recover damages for the loss of profits arising from the refusal of defendant to allow him to sink these wells.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-7\">Tomlinson testified on the trial: \u201c Q. What did Mr. Hartman say to you when he returned to you the paper ? A. Why, he told me to give it to John G. McConnell and have John make out the contract. Q. Told you to give it to McConnell and for him to make out a contract ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did he say anything to you about having Sparks agree to it ? A. Why, Mr. Sparks had agreed to it; he had signed it at that time. Q. What else did he say to you about the commencement of the well ? A. He said he was in a great hurry for them to start up, and he would like to have them go that day, and Mr. Sparks said he couldn\u2019t go until the next morning. Q. What did he say about waiting for the contract, if anything? A. He said that could be done any time by Mr. McConnell. Q. Said it could be done any time? A. Yes, sir. Q. And that he should go ahead and drill the well ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you tell Mr. Sparks, or give this message to Mr. Sparks ? A. I did so; yes, sir. Q. What did Mr. Sparks say ? A. He said he would start the next day. Q. Did he start the next day? A. So I am informed. Q. Who put this indorsement upon the contract? A. Mr. Hartman. Q. You say this indorsement was written by Mr. Hartman? A. Yes, sir. Q. And when he gave you this paper he told you to have Mr. McConnell draw up a contract accordingly ? A. Yes, sir. Q. And to have Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Sparks go to work immediately and drill a well? A. Yes, sir. Q. And not to wait for the contract? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\">Plaintiff testified: \u201c Q. When this proposition was returned to you by Mr. Tomlinson what did he say with reference to the drawing of a contract ? A. He said to leave it at Mr. McConnell\u2019s office and get the contract drawn up. Q. What did he say about beginning work? A. He told me that Mr. Hartman said that he wanted me to go up there at once, and not wait on the contract, that I could get it any time afterwards. Q. When did you begin work ? A. Why, I went up the next day after I signed that proposition and handed it in to Mr. McConnell to form the contract. I went up a day or so after that and seen Mr. Hartman, and he told me where to locate the well, and I got it drawn off on a piece of paper, and got it located, and came back down and took my men up and shipped my tools up, and got started as quick as I could. . . . Q. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Hartman afterwards about the contract? A. Yes, sir; I seen Mr. Hartman at Ellwood once about it. Q. What did you say to him about it ? A. He asked me if I had got it drawn up yet, and I told him that I had seen Mr. McConnell, and that he hadn\u2019t got it drawn yet, but said he would in a few days. Q. What did Mr. Hartman say to that ? A. He told me he wanted me to get it drawn up. Q. Was there anything further said by Mr. Hartman at any other time about the contract? A. I don\u2019t remember anything more at that time. Q. Did Mr. Hartman ever bring a contract to you and ask you to sign it? A. He took me into his private office one time at Ellwood and sat down to write out a paper himself, and I told him Mr. McConnell had the proposition that we signed and we had better let him make the contract according to that. Q. What did he say to that? A. Well, he said all right, he would wait on that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">The court gave binding instructions for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-7\"><em>A.

Whether or not it was the intention of the parties to make the perfection of the agreement depend upon the writing, to be subsequently drawn, and to have no effect until then, can be ascertained only from the proposition, the action and the statements of the parties. The proposition itself and the indorsements give no conclusive answer to this question. The evidence shows that it was in terms agreed not to wait for the formal contract, and that they did not wait.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-3\">Even if the parties had at first intended to make the drawing of the contract a condition precedent to the accepted proposition becoming obligatory, they waived this condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\">Vicinity does not denote so close a connection as neighborhood.

It is equally clear that the parties insisted upon a formal contract relating to the five wells. Undoubtedly there could be no recovery for the drilling of the first well on its completion, without reference to whether the other wells were completed: Brown v. Finney, 53 Pa. 374.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AQ3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>December 30, 1893 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b330-3\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AaQ\">Mr. Justice Thompson,</author>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Appellant\u2019s proposition to appellee was to erect a rig and to drill a well, the rig to be erected for the sum of $450, the well to be drilled down to Berea sand, upon any one of the leases that might be selected, to be for the price of one dollar per foot, to be paid for when completed, and the boiler and engine, except casing, to be furnished by him. It is then proposed by him as follows, viz.: \u201c If you decide to drill any more wells upon said leases or in the vicinity, up to the number of five, I am to have the contract of erecting the rigs and drilling the wells at the prices above named.\u201d At the end of the proposition is written \u201c Accepted, contract to be drawn in accordance with the above proposition or bid,\u201d and the following words are then added: \u201c This is about right and will be satisfactory to the Pittsburgh Company.\u201d Without any contract executed in pursuance of this proposition, appellant sunk the first well upon one of the leases and has been paid for the same. This well proved a dry one, and appellee, which had in its neighborhood leases upon about one thousand acres of land, and for the development of which the well in question was sunk, gave them up and abandoned the enterprise. It however sunk a number of -wells near Ellwood, some two miles distant from the territory thus abandoned. Appellant claims damages for the loss of profits arising from the refusal of appellee to allow him to sink those wells. This claim is therefore based upon an alleged contract and its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The appellant\u2019s contention is that the proposition itself constituted the contract, and the sinking of those wells at Ellwood the breach of it. The language at the end of the proposition, to wit: \u201c contract to be drawn in accordance with the above proposition or bid,\u201d and \u201c this is about right and will be satisfactory to the Pittsburgh Company,\u201d clearly imports that it was not intended to be the actual agreement, but simply the basis of one, to be subsequently perfected by a contract properly prepared. This appears to be apparent from the words used, \u201c if you decide to drill any more wells upon said leases, or in the vicinity. ... I am to have the contract.\u201d The proposition was that, when the decision should be reached to sink the five wells upon the leases or in the vicinitjr, appellee was to make a contract with appellant for their drilling. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>time of such decision was not fixed, as the order of sinking the wells, whether together or successively, was not determined, as the points of locality were not settled, as the times for completion were not designated, and the modes of payment were not specified, it is manifest that this proposition was not intended as a complete contract, but that it was tentative and was only to become a contract binding upon the parties by a written agreement when properly prepared. This is apparent from the proofs adduced by the appellant himself. He testifies that the president of the appellee company took him to his private office and sat down with him to write the intended contract, when he, appellant, told him that McConnell had the proposition and that he had better prepare the contract. Mr. McConnell testified: \u201c That Mr. Tomlinson, the agent of appellee, and Mr. Sparks, the appellant, brought him the proposition after it had been altered, and that Mr. Sparks said he was going up to the leases to be absent a week or ten days, and asked him to have the contract ready by his return, \u2014 that the proposition was left by Sparks for the purpose of preparing a contract;\u201d and Mr. Tomlinson testified that the president of the company told him to give the proposition to Mr. McConnell to have him prepare a contract. It is thus plain that the proposition did not contemplate the preparation and execution of an agreement simply for the purpose of more authentic proof of it, but was only an expression of what was to be the basis of an agreement to be prepared to represent the final meeting of their minds upon the subject. It has not been perfected by any contract which is binding upon the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\">It is contended that the proposition was not severable and that appellant, without such written contract and with the assent of appellee, having sunk the first well and having been paid for it, no written contract was intended to be required for the sinking of the five other wells. The first well was to be sunk at all events, and upon its success depended the operations upon the one thousand acres leased. The appellee was anxious to ascertain whether oil existed beneath that territory, and requested appellant to go on in advance of the execution of the written contract. By such parol arrangement of both parties the work was done. While it was being done, they sat down to draw the agreement contemplated, but at the suggestion of the appellant it was referred to counsel to prepare it, who it seems failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>to do so. The sinking of the first well was to be done promptly and the five others were to be sunk only in case appellee should decide to sink them. The work of sinking that well was distinct from that connected with the other five wells which, as it had not decided to sink them, were not then to be sunk. The fact that the first well was sunk and paid for under such circumstances cannot operate to turn the proposition to sink the others into a contract, when a future agreement for the sinking of them was clearly contemplated to be prepared. As to the first well, the work was done with the assent of both parties, without the preparation of the written contract intended, and was paid for. 'As to the five other wells, the negotiations have not been completed by the preparation and execution of the contract contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Assuming, however, that the proposition be treated as an actual agreement and not as tentative, there is no fact showing any breach of it. The proposition was in reference to sinking wells on the leases or in the vicinity. The leases referred to were those on the land situate some two miles north of Ellwood, and the vicinity intended was in their immediate neighborhood. The proposition is to be construed with regard to the subject-matter. The parties were contracting for a well to be sunk presumably to be followed by others upon this new and undeveloped territory, and necessarily \u201cvicinity\u201d must be construed with regard to it. It is ingeniously argued that \u201cvicinity\u201d is a relative term used differently as to subjects, as when applied to planets with reference to each other involving vast distances, as when applied to cities in regard to each other covering man}*miles, and that, as it was thus an indefinite term when used, its limits in the present case should have been determined by the jury. The argument may be plausible but it is not substantial. The use of a word in a written instrument which may liave in some uses different effects cannot operate to change the duty of the court in the interpretation of it, and transfer that duty to the jury. The construction of the instrument is for the former and not for the latter. The sinking of the wells by appellee upon lands owned by it near Ellwood, two miles distant from the leased territory covered by the proposition, was not in its \u201c vicinity \u201d and was not therefore a breach of the proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
