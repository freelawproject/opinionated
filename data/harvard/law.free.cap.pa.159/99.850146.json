P. Auld, a witness for plaintiff, testified that he had lived within a mile of plaintiff\u2019s land almost all his life. \u201c Q. Do you know of sales, Mr. Auld, in that neighborhood ? A. Yes, I have understood there was quite a number of sales. Q. You have some idea of what the property sold for? A. I have understood what the prices were. Q. I wish you would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>state from your knowledge of sales in that neighborhood, what this property is worth an acre, as near as you can. By Mr. Carpenter: Q. That is for farming purposes or suburban residences ? By the Court: Q. A year ago what would it have sold for in the market? A. Well, I presume it would have brought four hundred dollars an acre, this part of the farm. By Mr. Haymaker: Q. What damage, in your opinion, Mr. Auld, has Mr. Michael sustained by reason of the location of that line over his property ? Objected to unless the witness has actual knowledge of the loss; counsel for defence object to any speculative theory. By the Court: We think the witness ought to show a little more knowledge. Without any facts, we do not think his guess ought to be considered by the jury. You must get some facts to show that the witness has a knowledge of what he is talking about. Q. I wish you would state to the jury how this line affects the value of that property, and why it does it? A. Well, it affects it just in this way, I think there is a large portion of the farm that could not be sold at all in five or ten acre lots at this time with that pipe line where it is.\u201d The witness stated, under objection and exception, that the total damage would be about three thousand dollars. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-4\">[John Aldebrand, a witness for plaintiff, having testified that he resided within one half mile of plaintiff\u2019s land, that he knew something of the value of property in the neighborhood, knew of sales of land in the neighborhood, knew the location of the pipe line and the character of the land, was interrogated and made answer as follows : \u201c Q. I wish you would state, Mr. Aldebrand, in what way that pipe line affects Mr. Michael\u2019s farm ? A. Well, it\u2019s just as I say, it will affect the sale of this here* piece of ground. If a man wants to buy he would want may be eight or ten acres and would pay a big price for that knob, because it\u2019s a beautiful knob, it would hurt the sale of that piece of ground. Q. Would it affect the sale of all the property lying south of the pike ? A. Well, I don\u2019t know as it would very much, only this ground that this oil line runs through. Q. In speaking of the sales made out there, what size tracts have they been generally selling it? A. From three up to sixty acres. Q. That is the character of the sales during the last year? A. Yes, sir. Q. I wish you would state, Mr. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>debrand, what damage, in your opinion, Mr. Michael has sustained by reason of the location of that line ? \u201d The witness, under objection and exception, answered two thousand dollars.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-3\">Alexander Foster, a witness for plaintiff, testified that he lived at McKeesport and knew plaintiff\u2019s farm. \u201c Q.

Do you know what the prices were for the various pieces of property ? A. Well, by hearsay, I do, I believe. Q. What sized tracts were these various pieces you speak of ? A.

Mr. McClure, you know the effect that a pipe line through a farm has upon the market value of it \u2014 whether it affects it or not? By Mr. Carpenter: Q. From actual knowledge, now, not from theory? A. Yes, sir. By Mr. Haymaker: Q. I wish you would look at the plan, and state if you know, about where the line passes through Mr. Michael\u2019s property. This is the pike here, Mr. McClure? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now, from your knowledge of the value of the property in that vicinity, from actual sales that you know of, what, in your judgment, is this property worth an acre, in that field, \u201c A,\u201d or this property over which this line passes?

L. 61, which finally resulted in a trial by jury. This was not a suit on the bond given by the company, but an independent proceeding against the company alone. The same proceeding could have been carried on by plaintiff below in the absence of a bond; and it would have been held to have been a waiver of his right to an action of trespass or ejectment. If the \u201c just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed,\u201d provided by the constitution shall be limited to the amount of the bond, the court, in fixing the amount of the bond, and not the jury, will practically decide the amount of that compensation.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Apy\">Dec. 30, 1893 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AB6\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">An essential test of the competency of witnesses, called to give an opinion in respect of the market value of land, is that they should affirmatively appear to- have actual personal knowledge of the facts affecting the subject-matter of the inquiry : Railway Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 325. They cannot intelligently testify without such knowledge; its possession is a necessary element in the value of such testimony, but cannot be assumed; the court cannot pass on the question of competency until it be made to appear. Hence the possession and sufficiency of such knowledge should be made to appear and be passed upon by the court before the witness should be permitted to express any opinion. What constitutes sufficient knowledge was thus stated by Mr. Justice Clark, in Railway Co. v. Vance, supra: \u201c The market value .... is estimated upon a fair consideration of the land, the extent and condition of its improvements, its quantity and productive qualities, and the uses to which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>may reasonably be applied, taken with the general selling price of lands in the neighborhood at the time. The price which, upon full consideration of the matters stated, the judgment of well informed and reasonable men will approve, may be regarded as the market value: Railroad Co. v. Patterson, 107 Pa. 464. The general selling price of lands in the neighborhood cannot be shown by evidence of particular sales of alleged similar properties ; it is a price fixed in the mind of the witness from a knowledge of what lands are generally held at for sale, and at which they are sometimes sold, bona fide, in the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">The competency of the witnesses who were allowed to give their opinions in this case was not tested in the manner here indicated. What was the source, extent and character of their knowledge does not satisfactorily appear. They had \u201c heard \u201d of sales in the neighborhood, but how, where or from whom, was not stated. They do not profess to have had \u201c a knowledge of what lands'were generally held at for sale\u201d in the neighborhood. With one exception they do not appear to have had any knowledge from either observation or personal experience of the effect of the pipe line upon farming lands. The value of opinions, given under such circumstances, is seldom, if ever, appreciable. The witnesses may have had the requisite knowledge, but it certainly was not made to appear; and for this reason the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The tenth specification of error, claiming that the amount of damages, if any, to which plaintiff was entitled, was limited by the bond given by defendant, has no merit. The constitution expressly provides that \u201c the amount of such damages in all cases of appeal shall, on the demand of either party, be determined by a jury, according to the course of the common law\u201d: Art. xvi, sec. 8. If the \u201camount\u201d of the damages shall be determined \u201c by a jury,\u201d the necessary inference is that the power of the jury in that respect cannot be limited by the act of the court in approving the bond tendered by defendant. The bond is not intended as a measure of damages, but merely as security. There is no provision for appeal from the order of court approving the bond; but, in recognition of the constitutional right of trial by jur}1', for the purpose of determining the amount of damages, express provision is made for appeal from any preliminary assessment of damages \u201c by viewers or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>wise.\u201d In practice, tbe court is generally careful to require a bond sufficient^ large in amount to cover all damages to which the landowner may be entitled; but, whether that be done or not, the power of the jury, in the premises, is wholly unaffected by the amount that may be named in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
