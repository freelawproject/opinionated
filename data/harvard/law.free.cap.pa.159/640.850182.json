The company\u2019s agent explained these erasures as follows: \u201c A. It was the understanding that it would release the express company as well as the railroad company from all liabilities. I showed him this paper \u2014 it was laid right before him when he signed it. I didn\u2019t say anything to him. I told him this was the release to be signed. He signed it. I told him then that I was busy, and he was in a hurry to get out. He then even gave me his check, and said: \u2018Fill this out afterwards.\u2019 He signed it, and said: \u2018 Fill this out afterwards, I am in a hurry to get out.\u2019 And the same way with the release. He said: \u2018 I will sign it, and you can \u00f1x it up afterwards.\u2019 And that is how the erasures came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>about. If Mr. Armstrong had remained there at the time long enough for me to fix up that release, the erasures would have been made right there in his presence, but inasmuch as he was in a hurry to get out, he simply signed the release and did not even give me a chance to fill anything in, much less make any erasures, saying I should fix up the release afterwards; that all that was required of him was his signature, and I should fix up the release afterwards, which I did.\u201d Offer overruled and bill sealed. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-3\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-4\">\u201c [It is claimed by the plaintiffs that the horse for some reason or other pressed against the side of the partition, which partition gave way because of the insecure manner in which it was arranged. It is claimed that the side of the partition being too small to fit in, a piece had been nailed against its end which fitted in the groove so as to conceal it from casual observation, and that when the horse pressed against the side of the stall this piece gave way, causing the horse to fall on the lower piece and by his weight breaking his legs.] [7] This is denied by the defendant, which contends that this car was not so constructed, or that, in other words, the side of the stall was not pieced out, and that will be the first question for you to decide. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\">\u201c [This board fitted into the groove. How could that board have been forced out without breaking down the post if the board was intact and not spliced? Is there any evidence before you to show that the post was broken at all? For if the post was not broken the question arises, how co.uld this board get out of its place?] [8] If, therefore, you find that this car was arranged in the manner testified to by plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, then your next question is, was that proper under the circumstances, keeping in view the purpose for which this car was intended ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-6\">\u201c It is claimed by the plaintiffs that the defendant company knew the character of the stock to be transported, that it was blooded stock used for racing purposes, and from the very character of the animals greater care should have been taken than if they had been ordinary work horses. If that is a fact then what should the defendant have done ? The law, as I have read it to you, required the defendant to provide against every ordinary case of this kind; it was bound to take into consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ation the fact that horses will be restless on the ears, that passing trains will frighten them and that they will move from side to side; and, therefore, knowing that as it was their duty to know it, it was their duty to provide a car which would ordinarily protect horses under those circumstances. Did they do it ? If they did not then the law would hold them liable for any negligence resulting therefrom. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-4\">\u201c It is claimed by the defendant in this case that this accident was caused by the rearing and plunging of the animals. Now this company would not be liable for any damage resulting from any unusual conduct on the part of this horse which could not have been foreseen by them, and, therefore if the accident was caused because the horse plunged and reared in an unusual manner, in a manner that the express company had no reason to expect by ordinary foresight and prudence, then they would not be responsible, because they were only required to use ordinary diligence and prudence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">\u201c [What is the testimony in this respect? You have the testimony of Schlimme and of Service, the two gentlemen who were in the car and who actually saw the accident happen. Schlimme testifies to you that a passing train caused this horse to swing to one side, and from part of his testimony.you might infer that the horse plunged and reared.] [6] But was it in an unusual manner? Was it in any but the ordinary manner in which horses do move back when they hear an approaching train ? If it was, then the express company were bound to provide against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\">\u201c You have also heard the testimony of Service, who stood right at the rear of the horse, who says there was no rearing or plunging, but that there was a mere shoving on one side by the horse. If you believe his testimony then you will inquire whether the action of the horse was not simply of that character which is usual with horses of that kind, and which the express company was bound to provide against.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, among others, (1) rulings; (6-8) in structions, quoting instructions and bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b672-9\"><em>J.

The horse was injured, and had to be killed in consequence of alleged negligence on the part of the defendant in the construction of the stalls in the car upon which the horse was to be carried. The learned court below correctly and fairly instructed the jury as to the conditions upon which the liability of the defendant would depend, and left to them the question whether the stall in which the horse was placed was negligently or carefully built with reference to the due care of the horse. As there was considerable testimony on this subject, it was not possible to take the question of negligence away from the jury. They have found by their verdict that the stall was negligently constructed and that the injury happened in consequence thereof, and that finding disposes of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The release was properly excluded. The erasures were not made when the plaintiff signed it. They were made afterwards by the defendant\u2019s agent and there is no evidence that the paper was shown or read to the plaintiff after the erasures were made. But even if the release was free from objection in this respect it could not accomplish the purpose for which it was offered. It could not release the defendant from liability for negligence, as we have frequently decided. For any other purpose it was immaterial. We think the case was properly tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
