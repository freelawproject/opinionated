Plaintiff wrote defendant that Mrs. Scanlan had ordered him to place the tombstone, \u201c saying you (defendant) still had charge of the money subscribed for the purpose and to send for it whenever I wanted it.\u201d Defendant admitted that he had some of Mrs. Scanlan\u2019s money in his hands when he received plaintiff\u2019s letter, but denied that any of the money had been appropriated to any specific debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-4\">The court charged as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">\u201c [The mere fact that Mr. Weeks had some money belonging to this woman, Scanlan, would not of itself make him liable to this plaintiff, or would not entitle the plaintiff to a verdict. Under the circumstances of this case [if you find from the evidence that Mr. Weeks had $88.00 in his hands which this woman had put there, and had been set aside by her for the payment of this tombstone, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff for that amount.] [1] But if he had money of hers which was not set aside for that purpose, but was simply holding money of hers generally, then the defendant was entitled to a verdict, because in that case the plaintiff would have to get a verdict against this woman and attach whatever moneys were in his hands.] \u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $49.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1, 2) instructions, quoting them; (3, 4) in not directing verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-8\"><em>Horace </em>Haverstick, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYW1\">cited: Shoemaker v.

The testimony was quite sufficient to warrant the submission ; and the only inference that can be drawn from the verdict is that all the material facts were found in favor of the plaintiff. The main question was whether Mrs. Scanlan placed in defendant\u2019s hands thirty-eight dollars to pay for furnishing and setting up the tombstone which at her request was procured by the plaintiff. The jury must have found that she did. There was no error in charging as complained of in the first and second specifications. It would have been error to have withdrawn the case from the jury by directing them to find for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
