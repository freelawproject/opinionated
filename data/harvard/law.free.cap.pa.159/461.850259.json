The son of defendant\u2019s testator, an employee of the firm, became a defaulter, and the firm obtained a judgment against him for the sum which he had appropriated. Prior to the defalcation, and at a time when the son was solvent, he conveyed certain real estate which he owned to his wife, subject to a building association mortgage. After the defalcation, but before judgment was obtained by the firm, the son and his wife executed a mortgage to defendant\u2019s testator on the same property. Subsequently, and after the judgment was entered against the son, the building association proceeded on its mortgage and the real estate covered by it was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and bought in by defendant\u2019s testator to protect his mortgage. The sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>discharged the lien of the firm\u2019s judgment. <em>Held, </em>that defendant\u2019s testator had the right to purchase the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and take title thereto clear of any trust in favor of the firm.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b492-5\">Argued Jan. 3, 1894.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4J\">Appeal, No. 369, Jan.

As bona fide holder of the security, he had an undoubted right to purchase the property in question at the sheriff\u2019s sale and take title thereto in fee clear of any trust. There is nothing in the entire transaction to indicate anything like bad faith towards the plaintiff or the firm of which he is surviving partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">The learned master\u2019s findings of fact are clearly correct, and fully warrant his general conclusion \u201c that the bill is without equity \u201d and should be dismissed. An examination of the record has satisfied us that there was no error in dismissing the exceptions and confirming his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
