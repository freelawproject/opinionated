Mdcfarlane, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARo\">The contract in this case is not within the sphere of the powers and liabilities of a married woman, created by the married persons\u2019 property act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332. The purposes for which she may acquire property of any kind are limited, and the only possible binding one here is the use, enjoyment and improvement of her separate estate. To buy a house and lot, even for a home, is not a use, enjoyment and improvement of her separate estate : Latrobe Association v. Fritz, 152 Pa. 224; Real Estate Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496 ; Koechling v. Henkel, 144 Pa. 215 ; Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258; Abell v. Chaffee, 154 Pa. 254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\">While the act does \u201c greatly enlarge her powers,\u201d the cases decided by this court in every instance follow the principles laid down in the two leading cases of Real Estate v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496, and Koechling v. Henkel, 144 Pa. 215, limiting her powers and liability to (\u00ab) necessaries, (5) separate business and ('c) management of her separate estate. Whether expressly conferred or an incident to her rights, the contract power relates to these three heads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-9\">Brooks v. Bank, 125 Pa. 394, was the note of a business firm in which a married woman was a partner. Real Estate Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496, was a note given by a married woman as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>surety for her husband, or to aid him in carrying on his business, and she was not liable. Koechling v. Henkel, 144 Pa. 215, was a judgment against a married woman, regular on its face, without facts shown on its face to bring it within the act, and it was held good on the ground that she must show that it was not authorized. Bauck v. Swan, 146 Pa. 444, held that the power to sell under the word \u201c dispose \u201d carried with it the power to employ an agent to sell. Milligan v. Phipps, 153 Pa. 208, was a mechanic\u2019s lien for an improvement on a married woman\u2019s land. Evans v. Evans, 155 Pa. 572, decides only that personal property was a wife\u2019s and did not belong to her husband\u2019s creditors, even though she had bought it with borrowed money. Whether the loan was within her sphere of contracting power was not in the case, and, it not being shown to the contrary, it is presumed that it was. A horse, buggy and harness are doubtless necessaries on a farm. Packer v. Taylor, 2 Dist. R. 443, is an erroneous decision.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-5\"><em>John M. Groehring </em>and <em>S. Harvey </em>Thompson, for appellee, not heal\u2019d. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av2\">The act of 1887 was clearly intended to bestow upon a married woman the power to acquire an estate: Real Est. Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496 ; Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258 ; Abell v. Chaffee, 154 Pa. 254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">Under the act of 1887, appellant had the power to purchase a residence property for'herself and family upon credit and to borrow money to pay for it, and having done so is liable.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHY\">Dec. 30, 1893 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A-x\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The contract in this case comes clearly within both the letter and spirit of the act of 1887. That act gave married women unrestricted power to acquire real estate and to incur corresponding liabilities. It declares: \u201c That hereafter marriage shall not be held to impose any disability on or incapacity in a married woman as to the acquisition .... of property of any kind in (1) any trade or business in which she may engage, or (2) for necessaries, or (3) for the use, enjoyment and improvement of her separate estate, .... or (4) her right and power to make contracts of any kind, and to give obligations binding herself therefor; but every married woman shall have the same right to acquire .... property, real and personal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>.... in the same manner as if she were a femme sole.\u201d . . . This plainly emancipated her from common law disabilities, and authorized her to contract as a femme sole: Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The unrestricted power of acquisition in trade or for necessaries is conceded; but it is insisted that defendant\u2019s acquisition being within neither of these clauses, her power, and consequently her liability, were limited to that which was necessary to the \u201c use, enjoyment and improvement \u201d of real estate which she already owned. This is but a narrow construction of a single clause of the act. The word \u201c improvement \u201d it is true implies an existing subject.; but does not control, nor even color, the meaning of the words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cenjoyment \u201d with which it is coupled. They were coupled for the sake of convenience; but were employed to express distinct and independent purposes in reference to the separate estate. The \u201cacquisition\u201d of lands would often be advantageous to the \u201cuse \u201d and \u201cenjoyment\u201d of her separate estate when not required for its \u201c improvement.\u201d If the separate estate should consist entirely of personalty, circumstances might arise in which the acquisition of land would be the only available \u201c use \u201d and \u201c enjoyment.\u201d It would be strange, indeed, if, when a married woman has been expressly given unlimited power to acquire real estate \u201cin any trade or business,\u201d or for \u201cnecessaries,\u201d or \u201c to make contracts of any kind and to give obligations binding herself therefor,\u201d and \u201cto acquire .... property .... in the same manner as if she were a femme sole,\u201d she should be unable to acquire a home for her \u201c use \u201d and \u201c enjoyment.\u201d The purpose of the legislature was broad and liberal and must be interpreted in a like spirit. With the exception of such disabilities as are particularly specified in or contemplated by the provisions of the act, married women were emancipated from their common law disabilities, and authorized to incur contract liabilities as if they were femme sole; and such has been the trend of our decisions whenever questions have arisen since the passage of the act: Adams v. Grey, supra. As defendant is not within any of the exceptions, her liability necessarily follows, and the judgment entered on the special verdict must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
