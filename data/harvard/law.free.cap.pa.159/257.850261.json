Without undertaking to summarize the testimoriy, showing the dangerous condition of said sidewalk, particularly in the night time, the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s injury, etc., it was clearly sufficient to carry the case to the jury on the main questions of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and plaintiff\u2019s resultant damages. Upon all the testimony, and with full and adequate instructions as to the duty of the defendant as well as the plaintiff himself, the case was fairly submitted to the jury; and, in the absence of any apparent error, to the prejudice of the defendant, the judgment entered on the verdict should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
