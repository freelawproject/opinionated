Phillips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>and R. A. Phillips executed an oil lease to Ira De Witt. The lease contained the following clause: \u201c The party of the second part further covenants and agrees to commence operations on the aforementioned premises' or forfeit this lease within sixty days, and to complete a well on this lease in five months.\u201d There was evidence that, in November, 1886, De Witt hauled lumber on the leased premises, but apparently there was no actual beginning of operations on the well during the months of November and December, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">In January, 1887, De Witt agreed to assign the lease to plaintiffs. De Witt called upon the Phillipses in inference to this assignment. He testified to the conversation which occurred as follows : \u201cA. We had a general conversation in regard to delays, talked about the bad roads, difficulty of getting around and hauling machinery, tools, lumber and so on. By Mr. McKee : Q. What was the conclusion of this conversation, what was said and done ? A. The conclusion was that Mr. Phillips acquiesced in the delay and acknowledged the lease on the assurance that there would be a well put down, would be developed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">De Witt further testified as follows : \u201c Q. I call your attention to exhibit A, to this part of it: \u2018 party of the second part further covenants and agrees to commence operations on the aforesaid mentioned premises or forfeit this lease within sixty days, and complete a well on this lease in five months.\u2019 Was that portion printed in the lease ? A. No, that was written in. Q. Was it written in at that time ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Before it was signed? A. Yes, sir. Q.-You people had been discussing that question ? A. Yes, sir; we had. Q. And it was agreed you had to commence operations within sixty days and complete a well within five months or the lease was forfeited? A. That was the terms of the lease ; the forfeiture of the lease depended upon the completion of the wells, as we understood it. Q. Depended upon that? A. Yes, sir, the five months. Q. Didn\u2019t depend also upon the commencement within the sixty days ? A. No, sir; I didn\u2019t so consider it. Q. Did you complete a well there in the five months ? A. What was done after I left there I am unable to say. I simply went on there in pursuance of Mr. Hunter\u2019s directions and delivered some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>lumber on the ground, and I don\u2019t think I was ever back there since.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The well was not completed within five months from the date of the lease. The Phillipses thereupon notified plaintiffs that the lease was forfeited, and on April 13, 1887, leased the same land to the Baden Gas Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">\u201c There is no dispute about the fact that the well was not completed within five months, and, under this agreement, I say to you, as a matter of law, that the defendants had a right to forfeit the lease after the expiration of the five months, and they did so. Therefore, under all the evidence, your verdict should be for the defendants, and you will find accordingly.\u201d Verdict and judgment for defendants.

But this rule does not prevent the operation of the guiding principle in regard to all contracts, that the intention of the parties when ascertained must prevail. Rules of construction are aids in arriving at the intention, and when that is clear, either with or without resort to them, the court has nothing to do but to carry it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The general intent of the covenant in the present case, notwithstanding some little awkwardness in the arrangement of the language, is clearly enough to secure the immediate development of the land. It is in substance a single covenant for a well, to be commenced within sixty days and completed in five months. The parties certainly did not mean that a well should be begun within sixty days, and then indefinitely stopped, with no remedy to the lessor but an action on the covenant. Such a construction would destroy the main object of the clause, the prompt test of the land for oil purposes, and its diligent development. The gist of the covenant was to have a well finished in five months. The beginning in sixty days was only material as a step towards that end, and the stipulation for a forfeiture applies equally to both branches of the covenant. Any other construction would destroy its efficiency for the very purpose of its making.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">There was no evidence to connect the possible waiver as to the sixty days with the other part of the covenant. Even as to the sixty days the evidence of waiver is little more than a scintilla, and as to the other, De Witt, the original lessee says, \u201c the forfeiture of the lease depended upon the completion of the wells, as we understood it ... . upon the five months,\u201d and again, \u201c the conclusion was that Mr. Phillips acquiesced in the delay and acknowledged the lease, on the assurance that there would be a well put down, would be developed.\u201d There was therefore no question for the jury, and the learned judge was right in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
